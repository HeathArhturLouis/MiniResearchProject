 The first two recipes I've wanted to try have had errors. One didn't call for milk in the ingredients, but did in the instructions. The instructions for a sesame twist bread made with semolina don't really explain how to twist it. This is one that really could have profited from some kind of illustration. Another irritation is that neither the table of contents nor the index have the page numbers of the recipes--only the page numbers of the sections. Finally, a bread "bible" should really have a better recipe for French bread, made with a fermented starter 
 Taut with international intrigue and frenetic action, Robert Ludlum's novels are generally highly entertaining and rich with suspense. The standard of The Cry of the Halidon, however, is well below his usual.   Unlike most of his other books, The Cry of the Halidon is rarely suspenseful and does not build to a recognizable climax. The plot is typical Ludlum fare, with Alexander Tarquin Mcauliff selected by a company, -Dunstone Limited- to head a survey team deep into the Jamaican forests. Minutes after successfully attaining the survey assignment, he is approached by British Intelligence and informed that the motives of Dunstone are far from honest.  Naturally, he finds himself involved not only with British Intelligence, Dunstone and the rebel factions of Jamaica but also with a third faction, an organization known only as the "Halidon." While initially this may seem gripping and interesting, the text quickly becomes confused and rambling. With so many hostile organizations and no primary antagonist, it is frequently difficult to comprehend the plot, let alone the actions of the main character.  Although the novel does become more interesting at its conclusion, I found The Cry of the Halidon to be ultimately unsatisfying, with its more suspenseful elements overwhelmed by a confusing plot, a sprawling diction and a lackluster climax. 
 This book is a real dissapointment.  If you love bland food and only moderately interesting taste this books for you.  I have been cooking for 35 years 
 Carter's attempt to trace the disingenuous way in which many Americans have forsaken their moral compass in favor of political labels and bumper-sticker-grade philosophy is just about on target.  His prescribed fixes, however, are little more than just the sort of swell-sounding but essentially empty rhetoric which he is skewering. While Carter promises a new approach to integrity in American life, all he seems to have on tap is a lot of quotations and circular logic.  "We can learn to do right by doing the right thing, or listening to the right people," he seems to say, without ever providing a really supportable definition of those terms.  Instead, he depends on his own, completely subjective, ideas of right and wrong, which don't convince.  His appeals to group ethics are slightly more useful, but fall prey to the same critiques he is leveling at what he calls "media culture" and other left-wing "evils." Political hackwork.  
 Peter Robinson is one of my favorite mystery writers.  I am now trying to get through the audio cd version of Playing with Fire.  The narrator, as I can picture him, is speaking with the spittle collecting and the corners of his mouth.  His attempt at portraying the characters' voices is pathetic.  He should just read it straight out as his "normal" voice is not bad at all.  The story will be good, I know, but have to suffer through this reading may not be worth it 
 My friend told me this book is incredible but I found it a little far fetched personally.  Why doesnt the guy just catch two fish which are each half as big and then he can be eating fish sticks for dinner instead of a big plate of nothing which is where he ends up (WARNING: spoiler alert) in the end of the book. It would be a lot easier and it makes exactly as good a story or even better because it is extra fish caracters.  Me I think writers should stick with writing about stuff that is on dry land given the track record so far.  TWO STARS for your book Ernest!  One star for each caracter you put in the story (even including fish)!  Youre rating is as good as Melvile got for his fish book so chin up 
 In a course, this book was used as teaching material in a class for computer security.  The read, reminded me of speaking software to a hardware engineer.  Since the hardware engineer is coming from another level, the experience was like talking DOWN to the reader.  The author seemed to want to "impress" us with his "knowledge".  Luckily, we were fortunate to have an instructor that could translate for the class.  Had to use other manuals to replace what the author, may have tried to relay 
 The story is set up very well but goes nowhere. The world(present day England)from inside the mind of 15/y.o. autistic(or some similar syndrome)boy. Loaded with lots of gimmicks to fill up pages and make it look like a real book--lists, footnotes, sketches, diagrams, puzzles, maps, doodles, graphs and even an appendix. After 15 pages inside Christopher's mind one gets the basic feeling of how he sees the world and reacts to it. I personally don't think one needs 226 pages to get this across. After the first one third of the book the story became repetitive, tedious and boring 
 If you want a good Hank 3 album, go with Lovesick Broke & Driftin'. It's a more impressive and mature work than this one, which seems slapped together and unoriginal.   The best songs on Risin' Outlaw are the three written by Wayne Hancock, who himself has a delivery and style eerily similar to Hank Sr. So what you end up with on this disc is Hank 3 imitating Wayne Hancock imitating Hank Williams, Sr. And since Wayne Hancock is a better singer and songwriter to begin with, and his performances of his own songs are better than Hank 3's, why not just get the original Hancock CDs? The cover of "Thunderstorms and Neon Signs" on Risin' Outlaw seems particularly pointless, as Hank 3 uses an identical delivery, launching into falsettos at the same time, holding certain notes the same way, etc. I can understand why someone would want to cover it--it's a beautiful song--but at least add *something* of your own to it. To use an art analogy, it's like Hank 3 is tracing over a drawing that Wayne Hancock made, but it is apparent that Hank 3 isn't as good of an artist.   Having said this, Risin' Outlaw is still better than 99% of the trash played on country radio. But I think that speaks more to the horrible quality of contemporary country music than it does to the quality of this particular album. Still, if you get the chance to see Hank 3 play live, don't miss it 
     The Civil War ends and Frank and Jesse James have long since mustered out of Quantrill's band of Yankee-hating raiders.  The brothers try to return to the ranch but are forced by circumstances - circumstances in large part created by carpetbagging politicians, greedy railroad men, and eastern bankers - to return to a life of crime.  One particularly ghoulish looking railroad land buyer is rebuffed - Get off'n my land - only to come back a-gunnin' and a-bombin'.  A James or two is killed and the brothers find themselves yet again in the position of guerilla warriors against the United States government.  Or, to put it less sympathetically than 1994's FRANK AND JESSE does, robbing banks and trains is a whole lot easier, and more fun, way to make a living than busting sod.    FRANK AND JESSE isn't any more concerned with historical accuracy than most movies. It casts a sympathetic eye at its title characters, treating them as modern day Robin Hoods, ennobling their post-Civil War careers.   I have fewer problems with distorted history than with bad scripts and weak stories.  The boys are ennobled to the same degree the bad guys are debased and whoever was responsible for this script laid `bad' on with a thick trowel.  Bankers are venal and corrupt.  Railroad men are rapacious and corrupt.  The US Army is the corrupt lackey arm of the carpetbaggers.  Even William Atherton, who plays detective and arch-James' nemesis Allan Pinkerton, emerges as a character a shade or so shy of two dimensions.     Anyway, the bad guys can't shoot straight (it really does take ten Yankees to kill a Reb!), they'll kick a poor widder women off'n her land less'n she pays an exorbitant mortgage demanded by the Eastern Banker, and The People hate them.  In one of many awkward scenes, the James and the Younger boys discuss reuniting the Gang.  Someone reminds the group "we've got to keep the heart of the people."  It sounded forced and phony - a line more appropriate to a bad ad campaign or a bad movie about a bad war than a bad western.  Detective Pinkerton will be surrounded by the James' Gang on more than one occasion, with Yank troopers falling like ten-pins to the right and to the left of him, and escapes without a scratch!  FRANK AND JESSE wore me down long before they arrived at Northfield and committed the famous bank robbery.  I wasn't ready for the ludicrous ending.  If you're familiar with Jesse James' life story I'll give you a couple of hints.  Jesse knows the Ford brothers' visit is more than a social call.  Before Jesse adjusts the crooked picture he looks in on his son, who is in bed asking his mother "We don't have to move again, do we, Mommy?"  Jesse's (Rob Lowe) reaction shot is in soft focus.  If anything, FRANK AND JESSE will demonstrate the lengths some responsible parents used to go to to keep Junior in the same school.   There were some bright points.  As usual, Bill Paxton as Frank James gives a subtle and nuanced performance.  Randy Travis (Cole Younger) warbles a pleasant Auld Lang Syne around a campfire.   My favorite scene will probably pass by anyone who hasn't seen Walter Hill's THE LONG RIDERS, another story about the Jamess and the Youngers and another that devotes a fair amount of time to the Northfield bank robbery.     THE LONG RIDERS combines slow-motion photography, daring stunts and skillful editing to make of the robbery a memorably exciting scene. For instance, a galloping horse is shown exploding through a plate glass window.  Okay - real glass from a real plate glass window would have cut the horse to ribbons, and the movie horse galloped off into the Minnesota wilderness unnicked, but it was visually exciting.  Almost exactly the same situation develops in FRANK AND JESSE.  In Northfield a thundering horse gallops through an empty building.  Floorboards clatter, the rampaging steed leaps and - doink.  The resistable horse is thrown back by the immovable object - aka the malfunctioning prop.  The heavy window, attached by a top hinge, yawns out about four inches.  The stunned beast repurchases his traction, carefully noses the window and sort of squeezes out over the sill.      FRANK AND JESSE squeezes out over the screen and clocks in at a bit over an hour and a half.  If you absolutely have to see every movie dealing with the James' Gang get it.      
 I thoroughly enjoyed "The Elegant Gathering of White Snows" by Kris Radish and was looking forward to another great read with this book. I have seldom been so disappointed in a story.  I loved the beginning of "Dancing Naked at the Edge of Dawn"...but after the first chapter, the book just fizzles out. The writing is overly flowery and the conversations between the characters are unrealistic.   I'm a believer in many things new age, karma, positive thinking, etc. but the overblown prose in this story and simplistic resolutions to each and every problem facing our heroine, Meg, were enough to make me throw up my hands several times in frustration.  Meg serves her husband with divorce papers and they end up having a fabulous dinner together reliving the positive aspects of their failed relationship...and one-upping eachother with praise for the other.....uh huh. Her Mom has to have a lump checked out...but her yoga and positive thinking help to make it non-cancerous. Meg goes to Mexico as her Aunt had wished and finds the love of her life, a perfect seaside cottage that she now owns and peace. The list of unrealistic outcomes is endless.  I did keep plugging along trying to enjoy the story...but the writing kept getting in my way of the plot and the simplistic resolutions just became too much to bear.  Try "The Elegant Gathering of White Snows" instead. 
 If you are a Christian, this book isn't for you. It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must "... forgive God" and that we must love God "... even if He isnt perfect". Kusher even has the will to say that "...God would not be God..." without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said "...let US make man in OUR image" he was speking to animals and creation. Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution.    Since when was God in need of forgiveness? Isnt it that "... God so loved the world" and it wasnt us that loved God? I have no words in describing this book. It is full of error, because it does not base it self on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. All this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your fault, and that actully you are a good person. Why do bad things happen to good people? Wrong question. There are no good people in the world in the first place. " for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God..." The world is in sin. The world DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!! Only by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ you are made righteous. I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ to stay away from this book. It hasnt helped 4 million people, but it lied to them. Kusher, please turn from your ways and come to Jesus, then will you understand the life question "WHY" 
 The problem that I have with this book is that often the words that it defines tells me to go look up another fine.  That would be fine, except that I go to the word it said to look up and discover that I either have to look up another word.  This book is not helpful in that respect, and given that a lot of PCs run Windows, it doesn't really make sense to release a hypertext version for the Mac but not one for Windows.  So the Windows users are stuck with a book that really isn't that good 
  I enjoyed this movie. I orginially saw this move 30 years ago and it brought back some good memories from the seventies. I wouldn't really call it a porn movie. It's more of a movie with adult humor. I'd give it an "R" rating compared to some of the stuff that is available today 
 Gravity was tolerable ( I suppose) but this is it, Our Lady Peace is finished. This album is terrible, and very boring, its ovious Mike Turner (previous guitarist)was what made this band and gave them their sound.  Such a shame. If you like "POP" music, you'll like this 
 I was very disappointed with this book. The main problem is the Devanagari script is so small that it is barely legible, especially for a beginner. Strangely, the current edition has hand-written corrections in the margins!  This book must have been quite an improvement on Lanman and Whitney when it  was first published in the 1940s (?), but there are many better Sanskrit  introductions available now, for example Egenes. This book is of no use to  me. I have put it away on a very high shelf 
 I have listened to (and enjoyed) many books on CD in the past few years.  This reader is among the worst that I've had the displeasure of hearing.  The content of this book is great, so don't get me wrong.  However, the reader makes it impossible to experience the book the way it was intended.  He pronounces many character names incorrectly, including Carpathia and Adbullah.  His character voices range from unconvincing to downright abrasive and/or annoying (especially Carpathia's).  His voice inflection is often very wrong when reading dialogue.  He also adds pauses in the middle of sentences without any obvious reason.  These are just the most obvious and annoying problems.  There are too many to list completely here, so please trust me and avoid listening to this book 
 Any positive review of  this book is probably by someone trying to sell it to you. 
 This is one of three Iris Murdoch books I have read, as a good friend of mine is a big fan. I have yet to see why. I found Nuns and Soldiers silly and overwrought, an extended but inexplicable love story filled with  improbable and self conscious conversations. Do people experiencing a coup  de foudre really sit around and dissect their feelings? I don't find the  philosophical or moral underpinnings of the story to be compelling, either.  Social requirements versus individual desire, I guess 
 I think they should substitute "Small" for "Midsize" in the description of this item.  I just returned it because it was too small.  Entire states are on one letter-size page and only major roads are shown.  I bought it because the Large Scale Atlas is not available in spiral bound except for the one with the Travel Guide which makes it too big and heavy.  I have now ordered the Travel Guide version and intend to tear out the Travel Guide section 
 This is one of the most offensive and anti-gay movies I have ever seen.  Don't let the title or the box fool you.  Every character in this movie is oozing with homophobic sentiment.  I was shocked that such a film could come out of France.  If you're a homophobe and want to sit and watch a bunch of hateful people sit around and attack and harass (verbally and physically) a man who pretends to be gay to save his job, then rent this and snack on a can of worms.  HIDEOUS 
 I bought several tee shirts for my son. I washed them in cold water and put them in the dryer on a low setting. They shrunk at least one whole size. Also the stiching around the neck puckered. From now on I will stick with product lines I know like Hanes and Carters.  J. Duncan Arizon 
 Watch out!  Amazon has just copied these reviews from the original version of this classic which DOES NOT include the Destiny's Child garbage extras.  It looks like the original, uncut version is no longer sold by Amazon but is available from other sellers.  Be careful and get the original!!!  
 An important test of any theory is how much evidence exists for its case.  In this book, Doherty proposes that Christianity began with a celestial Christ who was thought to be crucified in a celestial realm above the earth, and that Paul's letters as they currently stand speak only of a non-terrestrial Christ.  In fact, Doherty makes this claim for all the New Testament epistles, which are thus presented as direct evidence -- people describing their own belief and thus directly attesting to the existence of the belief.  One trouble facing Doherty's thesis is that Paul's letters and the other early Christian documents speak of Christ's flesh and blood, and his birth and death; they also provide other indications of a terrestrial savior.  So a large part of Doherty's book consists of arguments to the effect that all these earthly-sounding words really referred to a "spiritual" death in the heavens.  A great deal of work has already been advanced against these arguments, and it does not need to be repeated here, except to say that no single piece of evidence for Doherty's thesis exists which is not ambiguous.  Doherty hardly denies this ambiguity, since it is his own contention that even the most terrestrial-sounding passages in the New Testament can be dismissed as metaphor rather than plain evidence for a historical Christ.  Thus, the main argument of this book is about a lack of evidence, that is to say, an argument from silence.  Doherty claims that the first ancient Christians are silent about an earthly Christ.  Again, much prior work has been done to show that this is far from true.  What I find interesting is that an argument from silence, though difficult to make and not generally favored by historians, can be legitimate, especially if combined with positive evidence.  In this case, if we could not combine it with such evidence we would face new arguments from silence that contradicted Doherty's thesis: Why are the proposed believers in the celestial Christ silent about so many details of their heavenly savior? And why do we not find ancient Christians, Jews, and pagans reporting or reacting to doctrines about a celestial Christ?  In this book, Doherty deals only with the second of these two questions.  He looks for ancient authors who tell us that others either believed in a celestial Christ or doubted the terrestrial Christ.  Since no ancient author tells us clearly about people who doubted that Christ appeared to be a flesh-and-blood man on the earth, Doherty proposes that we can find hints of such a thing.  In Appendix 3 of this book, he quotes a letter by Ignatius of Antioch to the Magnesians, written at the start of the second century, wherein Ignatius hopes that his readers will attain "full assurance in regard to the birth, and passion, and resurrection which took place in the time of the government of Pontius Pilate" (Magnesians 11:3).  This seems to Doherty like a polemic against a celestial Christ.  The principle he is using is a valid one, akin to when mainstream scholars use Paul's assurances about the Resurrection in 1 Corinthians 15 as evidence that doubts about the Resurrection existed.  But in that case, Paul tells us clearly what the doubts were.  Ignatius does not, and it will be worth a little effort here to go into the details.  Ignatius says earlier in his letter that some deny the death of Christ.  Today we call this the Docetic doctrine, which held that Christ merely appeared to be a human being but was actually only a spirit who appeared to die on the cross.  This doctrine is well-attested because so much ancient Christian literature seeks to refute it; and Doherty rightfully regards these refutations as different from the refutation that he is looking for, the proposed polemic against a Christ who did not even appear to walk on the earth.  Yet Ignatius mentions nothing like that.  He alludes to Docetism and to unspecified doctrines denying that Christ was the same as the one true God.  And he refers very specifically to Judaism, just before making his assurance about the birth, death, and resurrection in the time of Pilate's governorship of Judea.  He is telling his readers, in short, to have full assurance about things that both Docetism and Judaism are known to have challenged: the nature of this or any proposed savior's birth; his Passion under the Roman leadership in a Jewish province; and his Resurrection.  Doherty thinks that Ignatius is asking his readers to be "fully persuaded" of the bare facts of these things - the bare fact that they took place - but it hardly seems probable that Ignatius would be content to ask for that.  He is asking his readers to attain "full assurance" about all of the Church's interpretations and teachings concerning these things - to keep from straying into any kind of doctrinal dispute.  So he writes throughout his letter.  The ambiguity of Doherty's evidence prompts him to argue that there is so little clear evidence because orthodox Christianity changed, destroyed or neglected the evidence that was once there.  He uses this argument openly in a chapter claiming that at least some second-century Christians worshipped only God and rejected all savior figures.  Doherty presents the writings of Minucius Felix as a "smoking gun" to that effect, but he allows that the evidence is not as clear as we might want.  He tells us that it is the best evidence that can be expected, because clearer statements would never have "reached us through 2000 years of Christian censorship" (see p. 292).  That is the conspiracy theory.  Considering that Christianity has not wiped away all evidence of doctrines that it regarded as heresies, but instead has offered refutations of every heresy and preserved these refutations as a guide to the true faith, Doherty's claim is hard to believe.  A conspiracy to hide the truth can take place, Christians not excepted; the record of the past can be doctored, and has been.  But Doherty's specific claim is that Christianity's very first doctrines contained a purely celestial Christ, and that these doctrines have not been preserved even as heresy (with Ignatius serving as a brief and ambiguous exception).  Christianity's true origin was wiped away, not with refutation and doctoring, but with silence.  It is hard to believe that Christian institutions and individual writers were silent about what would have been the most radical and provocative of all the heresies -- silent about an idea that, per Doherty's central thesis about how religions work, would have threatened the Church's power to a greater degree than any of the other heresies, some of which were already regarded by Church Fathers as mortally dangerous to the Church.    So Doherty proposes one additional reason to explain the silence: he suggests that the Roman war against Palestine in the year 70 C.E. uprooted or destroyed so many lives that later writers could claim that Christ had lived there in recent decades, without challenges from locals who remembered either the true situation or the beliefs of the sect that worshipped a non-terrestrial Christ (see pages 168 and 179).  Doherty's picture is of a dying sect.  But a fundamental claim of Doherty's idea is the pervasiveness in the entire ancient world of the belief in saviors who descended to celestial regions above the earth and experienced pain or death there.  Had this sort of belief really been ubiquitous throughout the Empire, and applied to Christ as far as the church in Rome (to whom Paul addresses his longest letter), one war in Judea could not have extinguished the belief; and even in Judea it would be likely to reappear. Ignatius himself, per Doherty, is proof that the belief survived the war.  But if Doherty is right, we would expect such a popular doctrine to have flourished after the war.  We'd expect the orthodox sects of the Church proclaiming an earthly savior to produce some refutations.  The Fathers established in Rome, the center of all ideas, would surely have encountered or heard of the celestial Christ, for Doherty does not address how the celestial Christ of Paul's Letter to the Romans was just forgotten -- except by returning to the idea of censorship.  I invite any reader attracted by this book to work out Doherty's scenario and to test it repeatedly against the available information about the time period.  That's an external test.  Then test it against its own premises, repeatedly, for an internal test.  It is a worthy and rewarding challenge 
 But had one of the  worst endings ever...what happened anyway? My husband and I had to rewind the movie 3xs and still could not decide if the two people on board were alive or ghosts?  For example, the sailor on the boat looking at the yacht didn't see the woman, who was clearly standing up looking around.  And her baby was crying miserably...the movie depicted her as a doting mother whom runs when her baby cries yet, she wasn't interested at all in comforting the child, instead, she was looking at the man whom she supposedly saved, which didn't make any sort of sense?  These types of questions CHEAT the viewers, because we end up walking away from the movie disappointed because there was no clear understanding of what happened in the end...its like ordering a piece of cake, and not being allowed to eat it...which sucks!  Ohh, by the way, four out of the six actors should find new careers 
 I never bought GQ back in my 20s because for one thing, I never thought of myself as a clothes-horse.  Also, I actually took the G in GQ to mean that it was actually for Gentlemen, ie, sipping Champagne on a Yacht pass me the the Caviar type Gentlemen.  Well, after now having reached a "certain age" I find myself going back and forth between Esquire and GQ and find that in many cases, neither are exactly right for me.  However, I think I've bought my last episode of GQ.  The 2006 "interview" with Will Ferrel was interesting for the first three paragraphs, and then it became an excercise in self referentialism, disguised as an attempt at wit.   Also, the Politics of the magazine are unabashedly anti-Bush Administration, which would be OK except for the fact that I'm not reading GQ for Political content.  There are plenty of magazines out there make this their specialty, and when I find it in GQ, its just tiresome.  Frequently, swipes at Bush and his policies just come out of nowhere in an article, as if the Editor decided that a jab at Bush and his policies might help the piece, regardless of its content.  Not to mention - does anyone actually wear the clothing they put on display?  $800 tennis shoes?  I fear that I will be an Esquire reader - I can't bear to become a "Men's Best Life" subscriber just yet 
 Bio-identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be.  They have serious, dangerous impacts on the human body.  Please, if you are going to try these, do your homework first.  A growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects.  Some don't make it out the other side.  I am one of the lucky ones - I survived the blood clots in my legs and two near-fatal, year-long illnesses connected with use of "natural" progesterone.  Since that time, I have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones.  I hope this information will be helpful to someone else, too.  Please, safeguard your health - no one else is going to do it for you 
 I've read some long novels in my time, but this one I couldn't bring myself to more than skip through, aside from the first 90 pages, which excitingly detail the porteous riots. Scott might have had an interesting idelogical point to make about religion, but the story he found to tell it through was not worth 580-odd pages. Jeanie Deans story is more like a poor attempt at Jane Austen, who will she marry, how does her marriage go. Scott's interest is clearly in the supporting players, Douce Davie Deans and Dumbiedikes, who are aligned with whatever religious movement Scott didn't like. Honestly, if you don't care much for religious differences, you'll be skipping as I was. Too much character description and not enough character in action; the story doesn't fit the concept, and tells a story in 580 words what probably deserved 220 or less, for economic reasons, to sell the full three volumes (according to the introduction).  Scott is famous for being immensely popular: but unlike Dickens, I'm struggling to see why. I will give him another chance some day. I've got Waverley, Old Mortality and Ivanhoe sitting on my shelf - I haven't given up on him yet 
 This is a book that tries to do too much.  Its goal of exploring religion and popular culture is a good one, but that's territory that has been covered in many texts before, and with much greater insight than you'll find here.  Check out Chidester's earlier books on colonialism and the Jim Jones suicide for better scholarship.  Look elsewhere for better books on religion and American popular culture 
 I am 37 years old and trying to determine if I (and possibly one of my children) have ADD through both my own research and thorough medical and psychiatric investigation.  This was the fifth book I read on the subject, primarily to gauge the 'flip side' of the arguments in this area.  All authors are entitled to write their own opinion, it is their book, however I encourage potential buyers to do some research about this author and her biases and to formulate their own opinions to determine how much weight to attach to this information as it is presented.  I struggled to agree with much of the content as it does (as advertised) run contrary to most everything else I've read and most everything I've experienced personally.  I further don't believe there was any earth-shattering revelations nor reasoned counter-arguments to the mainstream ADD body of knowledge 
 Another in a long string of handsomely packaged Nonesuch releases of entirely adequate, workmanlike recent compositions by Steve Reich that leave me completely cold. You Are mainly sounds like a re-hash of ideas from Tehillim and Sextet, while Cello Counterpoint saws away with aimless dissonance just like Triple Quartet did. I always have such high hopes for a new Steve Reich release, remembering the excitement of discovering modern masterpieces such as Music for 18 Musicians, Octet, and Different Trains. I really hope he wows us all again one of these days... meanwhile, like The Cave, City Life, and Three Tales, this CD will just collect dust on the shelf... bah... 
 Look this album is old as i dont know what,this album wasnt even finished,they started on it like in early 2001,as far as tha production it will always be tight from paul and juicy-J,this was like an underground album,not like a world wide realease,thats why some will say its not that tight as production wise,it wasnt even through,thats why they put some of there old stuff on there with pastor troy and boo thats stuff is old,have u noticed that paul and others where just on hooks,some where supposed to be on there but paul took there verses off,because t-rock left over money and mic time,the album wasnt done,so there for they threw old songs on there cause he left,which was stupid because he would of gotten paid,so he left and now he aint getting nothing from this album,all that money is going to paul and juicy,t-rock is dumb,look tha unbreakables is gonna set tha world on fire its gonna be there hottest album to date watch,with boo gone u know they gonna have alot of superstars on there i would tell u but i got to go,if u dont believe me wait and see holl 
 In the begginning i was impressed by the title but disappointed by the quality of its material besides the font is very bad and hard to read , very small sketches hard to see , and the ideas exploration is not accomplished ,so never start with this book for this subject ... 
 I love Patti, and her last cd was one of her most consistant to date. This one is not good at all. This a low point in Patti's career, and God knows she has had enough low points on vinyl and disk. Live performances have been consistantly awesome over the years from what I can see on tv. I really wanted to like this, but "ain't no way" this song should have been remade by Patti and Mary who has a pitch issue. If you cannot do a song justice, don't sing it!!!!! Patti still has more vocal range left than most of her peers, but singing high notes don't "make" a song, interpretation is what makes the listener feel the lyrics. Patti and Mary need to learn that as age will creep up and lower ones vocal register. Patti should have listened to the doctor and waited for this one. This cd came and went, period! I literally gave it away!!!!! 
 The primary purpose of a coin sorter is to put the correct number of coins into the appropriate wrapper so you can take it to the bank.  That's what I bought mine for, anyway.  This thing is so imprecise that you never really know how many coins are in the wrapper.  As a result, if you really want to be sure you have to count them.  That's a huge drag and sort of defeats the purpose of owning this machine as far as I'm concerned.  Also, the "overflow" reservoir is where 25% of the coins end up whether the tubes are full or not.  I previously owned a coin sorter that was similar to this one as far as its simplicity etc. but much more reliable.  Don't waste your pennies on the Ultra Sorter 
 One reviewer said, ``First, Barbosa attacks Morris Kline (he's got some nerve doing that) for Prof. Kline's supposed lack of understanding of mathematics. This frivolous insult is so ridiculous that it isn't necessary to discuss it further.'' I won't claim that Kline doesn't understand mathematics, but it is quite clear from this book that he does not understand logic. I looked up reviews in the professional literature by logicians and found they made the same point.  Kline makes many technical errors in his account of the foundational debates in the early twentieth century. My favorite mistake, and perhaps his most blatant blooper, is Kline's statement that the Loewenheim-Skolem Theorem implies Goedel's Incompleteness Theorem; he thinks that models with different cardinalities cannot satisfy the same sentences. (For non-logicians: they can and do; Kline's alleged implication is wrong.) His account of the history of mathematics is not as bad.  Kline was an applied mathematician, and in his last two chapters informs us in very strong terms that applied mathematics is good and true, but pure mathematics is not. He urges mathematicians to abandon the study of analysis, topology, functional analysis, etc., and devote themselves to the problems of science.  The book is lively and entertaining, if not entirely reliable 
 It's hard to believe that a book by a fundamentalist Christian about the Devil could be this dull.  Usually the field of Satan-sniffing produces works filled with amusement, even hilarity, and massive evidence of human  credulity.  This book has only a vast vast number of Bible verses and a few  anecdotes so un-lurid that they wouldn't even interest Pastor Fletcher  Brothers on a dull day.  It does, however, provide a good groundwork for  understanding the philosophical basis of the fundy attitude towards demons  - if you happen to care 
 Since the reviews printed on the inside cover of the book all are blurbs, here are my blurbs:  "Really hard to get into ... tough to follow who's who ..."  "Opens strong, but fizzles out early ..."  "I literally feel asleep while reading this book one night ..."  "You'll finally give up without really wondering who did it ... 
 I didn't find this book to be very useful at all. It was basically a short review of general dog care focussed on city living. However all the information was very breif and didn't go into very much detail. if you really want to learn more about your dog I suggest getting a book that is more focussed on just one subject. I highly suggest the book "Rover, Don't Roll Over" for positive training. This book might serve someone well as a general reference, but if you have any troubles or questions that need answering or even trouble shooting don't bother with this book. I aslo didn't like their training style, it wasn't harmful, I just don't think their particular techniques work as well as in Rover, Dont Roll Over 
 The book is somewhat entertaining, but reading it you realize that the author  doesn't know much about the subject. The part about 18 century was so unrealistic with things like lipstick, iced tea or bath tab, that I was really surprised the characters didn't use computers in that time period 
 This book is falsified and exaggerated.  The press attempted to frighten the public at the time this was published.  The Voodoo's also were trying to scare "outsiders" who criticized them away with wild, false stories.  Don't believe everything you read in this book.  It's a hoax 
 Yes, this is a collection of stories, some of which are interesting and nice to read. Annoying, however, are the many mistakes which make one doubt Mr. Astor knows what he's talking about (Waffen SS infantry wear black? Panzer IV Panther?). Some select individual get to tell us about their life before the war, who they married, what their father did, etc etc, rarely anything interesting to know. One wonders why this privilege is granted to some and not all, although I would personally preferred none of this 
 I'm baffled by the glowing reviews posted by PW, Booklist, and my fellow amazon readers.  This book is nowhere near the quality of earlier Francis efforts (see Whip Hand, Forfeit, Come to Grief, Enquiry).  As a couple of other reviewers have noted, familiar characters--Jenny, the Admiral, Archie Kirk, Jenny's new husband--have undergone complete personality transplants.  Wonderful characters from previous books now come off as weak and foolish (or bitchy in the case of Jenny & Anthony).  Even Sid has lost his magic.    Rigorous editing would have helped, and surely Francis deserves Putnam's best.  But in this book, the usual spare and effective dialogue has turned clunky ("I've got to make a phone call," I said to the policeman.  "Now!  It's urgent!"), awkward ways of passing information to the reader abound (several sentences of dialogue begin "As you know ...", and at one point an asst trainer gives _Sid_ an explanation on the importance of not smoking in a stable!!!), and portions of the plot are weak (see the thoroughly inexplicable behavior of villain in ch. 19).   But, honestly:  I'll keep reading these books as long as Francis keeps publishing them.  (There are strong passages and elements here, in addition to the problems I mention above.)  Here's hoping we see a return to form in the next effort.  And many, many thanks for the dozens of fabulous novels that came before 
 Holy smoke was I suckered in. This is a terrible record. Just because these guys once were in the same room as the Beatles doesn't mean they can make music. I tried to listen to this disc a second time just to see if maybe I was being unfair. I wasn't. There's nothing here to hook into. This is one of those obscure bands that deserve their obscurity. Bad singer, no hooks, nothing. A complete disappointment. I gave it one star because there was nothing lower and for the mildly interesting story about meeting a couple of Fabs 
 We all know the saying, when you assume you make an (butt) out of you and me. Ronald Steel wrote a book about assumptions, which is bad enough. He tries to use the legend of RFK to predict vitality as a President and a man. However, he is unable to stay focused enough to present his case until the last nine pages.   Except for the last nine pages, the book is a very concise biography of Kennedy with a derogatory slant. Steel is critical of JFK's Presidency, making the suggestion that he would have been a forgettable president had he not been assassinated first. While Bay of Pigs was a failure, I suppose the Cuban Missle Crisis was unimportant in American history. Avoiding nuclear war is not important to Mr. Steel. The book suggests the legendary status JFK was exulted to was the only reason we even know of RFK. Steel goes on to suggest that Robert Kennedy was obsessed with his brother in the year following JFK's assassination. I suspect Mr. Steel would suggest Robert should be over his brother's death in a week's time. I would like to send Mr. Steel a copy of the Kubler-Ross's Stages of Dying.  My favorite assumption by Steel is that the primary reason RFK ran for President was because he wanted to be JFK. He makes Robert out to be like an obsessive stalker. Is it possible that RFK felt he had something to give the country as President? Or maybe he had something to prove being in his brother's shadow for so long?  The last nine pages, where Steel explains his thesis, is servicable for toilet paper. What is your vendetta against RFK, Mr. Steel? Robert Kennedy may not have won the nomination of his party, but RFK's very campaign stance is proclaimed hypocritical. Having apparently not cared for African-American rights during his tenure as attorney general, it is suggested that he only campaigned on the issue to get the votes. The portrayal of good Bobby/bad Bobby split personality is simplistic and inaccurate way for some to label Bobby coming out of his brother's shadow. He could not win, he was either mourning too long or trying too hard to establish his own identity. RFK encompassed the hopes of many Americans and had ideas to change America. He never had the opportunity to prove himself. Maybe he is not worthy of the legendary status he has gained in American history. However, people do change and can emerge with new priorities in their lives. I would hope Ronald Steel changes his career. 
 I heard all of these great things about this book etc...... So I got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down. I can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that I did not find at all entertaining. The "bowel movement" chapter was totally repulsive. I found it self indulgent, he had a crappy upbringing, that does not make for a good book 
 Sugrue takes a look at one of the crisis to hit not only Detroit but the rest of the country in his book on race and inequality. While there have been a lot of disturbing factors that have occurred during urban renewal Sugrue takes his text a little far. His flagrant bashing of urban planning gets old after the first two chapters and the book tends to drag on. This is an important issue that bears further studying but hopefully it will be done in a more academic way. This book does have all the information you need to start studying the subject and is a good way to begin looking at urban renewal.   
 ...because that's all this magazine is: an advertising vehicle aimed at kids who aren't old enough to discriminate between ads and actual content yet.   Don't be fooled by the venerable "National Geographic" name: this publications pays only the briefest lip service to educational content. When my son received it as a gift I was shocked to see that the ads were virtually indistiguishable from the articles. And in fact, the ads were often much more visually interesting.   The photos were excellent, I must admit. But the layout was jazzed up to the point of absurdity, as if designed to play to kids with minuscule attention spans. The science facts were sound, but again, the articles were cut absurdly short, more like squibs and factoids than actual articles, as if the editors believe that kids couldn't possibly focus on one topic long enough to actually read more than 250 words about it...or maybe because they didn't want to distract the kids from all that tantalizingly lucrative advertising stuffed onto every page.  As an editor and a parent, I am appalled by this magazine and would not recommend it to anyone. National Geographic should be ashamed of itself for pushing this kind of junk on young readers. Avoid this publication like the plague. 
 I LOVE John Grisham. I have read almost all his books, but this one.... I couldn't even read beyond the first hundred pages. It is so slow, a lot of narrative. It looks more like a history book than a thriller one. I didn't like at all 
 If there were actually a god, which you'd have to be a fool to believe so, he would promote goodwill, love, and peace. this is the most contradictory book EVER. its f***ing stupid. being conservative goes against everything jesus said, and a large number of liberal ideals go against what jesus said. the truth of the matter is that conservatives are against god. god would say repay the african americans, give the women at least close to an equal pay, choose the lesser evil and don't allow a poor pregnant fifteen year old girl to be forced to raise her son fatherless in a broken home that will promote crime, let her abort 500 cells that can hardly be considered human. he would say let those who have the most pay for our government, not those who have the least. he would say if a man is going to be gay and not care whether i say right or wrong, then let him get married by government, but not by me in my church. he would say don't promote an ideology of hate as a foreign policy and probably most importantly, don't lie. this last one is probably the biggest problem for conservatives. think i'm wrong? [...]. have at it 
 This was the first Harper story I read and it was dull. I enjoyed the Sookie story series. I won't be buying any more stories with this character. She just bored me and was pretty pathetic. 
 IM not sure where to begin with this review, its not that the book was poorly written, quite the opposite it was a very good piece but it lacked any sort of luster or appeal. It was quite infact extremely boring, by page 300 I could not wait for it to be over and this is weird because up to this point I have LOVED the gunslinger series, they were all very good from front to back. There is way, way, to much about Susanah and the whole thing about her having this baby and it dragged and draged, maybe this series is showing its age im not sure but one thing is for sure it was no Wastelands or Wizzard and Glass. It was a far fetch from those titles and it had barely any excitement. It got to the point where I had to try very hard to pay attention and often I would find I had read a page and not remebered what it was about and had to read it again. Im giving this book 2 out of 5, very poor story line, poor plot however it was written well I can only hope that the next book is better, cmon King give me the feeling Wastelands did, BLOWN AWAY!! rather than tired and exhausted 
 This is a mean spirited, humorless diatribe on everything A.A. Gill hates about the English, uncluding their humor, sportsmanship, war memorials, you name it.  As the author states, it is a collection of prejudice.  There are no laughs that might make it ironically amusing.  Unless you hate the Brits, don't bother reading it.   
  Despite the her extensive bibilography at the end of the book, Caro's research is at best superficial.  In fact, she seems to have relied a great deal on the Michelin guide to the Dordogne.  The author also has a tendency to insert herself into the story in an annoyingly coy manner.  Not recommended 
 After years of renting, my fiancé and I are thinking about relocating to another part of the country and purchasing our own home.  Since location is of the utmost importance to us - we'd rather have a large plot of land and a modest house than a mansion set on a tiny lot - we came up with the idea of purchasing raw land and putting a small but nice manufactured home on it while we slowly save up to build a larger home.  Eventually, the manufactured home will become a guest house or even home office.  At least that's one option!  In the course of investigating this possibility, I visited my local library and checked out every book I could find on manufactured, prefabricated, and modular homes.  "Buying a Manufactured Home" was the only guide I could find that is specific to manufactured homes.  Unfortunately, the book is embarrassingly awful, plain and simple.  Author Kevin Burnside, a salesman for a manufactured home dealer, clearly lacks both writing experience and ability.  Additionally, it doesn't appear as though his manuscript was edited - or even proofread - before it went to print.  The text is rife with errors: many of the sentences are poorly structured, words are misspelled or misused, and punctuation is spotty.  The reader literally can't pass through a page or two without spying some sort of mistake.  Two common errors include using "your" and "you're" interchangeably, and omitting one set of quotation marks in a pair, so that the reader's left to guess where a direct quotation begins and/or ends.  I wouldn't even expect my younger brother - a senior in high school - to make such basic mistakes.    However, it isn't just the presentation of the book that's flawed; the content is lacking as well.  "Buying a Manufactured Home" is organized into 16 chapters: Introduction; Looking at Manufactured Homes; Home Hunting; Financing: Shop for Money First; Finding a Good Dealer; Shopping for a Home; Finding a Home for Your Home; Finding the Best House; The Energy-Efficient Home; Be Your Own Contractor; Materials and Construction; Worksheets and Option Lists; Flow Sheets; Warranties; Contracts; and Arm Yourself.  Overall, I thought that Burnside did an adequate job of discussing financing and contract negotiation.  Nonetheless, these issues are not specific to manufactured homes; rather, buyers must be concerned with financing and negotiations in any home purchase.  Since I picked up this book to learn about the unique aspects of buying manufactured homes, I thought it was largely a waste of time to discuss more general issues, particularly since the book was so brief.  Given the short length of the book, I really feel as though the author should have concentrated on the issues specific to manufactured homes, issues of which the average homebuyer would not be aware.  For instance, the sections on "Finding the Best House" and "Materials and Construction" were frustratingly vague and truncated.  Burnside commonly lists different options that are available without explaining the pros and cons of each.  Additionally, he occasionally advises which option is preferable but doesn't explain why.    An excellent example of this is his "Quick Materials Checklist" on pages 146-148.  The checklist is essentially a line-by-line list of questions to ask of any home you're looking at.  In theory, this is a helpful tool to carry with you while shopping.  In reality, it's almost useless, as Burnside does not describe the various answers and explain which are more desirable and why.  For example, here is a short excerpt from his checklist, quoted word for word: "Are shingles 20, 25, or 30 year warranty?" "Are they held down with nails or staples?" "How many nails per shingle?" "Is felt used on the roof decking?" "What size are the trusses?" "How is the attic cavity vented?"  The only thing these questions tell me is that I should be concerned with the issues they raise.  However, even if the manufacturer were to address each of these in-depth, his or her answers wouldn't help much since I don't know what the "right" answers are!  I know to ask about the size of the trusses, but I have no idea what size the trusses SHOULD be!    The bottom line is that "Buying a Manufactured Home" is poorly organized, poorly researched, poorly written, and poorly edited.  It's awful.  I'd be embarrassed to have such a train wreck distributed with my real name stamped on the cover for all to see.  Do yourself a favor and pass this one up - I sure wish I had!  It was a waste of an afternoon, and I still find myself flabbergasted that Burnside was able to find someone to publish such a gawd-awful manuscript.  - Kelly Garbat 
 This unit sprays a mist of water nicely. However, any type of oil that I have tried will only be ejected as a weak stream. Not at all what it is marketed to do. It never misted olive oil from the very first day I got it. Extremely disappointed in this product. DO NOT BUY THIS USELESS GIZMO 
 The others summed it up.  Cheap parts, difficult to adjust. Put your money towards the EZ Rip instead. Costs more but much better results 
 The above book was truly one of the first "big people" books I read about 2 years ago. This may surprise a few people, but I always hated reading. Religion inspired me to read and read and read. When I first picked up Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism by Bishop Spong (Episcopal), I thought this was going to be an interesting book. Indeed it was. In the early days of my "re-search" for my faith, I was moving out of a secularized and atheistic mindset, so understandably I had a distaste for the "rules and regulations" of  a Church system like I grew up in, that is the Catholic Church. One of my best friends was or I should say, still is a lesbian. So how could I have reconciled the basic tenets of the Christian faith with the lifestyle of my friend? Well, as I read this book, Bishop Spong actually gave the answer: St. Paul, writer of many of the New Testament books, was a homosexual, albeit a celibate homosexual. This seemed quite revolutionary to me, indeed it still is, but I later found out that many scholars have been using this as way to justify homosexuality. After reading that book, I honestly felt like it was the Gospel truth. I didn't stop to think about how much of the book really used very little Scripture to justify his claims. Looking back on it, "Father Spong's" argumentation was more like a Psychoanalytic dissection of Paul's behaviors which may or may not have signified what Spong claimed. For example, does Paul's admission of a sin which he is struggling with mean that he is homosexual? Perhaps... But, there is absolutely no basis for his assertions either from a proper exegesis of the text or the Tradition of centuries of Church history. It's almost as absurd as the "revelations" of the Da Vinci Code.   I would not recommend this book, but I think a solidly formed Christian can read it for a good laugh. Bishop Spong has been a very controversial teacher and speaker for the last few decades. He is certainly a contribution to the potential of an Episcopal Schism in America. Indeed, in recent year, over a hundred Eposcopal Priests have converted to Roman Catholicism and have take many of their flock with them. Let us stand proudly with the Catholic Church to say that there exists only one Church, as Dr. Peter Kreeft has said on many occasions, which does not take it upon herself to edit God's Word.   God Bless, Laurence Gonzaga 
 This book is mostly hype and little delivery. The "inside" information can largely be found on the net and/or in better-written books by screenwriters of prominence. The agent and producer listings are vague and of little help. The book tells you almost nothing about "what they want" and virtually nothing about "how to win them over." All in all, it's poorly written and verbose and could have been cut down to a third of its length. Some of it is shockingly inappropriate, such as recommending to African-American writers where they can get good fried chicken in LA. In sum, it's yet another add-water-and-stir screenwriting book by somebody long on self-aggrandizement and short on Hollywood experience. I also find it quite suspicious that twelve five-star reviews here on ... were posted within a three-day period. Yeah, right 
 This is the kind of information my therapist of 4 years spewed...then I found one who offered practical guidework and here I am...a healed child. 
 I agree with all the other one star reviews (would give it zero if I could).  The author is a snob who  doesn't see the people whose lives she is supposedly reporting on as human beings in any way equal to herself.  If they take their "menial" jobs seriously she looks down on them.  She demeans hard work and celebrates entitlement.  For another view of the poor with some conception of how people's behavior shapes their lives, read LIFE AT THE BOTTOM. 
 I received this magazine as a gift... and I will not renew. Articles are very short and refer you to websites, telephone numbers, etc. for more information. Why so little information in the magazine itself? Additionally, there is a load of advertising: take that out of the equation and the magazine would only be a few pages long. For my money, there is much more available elsewhere, including a "google" search. Waste of paper, IMHO 
 We loved the strawberry book, and were very excited to see this one, but it was disappointing. The drawings are great, but the story lacks the charm and depth of the original 
 We're avid travelers and always take Lonely Planet guides with us -- they're normally very comprehensive and helpful.  The new 4th edition of the Switzerland guide proved a big disappointment, though, on our recent trip.  For some reason this is an unusually slim LP volume, so the depth of coverage for which LP is famous is lacking.  We went to numerous delightful towns, villages, and museums that didn't rate so much as a mention.  The city maps are also poor; many of the streets are unnamed, which makes the maps difficult to use for navigation.  Finally, some of the authors' choices seem almost bizarre.  The first boxed "Highlight" listed for the beautiful international city of Geneva, for example, is a particle physics laboratory(!) with the world's largest machine.  It's probably fascinating (we didn't visit), but does it really rank with the historic European headquarters of the UN, which didn't make the Highlights box at all, or the superb International Red Cross Museum? We came to rely almost exclusively on the excellent Rough Guide to Switzerland, which at 550 pages -- compared to 335 for Lonely Planet -- is much more thorough and useful 
 Once I read the description on the author, about how she's a screenwriter, it all makes sense.  I mean this in the sense that the text is not lyrical.  It's just there to serve the purpose of conveying the plot, nothing else.  There's no poetry to the writing.  Like many have said already, the characters lack depth, the plot is not much more than a soap opera, the recipes are added to the writing almost as an afterthought (they're just dropped in), and the ending is so forced and abrupt and ODD, that the book just left me feeling like I wasted my time reading it.  I did find the smattering of information about the Mexican revolution interesting.  Maybe I'm too much of a realist and enjoy nonfiction too much, but this story just was not for me 
 I read so many good reviews of this book that I had to get it for the Halloween season. It begins with an interesting and mysterious premise but soon evolves into pages of story with little excitement. I am at the last 5o pages of the book and perhaps I will find out why everyone else found this book so good. An antique book seller and his daughter operate a dusty old shop with valuable books. The daughter is invited by one of the top authors of the day to write her biography although she has been a recluse and resists others attempts to find out the truth of her life. The common thread between the author and biographer is that they are both twins. I am married to an identical twin and I am baffled by the excessive concentration on this one topic. Wait for it to go on the discount table 
 Yes it's true. The book of Sen it`s too much focused on the "theory of social choice" and it never makes an analysis of freedom and rationality by a pure philosophical point of view, but always by the point of view of the "social choice".  And it's also true that this kind of analysis is often related to the impossibility theorem of Arrow, as all the social choice theory could be reducted to that theorem  I think the title of the book does not say the essence of it,  People philosophically intrested in these two concepts should read something else... 
 I found this book to be an ignorant one-sided look at the near-death experience phenomena.  I have no argument with the fact that it happens, or that many people have this take on the issue.  However, the author shot down every other possible logical explanation with heresay, exageration, and tried to cover up his lack of knowledge on the scientific aspect with psequipedalianism. 
 I was so excited to receive this book, and can not believe how dissapointing it is!!  The people aren't urban explorers (UErs for short) - they are children who dress up in costumes and give each other "gang" names and then proceed to perform daredevil-like stunts which are not very impressive.   The book starts out talking about two of the teams failures - City Hall Place and the Croton Acqueduct, which makes you want to put it down and watch grass grow instead.  I've been past City Hall Station many times on the downtown 6 train, even with my Mother, it barely even qualifies as daredevil.  Their train stops while looping through the station and they are standing right there, but decide not to jump off - don't write a book about it then!!  Croton acqueduct is equally as sad - they walk through the tunnels for hours, then stop before the actual bridge (the goal) because they are tired - go back the next day and do it right, or don't write a book about it!!   Any yes, there are no pictures, although they refer to their pictures all the time.   The writing is pretentious and annoying and pointless for the most part - I want to read about "Exploring the Tunnels, Ruins, and Rooftops of Hidden New York" not about your evening spent in twin donuts looking like freaks and scaring people!!   Do yourself a favor and don't buy this book - there are better books about urban exploration, particularly ones about the NYC area.   
 What has happened to the Anna Pigeon in Track of the Cat, Superior Death, Firestorm, Blind Descent, Ill Wind? That delightfully flawed character? Why has Ms. Barr been so fixated on teen angst, rednecks, drugs & their ilk? Where is the Ranger who found it sometimes "embarrassing to be human",(a line I still use from time to time). Where is all the politics between the NPS & the Forestry, before Anna was "Boss"?   In High Country we have Anna impersonating a waitress in Yosemite NP as part of an undercover assignment. Aside from a collection of the sleaziest, foulest-mouthed characters you'd never want to meet, we have four missing teens who may or may not be victims of foul play, two chefs & an assortment of fellow waitresses who may or may not be on the level-and do we really care?  Personally, as a former die-hard Anna Pigeon fan, I feel that this is Nevada's worst Anna Pigeon yet, & it hurts to say it. As others have mentioned, she doesn't paint a very desirable picture of Yosemite-I didn't get the feeling I had been there the way I did with her earlier books. In Firestorm, I almost felt ashes on my clothing & in Blind Descent, I had that claustrophobic feeling of being trapped in small spaces & so on. Maybe it is because it was set in winter-which I would think would be a spectacular time in any National Park-it paints the whole atmosphere with brooding strokes. Nevada Barr is obviously seeing a different place than Ansel Adams saw through his camera lens! Anna always did survive planned "mishaps" in superhero fashion, but we loved her & wanted her to survive. High Country almost goes beyond superwoman! The incident with the deer was completely uncalled for. I also felt that mentioning the real life murders was in bad taste & beside the point of the story (not that there was much point.)   This reader has gone from waiting with great anticipation for each new adventure, wondering where I'll be transported next, to ho hum; maybe I'll wait until I can get a good price on the paperback. I understand that her next book is set in Rocky Mountain NP, a park near & dear to my heart. It will be interesting to see if I recognize it. Nevada, please bring back the old Anna Pigeon-flaws & all.  
 The authors make several references to a set of plans and list of materials that are included with this book but these appear to be missing. I would not try to build a masonry oven with this book but it is a good start 
 Because there were so many great reviews for this movie, I decided to go out and rent this film and watch it.  I was bored to death watching this film, and whats with the words "what's wrong" kept being said over and over again every time someone opened the medicine cabinet in a computer generated voice?  Those words and that voice really annoyed me!  Why does this place have not one person with hair?  Now, I'm not trying to be raciest here, but what's with a black girl and guy dancing totally nude on t.v., well  I can only say that the girl was totally nude since they only showed the guys chest and up.  What's with that guy who kept stalking one guy by saying that he wanted to be his new roomate?  Was he supposed to be gay?  I guess this film is way to so called "artsy" for me.  What I know is that this film is boring, and when it comes to ending, you don't know what happends to the guy at the end.  The film just kind of fades out after he stands on top of that cone stairway.  This film makes the movie The Village exciting to watch.  I wish that I could give my money back 
 Since I loved Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain (way back in high school) I happily picked up Congo at the airport. What an enormous disappointment - the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half. Nonsensical details are never explained (what's with the gray gorillas and the paddles? The gorillas were trained by the Zing-ites, back in the day, to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it? This is never made clear), the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up, and the characters are ridiculously one-dimensional. This is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you're SOL - the plot is not going to come together, and you're not going to be satisfied. That, plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology, left me entirely cold - this book hit the airport trash can the minute I debarked 
 It takes too long to focus and shoot! This, coupled with the very long time it takes to write to the memory card, well, it is horrible.  People who write in saying they didn't notice the the slow focus and writing, must be either paid by Nikon or total nubs.  Do not buy this camera.   It did take decent movies, and the size is nice 
 Having devoured the Skye series, and finding them to be the absolute best of the historical romance genre, I found The Last Heiress to be a huge disappointment. The plot is comparatively simple.The reader waits for the adventure and intrigue of Small's previous novels, but it never comes. I find it hard to believe that this is even the same author.The plot is entirely predictable after chapter one. No surprises twists or turns. Save your money and skip this one 
 Firstly, it took two poeple to write this uninspiring book? Nowhere on the back does it state this is a Christian Chick Lit book.   Basically I cannot finish this book because the character is such a dork. One of the authors graduated from Baylor, so that explains the Christian theme, but come on! Drinking is not a sin! I guess my Catholic alcohol infused upbringng just can't relate to teetotaling Baptist types. I'll pass, now hand me a glass of wine... I'm moving on to read Smashed instead 
 If you want a good Hank 3 album, go with Lovesick Broke & Driftin'. It's a more impressive and mature work than this one, which seems slapped together and unoriginal.   The best songs on Risin' Outlaw are the three written by Wayne Hancock, who himself has a delivery and style eerily similar to Hank Sr. So what you end up with on this disc is Hank 3 imitating Wayne Hancock imitating Hank Williams, Sr. And since Wayne Hancock is a better singer and songwriter to begin with, and his performances of his own songs are better than Hank 3's, why not just get the original Hancock CDs? The cover of "Thunderstorms and Neon Signs" on Risin' Outlaw seems particularly pointless, as Hank 3 uses an identical delivery, launching into falsettos at the same time, holding certain notes the same way, etc. I can understand why someone would want to cover it--it's a beautiful song--but at least add *something* of your own to it. To use an art analogy, it's like Hank 3 is tracing over a drawing that Wayne Hancock made, but it is apparent that Hank 3 isn't as good of an artist.   Having said this, Risin' Outlaw is still better than 99% of the trash played on country radio. But I think that speaks more to the horrible quality of contemporary country music than it does to the quality of this particular album. Still, if you get the chance to see Hank 3 play live, don't miss it 
 China Mieville's first two novels set in the world of Bas-Lag gave him a well-deserved reputation as the most important young writer working in the sci fi/fantasy genres today. In Perdido Street Station and The Scar, Mieville created a neo-Dickensian milieu of bizarre, terrible, but deeply compelling grotequeries inhabited by complex, often-conflicted characters. Both narratives gained momentum over hundreds of pages, even as each sprawled further into and then away from the teeming city of New Crubozon, and  all of it was illuminated by Mieville's powerfully intelligent, pleasingly baroque prose style.  So, what happened with Iron Council? Mieville's third Bas-Lag book is confusing, meandering, and populated by shallow, underdeveloped, highly unlikeable characters. His writing style is choppy throughout and routinely defies the most basic rules of grammar and usage; perhaps he was aiming for profundity (think David Foster Wallace), but he achieved only preciousness at best, and tedium more often. The narrative-such as it was, given his penchant herein for flashbacks, deus ex machinas, and withheld information-had holes in it one could (pardon the pun) drive a train through. The plot progressed as if he didn't know where it was going when he was writing it. Above all, Iron Council was agonizingly dull-I could hardly wait for the book to be over with and finished.   Many have correctly noted that this is Mieville's most explicitly political novel. Since his politics are Euro-socialist in character, perhaps you might think I was put off by that-but no. I am myself that rara avis, an American social-democrat of long standing, and I have little but sympathy for tales of community-level collectives (a la the Paris Commune) or worker oppression (a la the transcontinental railroad)-and both themes and their thinly veiled historical antecedents are prominent in Iron Council. But largely because of Mieville's failure to draw fuller, more sympathetic characters (Cutter is a whiny jackass; Judah Low is a cipher) or to sustain a believable and interesting narrative (the Council itself is an irritating community prone to sudden, inexplicable shifts of opinion as to its raison d'etre-but never mind, as it doesn't finally appear until hundreds of pointless pages have passed following the interminable wanderings of Cutter & Co. and the similarly unlikeable Ori back in New Crobuzon), and with it all undermined by his annoying staccato voice and sometimes incoherent descriptions of events, whatever merits Mieville's radically politicized story may have had get thoroughly lost in the shuffle.  In his previous novels, nothing felt like a "set piece"; everything that happened usually played a crucial role in why subsequent events turned out as they did. In Iron Council, by contrast, one senses more a rote succession of staged novelty acts, as if Mieville were making use of every half-developed idea he'd ever had. (Take the attack of the "inchmen," for one instance.) In a similar vein, the major characters in his earlier Bas-Lag were sometimes morally ambiguous, but that just made them consistently interesting and complicated. As many have commented, the most noteworthy thing about two of the major characters in Iron Council is their homo- or bisexuality, and yet while this is a promising and perhaps vaguely daring premise in the usually hyper-heterosexual world of fantasy fiction, it seems a choice made more for shock effect than anything essential to them or the plot. Their sexuality is clearly intended to be-but is very poorly realized as-vital to these characters' "being-ness," and thus it contributes almost nothing to our understanding of them. In fact, Cutter's passionate possessiveness toward Low makes him seem, more than anything, one-dimensional and frequently grating-hence, Cutter's sexuality becomes more of a negative trait, which seems rather incongruous with Mieville's anti-intolerance politics.     SPOILER ALERT-Just a few plot objections concerning the end of the book (though there were plenty of others throughout): Why wouldn't the militia have destroyed or booby-trapped the tracks just outside of New Crobuzon? Why hadn't they sought out and found their cohorts and the Council in the weeks prior to the train's approach, just as Cutter had? Why can't any of the refugees from the city give the Council a reasonably straight answer as to whether or not the Collective had already been vanquished? (It had.) And most of all, how does the "time golem" manage to continue in existence even after Judah Low has been killed? Finally, and in a completely different vein, why does Mieville use the word "career" as a verb over and over again?   But enough already. I have never before had my expectations so shattered by an author. I am astounded that anyone would think that this book is on a par with-or even better than-Mieville's previous Bas-Lag novels (though the wider consensus seems to be one of disappointment, more or less). Unfortunately, though, Mieville received some of the best and widest mainsteam-media reviews of his career with Iron Council, and if he believes his clippings, I'm afraid we may in for more outings like this. But his earlier works provide a far better indication of his prodigious talents, and so  I will fervently hope that he can still return to that form with his next novel. 
 I bought this book nearly as soon as it came out, and I absolutely loved it.  The cartoons and the layout of the book are superb. I did not really use the CD's, however, because I was in transition between computers.  It was still nice knowing that there were 60,000 more cartoons waiting for me if ever I wanted to read them, and with the stellar quality of the book, I assumed the same for the CD's.    I was wrong.  The cartoons on the CD's are very low resoluton- this means that the pictures are not clear; they look a little blocky and pixelated.  Also, the large, multi-panel cartoons have been compressed even more so as to fit on to one page.  I was severely disappointed. The captions, however, are very nice.  Too bad it's often difficult to see what they're referring to. I don't really have the complete cartoons of the New Yorker: I've got about half, with the other half illegibly thrown into the mix.    Why then two stars?  It's simple: The book itself is very nice.  With the price lower now, It is a very reasonable price for the Best Cartoons of the New Yorker, which is what this book is without the CD's.  The book is wonderful, just don't be confused into thinking that you will be able to read every cartoon as the book claims 
 For decades, many male professors have made the same excuses for sexual exploitation of their students--to the fury of feminists.  To read a feminist using the same rationalizations is both nauseating and infuriating 
 it is nice to have tab, with the notation.   there is no indication as to which version of the tunes he is trancribing , the title is a lie  there is no breakdown of the guitar style there just tunes trincribed period 
 I'm 49, post-menopausal, and I love the Golden Girls, Erma Bombeck, and The View, but that type of sharp humor is not in this book. This author's humor is mild and corny, with LOTS of capitalized words. You know, for EMPHASIS! That said, it's pleasant to read. Companionable, but not terribly compelling. A nice book for the nightstand, to pick up now and then 
 The opening track is an awesome collaboration with Sting.  I thought that if the rest of the CD was that good, I'd love it. It isn't, and I don't.  In fact, there are only two tracks on this disk I really like.  The only other song I liked on it was the very funny Changing Your Demeanor (who knew Derek Bell could honky-tonk like that?!).  The rest of it just doesn't work.  Tom Jones does such a hammy job of Tennessee Waltz, he ruins one of my all-time favorite songs.  And I'm sorry, but Mick Jagger singing The Rocky Road to Dublin is just wrong.  A rare misfire from a usually rock-reliable group of musicians 
 As a white man, this book offended me several times during the first five minutes of reading it.  If an author wrote in the same way about black people the book would not even be published! I am tired of the double standard! Thank god I didn't pay for this book and only checked it out at the library 
 I have to strongly disagree with the editorial and reader reviews on this essay, even though it was a national bestseller. The book is touted as possibly the most rational description of a descent into morbid, clinical depression and suicidal despair. I didn't find it so. Styron was descriptive but rather than probing and baring the depths of his mind and emotions during his depression, I felt he only hinted at the tip of the iceberg. I didn't find any riveting, palpable tracing of his depression. It was rather moribund for a subject with such potential. There is a detachment throughout that many attribute to Styron's calculating dismantling of his own emotions to throw light into the abyss. I found the detachment sort of hovering over the pond, unwilling to dive in, which robs the reader. Candor, yes in some aspects. Precision, somewhat missing.  He quotes Dante "In the middle of the journey of our life, I found myself in a dark wood, for I had lost the right path." Styron was in the melancholia described by Dante but he never succeeds at identifying why or even how he managed to eventually recover.  From what most reviewers have said, this book should have been the definitive treatise on deep depression, written by a survivor. It is not that impressive at all 
 I bought this for the version of 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' included in it.  Olivier is excellent as Big Daddy, and Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner are very good as well.  The photography and sets on these plays are reminiscent of a mid-seventies soap opera;  fairly cheesy sets, glarey lighting.  That would be tolerable, but the sound is recorded so muddily that it's really hard to understand the actors-so much so that I haven't been able to finish some of the plays.  I can't believe that the DVD producers couldn't have spruced up the sound.  If they can reissue CDs of Caruso and McCormack with listenable sound, surely they could have restored this soundtrack to some degree of clarity.  What makes it even worse is that they don't include subtitles on the DVD.  Hey, producers, a play is all about the WORDS, ya know?  They're important, and if they aren't accessible through the soundtrack you might consider subtitles.  Given that you can't understand half of what's said, I see no reason for anyone to ever buy this item.  It's sad, because there seems to be some pretty good acting in these plays 
 If you want a book about jarring, hideous color combinations and no useful information whatsoever, get this one. There are so many bad art instruction books, and this one is one of the worst & most useless. The cover of the book gives you an example of the horrible color schemes the author uses. Do you really want to make paintings like that? Also, the color theory in this book is WRONG. Quiller is one of those who still believes that the primary colors are red, blue, and yellow, when they are actually cyan, magenta, and yellow. I bought another book, "Color Theory Made Easy," which is much better. It teaches correct color theory and useful information. I don't know what other good color theory books there are, but I do know you shouldn't buy this useless piece of junk by Quiller. I am really tired of bad art instruction books getting rave reviews on Amazon.com and buying them because I was gullible enough to believe all these reviews 
 Despite this book's title, the author provides no useful information regarding the art of angling with flies, and readers seeking advice on fishing the waters of Colorado, where the author lives, should look elsewhere 
 I bought the DVD with this artwork out of a dollar bin and I got what I paid for. The image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality. This must have been taken from a 16mm print. It may be that this film is in public domain, so it may be difficult to find a decent quality DVD. There are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other DVD issues. Note: Amazon seems to spread these reviews across DVDs of the same title, so you may see this review under multiple DVD releases of "Meet John Doe".  The poor quality DVD that I bought has a cover that looked like this: [... 
 Anti-corporate Cassandras grind axes to sparse audiences these days.  In O'Boyle's piddling attempt to make us outraged at GE, he destroys his own credibility.  By attempting to pin every social ill of the late 20th  century on Jack Welch-- a good, if ruthless CEO-- his ideological ship  spins wildly out of control.  Downsizing is his fault. (Hello,  organizations are becoming streamlined all over the developed world)  Media  sensationalism is his fault. (Welch personally delights in the bottom  dwelling content of Dateline NBC) Anybody who has ever worked for a  corporation, especially one as big as GE, knows a few things that should  make readers way of O'Boyle's hokey cause and effect analysis: 1. The CEO  does not micromanage his or her company-- thousands of important decisions  are made under a CEOs jurisdiction every day. 2. Corporations are not  social utopias, and shouldn't be.  People get fired sometimes.  But people  are also given opportunities to do interesting work.  And competition is  good. 3. If there is a ubitiquitous problem in society, e.g. families are  no longer as stable, a corporation, which is sample unit of social  organization, will usually reflect, or possibly be linked more directly to  that problem.  However, small minds confuse this with causality, not  understanding the methodological pitfall of ad hoc ergo propter hoc.  For  example- families break up more, partially because people don't balance  work and family very well. Lots of people work for corporations.   Corporations caused the decline of the American family. Read the book--  O'Boyle is guilty of not understanding these truths and more 
 It is the heighth of academic arrogonance for high school educators to think they should teach Huck Finn.  From an academic standpoint HF is advance college-level literature.  
 I have read all twelve of these books and hoping there will be more. The language is pretty graphic but they are so funny you can usually ignore those words. These books can cause you embaesment, since I read where ever I have to sit and wait and you burst out laughing people do stare and wonder if you are losing it. Please we would all like to see more of these 
 I may never read another book.  Never has it taken anyone so long to never arrive anywhere.  At one point I actually lost the will to live, not because I empathized with any of the characters but because I could not believe I had another 90 pages to endure.  I am so glad it's all over 
 The book does not go indepth into a lot of physics problems. It will solve one question on one topic and then give the student a bunch of other questions at the end of the chapter that are different and harder than the solved example problems. Everyone who has taken college physics knows that there are a lot of variations to different questions, and there are conditions and exceptions that must be taken into account before a problem is solved. If you have a crappy physics professor, like I had, this book will make physics a nightmare for you 
 "Amanda Miranda" is by far the worst book I have ever read.  They must have abridged all the exciting, good parts out of the story!  Peck isn't my favorite author, but this plot sounded very intriguing, but I was only able to read a few pages a day.  The Titanic was not introduced until the end of the novel, and when it was mentioned, it was brief.  I do not recommend 
 Can Mr. Luboff, Avalon Travel books, or Amazon spell E-T-H-I-C-S ? My wife and I are determined to move to Mexico. We have been reading several books about the process of making this transition and eagerly awaited Mr. Luboff's book. Having purchased (and enjoyed) his 1999 book, Live Well in Mexico, we figured, the 2002 Adapter Kit, would have more detail, and provide further assistance in our move. THE TWO BOOKS ARE ONE AND THE SAME!! Chapters were simply moved around, and 2 renamed.I don't have a problem with  Mr. Luboff reworking his earlier book, but wouldn't it be ethical to state somewhere (on the cover, in the intro, OR in Amazon's write-up)that fact? I am disappointed. I have to assume Mr. Luboff has nothing further to say and forgot he had already published one book on the subject. 
 This is not a biography of the humble young Mohawk woman whose courage, holiness, faith, and purity earned her (as thousands who know and love her truly believe) that place in Heaven.  This book, in the author's own paraphrased words, is meant to "bring Tekakwitha down from heaven."  (And it is part of a gloomy trend to do just that - to as much as one can to bring one's subject down.) And, thankfully, despite over two hundred pages of trying, he has not succeeded in dragging her down.  There are people who were primarily historic figures and those whose lives are mainly of religious significance. Blessed Kateri (or Catherine, as the author prefers to call her) Tekakwitha was very clearly the latter.  But this book approaches her from the former point of view, making her a postmortem pawn in the Jesuit's missionary work among the natives in Canada.  The mystical and the supernatural (from a religious view) are ignored.  The author seems even unwillingly to use the title of "Blessed" in reference to her.    At one point, the author even seems - in a very subtle way - to imply the Kateri and her closest friend (Marie-Therese Tegaiaguenta)were lovers.  If, as he writes, there is "no reason to think they were lovers," why mention it at all?  What does it serve?  The author dwells on each and any discrepancy in the original accounts by the two missionaries who knew Kateri during the last years of her life.  (Even the Bible - in all its various popular translations - has its discrepancies.)  Any story of any person, any account of any event is bound to have differences when told by two different witnesses.  That alone is not enough reason to discount the differences.  His grim portrait of Kateri in no way accounts for the great numbers of people (not only Native Americans, but from around the world) who have a profound love for this holy young woman.   I can speak from my own experiences and observations that she has had a great impact even on people who knew little or nothing of her.  Historians may find this book of interest, but for those who have a devotion to this wonderful saint-to-be, there is little to recommend it.  On a personal level, I have been studying the life of Blessed Kateri for a number of years.  My personal collection includes nearly a hundred works of literature on her.  These range from reprints of the original biographies by Fathers Chauchetiere and Cholonec to fluffy, sentimentalized (to the point of being quite ridiculous) books for young readers.    I am also the creator of the web site mentioned on page 241 of this new book.  I work for and look forward to the day when she is finally declared a saint.    I pre-ordered this book many months ago and read it with an open mind as I am always eager for new details on her life.  For me, it was a dull read (the narrative flow seems uneven) with left me unimpressed (not with Catherine Tekakwitha) and with a very unpleasant taste.  Historians, cultural anthropologists, and the politically correct may find something of interest in this dry and dreary book, but for those who have a devotion to this wonderful saint-to-be, there is little to recommend it.	  (I gave it one star because there is no lesser option and, well, my site was mentioned in the Notes to Chapter 9.  I suppose I owe it something.)	  
 Buy this book and feel like an [fool]!  I was hopeing for a book that would address male issues for those over 40.  What I got was one man's collection of "urban fables" with instructions based on his unique, singular experience.  I struggled through chapters 1 and 2, but the real kiss of death was chapter 3 (Why men feel ashamed of themselves and therefore do not take any interest in health or longevity).  I'm ashamed because I'm not a hunter?  I'm ashamed because I got a circumcision and didn't get a chance to resist?!  Give me a break!  I was going to give the book to my local library, but I don't think I want to be guilty of promulgating this kind of [stuff].  You want to  be healthy over 40  each less junk, exercise regularly, find meaning in your job to insure your efforts make a difference somehow, try and stay connected with friends or make new ones, stay connected with your partner and be supportive and allow to be supported.  There you go, saved you [$] (not including shipping and handling) 
 I bought this Apple humidifier in early November. It stopped working soon at the first time I used it. I later found out that there was no water exchange unless you shake it or move it so that it might continue to work for a while and then stopped again. You have to repeat the above steps in order to keep it working. I contacted the manufacturer and got replacement. However, the new one has the same problem, and what's worse, it leaks!! I talked to the manufacturer again, but they didn't think there should be such problem and refused to do anything else. Now I have to keep this defected machine and have no idea what to do 
 I bought and used this book for a probability class and for preparation for the Society of Actuaries (SOA) exam course 1.  I had never had a probability or statistics class and this book did a very poor job of helping me to understand the topics.  I had to resort to using other books not required for the class in order to understand anything.  I did not pass the the SOA exam and I blame that, in part, on this stupid book.  I also had about 50 class mates, all of which had just as much disgust for the book as I did.  Not disgust for the class but for the book 
 I'm not sure if there's something unusual about the cigarette lighter adapter in my Ford Escape Hybrid, but this dual outlet plug adapter didn't fit in far enough for the side contacts to touch where they needed to for the power to go through it.  It may be my particular outlet in the car, but I'd definitely check to make sure you have a fairly deep cig. lighter outlet for this to work.  The company did respond pretty quickly, but it would have cost them and me more than it was worth for a $4 item to send it back and try to get me a different one. 
 BB offers no meaningful insights into the securities industry. Like all businesses, there are various types, but he never once calls into question the very nature of the activity. As he is still in business, he does not want to offend the pantheon of interests that control OPM (Other People's Money). Among his comments: 1. Long only managers add value - some may. His friends? Who knows. But the vast majority are closet indexers. 2. Hedge Funds add value - this is dubious. 3. Funds of Funds add value - I TRIED to believe this one. But I can't. Not after BB describes his own diversification strategy. Its just another layer of diversification - and hence fees.  He does say that large asset management firms are run along business rather than investment principles. He worked at MSAM for 30 years. THEN he found religion? This is a convenient jailhouse conversion, now that he has a hedge fund.  There are several veiled comments that one is only TRULY successful unless one is worth $500. Ok Barton...I'm not worthy.  I have +10 years in the industry and am very aware of the conflicts of interest and outright crime that occurs on a daily basis. BB papers over all of this with bland platitudes and the help of a good editor 
 When it comes to nature cd's, less is more to my ears. So often, including here it seems, the engineer seems to think that more is more, the more sounds they can fit in the mix, the better. What about non-distrcipt ambient sound from  the forest? That seems to me the best and most relaxing part.   The sound of running water is highly unrealistic as well. For my ears, too busy for a natural sounding cd. For the generous price, you might want to come to that conclusion yourself.   
 Can I give it negative stars?  I actually have no idea how it works on my Palm Treo 680, I was never able to get that far.  I installed the software to my Windows XP desktop and it:  would not allow me to install the Palm software (no device found), ran my CPU at 100% and refused to let go or be terminated.  And then crashed my computer.  On reboot, I discovered that it's autostarting, sucking 100% of my CPU, won't let go, won't terminate, and as soon as I opened the UI it crashed my computer

 (Commentary below refers to soft cover Third Edition.)  For those of us who learn by example and who need more active guidance through difficult material, this book falls short.  It appears to be a deliberate design strategy of this book, to under-explain then over-exercise.  This is tolerable until one gets to integration, where the sink-or-swim approach will result in many unnecessary drownings.  Stewart seems at least a little better in this regard, and I note that it is replacing Hughes-Hallett in my school.  One could hope some day for a text written by someone who had enough trouble learning the subject, to be able to remember the value of a patient explanation.  No, 8 pages (including the exercises) are NOT sufficient to explain algebraic identities and trigonometric substitution in integration, except to a bright student with a fresh memory of trigonometry.  The physical weight of this book is burdensome, and the price is symptomatic of the shameless shakedown racket that American textbook publishing has become.  Some Web research reveals that a typical price for a German university mathematics text is under $50 equivalent 
 i tried reading it, and made it about 3-4 pages.  i'm pretty sure that's a bad sign.  i seem to recall mr. sedaris writing about his mother's bedpan or something.  the impression i instantly got was "BEEP BEEP!  PRETENTIOUS YOUNG WRITER PEDDLING SO-CALLED BAD CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES FOR FAME, MONEY AND SYMPATHY."  guess what, mr. sedaris?  i don't give a (expletive deleted) about your so-called bad childhood.  millions of people have bad childhoods and don't play the sympathy card.  check out augusten burrough's books, they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style.  
 Sure all the movies on there are great, and wow what a chance to get them all, but come on, this is absolutely sickening. The ultimate gift for the movie buff? With the list price of 4 grand, and the Amazon price at a grand and a half, it'd be cheaper to slap the movie buff who puts this on his xmas list. Seriously, there's no way anyone who buys this can say the economy's bad if they've got 1.5 thousand dollars to blow on something so meaningless. I'm for splitting that package up into about 4 or 5 sets, lower the price and viola! You're not a glutton for buying one of them at a time. Perhaps I'm the only one in this consumer day and age who doesn't find this to be a deal of the century, but rather one of the sickest displays of commercialism I've seen 
 This book was disappointing in its lack of detail.  It doesn't really get into much depth on any topic and I just didn't learn anything from it 
 I purchased this lumbar support for a recent back problem. Big mistake! It simply will not stay put no matter what chair I tried it with. The arch that is supposed to help relieve back pain and give support is just too much, it has you bending over backwards. I believe it actually made my back ache more. 
  Hard to believe it has been ten years since Load came out. Like many Metallica fans I recoiled against it, not because of the songs per say, but the whole image change, the shock of Metallica being on Lollapalloza, the disgust at seeing the arrogant attitudes displayed by Hetfild and Ulrich towrds Metallicas established fan base and the genre of heavy metal in general.It was too much for many people to take, and they rejected Load right then and there.    That said, with 10 years passing by, one can listen to Load is a clear eye(or ear). The fact is that while Load is not up to the previous standards of Metallica, it isint all that bad of an album, and despite the dramatica image change, it isint "alternative", either. What Load is more or less is Metallicas interpertation of 70s style blues based hard rock/metal. Think Black Sabbath, AC/DC, Sad Wings of Destiny era Judas Priest, Deep Purple, Budgie, UFO and Thin Lizzy. It are these influences that are most heard in Load. The mid temp, chunky riffs, the wah-wah pedal drenched solos, simple 4/4 based arrangements. Certarinly a big change from the agressive and also progressive nature of previous Metallica albums(even the Black album still had agressive and progressive influences).    The problem with why Load doesnt work per say is mainly two fold. One, at 80 minuites, there is quite a bit of filler on it. The hard rock/metal groups in the 70s worked with a 45 minuite frame work at the very most when it came to LPs, Load would have been a double LP, and the number of successful double LPs in any genre of rock can be counted on by one hand(the only one I can think of in the hard rock/metal genre is Led Zepplins Physical Graffiti). The filler material really weights the album down. The other problem is the bland, mid range production that Bob Rock gave the album that robbed the guitars of their power.    Some of the songs despite the production shortcomings have held up fairly well over the last 10 years. Songs such as King Nothing, 2X4, Bleeding Me, Aint my [...], Torn Within, the Outlaw Torn and Wasting My Hate are fiarly solid. The problem is the rest of the material is not solid, and still has the lifeless sound. Had Metallica only released one instead of two LOADS, had Metallica had better, more lively production, and had Metallica taken the better tracks off ReLoad such as Fuel, Devils Dance, Unforgiven II and Where the Wild things are, then it very well may have been a near great CD(think 4 stars or A- grade), but alas, Metallica went a different route, and the Loads are still considered a failure overall.    I do not reccomend fans of hard rock/metal purchase the entire Load CD, but the individual tracks I listed for Ipod make for decent rotation material 
 Loved his other books but this was all over the place, hard to read, and to apply 
 Not sure this is the book to study for the PMP. Agree that its missing the tools techniques and concepts but he made it clear up front he was not going into it. Also, the intergration knowledge area is missing. I think if he went into the format of the exam , it would really serve its purpose better.  Read this after you have read the PMBOK and another REAL PMP EXAM prep book! This is great to read the day before for leisure with no pressure 
 The first 15 pages were OK. After that, it got boring fast. Borrow a copy, if you must

 This oven gets soooooo hot on the outside that if ANYTHING is touching it or near it it will be affected.  Be especially careful that the cord itself (slack) is not touching the back of it or you could have an electrical fire on your hands.  We had a phone cord that touched the back of it and melted itself to it, luckily the phone line shorted out the whole system and alerted us to a problem before a fire broke out.  Also, since there's no timer it was easy to forget something was cooking.  Spend a little more for better insulation and a timer 
 Don't waste your money if you're looking for any written help on Saltboxes or Capes. The photos are adequate but the author's attitude toward architects and builders is malevolent 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 Since "Luck Of The Draw" Bonnie Raitt or her record producers have been out to lunch. "Fundamental" sounds like a jam session gone bad. There is  really nothing special on this CD, except for "The Spit Of Love". When are we going to hear a song like "When The Spell Is Broken" again? Bonnie seems to have passed the female blues guitar mantle to Sue Foley and Kris Wiley. Sorry, I'll stick with her old albums 
 Born Confused follows the life of the culture-confused main character, Dimple Lala.  Now I have to say, I know little about Indian cultures, but it seemed to me that Dimple didn't know so much herself. I do have experience with parents, of course, so her parents' reaction when she came home drunk was entirely unrealistic. My huge complaint is that the author portrays getting drunk and stoned as hilarious. The entire story, Dimple keeps saying how she never does anything wrong, but when her best friend says to drink or smoke marijuana she immediately does so, without question. God forbid if she had been told to do anything worse. Please, do not teach teens that smoking grass is a good thing. Is this author out of her mind???  Then, there was the friend, Gwynn, who was no friend at all. She was probably one of the most selfish characters I have ever come across, ex: taking her friend's clothes without asking, divulging her deepest secrets to a total stranger, who just so happens to be the boy she is after while her friend, Dimple, is sitting right there, she throws her best friend aside as soon as she gets a boyfriend, and when the time comes to apologize, she lays it all on Dimple's shoulders. If I had a friend like her I wouldn't stand that kind of treatment, but Dimple did. Even when she confronted Gwynn, nothing seemed to come of it, in my opinion. Dimple was a major pushover, and the ending, although everything is magically resolved in one year in the story, would not be in real life. Dimple was a kind, sympathetic character. She deserved a better friend and a backbone. Also, the author sometimes got carried away with descriptions...  At the moment, I'm having trouble remembering any good points. I think I liked it somewhat at the time I was reading it, but that feeling has left me completely.  Overall: another over-hyped book.  
 This book contains nothing but left-wing talking points that have been thoroughly debunked since its writing. However that's the principle of the Big Lie: Just keep repeating it over and over until it takes on a life of its own and people believe it based merely upon the number of times they've heard it 
 A bought this book before reading the review below, mislead by the title.  What I found out was in half the book a brief descrption of metrics with  recommendations on what to do with them and in the other half, some generic  statements about concepts as customer life value, interviews, lineal  regression and ROI. This book is intended as a recipe book for call centers  management but it falls too much short. If you need to learn more about CC,  then read "Call centers on fast forward". It's a more  comprehensive treatment on them 
 I received the CitriStar juicer, and immediately after opening it, found that, about 25% of the time, the motor would buzz instead of engaging and rotating.   When I called Tribest, they told me firmly that I needed to press down on it using a citrus fruit instead of my hand, and then it would work properly. This turned out to not be true (not surprising, as the juicer does not appear to include sensors and circuitry to insure that the object pressing on it is a citrus juicer instead of, say, a couple of fingers). I called them back, and they said that I could only return it, under warranty, after registering the product. I did this, and called them back yet again. I was then told that they would examine it for possible warranty repair or replacement. When I told them that it was defective right out of the box, and that I did not want a repaired defective item, but a new item, they informed me that they simply don't do exchanges under any circumstances, and that they could not help me. I am currently taking care of this via my credit card company.  The thing is, I really liked the product based on its description, more powerful motor, and so on. If only it worked as advertised, or was cheerfully replaced with one that worked as advertised. Oh well 
 I bought this book because I liked the table of contents.  I assumed this book would present concrete, actionable specifics on the subjects presented in the table of contents.  I was disappointed.  Under information planning, this book only tells you that you should do it.  Gee, thanks.  Under estimating and scheduling - you should estimate future project resources and you should request new resources and fund innovation.  Oh, boy.  Yippee.  This book is an exercise in stating the blatantly obvious.  I expected to see information on the nuts and bolts of producing technical documentation...I expected to see examples of budgets, examples of ways to create efficient systems for document production using single-sourcing, and to see examples of specific, important techniques for planning a document production process that allows for easy translation, revision, re-usability and transfer to different mediums.  I expected to get a reference that would become well-worn on my desk.  This book is as far from such a tome as it could possibly get while still being written in the English language.  I want to improve the efficiency of my documentation projects.  I'd like to know about technologies (XML?, VBA?) that might help me with separating content from layout and improving reusability.  Is that here?  Nope.  But you do get way too much talk about how you should acquire good tools that support your business goals.  There is nothing about what those tools should be or what specifically would make them good.  One page tells you the difference between a "traditional" project and an "agile" project...things like:  An agile project "responds to change" and has "minimal process documentation"  as well as "reduced development schedules".  That's nice.  Who cares?  Implementing a Topic Architecture is the only section that even makes a move in the direction of specific, concrete, useful material.  But even it leaves you thinking, "Well, duh...yathink?"  To sum up, this book tells you all the obvious things you ought to do...but that's it.  It doesn't have anything to say about HOW you would actually do those things.  I doubt the author has the foggiest idea how because I doubt she has a single hard skill to speak of.  She definitely didn't write about any 
 I paid for expedited shipping, but my order took forever!  Communication with the company was unacceptable to say the least.  At first I received only half of my shipping refund and had to complain to Amazon and BestPriceCenter to get the rest.  There is NO way I would ever do business with this company again, and I would like to urge others to do likewise.  This is not personal, just bad business practice 
 Mick Taussig's fetishism with fetishism is shown at new levels in this book.  This pomo work of fantasy is almost a parody of the stupidity with which anthropology has retreated from a world inhabited by real people with real problems to a never ending exercise in self exploration.  This book shows Taussig to care only about himself and his whims in ways betraying not only his own narcissism, but that of contemporary anthropology as it praises such self important musings while ignoring the voices of other cultures. 
 I could only get to page 17 before I threw it into the trash. It was given to me by a neighbor so it was free.  Too expensive even at that price!!!! 
 I agree with many of the other reviewers about this book.  It's not something newlywed couples should read, and certainly not married couples experiencing intimacy problems.  The tone of the book is very offensive and even anti-sex at times.  It gives you a complex about sex and possibly crossing some "line" which the author refuses to actually draw.  Sex is treated as a selfish thing, and being selfish is a sin.  The book is especially degrading of women and their needs.  For example, it talks about orgasm with a kind of disdain, something "unecessary" that you shouldn't bother aiming for.  It has a kind of "oh, that's overrated" attitude towards orgasm and the female's pleasure in general.  If she doesn't experience it at all or with any frequency, i.e. not satisfied, eh, that's ok, no big deal.  And same for the guy.  Satisfaction doesn't "just" come from orgasm.    The book will ultimately cause you problems.  I can't see it helping anybody with much of anything.  It makes you feel selfish about doing anything and will bind you down with worries and make you feel guilty for trying to find solutions to problems that exist or ones that might come up 
 And I do mean REALLY STUPID. Like a previous reviewer, I bought this to keep me occupied on a long flight. When, within the first 20 or so pages, the author introduces two made-up gimmicks that are central to the plot, I knew I was in trouble. First up is a liquid nuclear explosive. Yeah, right. Anyone who even slept through high school physics would know that's a crock. Then there is the super oxygen carrying blood transfusion that gets the major bad guy through an execution. In a science fiction story, the spare use of such gimmicks might be ok. But here the author uses them because he just isn't bright enough to come up with a good story otherwise.     Had I been on a train trip, this book would have gone right out the train window. However, they frown on opening windows on airplanes so I just left it on the plane. I probably should have taken it off with me and tossed it in the trash to save the next passanger in my seat from having to deal with this 
 I have been a fan of Sue Henry since her first Jessie Arnold mystery.  I was looking forward to reading her lastest adventure, but was very disappointed in this outing.  The characters were one-dimensional.  After discovering who the "bad guys" were I needed to reread part of the book for clarification.  Sue Henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end of many of her chapters.  "...they hadn't a notion just how decidedly things could - and would - change in the next few hours."  Even the relationship between Alex and Jessie seemed stilted.  I realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries for a civilian like musher Jessie Arnold, but this book tried too hard and accomplished too little 
 I have been studying gambling for 10 years now and I have found that some of Victors methods are very dangerous. In one book he gives some roulette systems. Some of these methods require you to climb your betting into the thousands. Not only that, but they increase as you lose. One system has you betting a 10 step on thirds. Ive seen one third of the wheel not hit for over 15 times in a row quite often. I went to a land casino and tried his big secret in craps to the letter. I kept getting hardways on the comeout when the hardways werent working and when my hardways were working, I was getting a blizzard of seven outs. I went to two other tables all the while keeping my place in the system trying to shake the bad streak, but my money lost kept escalating to the point where even if I did hit a hardway or two, it didnt help me recoop my money. I ended up dropping 2 grand and wasnt to happy about it. Victor will no doubt answer this review because this review will impact his book sales, but look at his books for yourself while standing in a bookstore. Then purchase Frank Scoblete's books and save yourself some money. I believe that Vic might be working with the casinos. They love his systems. Good luck and good gambling 
 I dont recommend this book.  If you are currently hasseling with the big 3 credit bureaus, this book will inform you only of your rights.  It doesnt tell you how to utilize them..I recommend Quick and Legal Credit Repair 4th Edition by Robin Leonard.  I have used her previous version and I have gotten results 
 this book is only small, the larger book is much better and contains all the information from this one 
 It wasn't clear that this was a book on "classical" horsemanship printed in 1965.  The 1/2 dozen illustrations were poorly drawn/designed.  I was under the impression from the other reviews that this would be a good book for beginners learning to ride horses.  This book was translated into British English from Germany or Russia.  A native American Indian could teach horsemanship much better than this guy 
 I didn't expect this series of books to be laid out the way they are. I am disappointed that the "notes" are simply a glorified glossary arranged by chapter rather than alphabetical. Key points from the book are not bulleted or organized based on content presentation, rather key terms are defined and that is all. 
 I give this book 2 stars because I did find it entertaining to read. It was not one of those boring books that I have to struggle to finish. I liked that it was set very close to where I live and I knew a lot of places mentioned. I also admired that the author tried to understand the mind of a young woman- a man writing from a female viewpoint seems to be rare.  The ending was disappointing, because it seemed kind of canned. All of the sudden everyones families are reconciled, everyone gets off drugs, etc. Tracy gets back with her first boyfriend, who seems to be a gigantic loser, and it's written like it's good. But what really irritated me about the ending was all the racism. Here is my summary: Tracy lives in the ghetto, makes it her goal to be the coolest, uses guys for status, trades sex for bling, realizes there's more to life, then suddenly she becomes enlightened once she becomes proud to be African-American. That's just great, except in this book, being proud of being African-American basically means hating white people and blaming them for everything. It would be understandable if there were even some white characters in the book that mistreated her or her friends, but being that there were virtually no white characters at all, this seems ridiculous and a cheap shot.  Among many other racist comments, she said something about how Africans invented things like vegetarianism and were civilized "while white people were still clubbing each other over the head." Imagine if a white author wrote something like that about blacks. They would be labeled racist and never hear the end of it.  Omar Tyree is hypocritical if he is going to complain of white racism and yet have so many comments like that. (Maybe the characters don't reflect his views, but since so many characters said them, I'm pretty sure they are his views.) He should get over his racial issues. A lot of young people have read this book and adore it, so think of what kind of message this gives them 
 I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you have nothing else to do for the night and want to watch it alone. Due to a high content of bad words, screaming and violence, it's kind of embarrassing watching it with someone else. Some people really enjoyed it, and that's not me, and that's not the other two people I know who watched it. Some violent parts are a bit hard to believe, but I guess that's what the story is about. This movie is a bit of a hollywood-style suspense, with rather cheesy college scenes that are common to comedies.   There's one good idea in this movie and that's how life develops as it goes along, and one action or inaction changes how life plays out. But this is no where near original, even the Simpsons had an episode like that.   So, this movie is definitely not on my best movies list. 
 This book is not awful.  But it is not a replacement for Strunk and White's Elements of Style.  Elements of Style has many advantages-- It's clear, it's short and the direction can steer no one wrong.  Adios, by contrast, is a long, dense book, and might do for helping established students or writers, but is simply too large for a beginner to use.  With the Elements in place, a writer can go forth and choose his or her own path.  The authors of this book seem to be informed by television and video games and the magic of computers and miss the fact that good writing is good writing, no matter what the flavor of the month in popular culture might be. I have taught writing, and I would no more use this book to teach writing than I would throw typewriters at my students to teach them typing.  I had high hopes for this book, expectations that were not met.  If nothing else, this book serves to show that The Elements of Style is still a valuable tool for the modern writer, one that remains useful and the first book of choice to turn to when looking for a beginning guide to writing 
 I purchased this script with the intent of directing it as a high school play. Our high school has done many productions of children's stories and almost always receives a positive response, so I was not worried about the content of the play being too infantile. But this play was adapted from the original book to be performed by a group of 6th graders. The age group it was intended for shows blatantly. After reading through it and reflecting on the play as a whole, I decided that it was pretty lame. Now, I'm not trying to impugn Mr. George's adaptation. On the contrary, I commend him for taking the initiative to put so much work into adapting a story like this for the stage. But I wouldn't dare try to put this play on the stage of a high school theatre, or anything at all, unless it is done with all children cast members or done for an all children audience 
 I come here to buy items from Amazon, decent prices, great shipping, ease of use, but lately more and more items such as this are coming from other companies.  I have no problem with this other than the fact there is no indication of this anytime during the transaction.  It took a non-delivery for me to find out, now I'm forced to go chase Macy's around to find out where my order is.  Out of protest for the ever increasingly poor service and deceptive item listings I am not making any more purchases through Amazon for the rest of 2006.  It'll be much easier to just goto the other site in the first place than deal with order issues by way of proxy 
 There should be a note in the description somewhere that you will be unable to PRINT any worksheets from the workbook.  What good is a workbook that you CANNOT WORK in???  And I can't even get my money back.  I am completely unsatisfied 
 Usually things I read don't bother me, no matter how absurd or disgusting they are. I'm an English major, and I've read enough to not be shocked by much. But then there comes The Old Gringo. What shocks me about The Old Gringo isn't really the events of the plot. As far as a story goes, this is just pretty dull and wouldn't offend. The writing, however, is shocking. I don't know if it's the translation or what, but there is some really absurd writing in here. The guy actually wrote the following image (I'm recalling this sentence, but I know this is still pretty accurate): "Arroyo's testicles were like furry little avocados." This isn't even the dumbest image in the book. The sex scenes throughout are similarly hilarious. Fuentes writes half of the book about sex, and the terms he describes it in are either cliched or are as laughable as the avacado image.   Anyway, I'm giving this book two stars because, even though the writing made me cringe when I read it, it makes me laugh now. There are probably a few things in the book that are profound, too. But I generally can't remember them for all the absurdity throughout 
 According to my online purchase records, I bought Fear and Trembling nearly 4 years ago, probably on impulse because Amazon had recommended it to me.  I have just now, this evening, managed to finish it.  Considering that the book is only 132 small pages of large type, maybe as long as a short story in the New Yorker, the fact that it has taken me this many years to make my way through it should tell you a lot about how dull this narrative is.  The book has practically no plot, no suspense whatsoever, and all the depth and insight of a 22-year-old working in her first job at a large corporation.  Why the two stars?  It is not incoherent, and it is sort of interesting to read the narrator's misconception that somehow her experiences are worth writing about.  I can imagine that this book, in its original French, might make a good assignment for a second-year college course in the language for non-native speakers.  At least in the English edition I bought, there is plenty of margin space for a student to make notes 
 After reading five of her novels, I have become a fan of Jodi Picoult. I will admit (and this probably proves that I am a sucker for marketing rather than letting the literature speak for itself) that I've deliberately read all of her best sellers before reading the books that didn't make it on the list.   Initially I liked the book and it kept me reading, though maybe just out of habit. I enjoyed reading about the Amish way of life and the Amish traditions - though it did make me think of that Harrison Ford movie, Witness (circa 1989 or something). I like that she used one first person voice as well as the third person narrative in a well crafted and varied way.  I like that her main character has a powerful job that challenges gender stereotypes by being the morally questionable lawyer. That being said, she doesn't explore this as well as she could. We sort of forget that Ellie has blatantly suppressed evidence and watched as little girls saw their rapist acquitted. Rape, she can defend, but infanticide creates some problems for the notorious defense attorney.   Something about the book bothered me. Maybe I am reading too many of her books too fast but I am seeing a formula here.  - Many of her plots include a court room drama.  - All of her plots feature romance or end with the obvious potential for one.  - Mothers and their powerful (all encompassing, self-sacrificing) love for their children are a theme in all of her books I've read.  - There is usually a "twist" at the end. She's becoming Koontz like in her formulaic predictability and I stopped reading his novels as a teenager.  Most of her books left me content, like I'd eaten a good, hearty meal. However, this book left me hungry and searching for critical reviews to see if others shared my dissatisfaction.   So: - I was unimpressed with the "twist" at the end of this one - I knew "whodunit" about 1/2 of the way through. I was getting bored with that part of the story. The red herrings are too obvious and her suggestions that Katie didn't do it were there from the beginning. She should've stopped the heavy handed attempt to make us question that and just made it known through the 3 person narrative exactly who did the killing or hiding. Then she could have explored that character in depth instead of hiding her and others she wanted you to be suspicious about. Just because we, the readers knew, didn't mean that Ellie had to know - or anyone else for that matter.   - The characters in this novel were a tad generic. I am sorry, I like her, but they were boring.   For instance, I was bored with Ellie's dilemma over Coop - to the point where I often skipped the interaction they had when they discussed their potential future together. Duh, I knew they were going to get together after a little drama from Ellie through which Coop - being the quintessential "sensitive ponytail guy" - would wait, albeit in pain. It was just too predictable.  Hannah's ghost; she has a ghost hunter in a later novel and I was a disappointed to see another one. But other than that, Hannah's ghost seems a bizarre and meaningless addition. Is it to suggest that she, Katie, might be crazy and a murderer? Is it to explain why she was so drawn to Adam? Katie being the good Amish girl could only fall for someone who could share her secret ability to see her sister... In a book that is so Amishly pragmatic and logical in every other way makes it so the supernatural element clashes with the rest of the novel. Maybe Hannah's ghost killed Katie's baby or hid it.  I liked the details. The Amish and their daily lives, those who assimilate and those who don't, and how the religion and way of life affect one's thinking offers a neat, un-scholarly insight into a different culture. I liked the culture clashes and I wondered how they would be resolved. But what I did like, doesn't measure against my dissatisfaction.  My most recent book purchase included three works of fiction; two by Picoult and one by Atwood. I think I'll shelve the unread Picoult for a while. I'll have some time to forget her modus operandi. I'll read the Atwood and then I'll buy a book by a different author 
 This book was a complete waste of money for me.  Not only that, but I didn't even feel right about reselling it, so I threw it away.  The author picked apart the Old Testament, saying the gospels are the only part of the bible to believe.  He also talked about "Hell" as being a "realm" where the spirits of people who died were full of hate. He did not mention the fact that there is a real hell with fire, anguish and complete separation from God awaiting those who do not accept Jesus as their savior. He also said many other things that were way off.  I have heard so many stories of after death experiences that all agreed, making them believable.  However, his description wasn't even similar to the others.  I was very disappointed.  
 Every once in a while, a management guru or academician writes a book so idealistic and simple in its basic premise that it appeals to scholars and businesspeople alike solely for the inherent beauty in its simplicity. Much like the appeal of fairy tales or biographies. No fuss, no complexity, no crooked lines. But whereas this way of storytelling is charming when describing a lifelong career or the fate of princess or princesses, it becomes downright repulsive when applied to modern business and economics. Not only repulsive, but also dangerous.  Jensen is learned and a fine raconteur at that, which he uses to his advantage in this book. The basic premise, that corporations of today are selling stories instead of products is intriguing, if not completely original (Pine & Gilmore described the progression of economic offerings towards experience and entertainment in their 1999 book "The Experience Economy"). Had Jensen stayed within the boundaries of a conventional management book, i.e. simplified descriptions and corporate nice-to-know facts, The Dream Society would have been a fair effort, if slightly trivial. The big misstep that Jensen makes is that he, like too many other colleagues, starts to add a philantrophical aspect to his ideas. Not only can the striving towards a dream society be applied to goods and services, but also on the modern family, on the third world, on modern labour, globalization, urbanization etc. In fact, so amazing is Jensens Dream paradigm that there is no area or phenomenon that is left unexplored. Actually, "unexplored" is an inaccurate description. There is no area that Jensen doesn't beleaguer with his newly found buzzword-baby. That's where the book sets off on thin ice. To fully explore a principle, such as "The Dream Society", one must look at its flaws and dangers. The term "fundamentalist" is what we use to describe the people that don't and instead take the written word as the formula to follow. Jensen displays similar dogma and fanaticism in his belief that The Dream Society is our goal and destiny. As he runs astray from the description of economic offerings, he looses the integrity that he displays in the early chapters of the book, his "succesful" attempts to apply the theory to, well, anything become more comical... and questionable 
 Even though we in America have peace and a booming economy, Bill Clinton does not deserve all the credit as many want to give him.  A truly great president leads in times of struggle and disarray. Before George Bush was  considered the worst president ever by so many, he had fantastic approval  ratings because he earned them.  He also led us through a war and a  recession.  But many would just claim he was the cause for these problems.   Bill Clinton just inherited peacetime and an improving economy and  considers himself to be a wonderful president.  Its a shame he will be  remembered by so many as a great president who supposedly brought on peace  and a healthy economy when it really was the work of so many decent, moral  Americans 
 This pre-911 "book" is laughably outdated.  Too much has changed since it was written.  You'd be much better off finding sources on the web. If you go into the interview with this archaic information, you're going to get killed in the interview 
 I enjoyed ric's other book "The truth about money", and decided to purchase this book as well.  Firstly, for someone who is looking for a tactical plan and something i can excute upon, this books provides very little help.  Only the last few chapter provided some relevant information, the rest of the book was focusing on the inspire readers to invest, not exactly what i looking for.  Secondly, a lot of the information is a rehash of the truth about money.  I do like ric like a financial advisor, but wouldn't recommend this boo 
 I think this book was too confusing to read, but it had a lot of good information about Benedict Arnold. The book was too confusing because the events in the book changed a lot and it was hard for me to remember the names and the time. Since I haven't learned much about the history of America I find this book boring. I'm not an American, so I only learned part of its history. The author's writing is like she is telling a story about Benedict Arnold, so she didn't really say that Benedict Arnold was a bad guy or anything like that. One good part about this book is that it tells the events in order like from when Benedict was a child to when he died. So that wasn't too confusing. I know some books that had all the events mixed up.  If you like books about history and heroes in the past then I suggest you read this book.  I suggest you read this book because Jean Fritz is a pretty good writer, and she wrote many good books 
 I was excited to find a book about preconception but this particular book was a huge disappointment. It covered the facts- that's it. The material was dry and boring and nothing I haven't read already before. By the time I finally reached the end, still in hopes of something helpful, I got to the actual "conception" part- one slim chapter. Awful!! If you are truly stupid this book may be perfect for you. Huge waste of money. 
 If I had the option of zero stars, I would have put that.  It says to "clean often" and you'll know why.  It may filter the smoke as it goes in, but it leaves a disgusting smell on the lid. I used it one time, for one cigarette and put it back in the box. The lid smelled so bad it was permeating the room. Looks cool, promising theory with the smoke filtration, but an absolute waste of money 
 Don't get me wrong, I LOVED this movie! And I'm a big fan of Tim Burton and his visuals. But this book doesn't accentuate either of the above. The illustrations are not very exciting and the book lacks tons of actual still photos and behind the scenes shots. At least I got it for free. I was hoping for something similar to the Bram Stoker's Dracula book that came out shortly after that film. That book and script was exceptional and captured the full beauty of the movie. This one (though the script is included) does not do the same. A shame because I love this film 
 This is the second book about a group of four best friends who go their separate ways for a summer, keeping in touch through writing and passing along a shared pair of jeans.  The characters in this story were likable.  I enjoyed reading the story from the various points of view.  I liked the ways the four girls supported each other through hard times.  However, I found much of the story to be utterly predictable.  From the moment I started reading, I could tell exactly how Tibby's experience at the summer program and her adoration for the "cool" kids would turn out.  I also knew what would happen when Bee tracked down her grandmother.  Carmen's mother's relationship followed an equally predictable arc.  Although the characters were good, I found the story lines too dull to really sustain my interest 
 This book is very boring. It is more like reading philosophy than a novel 
 i got this fryer only yesterday i fryed some chicken wings and french fries the fries came out with so much oil and cooked for 10 min for a small batch i have been frying for about 10 years and know how to cook very well and i have to say this is just as bad as frying on the stove. i put the oil to the max fill line and with cooking the two things the oil went down to the min line do not buy. 
 I honestly hate Kidz Bop. I mean, Avril Lavigne is my favorite singer, and My Happy Ending is too good of a song to be wrecked by Kidz Bop. I mean, I sing in the shower better then these kids! Don't buy it. Borrow it from the library if you must. 
 This is a soap opera that either wants to be literature, or was marketed as literature. It's a romance novel. Many people over a period of many years fall in love, get married, have affairs, grow up, grow old, and have children of their own. Though the characters are scientists, their crushes and affairs are no different from any others' (the book jacket says it's about "inner lives of smart people"). Regrets are a large part of their lives, though only one or two characters are well-drawn enough to be interesting and induce sympathy, and they have a terrible habit of not taking action when they can and want to. Large editing problems render this clearly a first novel, though I give it two stars for the apparent effort put into it 
 This book is terrible.  The lists are disappointingly incomplete and inconsequential.  For example:  A list on tipping includes tips for restroom attendants, but it omits tips for valet parking.  In my life, I have used valet parking significantly more often than a restroom attendant.  A list of common foreign phrases omits pronunciations.  How useful is that?  Knowing the spelling of a phrase does one no good during conversation should the pronunciation of a phrase be very different from its spelling.  Basically, if one had been raised by kindly wolves in the forest, and recently dropped into modern society, this book might be marginally useful.  But anyone with a modicum of planning or forethought would have outgrown this trite little waste of words and paper by age 10 
 This book is not for the beginner and it is harder and more confusing than necessary. Also it is somewhat stiff in the overall tone. There are better, easier and more complete books out there 
 I'm fascinated by the rave reviews for this text. I used it for a community college stats course and once I was in the classroom with it, I became aware that I had some problems. It is true that it's written in a friendly style and has plenty of exercises, but I found it to be poor preparation for my students who will be going on to higher levels of statistics in behavioral science courses.  I found myself explaining, more times than I wish to recall, how formulas look different in other statistics books, and I was disconcerted at the lack of use of symbols that one usually sees in beginning statistics courses. Simple terms most commonly used in statistics were not introduced at all, and most statistical tests were not mentioned. Many students found it to be cumbersome and a bit overwhelming.   It's my own fault, really. I did not spend enough time perusing texts. And my familiarity with statistics prevented me, when looking it over, from realizing how much was really missing. I realized that my students would enter bachelor's programs lacking some very basic information that is always used in statistics for the behavioral sciences. Most of my students plan to earn graduate degrees; I had to spend quite a bit of time preparing notes for them as well as lectures explaining formulas, symbols, and terminology that "some of" their higher courses might use. And with nary a mention of ANOVA or any other higher level tests, I felt I really had done my students a disservice.  I began to wonder - have I been out of school so long that things have changed this much and I'm not aware of it? But - as I am teaching at a state college, stats texts started trickling in from other publishers. I saw that it was not me. This massive text, costing my students $120, is lacking quite a bit that they should be exposed to - to better prepare them for future statistics studies in the behavioral sciences. This was certainly a bitter lesson for me! I had to waste far too much time putting together information that was missing just so my students would have the course they should have.  I recommend Sally Caldwell's text, "Statistics Unplugged" for beginning students - at least in behavioral sciences programs. It's a third the cost, a third the SIZE, and much more reader-friendly. And it contains the information that I had to supply to my students just so they would get what they paid for.   I do not recommend this book. I'll certainly be much more careful in future when choosing textbooks 
 I normally like warm, sensual-type perfumes, but I wanted to try something different for a change.  I liked the fact that this is advertised as subtle and not perfumey.  Well...I have to disagree.  I think it is VERY perfumey and not subtle at all. To me it has a very sharp, high-toned scent which is almost acrid. I thought at first that maybe I had sprayed too much on, so I tried just a little spritz.  Still VERY strong and sharp. And I agree with the comparison to dead flowers and dryer sheets.  I will definitely not be ordering this again.  
 I just cant warm up to anything on this album. It reminds me of some of the NewAge stuff back in the 80s mixed with some of the candy rock of the time. Like George Winston's piano on "Winter" where the pauses between the notes added meaning. It seems Gilmour was playing with the space between the notes. Definitely not the space between his ears. If you like this try Jean Michelle Jarre or Kitaro. They do a much better job. Lord knows I've tried to listen to MLOR and Division Bell but PF truely died with the parting of Waters. This is just retire money for Gilmour or he as gone by way of Sid Barrett. 
 Generic, overproduced, commercial, mediocre emo. It's the pedal they use to make their non-distorted guitar parts sound like synths that I really hate. If you want to make synth music, play a synth. If you're going to play guitar, use it like a guitar, don't process it through an effect so you can make the most insipidly soothing and palatable sounds you possibly can, because the sound of an actual guitar is too abrasive for your wussy prettyboy ears. This band's existance disgusts me. 
 I read the other review about this book. I dont understand how reader enjoy the book. its boring, many twisted plots is unnessery, the end is little surpising but not convincing at all. I read the book 10 days and I just wait to see where the book will become interesting- its not happen. I never feel so boring in reading a book. This is my second book of deaver. I read the vanished man and I very enjoy but this book was inferior.  Maybe one thing in the book was enjoyable and this is the descriptions of Deaver- like the description of the childhood of  Hrubek and of Lis- this was touching and maybe this give me the fews moments of enjoy in the book 
 The Web Design department of the career college I am an instructor and program coordinator at have used this text for several years now as the primary text for a web project management class. The problem with this book is that it sets the bar too high from the beginning and only applies if one finds themseleves a project manager handling huge corporate website accounts. It is impossible to scale the tone of the book down to explain the process when dealing with individuals and small businesses when the book has you only "wearing one hat" when sometimes you have to wear them all. It's also terribly boring to read, which makes it impossible to gain any understanding from it.This is an old book, in great need of an update. There are much more current and interesting books out there now that handle the same topic, and do it well. This may have been the first book of its kind, but it's certainly not the greatest 
 I first purchased the blue Shark Cordless sweeper which did not swivel. one day the cheap plastic connector where the handle bar meets the vac broke off. This was less than 30 days after I purchased it and honestly, I had used it about 4 or 5 times in that short period, simply for the tile floor in the kitchen.   When I went to return it at the local store, I saw the Shark 3 Speed version which swivels. I did an exchange and shelled out another $20 bucks thinking that maybe this one would be better since the 3 speed version swivels. SHAME ON ME! It took only about 20 days to break the handle in the same spot on this one. I was turning the handle to manuver around a corner and hit the corner with the edge of the Shark and off broke the handel in the SAME SPOT! I would be honest to tell you if I had really slammed the vac hard against the corner but that is not the case at all. I returned it and got my money back ... no exchange this time.    
 Marked Expert Edition, the outrageous techniques demonstrated in The Joint Rolling Handbook are complex and require a bigger attention span than the average stoner has.  Even not stoned, the instructions were difficult to understand.  If you're looking for practical methods and easy rolling instructions this isn't the book for you.  If you already know how to roll joints and have a crafty hand, maybe it is.  Most of the convincingly illustrated creations like the windmill and the nose cone require multiple papers, many of which will be cut up for the gummed strip used to "bandage" together joints and long tubular roaches until they resemble a smokable jumble of tinker toys quite likely to end up burning a hole in your rug.  Intermingled with the individual joint instructions are a few sections offering information on marijuana itself, laws, health risks, etc 
 Really boring and some of the author's words were more confusing than any mathematical equation. I was very disappointed with this one 
 Although New Order was uneven even before this one (Brotherhood is full of mediocre filler, and Low-Life has some bad stuff), the consistent quality of Technique created high expectations for the next record.  This record didn't have even one song that I cared for, and I gave the CD away. New Order's best records, in my estimation are: Power Corruption and Lies, Movement, and Technique. All three are very different, but consistently great throughout 
 I, like so many other's, was stupid enough to buy this guide not realising the mystery's within. I still havnt got %100 thanks to this guide and can say now that i will never buy a Bradly guide again.   Everything is all mixed up in there,(Locations of all inportant things such as Horseshoes, tags ect) there must of been no proof reading what so ever... SO I SUGGEST TO EVERYONE, DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF... ...GUIDE 
 Bought this housing new in November 2005.In April I used it for the first time and it flooded on the first dive! Neither Amazon (since it is ouside the 30 day return policy) nor Canon will stand behind this product! Period! I got so much run around from Canon it was ridiculous. They wanted to "evaluate" the housing to determine if it was defective...DAH? They WOULD NOT tell me if I sent it back for the "evaluation" what the final resolution would be (refund, rework etc).   Coincidentally, another person on the same trip had the same housing...it flooded on their first dive too!!!! Coincidence? No. Just terrible quality control and NO product support from Canon. DO NOT BUY CANON PRODUCTS!! 
 I got roped into listening to this because it appeared on the Virgin "Top 100 Albums Ever" poll. I'd always thought "Runaway" was a nice tune, sounding like Wilson-Phillips with their Irish cousins helping out. The Corrs peddle a sort of lite Celtic pop with English lyrics. Unfortunately, too little time seems to be spent on the words. ("Queen of Hollywood" is particularly abysmal, a cliche about the small-town girl who's out to take Tinseltown by storm.)   The Irish band has been popular elsewhere on the globe but not Stateside. With this album, the tunes on the original TALK ON CORNERS are remixed to try and lend more pop appeal for the American market. (The band's big U.S. breakthrough wouldn't come until "Breathless" on followup disc IN BLUE).  HIGHLIGHTS: "Runaway" doesn't stray too far from the original and its still a nicely lilting mid-tempo number with a fair amount of Celtic influence. While I don't like it as well as the Cranberries' cover, their take on Fleetwood Mac's "Dreams" is also decent with a dance floor cast given to it. It's listenable but nothing that really remakes the song their own.  LOWS: "Queen of Hollywood" and the pretentious pathos of "When he's Not Around" are easily the disc's nadirs. Hendrix cover "Little Wing" also fails, not because I feel the band commits musical sacrilege but because they can't choose a direction. It can't decide if it wants to be a smooth jazz retool or a Celtic re-interpretation (wasting some nice arrangement efforts by the Chieftains' Paddy O'Reilly because of the dilly-dallying).  BOTTOM LINE: C'mon..couldn't people really have come up with something better to hail as one of the 100 finest recorded pieces of music ever 
 I thought the original was pretty good, but this sequel was pure torture to watch! I'de rather eat a giant roach, than watch this movie again! Without question, one of the worst comedys ever written 
 Albert Pyun is my absolute least favorite director. I hate his guts. His direction ruined "Cyborg" and was murky in "Omega Doom." This is his best flick, and it's not that good. In fact, it pales in comparison to the so-so original. Sasha Mitchell is highly entertaining in this sequel that is certainly watchable, but highly forgettable. The villain from the first, Tong Po, has returned after killing the Sloan brothers from the first movie. Now, he's out to redeem his honor by fighting little brother David Sloan. Standard martial arts fare. Some choppy fight scenes, but an interesting main character saves this picture from otherwise becoming complete dreck 
 How Germaine Greer came to be an authority on Shakespeare, I'll never know. Actually, I can't believe people are still writing about this guy at all 
 all non-yellow parts of the ducks are painted and come off pretty easily. a little moisture and some teeth for a minute can remove paint.  this toy is best for those who are past placing toys or anything in their mouth. I still think they are cute and a great idea...just need to be made better/safer 
 Don't let the fact that this book is edited by two men fool you. This book treats white, heterosexual men as sadistic oppressors and is driven by a women's studies/feminist and sometimes Marxist agenda.   You can get the complete summary of the book from this quote contained in it: "Heterosexual men maintain their status by the oppression of gay men; middle-aged men can maintain their dominance over older and younger men; upper-class men can exploit working-class men,; and white men can enjoy priviledges at the expense of men of color."  (I am not sure here whether a middle aged gay man dominates a young heterosexual, but I digress...)  If you want to find a positive image of (non-gay) men it is not here.   Articles include (with a quote from each article):   Men on Rape , "Rape may be America's fastest growing violent crime; no one can be certain because it is not clear whether more rapes are being committed or reported." (uh, so therefore let's just assume it is true as a basis for the article...)  Getting Off on Feminism, "There has to be a difference between being straight and being a breeder. And breeding is just one of the many assumptions that our culture applies to male heterosexuality." (Written by a feminist male who is really much too worried about what all his feminist pals think of him)  Life Styles of Gay Husbands and Fathers, no quote. A balanced article about the experiences of males who figure out they're gay after being married and having children. This book has a very high gay to straight ratio in articles however that overstates the prevalence of homosexuality among men.  Fraternities and the College Rape Culture, "A rape culture is strengthened by rules that permit alcohol only at fraternity parties. Under this system, men control the parties and dominate the men as well as the women that attend." (This actually was an evenly balanced article that focused on how to structure organizations and events to reduce the potentiality of rape)  The Fathers' Rights Movement: Contradictions in Rhetoric and Practice, "Indeed, fathers want to play a role in their children's lives, but for most, that role is merely a continuation of their predivorce role of the traditional father who exercises his power and control." (the "but for most" helps the authors dismiss my anecdotal evidence of being a single parent. Note we can say "single mother" easily and understandably but "single father" requires explanation so we have to resort to "single parent".)  The grammatical errors in the quotes are from the book and are not typos.   Some articles use made up statistics, gross generalities, and outright distortions to make their point. Many of the articles are balanced in and of themselves but, taken as a whole collection in this book, present a distorted view of "Men's Lives."  
 What kind of masterpiece is this supposed to be?  Psuedo-Dickensonian language that drags you down like old mud. The "colorful" characters are all steriotypes: pure good or pure evil, (or pure dumb in the case of the hero), drawn from some 19th century grab bag.  And the plot ... god I hate plots that rely upon the endless stupidity of their protaganist to drive them onward.  The plot ... nothing happens except in responce to some idiotic action by the main character. If the man, (well kid ... I admit that I could not stick it out enough pages for the little brat to grow up) had the sense and self preservation instinct of an intelligent spaniel there would be no story 
 If you have never read any of Sylvia Browne's book, don't start with this one. There is a lot of material in this book that refers back to other books.  
 After reading reviews from readers on this site I was excited about enlighting my knowledge on the male and female "goods", but found myself bored within the first couple of chapters.  The so called doc - constantly kills the interest with one liners that leave you yearning for nothing.  She desperately tries to appear witty and experienced only to come off as a preformance anxiety filled writer(2-3 stars at best).  The physical layout of the book is a desk top publishing nightmare - with the margins so far in on all sides to give minimal words per page, yet streching the length of the book (perhaps an attempt of overconpensation, hehe).  This book had huge potential and its a shame a better writer didn't grasp the idea between his/her hands before Hamilton.  I'm guessing if you are easily entertained and you've got 20+ bucks to spare, then this would be a good book.  Other wise, spend the money on your significant other and learn about the curiosities first hand 
 I thought that this book was a realy slow pase. I liked how they tied the beginning to the end and how everyone thought he was crazy. It is sad about the death that goes on durring the storie. The one thing that bugged me  about this book was that you never finf out the boys name who is the one  telling about the book. It is hard to write about someone when you don't  know his name. oh well, it was an ok book, my class thought that it was  slow too 
 First of all, I didn't think the book was very well written - it needed much tighter editing.  Many points are repeated over and over again, and I found several typos.  It is also heavily aimed at Americans with poor diets.  However, I did it, although I had to go to 3 doctors to find someone who would prescribe the necessary drugs, and then only reluctantly.  I have just finished 6 months on it and am going to stop now.  It has helped none of my health problems, and I have in fact had new fungal rashes develop while I was doing it.  The food restrictions make it very hard to lead a normal social life.  According to his questionnaires, I am a prime candidate for candidiasis, but this treatment did not make any difference.  No harm in trying it, but don't put too much hope into it 
 Just sad and bad poetry. This is the kind of stuff that middle school kids write. I can only guess that those who praise Boof's literary "work" are in fact praising her political positions. 
 I find it interesting that such a supposedly important and relevant contemporary work has only been reviewed by 11 people at the time of this writing. That alone tells you all you need to know since this is a book that is classed under both Latino and Women's Studies, and is part of many university literary programs.   The book is pretentious claptrap of the worst kind. If this book were judged on its merits rather than by popular, politically correct notions, it wouldn't come close to making the cut.  Alas, academia has embraced the book as a great work, and so it is required reading for an English M.A. program at a major university that I was accepted into. An English M.A.! Once I saw that this book was part of the program, I didn't even bother registering.  I don't mind rants against social, cultural and economic injustices. I've read many. But Ms. Anzaldua is no James Baldwin, that's for sure.    
 This book did start out very readable, however it soon became clear that some traits he considered "jerky" had no basis in harming another person but rather failed to meet up to his personal religious code.  He continues on in various worksheets to give "jerk points" for not measuring up as a Christian.    The author also takes pretty much every opportunity to shamelessly plug his personal businesses.  It's like watching a movie and having a Pepsi can zoomed in on every few minutes.    I really think it is a good template for a book, if the author could have done it from a neutral and respectful viewpoint religiously speaking (or clearly labelled it as a religious self-help book), and left out the self-promotion.   
 First, and most importantly, the server doesn't keep the coffee hot. It does not have a glass thermal lining (I should have known to look for that feature before I purchased this product.)After a half hour in the server, the coffee is lukewarm and I have to reheat it in the microwave.  Secondly, the screw-on top has some features that seem to serve no purpose - a button on top that I assume is intended to release the vacuum so the coffee can be poured out.  It doesn't work, you have to loosen the lid itself. Also, the lid comes apart into several pieces for cleaning I guess.  But it collects coffee inside the hollow lid and then that coffee dribbles all over the place.  
 Our entire book club disliked this book. We had a hard time feeling a connection to the characters. Howard, the largest presence in this story, feels like a blank at the core. Upon putting this book down, his motivations and what might be in his heart were still a mystery to me. Characters such as Jerome, Victoria, and Carl were intriguingly introduced, but then inconsistently treated for the rest of the text. Especially Carl - he just disappears - no resolution to his story at all. As am homage to Howard's End, some of the parallels were not strongly enough underscored to flesh out this book for me. For example, the heart-to-heart connection between Kiki Belsey and Carlene Kipps does not jump off the page at you the way the connection between Margaret Schlegel and Mrs. Wilcox did.   I thought Zora was one of the most interesting characters, and I like how Smith contrasted her obviously high intelligence and intellectual arrogance with her social awkwardness and sexual insecurity. But Smith makes her smug a bit too often, and so feeling a connection with Zora is difficult as well - most of the time I just wanted to smack her. And I have to agree with the others that Smith needs to brush up on her American characterizations. There was next to no authenticity in that regard. Especially the Southern dialogue - laughable!  It also feels like Smith had a hard time figuring out how to end this book...I understand that end is supposed to be a beginning of sorts...but the fact that there were so many plot threads left dangling, unresolved, by the last page just gave me a feeling of incomplete-ness.   Aaaargh...must go and re-read Howard's End to dispell the queasy feeling left by On Beauty 
 WARNING: SPOILERS   Zora (Sanaa Lathan) is an aspiring singer and song-writer recently moved to Brooklyn.  She meets Franklin (Wesley Snipes) a  carpenter as she is moving in to her newly renovated brownstone. Sparks fly between the two and they quickly wind up in bed.  This movie is pretty standard up to this point and then we learn more about the characters.  We find out Franklin is married (though separated), has two children (but rarely pays child support) and has not managed to finish high school (though he is well-spoken and can play a mean game of Scrabble).    Now for some women the breaking point to a relationship  with a guy would be finding out he is married with two kids.  In this movie?  No way.  Instead when Zora, a woman we think is intelligent, finds out these things about Franklin she is initially upset but quickly "gets over it" and even invites "Fast Frankie" to live with her.  When he lets her know that he can't even afford to split the rent with her she doesn't mind!  Instead she gives him the keys to her home and tells him not to worry about. This is first of the many improbable events that occur in this film.   Once Zora stupidly allows Fast Frankie into her home and life she gets pregnant and seriously contemplates abortion.  She makes the decision to go ahead with it and in a distasteful scene argues with  Fast Frankie as he begs her not to "kill his baby".  Of course Zora being Zora she decides to go ahead with having a baby with Franklin (who barely takes care of the kids he already has).  Franklin resolutely promises that he will take care of Zora and the baby and will work THREE JOBS if he has too.  The story progresses and Zora is heavily pregnant and it appears Franklin keeps his word as he finds a steady gig at a unionized construction site.    Things go well until Franklin drinks on the job, falls down injuring himself and is ultimately fired. Zora has the baby and since Franklin is too proud to accept work from his father or former boss, Zora carries the entire family financially. Keep in mind she works full-time as a music teacher, is pursuing a music career and, oh yeah, has recently had a son she has to care for.  Although Franklin doesn't have a job and won't go look for work because, as he explains it, "it's too cold" he doesn't try to cook, clean or change wet baby diapers.  That of course is women's work.    It is at this stage that we finally see some hope for this hopeless story of strange love.  Zora finally gets fed up and asks Franklin to leave.  Even in this though she makes a mistake.  After telling Franklin to pack his things and go, she leaves the house with their child.  When she returns she finds that Franklin, in a drunken self-pitying stupor, has completely trashed her home.  We see scenes where Franklin takes his hammer and rips everything he has built.  He breaks  down a coat rack, a mantle, a book case, etc.  Now, as the viewer, you can only believe that Fast Frankie, a selfish waste of space, is a truly terrible person. He trashes the home where his own child lives!  Honestly, who is this person!? Thankfully this is near the end of the film.  We see Zora getting on with life alone with her son.  She appears lonely in scenes, although after her ordeal with  Fast Frankie you would think she would be shouting with glee.  But not in this movie, no she is lonely without her shiftless man.  When Franklin knocks on Zora's door out of the blue one day, she is surprised (as are we). We hear that Franklin has been sending money to her for their son (I guess $20 can go toward diapars).  It's been over a year (!) and Franklin wants to see his son.  Later Zora and Franklin talk about things and we find out Franklin is taking an exam to become a licensed contractor.  Zora is suitably impressed because this means Franklin now has his GED (and boy is he proud of himself).  Zora can't believe the changes in Franklin (hmmm...he received his diploma for high school equivalency and he isn't drunk, what accomplishments) and looks at him with new eyes.  Their visit over, Franklin walks down the stairs leaving Zora to further contemplate the new Franklin.  A few seconds later she rushes to the stairs and calls him back up to the apartment.  The final scene of the film finds Zora and Franklin sitting happily with their son playing their favorite game, Scrabble.    Once you see this final scene, you can't help but be confused and disgusted.  Although I think the acting and directing in this film are outstanding, the characters and story line are deeply disturbing.  This film is based on a book written by Terry McMillan, an author that has made a career of writing about the desperate and curiously crazy behavior of middle-class black women in relationships.  I am not a fan of  Ms. McMillan, but I am a fan of Gina Prince-Bythewood who I can only assume took on this project as a challenge but could not quite pull off overseeing a film that makes black women appear incredibly self-deluding and obsessed with being in a relationship (any kind of relationship) even to their detriment.  If you want to see a well acted and directed feature, this is for you.  However, the movie itself is incredibly infuriating and disturbing in its portrayal of an adult woman being so completely blinded by the insecurity and fear of being alone.  I would not recommend the film for content, except as a cautionary tale. 
 I cannot say that I learned much about the Internet through this book.  The book was too simplistic for a regular Internet user.  The generalizations were repeated over and over throughout the chapters, which made the book fairly boring.  Also, the information in the chapters was commonsense based information.  If anyone has any knowledge about the Internet, this book is not for you.  Most high schoolers could probably give you the answers to the questions approached by Castells.  This book is not worth the price paid, I am sorry I ever bought it 
 If you are looking for new material about Tesla, do not buy this book.  The only thing that is told about these so called lost journals is that they are lost (stolen by MIBs, of course)!  The rest of the book is a compendium of conspiracy theories using Tesla's name as a come on for you to keep reading.  After a few pages, it gets very boring. In summary, no new material here, just Tesla's name used to get you to read the authors' conspiracy theories 
 This book was so different from the usual NR story.  The burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic.  If you want romance, skip this.  It also seemed to take forever to get the book set up 
 I saw Zach's special on Comedy Central Presents a while back and thought he was genius.  I bought this DVD with high expectations, but they were definitely not met. It seemed to me like he barely told any jokes. He just spent 15 minutes making fun of someone in the audience. The interview with "Seth" is by far the best part 
 I have all of the 4 major sports books of the Total package.These stats were increddibally incomplete like they show no tackles stats. I know tackles are not an official stat but there are sources like with the Negro leagues in baseball that show the stats. I liked the part about the Top 300 players to 1998. The Draft had all of the picks but I wish they would have who the top players were in each draft like the hockey one. I thought this book was okay it had some good stats but is no where near Hockey-Baseball-Basketball versions 
 I was totally disappointed in this book.  Totally predicatable. Major disappointment! 
 Of the 7 or so Grisham novels Ive read this one is my least favorite.  It's not a bad story at all but it's just way too long, about 150 pages longer than it needed to be.   It also just lacked credibility in many spots. Grisham is normally quite good at presenting characters and situations that are at least plausible, if not really interesting. Most of his books give the layman some insight into the workings of the law that Ive always thought were fascinating. This book, however, plods along and doesnt bring anything new to his body of work.  The other thing that really got me was the dialogue he wrote for Mark Sway, the 11year old protagonist. He sounds more like a street-wise 30year old, using words like "wonderful" and phrases that have been out of use since the 70's. I think Grisham forgot he was writing the words for a young boy and not one of his more typically older characters.  This isnt a bad book if you just want to escape for a few hours a day but most of his other ones are far more enjoyable 
 This movies rates right up there with "Schindler's List" . . . in terms of unapologetic propaganda.  Fortunately, Ted Turner showed some remorse for this hatchet job by making "Gettysburg," and the even better "Gods and Generals."  If you want to see a real, accurate depiction of the War For Southern Independence (aka, The Civil War), watch "Gods and Generals" or "Gone With The Wind," and stay away from movie garbage like "Andersonville."    Also watch for the extended version DVD of "Gods and Generals" coming for the Christmas season of 2005. 
 The only thing that makes this book similar to the Television Show are the names of the characters.  The author thanks crashdown.com for giving him advice on the characters, and he obviously didn't listen to a word they said.  You would think if he was going to attach his name to something, he would have taken the time to watch some of the shows that his story was supposed to have been based on.  The perfect example is that the pod squad is always drinking tobasco sauce, something that just is not done.  He obviously doesn't get it.  Furthermore, his writing is completely amateurish.  How many different ways is he going to call them teenagers?  Why does he have to use their age as a description every single time he mentions one of them?  Its absolutely rediculous.  He spends way too much time in this book setting up the scene, and never really gets to the heart of Roswell, whether it is the science fiction side or the romantic side. You may be able to fool someone who has never watched the show, but if you have ever seen the show, or read any of Melinda Metz's Roswell High books, you will be highly dissappointed in this ripoff 
 I checked this book out from the library, and I wouldn't recommend that, let alone buying it. If you get it as a Christie fan, you'll be disappointed. The connections are loose, forced, and meager. Reread one of the biographical entries on Christie and learn MUCH more. If you get it as a travelogue, there are many better. The coverage of sites and culture is superficial. Finally, the writing is nothing special at all. It's travel and Christie lite, if not misleading and thin. Truly not worth your time. 
 Between the amended "politically correct" ending to this famous tale and the so-very-hokey interaction between Kirstey Alley and Lloyd Bridges, I couldn't wait for this to be over! The animation was very poor quality... the music was not the focus, my grandchildren lost interest. Shat else could possibly have been wrong 
 To cover all the problems with continuity, logic, theology, geography and plain common sense in _Left Behind_ would take a whole book.  One hardly knows where to start.  Perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to Christian religion by this trashy novel.  As such, it isn't even a decent trashy novel; instead of steamy sex scenes, we get sanctimonious sermonizing.  Worse than that, what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the Bible into a cheap comic book, ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self-centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it's too late.  The comic book aspect can not be overemphasized.  Even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario (an idea with virtually no scriptural support), little in the characters' actions, thought processes or dialog rings true.  One gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student.  God ends up looking like the ultimate villain, demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side Or Else.  Whatever happened to the inspiring Christian writers of yesteryear?  Who is the present-day equivalent of C. S. Lewis, or Catherine Marshall, and why aren't they getting more attention?  These were writers who actually made you THINK.  LaHaye and Jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing God wants us to be doing; they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought.  They show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non-believers in such a world might ask.  One wonders if they have ever met a non-believer at all, or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter.  These days, it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of Ann Coulter or Pat Robertson, whose mission seems to be to turn Christianity into a twisted, bigoted caricature of what it once was.  Perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured.  If _Left Behind_ is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from Christian writers, then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind 
 I was forced to read this book in my Junior Health class in High school. The book is interesting enough and easy to read. Any reading level can understand this book.   The plot revolves around Nick Andreas, who has received a restraining order against his ex-girlfriend Caitlin after hitting her. The story shifts between present day Nick dealing with his anger management class and filling out a journal. Those journal entries provide inside into the past, highlighting Nick and Caitlin's relationship while it was still "happy".   It was a constant reminder throughout the whole book that the author who wrote this book has no idea how teenagers actually speak. Being one myself, I have firsthand experience. It's not as if the characters use words that no normal one would use, it's just the manner in which they present themselves. Frankly, most of the dialog is just uninteresting and unrealistic.  My other complaint are Nick's journals. He writes them so perfectly detailed that it seems like they are happening in present day. He even uses quotes and "she/he said" to cap them off. I find it extremely hard to believe that any teenager will be that in-depth with a journal entry, treating it as if they were writing a novel.  I commend the book for dealing with such tough issues as control problems and child abuse but any brave steps taken to deal with these or short cut with the ridiculously formulaic ending that made the whole book feel like a worn-out after-school special.   Overall, the book is not the worst in the world but it definitely could have been better. I could have written a book better than this in my sleep 
  Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist [...] fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 This is probalby one of the worst text book I have ever read. The concepts are extremely difficult to follow most of time there are no consistancy between the concept introduced in the chapter and the the problems presented to you. As one of my friend said: it won't make any difference if they just give us a book full with problems and not teaching us hard to do it. THAT is how bad this book is. Or another suggestion will be buy the book and MAKE SURE you buy the solution manual. Don't worry about reading the book since it won't help you at all, just do the problems with the solution manual and you'll be fine for the semester. At the end of the semester if you are rich enough....bring the book and burn it during one of your camping trip. In case anybody is thinking that I probably failed the class so i hate this book so much, Im actually getting an A and I never read a single page out of this book....again what a useless book 
 I bought this edition for a bicycle trip across northern Laos, but was very disappointed with the very old and inaccurate information on Hua Phan Province in the northeast of the country. It's a remote region, and probably on few travelers' itineraries, but it was on mine. I felt let down that the authors didn't provide up-to-date coverage. Neither author even visited the province! That's not good enough 
 This is one of the weakest albums of this great band 
 It definitely seems to be more religious than I expected. Although I only browsed though it, I thought there were going to be more recurring themes regarding reincarnation, children relating stories of having been here before,or knowing things beyond their circumstances. It does have some sweet stories and is nicely laid out for the reader. I got a bit choked up reading a couple of the stories 
 I found Dorrell's frequent asides about his personal experience as a struggling gallery owner to be self-indulgent and unnecessary. Some of these sections got almost too personal. Dorrell's overall tone was jaded, then  self-congratulatory on his finally realized successes. I also found that his advice was exactly contrary to that of another writer of a book I found on this site. I recommend "How to Survive and Prosper As an Artist" by Caroll Michels instead of this book. I think Michel is far more upbeat and serves the interest of the the reader/artist; whereas Dorrell thinly disguises his self-interest as a gallery owner 
 Ok, Some books should be judged by their cover. This is one of them. By the books own definition, bobbers are "a machine that had things cut or bobbed off." It then goes on to explain using a stock machine as a starting point. The bike on the cover, like about 80% of the bikes in this book, does not use a stock frame or front end as a starting point. Many of them are aftermarket raked and stretched frames using overlength front ends and mag wheels. Clearly not bobbers. This book should be called Art of the Custom Motorcycle. It is a decent book about modern custom bikes, but if I had the opportunity of browse the book prior to purchasing, I wold not have purchased it. I would categorize this book as a book written by people who are taking advantage of the recent bobber craze without knowing the true definition of the term. On the flip side, the book is a good value for what Amazon charges and if you are into custom bikes perhaps you should consider it. But don't expect to see traditional bobbers 
  If Glenn Stanton were a lawyer arguing in a real live trial, he'd lose the case. Many of his arguments against same-sex marriage play right into the hands of gay-rights activists. For example, to make the case against gay marriage he lists all the ways that heterosexual marriage benefits adults and children. (Huh? Those benefits are exactly what the homosexual community is seeking for their own unions.) Stanton also argues that gay marriage is not genuinely necessary for the gay community because not all gays want it. (Huh? Does this mean that straight marriage is not genuinely necessary for the straight community because not all straights want it?) He further argues that homosexuals make up only one or two percent of the population and that gay activists (who claim it's closer to ten percent) are inflating the numbers for their own advantage. (Huh? If the homosexual population is that small, a book against same-sex marriage is hardly worth the time. Why not write a pamphlet and save the book for a topic like poverty-a factor that correlates strongly with family breakdown?)  To his credit, not all Stanton's arguments are that transparent. To debunk scientific research affirming that "well-grounded, credible studies have shown that it is likely--highly likely--that homosexuality is grounded in biology," he responds with this very persuasive statement: "The truth is that there are no replicated scientific studies that prove . . . homosexuality is determined by biological or genetic factors." Unfortunately, few readers of "Marriage on Trial" will realize that this is exactly WHY scientists use phrases like "highly likely" and and make no proof-claims for biological cause. Ironically, even as the biological evidence mounts, scientists have the decency to be conservative about their findings. Conservative Christians, on the other hand, are indecently sure about their own position. Quite rightly, though, Stanton is alert to the possible biases of homosexual scientists. The problem is, he doesn't acknowledge his own.   It's evident that Stanton had already decided that same-sex marriage was wrong before he wrote "Marriage on Trial." That's not a scholarly way to examine this or any complicated topic no matter how much research is done. If you care about this issue, and are seeking a fair coverage of the pros and cons of same-sex marriage, this book is not the one for you. If you oppose same-sex marriage and want to confirm your pre-existing convictions, this book still might not be the one. In fact, if you good at identifying fallacious arguments, it might even change your mind.   
 I read this book and I was quite dissapointed. I had read My 60 Memorable games and The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal, and felt that those were excellant books! I felt that Nimzowitsch didn't have anything good to day. I read this book last year, when I was under 1600, and thought to myself, maybe its to advanced I will try reading it again in a year from now.  But now at expert strength I still am going wow, its not good at all.   Fine, Nimzowitsch gave some good ideas about chess, but it seemed all very basic! I think/thought that this books was a total waste of money if you have a USCF rating of over 1300, and a ICC rating of probably over 1500.  If you are under that, this book may benifit you.   Even though it is said that every one read My System, I disagree.  I think that this book is a very sad excuse for a "classic".  I really believe that it is a nothing compared to "The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal" and "My 60 Memorable Games".  I guess overall, the book wasnt so hot, but it may be benificial to people who are lower rated, but people who are higher rated I would highly advise NOT TO BUY THIS BOOK! It would be a waste of money : 
 I have recently read 5 books about the Trappists/Cistercians and this is the worst book of them all.  I have spent 10 days on retreats at a Trappist abbey and more to come, and I DO NOT recommend this book for several  reasons.  First, the author has approached his subject as a journalist and  has a negative tone.  Secondly, he has included too much autobiographical  information about his own life and spiritual struggles.  Thirdly, he has a  rather arrogant attitude about his desire to invade the privacy of some of  the monks who choose not to be interviewed by him.  Lastly, his tone is  that of one being perched "on-high" and gazing down upon the lives of the  Trappist monks.  For a much better introduction to Trappist/Cistercian  monasticism: The Silent Life, By Thomas Merton; The Cistercian Way, By  Andre Louf; Trappist: Living in the Land of Desire, By Michael Downey; and  The Orchards of Perseverance, By David Perata.  I believe that these other  titles are much more accurate in portraying the spirituality and practice  of Trappist monks 
 I gave this 2 stars b/c I liked the author, but the story itself did not appeal to me.  I found I couldn't identify with Ali at all.  I thought her decisions and her actions were horrible.  This is just my opinion obviously, and again I liked the writing style of Carol Matthews but I was glad to be done with the story when I got to the last page 
 I'm so tired of being conned out of ten or twenty bucks.  When I saw what this DVD was titled, I didn't hesitate to get it.  I watched it and laughed, but it is far from what it should be.  It lacks so many of the truly "best" parodies, that titling it in this manner is deceptive.  It could, and should have been loaded with so many more of the greats.  Until we demand quality, I guess all we'll get is the mediocre 
  I enjoyed the other books in this series, though strangely, it seemed to me that each successive book was a step down the rung from the one preceeding it. Kiss & Tell remains the strongest and most enjoyable. By the time I got to Out of Sight, the decline in reading pleasure had sunk so low that I was unable to finish the story. I was completely turned off by the self-centeredness of the heroine. Her inability to see the larger picture in life and death situations endangered not only herself but others, and ultimately led to the death of another character. She seemed less troubled by this than she was with proving herself, which I found contemptible. My two stars are for the hero, who deserved a much better woman. I'll be waiting for Ms. Adair's newest entry, On Thin Ice, to be released in paperback before purchasing. I sincerely hope this series, which began with so much potential, will get back on track. The author has a lot of talent, and I'm looking forward to better things from her 
 I'm a big Nora fan, but I couldn't even finish this one. By the fourth chapter I began to skim. WAY WAY WAY to much detail for me. Which made it boring and slow. Testing and corrosion, is it fake, is it real ...blah blah blah. ENOUGH! I did however enjoy the side story about the brother (I forget his name). But thats it folks. Unlike ALL the other reviewers, I hated it. I say PASS on this one. But as you can see, I'm in the minority 
 ...I'm sure Air Supply is what I'll be listening to for eternity 
 This book did not offer nearly enough real-life examples for thank you letters. Do not waste your money.  
     I read a good short story by Franzen in The New Yorker a couple years ago, but this book is lame, lame, lame.  The essays contain little to no humor or insight- they are just lengthy, boring opinions on various subjects.  Imagine if you can a duller, less-relavant Andy Rooney.  If I wanted to read some loser's uninspired musings, I would get on the internet and start reading weblogs.  I hereby declare this book Unreadable 
 I know the Mid-East, having lived & travelled there constantly for  more than ten years & having returned very often since my last  residence there to travel even more. Like the author, I am Ph.D. holder --  Mid-East history. I find this book very superficial; what else can it be  for lack of real substance? Moreover, I randomly checked the index &  found that not a single item panned out. Need I say more? I am sorry I  bought it; that is more. And still more: with so many notes, a bibliography  is a must, if for nothing more than to help the reader evaluate the book  based on the sources consulted 
 Not much there,some good ideas but really only a few chapters worth of materia 
 I won't be buying these, because there is not enough public comments or even actual photos of people using these goggles. If you look closely on the example photos provided by amazon the people that supposingly wear these things, then you'll notice they aren't really wearing them its just drawn 
 I purchased this based on the numerous reviews here and glowing recommendations elsewhere online, but it has turned out to be the poorest choice and truly the most useless book on drawing I've ever read.  I wish I hadn't ignored the fact that others commented about nearly everything except actual drawing instruction.  I wish my mind had registered the key words analysis and theory in so many others glowing reviews.  If you want to learn to draw, or learn to actually apply lines, mass, tone, balance, proportion, etc. to improve your drawing skills then look elsewhere.  However, if you want to read one author's horribly long winded rambling lectures about how these things influence art, perception, and the psyche then this is the book for you.  This is far more an analysis of drawing as it relates to art than it is a tutorial.  Nearly three hundred pages and you could compress the portions related to applying these ideas to your own drawing down to two dozen pages at most 
 This book offers absolutely nothing of value.  As a person who sews, I was very disappointed 
 While I understand the inability of caucasians to get the "inside scoop" on the Tongs and Triads, this book could have been better researched. Many crucial items are left out, such as organizational structure, the "who-does-what" positions, and maybe even some  first hand accounts, as has been done and done well by La Cosa Nostra  researchers. Very general overview with little hardcore information 
 Considering I found this dvd in Walmart for $10 I thought I was literally in for a treat.Not likely.First off my main problem with the girls is that they lip synched too much throughout the whole show.They could've at least redid the backing vocals instead of them obviously sounding like Beyoncé.I saw the same exact show live and it had way more energy than this excuse of a performance.It must've been taped during the end of the tour because all 3 girls looked tired.If you literally want your money's worth I suggest you pick up Beyoncé's Live in Wembley show because her performance of Dangerously in Love was weak compared to a more matured version on her dvd.Don't even get me started on Michelle's song Heard A Word.Babygirl was straining to hit the high notes towards the end and I'm surprised it wasn't edited out because she sounded bad!.I love the girls to the heart but this was a bad idea 
 This book has nothing to do with anyone expecting anything great, so I hate it! This book is perhaps one of the greatest books of all time, but I hate it, because the title is misleading. What the Dickens does the author think he's doing giving this book a title like that! 
 There are gaps above and below in the box which limit the capacity to 22 total individual CDs.  If you have 4 double CD carriers, then you can maximize the capacity to 30.  Otherwise, it looks silly.  I was rather disappointed especially because for a dollar more I could have had a different 30 CD storage cube which I liked better 
 The book is probably great to those that know nothing about any psychological concepts.  But most of the information is already out there on the internet or in other psychological books.  This is definately not for people who already have done prior research.  Many of the ideas like finding your "inner child" seem somewhat implausible to me.  
 The premise was great. The storytelling, very awkward. The technological information could have been interesting, but it read like an instruction manual. I give one star for the final cat-and-mouse and another for the funny way Mr. Clancy portrayed the Soviet apparatchiks 
 If you like this book you will probably like "Bless the Child" by Cathy Cash Spellman.  They are very similar.  This book can be summed up in one word, simple: simple-minded, simple characters, simple plot (applied loosely), and simple premise.  What a contrived piece of garbage!  I can't describe everything wrong with this book because there's not enough time.  If it's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through.  If it's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims, in denial, weak, worried about what everyone thinks, or oblivious.  If it's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author's plea for that is irritating.  That's how bad this book is! It can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying.  This author has no style.  The book reads like an episode of inside edition.  There is no immersion into the story.  The total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them.  As a reader I felt completely outside the story; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario.  The attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable.  I've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn.  The only reason I read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me.  Do not waste your time.    I must say though that this novel was inspirational.  If this crap can make the best seller list, it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published 
 The author spent his entire life in journalism and not academia and it shows in the book.  The book is written at the 8th grade reading and intellectual level, which accounts for its popularity.  The book is a collection of interesting tidbits about the ancient Greek world that the author collected in his hobby reading.  An analogy would be describing a religious belief system by the sequence of body postures used by the worshippers and ignoring their intellectual beliefs about the spiritual world.  There is a total lack of academic rigor.  The author tells you what to think instead of presenting the evidence and making you think for yourself.  What is worse is the absent material.  The author totally ignores the usually understood reason for the trial being revenge from a high level public official that Socrates frequently publicly ridiculed for being incompetent.  Another journalist aspect is the occasional political propaganda presented.  Watch out for irrelevant and false references to the current world and notice how they are presented as proof by blatant assertion 
 A useful tool to try and get people to accept ideas (usually bad ones).  To shift your paradigm (knowledge filter) means to a) roll with the punches b) free yourself from independent thought or c) goose step...right...left...right....left...  There are plenty of used copies!  HR people love this approach because it gets the American worker to do HR's job for them, ie. brainwash herself/himself into accepting lousy ideas that will hurt the average American in the long run.  
 if i could give this music negative stars i would. no kidding i got nauseous listening to this band. i seriously was on the verge of losing my lunch as one song led into the next and i headed straight to the bathroom after being tortured by them all. a hard-to-believe reaction, i know -- i was wondering myself how it was possible to get physically sickened by a cd, but then i figured it out: it just goes in circles and circles and circles and circles and circles and circles and circles. HOLD STEADY? i WISH! it's TORTUROUS. on top of having a boring-as-hell voice, vocally this guy "sings" the SAME 2 or 3-note "melodies" for every song. wtf? + musicwise it's the same level of Abysmally Boring and Uninventive -- and let me repeat -- CIRCLES. the "band" does the exactly the same "music" for EVERY song. how can anyone say good things about these guys??? bravo to the other two reviewers who gave them one star. i'm happy to see that at least two people in the world have ears. it's astounding to me that crap like this gets recorded. even more astounding that crap like this generates fans. 
 what's Star Wars Galaxies? Is that the game that died 4/26/05 when the idiots at SOE released the combat 'upgrade'? 
 I have read the previous 11 reviews on this book and they all have one thing in common; NOT ONE of them says that they have ACTUALLY repaired  or even taken a watch apart by using this book.   The first 20 pages are easy to understand, but after that too many special tools are required and I can't follow it. After reading the parts of this book that I do understand, I don't see how just ANYBODY could repair a watch by using this book. It seems to me that this book was written with the intention for it to be used as a TEXTBOOK for a watch repair tech school or for watch repairmen to refer to in their trade.    If you're looking for a book that EXPLAINS how a watch works and what makes it tick but not intended to be a repair book, well, you won't find it in this book. For half the price of this one, try 'Instant Expert: Collecting Watches'. 
 Good Eastwood-Streep movie, but terrible book. The plot itself is fine, but the manner in which the book is written is amateurish and just plain sappy. Skip the book and watch the movie. If you want to read a well-written love story that doesn't insult your intelligence, then may I suggest Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice? Now that's good writing and an entertaining yarn to boot 
 I must agree with the reader who says there is more style than substance in this book. This applies particularly to S. Felman's part of the book. D. Laub's articles are straightforward and clear, Felman's essays, however, are intellectually self involved, and convey a nervous kind of circular argumentation. This comes across as a very neurotic writing. But may be it's a sign of the times that trauma becomes a pretext for the somewhat usual textual interpretations of academic authors. May be it's also to be expected that most writers fail somewhat when they try to talk about personal or collective suffering. It is a difficult subject for sure. Read the book for its failures 
 This extension cable did not work with my standard Microsoft S Controller.  Unless you still use the old monster-sized XBox controller, these cables are worthless 
 Generally, I think that actors can make a film worth watching even when the script isn't that good. A good performance can make an otherwise unremarkable script seem better than it is. But actors like Colin Firth, an actor with a quiet, almost passive acting style, cannot hope to compete with this stultifying, cloying, saccharine screenplay. This movie goes back and forth on a linear timeline for virtually the entire 92 minutes, creating the feeling that there has been no passage of time at all. It's suffocating, a static, energy-sapping, eyelid-drooping tour of duty through Mark Herman's drifting career - as is the cinematography which frames every scene so tight and close that you feel like leaving the room yourself just to get some air.   Besides a limp storyline, the dialogue is frightfully bad, barely a laugh anywhere. That the resolution of the film, Colin Firth carrying the usually bounteous Heather Graham - reduced here to some kind of carefully-wrapped, de-sexed, small-town butter queen - for an inordinate distance for no apparent reason other than to use up some of the movie's endless-seeming running time, is pitiful. The payoff to this awkward forced march? When the two begin stripping off their clothes, apparently as prelude to some even more tame lovemaking, guess what? Firth's character throws out his back. Gales of laughter do not ensue.   An earlier scene, in which the also usually sexy Minnie Driver - whose body is arguably superior to that of Ms. Graham - strips to her negligee, is shot and lit so poorly that we never get the impact of the omnipresent sexuality that is supposed to be driving Mr. Firth throughout the film. Without this sexuality in the two women, Firth's desire is muted, confused, and desultory, his performance has nothing to work off of. Firth is an actor who requires impetus from his surroundings, from other's characters, and from the story itself. He receives none of this and so begins to appear an even more reluctant player than usual.   There is usually one person to blame for something like this: the director who, in this case, is also the writer. Blame them both, and give the actors a pass on this one. 
 Somewhere, in a fake Latin American country, Irene and Francisco meet and fall in love in the midst of a military dictatorship.  They discover murderous plots surrounding numerous characters that at first seem inconsequential but become very important.  Unfortunately at times the plot is slow moving and uninteresting, but the overall take on the book is pretty good.  I wouldn't read another Allende book for pleasure though.  
 Funny enough, I am Shine's target audience... a stay-at-home mom who believes my children come first, agrees that cultivating a healthy relationship with my husband is important, buys organic, does my best to take care of myself etc.  I thought I would love this book.  I WANTED to love this book.  I believe we should champion SAHPs more and I was thrilled to find a book that seemed to do just that.  But as I was reading I was stunned to find that while I agreed in principle with nearly everything Shine said, I couldn't get past her highly judgemental, snotty way of referring to those different than herself.   She chides the women's rights movement for not being more supportive of SAHMs (agreed) and declares she wishes we could all be sisters and supportive of one another.  Yet she is highly critical of these "sisters" whose choices differ from her own. My jaw dropped when she referred to an overweight woman in the grocery store a "fat a#$."  I don't remember ever calling my own sister a fat a#$!  Shine is not the voice of stay-at-home-moms I was looking for. 
 Although Speaker for the Dead is a decent story overall and does have some great sci-fi elements, like relativistic space travel, I didn't think it was anywhere near as good as Ender's Game. I thought of it like Return of the Jedi if the rebels spent the whole movie pondering the social behavior of the ewoks.  Of course we're not talking about Star Wars or movies here. Speaker for the Dead was just a peculiar departure from Ender's Game, which is one of the best novels I've ever read. I almost felt like Card decided he didn't really feel like writing another sci-fi novel, so he went with a biologist drama instead 
 This book substitutes a liberal bias for the conservative one.  Besides, some of it is just plain wrong.  To give just one example, the following quote from track 8Q:  "In sum, affluent Americans, like their textbooks, are willing to credit racial discrimination as the cause of poverty among Blacks and Indians, and sex discrimination as the cause of women's inequality, but don't see class discrimination as the cause of poverty in general."    Its funny that Loewen, who loves to criticize conservatives (often a worthy cause in my opinion) is wrong in a way that gives up such an opportunity.  He attributes to them, two "liberal" opinions that many of them would vehemently disagree with.  
 I enjoyed the selections made in the past by Windling and Datlow, they have truly opened my eyes to many writers that I would never have considered reading and even one story that I still gives me nightmares! These compilations were always great for assisting me in locating books written by up and coming authors and their recommendations are generally dead on....however, since the series has added two new editors the quality of stories has dropped dramatically. Gone are the truly scary and wonderous stories of previous additions. I keep buying and hoping that the series improves and I can once again rely on it as a solid anthology 
 For a book about such an emotional music, this "matter of fact" account of the blues is totally without feeling.  Davis is cynical about most previous beliefs of the blues and is absolutely critical of current  blues artists who have attempted to keep the earliest blues alive.  This  author lacks the charm and scope of an Alan Lomax or a Samuel Charters.   Although the book contained information, it was dull and sometimes  annoying 
 Like most great diplomatic moments, successes and failures alike, decades will pass before anything approaching a full history of the Camp David debacle can appear.  Even then, disagreements on the apportionment of blame will likely continue on for decades after.  Given the wide interest in the Israeli-Arab conflict and the complex nature of the negotiations, new works exploring the crucial climax at Camp David remain welcome.  Some dismiss Mr. Swisher's work because he was not in fact part of the negotiating team, but instead was responsible at Camp David only for negotiations.  That seems to me unfair.  Clayton Swisher clearly did considerable "leg work" to prepare this text; sadly both his rather obvious bias and almost juvenile desire to settle scores renders what could have been an important work at best suspect.  Mr. Swisher's book follows on the heels of Dennis Ross's interesting "The Missing Peace" and, given Mr. Ross's direct involvement in the negotiations; no one could be blamed for looking at other works as well.  However, Mr. Swisher spends much of his time looking to lay the blame at Mr. Ross's feet, even when he makes claims that others at Camp David, many more central then Mr. Swisher directly contradict his statements.  Much for example is made in this work of Mr. Ross's change of "municipal Jerusalem" to "greater Jerusalem" in a draft as if this caused the breakdown of the agreement.  Unfortunately, Ross's change in fact was a return to an earlier draft after being changed by Robert Malley, a member of the US team and now often a talking head representing the Palestinian point of view, who made the alteration without consulting any of the parties.  Malley has never denied this.  Moreover, days would pass before the negotiations actually broke down.  Swisher's target, perhaps seeking to sell books by putting forward a contradictory point of view, shifts the blame wherever he can to Israel and the US negotiating team.  While such an effort might well be reasonable, Mr. Swisher often twists facts, making excuses for Palestinian gaffs while blowing minor facts out of all proportion.  For example, Mr. Swisher brushes aside the days lost when Mr. Arafat and the Palestinian team insisted that Jews had no historic link to Jerusalem or the Temple Mound -- a position farcical on its face -- as mere posturing.  However, he never mentions that such ideas, undermining the Jewish people very claim to the Land, serve only to inflame the parties and make agreement almost impossible.  Nor does Swisher ever consider the Palestinians failure to negotiate in good faith, treating every Israeli offer simply as a new base line, rather than offering any proposals of their own.  Again, even Robert Malley concedes that this disingenuous strategy by the Palestinians likely doomed Camp David from the start.  Swisher's dismissal of all Israeli concerns reaches a crescendo when he simply casts aside as silly Israel's interest and the Palestinian's refusal of any compromise for the so-called "right of return," or the claim that all Palestinian who left the area of modern Israel and all their descendants must have a right immigrate to Israel, a right held by no other people.  As to the simple fact that this would lead to the destruction of the Jewish State and that the Palestinians are thus expecting Israel to commit national suicide, on this problem Mr. Swisher remains silent.  Lastly, one cannot help but marvel at Mr. Swisher's odd coverage of the events after Camp David.  That Yasser Arafat led a bloody war against Israel rather than offering an alternative proposal for peace is dismissed.  Mr. Swisher combs through events searching for, magnifying, and twisting any event that will make Israel look bad, while at the same time minimizing or even ignoring the waves of suicide terrorists who have murdered hundreds of Israeli civilians in cold blood.  Mr. Swisher even parrots points of Palestinian propaganda so thoroughly disproved that even Palestinian leaders no longer mention them, such as the claim of massacres during Israeli operations in Jenin, which exhaustive study long ago proved to be nothing more than a fabrication.    Curiosity will cause readers to ask why Mr. Swisher takes this extremely biased view.  Fortunately, he lays out his rather simplistic point of view at the very beginning of the book by writing the following, "The primary reason for Arab and Muslim anger against America has been and remains unbridled support for Israel's oppression of the Palestinians."  Again, one can only muse as to why Mr. Swisher does not take Osama bin Laden at his word when he spoke shortly after 9/11 that his hatred manifests from the presence of American Christian soldiers in the heart of Islamic holy lands like Saudi Arabia and later Iraq.  Surely neither the bombings in Madrid or more recently in London had anything to do with Israel, but it seems for Mr. Swisher's simplistic world view, it is at the door step of the Jewish state where all blame is to be laid.   
 This book completely ignores the most important nonzero sums of a human male's life which are the amount of women a male mates with and the amount of children a male sires. Ignoring these two sums makes the theory Wright proposes collapse. 
 Assault On Precinct 13 is an action packed film starring Ethan Hawke (Training Day), Lawrence Fishburne (The Matrix), John Leguizamo (Carlito's Way), Brian Dennehy (First Blood), Ja Rule (Scary Movie 3), Gabriel Byrne (End Of Days), and Maria Bello (Secret Window).  The story is set on a very snowy day in Detroit where a group of the city's dirtiest criminals including cop killer and big time gangster Marion Bishop, played by Fishburne, are held in broken down Precinct 13 managed by troubled cop Jake Roenick, played by Hawke, and a few of his staff. All of a sudden, an army of corrupt police officers led by Marcus Duvall, played by Byrne, storm the precinct in an effort to kill everyone inside for the sake of getting their hands on Bishop. Jake finds himself put in a dilemma where he will have to put his hand in the hands of criminals to survive throughout the night and make it out alive.  The script, like the story, is vague. Ethan Hawke, who earned an Oscar nomination for Training Day, seems to be overacting; the screenplay, on the other hand, seems to have been written over a short period of time, giving the actors little to work with. And throughout the time the poor good guys and bad guys were held in the precinct, I was wondering why didn't anyone pick up a cell phone and call for back up!?  Mindless action movie lovers will love Assault, but avid film-goers, like myself, will most definitely pass it by.  Not really recommended  D 
 I find it disturbing that John Updike can apparently find no female artist worthy of mention in his book...beyond one artist who is practically unknown. And she is included only because his family owned a piece of artwork created by her. Updike seems very dismissive of even this one female contributor.  He does find room in his book to include a nude photo of the great artist Georgia O'Keefe, but no actual artwork created by O'Keeffe. That should give you a clue what the rest of the book is like.   Disturbing, too, are Updike's dismissive comments about Edward Hopper; he claims that Edward Hopper can't paint faces very well.    So even though I purchased this book, I don't recommend it to others. Give this one a pass. 
 I just didn't find this second installment to Nightmare On Elm Street scary at all. And neither did my Dad. It's definitely, so far, the worst Freddy film. The only bit that really freaked me out was the demonic parakeet, and that's mainly because I have a bird myself. I didn't like the lead guy either - he was a bit wimpy wasn't he? It also has the highest body count of all the Nightmare films, but none of them were that different to any other slasher movie.  I hope the rest are better, cos I did buy the seven disc box set. Hmmmm. It also doesn't use Charles Bernstein's original theme, or a variation of it, which is disappointing, as I do like that theme.  I'm gonna try and forget this film, and keep watching the rest, I just hope this was just a mishap.   Oh, and look out for the REAL Robert Englund in a very, very brief role as the bus driver in the opening sequence. It's very quick, and you'll be thinking "did I see him or didn't I?" Yes, it is him. 
 The "ultimate Reference"???  This man's hubris knows no bounds.  I got my 1st Hart book when I was a budding cartoonist at the age of 12.  I could wax eloquent about Mr. Hart's lack of artistic prowess and limited style, I will simply point out that aside from publishing these How To Draw books, he has done virtually nothing in the mainstream or independant comic/ art industry.  That in itself should be the biggest warning to all of you out there.  As far as strict anatomy for goes, few people have done better than Jack Hamm and Bruce Hogarth, with Hogarth being my current favorite.  For you aspiring comic artists out there, "How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way" may be a bit older, but still worlds better than anything Hart has produced.  For those of you just looking for one book that covers everything about drawing comics, I must reccommend WIZARD's "How to Draw" Book 1.  This, as opposed to Hart's books, are written by a collabaration of successful and undisputed masters of the industry, and is so superior to Hart's that there's practically no comparison.  So for pete's sake, don't waste your money on this book, or any other book written by Hart 
 Never, I repeat, NEVER allow Biblical/Theological scholars to create their own guides and tools like this.  This edition of the Strong's brutalizes the original edition, changing word meanings and etymologies to reflect Christian doctrine, not keeping true to the original Chaldean/Hebrew and Greek texts.  Don't believe me? Use an original Strong's to look up Hebrew word #430, elohiym. This is given as the name of God throughout the NKV bible but in fact if you do a word etymology shows that this is a female plural word about a group of lesser, inferior gods.  Follow this, and the key to Truth is yours. Don't listen to the lies of this edition of the book which changes and eliminates words which are tricky for Christianity to explain away. Man cannot be trusted to take care of knowledge properly, and this book is a prime example why.  Get the original Strong's. If you seek the truth about the world you live in, that is 
 I skimmed John Gray's "Practical Miracles for Mars & Venus," but couldn't stomach the hype.  The first 150 pages are about the power of positive thinking and of belief in miracles.  (Gray claims that the world has matured to the point that miracles are now available to anyone, at any time.  Democracy and religious tolerance are two of the enabling changes.)  Gray then sketches some simple techniques for physical and emotional healing: eat right; breath deeply; use a Chi Gong exercise to "recharge healing energy" and "decharge excess or negative energy" (or stress and negative thoughts); imagine that people have treated you better than they actually did; write yourself a letter expressing your frustrations; cultivate gratitude, confidence, joy, etc.; envision the world you want; believe in yourself and your power to heal.  I gather that the techniques are more completely described in Gray's "How to Get What You Want and Want What You Have."  "Practical Miracles" reads like an ad for Gray's seminars, or like a verbatim trancript of a stage presentation.  (On page 239 he says "Now I have written twelve bestsellers and tend to be a speed writer. ... After many years of developing my thoughts, it takes me only a few months to write them down and create a book.")  Positive thinking is all well and good, but the seminar must be more inspiring than the book 
 A waste of money for those of us who live in the real world versus the spiritual world 
 This book is so beautiful on the outside it's a pity that the words are so incredibly hurtful and wrong.  The story is about a fish who is covered with beautiful scales.  Another fish comes up and asks to be given one of the scales and the beautiful fish says no, after which none of the other fish will play with it.  The fish is advised by someone "wise" to give away its beautiful scales so that the other fish will like it.  It follows that advise and gives every other fish a scale so that by the end of the book the page is filled with a bunch of pathetic looking fish that all have one shiny scale and everyone is supposedly happy.  For me this is a terrible moral!  It's wrong to be prettier or smarter or more talented in some way?  You should try to make yourself less pretty or dumber or ignore your talents so other people won't be jealous?  It's OK to demand other people give you things that you covet?  Yuk! 
 I was dissapointed in this book. I found it a difficult read because the text was inundated with percentages, statistics and numbers. The author used statistics and percentages, which can be manipulated to 'prove' anything, to back up every one of her statements and opinions.  I would have perfered much more straight reporting of her ideas and feelings and much less this mish-mash of numbers and percentages. A very cumbersome read 
 After reading this book, I would like to make three points about it:  1.) First of all, DON'T MAKE THIS YOUR FIRST DEAN KOONTZ BOOK.  This is the second book of the so-called Christopher Snow trilogy.  Read the first book in the trilogy first -- FEAR NOTHING.  The first book introduces pretty much all the key characters that you find in this book.  2.) Second, please be aware that Koontz has yet to write the third book in the Christopher Snow trilogy.  This is a real shame, because SEIZE THE NIGHT ends on a cliffhanger of sorts.  Koontz has claimed that he will write the third book someday, under the title RIDE THE STORM.  But since it's been over eight years since Koontz has written a Snow novel, I wouldn't expect this book anytime soon.    3.) Third, I must admit I didn't really care for this book at all, and I say that as a Koontz fan.  Lots of padding -- the action doesn't really start until page 250.  Koontz wastes a LOT of space repeating things he originally wrote in FEAR NOTHING.   I found myself skipping through this book quite a bit to get to the good parts.  The plot here is also too over the top -- plot elements include time travel, killer monkeys, alternate realities, serial killers conducting government experiments -- and that's just the tip of the iceberg!  Even the characters in the book don't seem to take any of it seriously.  All the dialogue in this book is whimsical and unrealistic.  I was therefore never able to suspend disbelief for this book.  It was just too silly for my tastes.  Koontz is a great writer, but his best novels are the ones that have a more believable, fast-paced plot.  Instead of this book, I would therefore recommend WATCHERS, INTENSITY, ODD THOMAS or VELOCITY.  
 Okay, so to catch up on this exciting new series, I decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - Amazon Unbox!  I selected the first 10 episodes and hit Purchase.  Minutes later, I was watching the first episode, it came quickly, sounded great, and looked wonderful... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end.  Forgiveable, until... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video, making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing.  But, this IS a good concept... unfortunately, Amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality!  So, until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds... DO NOT try and download Season 1, Episodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7!!!  1, 3, 8, 9, and 10 were the only ones that were 100% complete for me 
 The book attempts to describe a country that the author clearly does not understand, or worse, chooses to misunderstand. Like the world-view of a jaundiced man, the book reveals more of the author's view than the reality of the world he is attempting to describe. 
 This program works after it's installed, but the installation process is unbelievably flawed.  If you have a version of Norton on your computer already, this may cause all kinds of problems with the new installation.  Not only did I have to uninstall all versions (after Norton lets you install the new one), but I had to make a bunch of changes to Windows, also.    On top of that, while you're struggling to install (I got it on to one computer easily, a second with some difficulty, and the third... well, it's been several days of struggle), Norton counts down the number of days in the subscription.  So if you install on one computer today, and another two months later, then your subscription on all your machines still expires a year from now.  I don't see how Symantec can put out a program that doesn't allow you to upgrade easily... after all these years, they can't fix this major bug?  That's just pathetic 
 I found this book very boring. Tyler does a good job on detailing the charictors but I kept waiting for something to happen. Poor Maryam never developed into a person she was so caught up in trying to be a proper American. I will read another of her books since she is so well thought of 
 This book is for the beginner and offers no information that cannot be found (for free) on other internet sites. It appears as if the author has written this book to make his methodology clearer to himself and in the process decided to sell it as a book. No earth shattering revelations to be found and definately not enough good quality examples.   A bit disappointed in the content but this book will be a good read for an absolute newbie in the field.  
 I just could not get into this book. After several attempts to read I had to finally say that I just did not feel that the characters had enough depth to be enticing. However, I sure was captured by the cover 
 I did not purchase this book.  I had the luxury of checking it out at my local library for FREE.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME buying this book.  I've read the majority of the book & I'm sick & tired of these author type people capitalizing on other people's desires and emotions.  FACT:  Everyone wants to be rich and have a more comfortable lifestyle.  Do not lead people to buy your book if you cannot present them with useable knowledge!  I will save you the hours of time it takes to read this waste of time & tell you what the authors are trying to tell you.  This is their hidden message........"Find a really good idea & go for it!"  Wow!  Great idea!  News to me?  I think not.  That's it.  The whole book boiled down to that.  There are plenty of good books out there for any interested in becoming wealthier and/or living a more comfortable lifestyle.  This isn't one 
  An extremely convoluted read. Another reader mentioned "dizzying" and I concur. Chock full of psyco-babble and others' personal stories that I found uninspiring.  The numerous exercises Myss requires of you to dissect past emotional events, felt somehow unhealthy and too self-absorbing. How can one be objective about the dynamics of past painful events since our perspective of them can change dramatically with time?      The author's voice was to me that of a least favorite professor in college. You know, the one class you would nod off on occasion? I took alot of effort for me to get through the first lengthy chapter, which I did, indeed, fall asleep around page 83.     However, the bottom line for me was the lack of joy in the authors words. I found Myss overcomplicating, and over intellectualizing too many fundamental Spiritual practicalities and principles. This book would seem better off in "general psychology" and not in the "Self-help/improvement" section of the bookstore. The over-analytical process could be enough to send someone in crisis over the edge.    
 Dont pay attention to any of these 4 & 5 star reviews. This album is a complete waste of time & space in anyones music library 
 I have no doubt Will Eisner's intentions were noble in writing this book. I'm also not here to disparage a widely acknowledged great in the comics industry. And yet...   It comes as no surprise that this emanates from a series of academic lectures as it smacks of a non-academic striving desperately both to sound learned and informed and to give serious academic weight to a subject generally percieved as throwaway entertainment.   Will Eisner was a great, but a great of a very different era and as such he has very little relevance visually to the world of comics today. That's not to say he's inferior to a lot of the hacks passing themselves off as 'cartoonists' these days, but if you want to work in that industry as an artist (thus producing sequential ART) then this book is a fraction of the use of the superior (that's right SUPERIOR) Scott McCloud book "Understanding Comics".   So do yourself a favour and buy that instead.   Oh, and using lots of big (and inappropriate to the medium) words doesn't make you sound smart, either.   Sorry 
 Prejudiced and unobjective account of the CAMI joint venture in Ontario.  The authors, (two sociology professors and a union bureaucrat) are guilty of sloppy research and pro-union bias.  Their much emphasized  "unlimited access to the shop floor" was apparently wasted.  This  book is a golden example of a wasted opportunity.  Still, it serves as an  example of why transplants usually stay non-union 
 My son and I have had the same experience with this sticker maker.  Great fun for the first 5-10 stickers but then the sticker role jammed and I did not have the opportunity to give the insides a good look before I was desparately trying to remember how it all went back together.  Too bad...he loved it while it lasted 
 I find it difficult to believe that someone who endorses 9-11 conspiracy theories (see the authors review of "9-11 Mysteries" on December 7th)  could be viewed as an authority on intelligence issues.  If he ever had any credibility in the field, he's long since gone over the deep end.  Ironically, its people like him and his ilk, who believe a neconservative/Israeli conspiracy was behind the destruction of the twin towers, that best undermine the central premise of his book:  that ordinary citizens need to take a greater role in intelligence.  If 9-11 conspiracy theories are the sort of  mind-numbingly stupid, paranoid output that can be expected from the sort of amatuer intelligence agents Steele wishes for, I'd prefer to leave it to professionals 
 The problem I have with a book like this isn't necessarily the premise. I agree there are some kids with a profound amount of energy, intuition, and desire to change the world. The problem I do have is with the movements as a whole, that fill a kid's head with extremely lofty ideas... and then what?  Well, nothing. You're expired goods after 18 I guess! You were apparently supposed to transcend space and time and save all of humanity and shoot roses out of your butt, but it didn't happen so let's look to the NEXT generation of children. What? Wait a minute... I'm still here.   There you have a problem to the whole new age and gifted and idealistic movements. They're looking at children and tiny blocks of time, and almost 100% abandoning everyone else's potential after the fact. No wonder Christianity is staging a guilt and hate ridden comeback... this movement simply isn't making making enough waves in institutions and suggesting what GROWN UP's can do. The new age remains insular unto itself, and the mainstream remains full of idiocy, hatred, and stupidity. I hope things change and I hope honestly some people in this realm can start proposing very long term society centered objectives, and stop saying the world will end in light beams every 10 years. (It will not, trust me. 
 On the surface, you can't really argue with a book compiling Strummer-related writings from people like Lester Bangs, Greil Marcus, Sylvie Simmons and Ann Scanlon. Much of the material between the covers has previously appeared elsewhere, but never before with such a stunning array of glorious typos.   Unfortunately, Mr D'Ambrosio dually blows his cred as both a writer and an editor before he even finishes what serves as his introduction. "London Calling was recorded in New York City" (p. 11)? No, I don't think so, but close...it was recorded in London. Hence the title, geddit? But it's a spattering of mis-information, disguised as matter-of-fact statements, such as "In an ironic twist, on December 22 he would perform (with Mick Jones) for the last time ever at a benefit for striking firemen in London" which ultimately made me dismiss the book without a whole lot of further reading and fling it across the room. December 22 was, as fact-fans worldwide will note, actually the sad day of Mr Strummer's passing, which would clearly rule out any chances of playing a gig (with or without Mick Jones), let alone making it up to the microphone.   Picking the nit? Maybe, but not when there are absolutely fantastic books out there at the moment which do quite an honourable bit of justice to Joe Strummer's memory and legacy. My recommendation, then, would be to bypass this book altogether and make a dash with cash for Pat Gilbert's "Passion is a Fashion: the Real Story of The Clash" or Kris Needs' "Joe Strummer & The Legend of The Clash."  Mr D'Ambrosio's book, unfortunately, smacks of a careless cash-in with little regard for factual accuracy or careful editing. To state that "some people are missing the point reading it like a biography...that is so dumb and pathetic" -- as the remarkably forgiving and splendidly lenient C.C. Ho of Minneapolis has so eloquently stated above -- is no excuse for such an over-abundence of mis-information and fallacies to be presented as facts.  If some guys have all the luck, then clearly none of them are spending money on this particular book 
 It had been years since I'd heard this and thought I would add it to my collection, now I know why it has been years since I listened to it, I'll continue with my CCW, Bob Seger, Fleetwood Mac.. 
 Once,when I was working,I had only this album&a couple of others to listen to.For some reason,I didn't go for Nickelback.It's just a lot of groaning&whining.This isn't worth anyone's time or money.I'm happy with my world music collection,and I'm glad I haven't spent a cent on Nickelback.Every song SOUNDS THE SAME!!!! 
 Hmm, quite a disappointment, especially after splurging on the hardcover edition.  Set as a kind of "Rockies Rear Window," this is one slow story.  Endless pages of crazy-making when I'd already guessed the outcome about halfway through.  Finally skipped ahead to finish the book.  I had really looked forward to Angels Fall, too :(  If you are a Roberts fan, don't spend the money on the hardcover, wait for the paperback, go to the library, or borrow from a friend.  Not worth the price. 
 peeps, if you want a good ministry album, try amazon.CO.UK!!  The club scene is MUCH bigger there and has the best DJ's in the world and so .co.uk has a much bigger choice of dance albums!  Check it out 
 this book is so deeply biased and prejudiced against its main subject (Werner Heisenberg) that it cannot be taken seriously even for the few relevant things it has to say. Moreover the author is so aggressive (almost violent)against what he calls "german culture" (this label already suggests a lot) that his criticism borders on cultural racism. I deeply regret the time and money I spent in reading and buying this book 
 I can't believe someone actually made this movie. The writing seems like its out of a high-school drama class. I would never pay for this movie and i 'm glad my room-mate paid for it. He paid $1 and that was by far WAY too much. The only thing that I can say I got out of this movie is that i can see any movie in the world and it will be better than this. If i ever saw Dean Kain in person i would punch him in the face 
 There was something about this book that reminded me of a mosquito.  From the first page on it began sucking.  Being a lover of nature I felt that love drain away as I continued reading.  The author's excessive use of metaphor was too much in itself, not to mention the fact that his descriptions were terribly cheesy. I found myself exercising my gagging reflex to no end.  The other repulsive factor involved the author continually refering to himself.  Since he is the author it is only obvious to conclude that indeed these thoughts are solely his; the fact that he kept reminding me of this led me to feel that what I was reading derived from pure arrogance.  The ideas in this book are not as complex as the author insists, only if you take into account the way he presents them. Any form of theory can become garbled when muddled with overwhelming language.  While the points he was trying to make were legitimate, the way he presented them was a major turn off.  I had to put it down before I fulfilled my urge to go chop down an ancient forest, or at least light a match to my own backyard.   
 Loser by Jerry Spinelli could have been an interesting and overall good book but, in my opinion it was not because it was rushed and undeveloped.  The book chronicles the life of Donald Zinkoff from his first day of kindergarten to his last day of eighth grade in a mere two hundred pages.  Thus no grade is well developed and neither is any character but the loveable loser and main character Donald Zinkoff.  This book was attempting to give a good message about the life through school of a loser.  Because it is hard to go through your time in school with out true friends or any real interests to speak of let alone to be unatheletic on top of it.  But although the message was no doubt an outstanding one, it left much to be desired as a whole 
 Dr. Dolittle has fallen afoul of the PC police, well before they were so named.  This edition is heavily adulterated to maintain political correctness.  Unfortunately, you must read the afterword to understand this.  A great story, a bad edition 
 This book has major shortcomings; Stein's obsession with character over plot, for one (Martin Amis said, "I used to sneer at plot until I wrote a novel that had one, titled NIGHT TRAIN. It was HARD and I used stay awake at night hoping I wasn't leaving any holes."), another being his obsession with "show don't tell" (Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel LOVE IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA is probably the greatest novel of the 1980's and it's almost entirely "tell" and very little "show.") And the passages Stein includes from his own novels as examples of good writing were actually examples of terrible writing! (A taxi "disengorging" its passengers is categorically bad writing.) And Stein admits he rejected Frederick Forythe's THE DAY OF THE JACKAL. I wouldn't read a book by Dick Rowe about how to make it in the music business (Rowe famously rejected the Beatles from Decca Records). Stein excuses himself that he was going by only an outline, but then Rowe was going by just a demo tape. Better writing books are out there 
 I love all kinds of books, and I have been reading romance novels for about 15 years now, and I can honestly say this was one of the worst I have ever read. The writing is so bad, I had to post something. She actually writes at one point that he looks at her "unquestioningly," and then he asks her a question. What is that? And I found a few mistakes in the book which should have been caught in the editing process. Don't waste your time or your money on this book. There are so many other great romance writers out there 
  I WOULD RATE THIS ITEM -0- STAR BUT IT IS NOT AN OPTION.  THERE ARE TOO MANY STYLES/MODELS. IT IS VERY CONFUSING. CHECK ITEM SPECIFICS CAREFULLY TO AVOID GETTING THE WRONG STYLE/MODEL.  THIS VACUUM HAS STATIONARY BRUSHES. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND PAY THE DIFFERENCE FOR THE MODELS W/ SPIN-SCRUB 
 This book is so appalling that I honestly do not understand why a publisher would put out something like this.  It is almost 300 pages of what looks like a power point presentation.  There is hardly a complete sentence in the entire book- just bullet points.  As a reader I am disgusted at this format and hope that this is not a sign of things to come. I simply could not "read" this book.  The presentation is terrible. There are no proper sentences, no paragraphs and therefore little in the way of intelligent analysis.  Not being illiterate I hated it because its message was impossible to decipher. Who knows what it is about -   I wish I could give it zero stars. 
 Hahaha. Bubblegum music at its finest. There are definately better singers out there that can ACUTALLY sing, unlike Ciara. Garbage lmao. Those one songs, what are they called, 1, 2 Step and Goodies. LOL! Bubblegum, and why is Ludacris on that song "Oh". Sellooouuuttt! LOL. For reals though, if you seriously payed more than 10 bucks of your hard earned money for this. Ouch 
 This review concerns the unabridged audiobook of The Last Camel Died at Noon read by Susan O'Malley. I have read that book before and I am a fan of the Amelia Peadody-series which I have read completely. The books vary in quality but they are always enjoyable. The present title is one of the most unique stories - best explained as being a satirical citation of Henry Rider Haggards SHE. I also like audiobooks and last year I first heard a Peabody-novel narrated by Barbara Rosenblat. It was quite a treat. I wasn't able to get "The last Camel.." read by her then, but was content to order this unabridged version read by Susan O'Malley. However, it was the worst audiobook I ever listened to. ...I therefore recommend that if one ever want's to listen to an Elizabeth Peters audiobook than only if Barbara Rosenblat is the narrator. Anything else would be  selfdeceit. Rosenblat even turns the weaker episodes into celebrations (all by Recordedbooks) 
 I began my study of political philosophy with the best - namely Plato - so I suppose that when I began reading Aristotle's The Politics, I was optimistic.  That optimism didn't last.  I find that Aristotle takes many arguments for granted and ignores entirely others that would call into question some of his premises.  Often while reading The Politics, I found his analysis entirely lackluster, and his criticisms of The Republic, Gorgias and Laws (all by Plato) flawed or at least overly simplistic.  It's not that I'm incapable of appreciating the brand of philosophy Aristotle uses, after all I do consider myself more or less a realist.  But rather I did find it lacking of vision and insight.  Aristotle focuses on such parochial matters such as classifications of constitutions and mastery over slaves in the household versus statesmanship in the nation, that it never moved me or left me in deeply pensive state.  Ultimately, if you want to be truly inspired - read Plato, not Aristotle 
 Wolfe hero worships the Irish, and all others rank below them.  The Irish detective Martin, DAs Fitzgibbon and Caughey can do no wrong. The Italians, Jews and Wasps have their good points, but are flawed in one way or another. At the bottom are the "dark people" as Wolfe constantly calls them, who have created a great, dark hole in our once-great society. There is the single exception that proves the rule of the black public defender, though the narrative implies that his legal skills are inferior.  Granted it's an entertaining read, but don't be fooled 
 Well, if anything this was a decently written story, with good dialect and character detail. However, this story felt like it was going around in circles without any indication of ever ending. Grafton seems to have an idea of where she wants to go with this story but never really gets there.    The story starts off with PI Kinsey Milhone in her office at night when she hears a knock on her door. She opens it to find Janice Kepler, mother of Lorna Kepler standing before her with the tale of her daughter's mysterious death. Not only this, but she also explains to Kinsey about how no one ever solved the murder because Lorna's body was left to decompose for ten months in her isolated cabin house. They talk for a while about the strange circumstances surrounding her daughter's death until Janice tells Kinsey about a pornographic video that was sent to her house after Lorna's death. This tape leads Kinsey on a wild goose chase of suspects in the red light district and gets her nowhere when it comes to turning over the real murderer.   	Millhone dives even further and searches through the world of Lorna's day job where she uncovers a mysterious lead about an expensive, elaborate project which is angering several people a considerable amount. Kinsey also checks up on Lorna's family members, and with the exception of Janice, all seem to have a motive to murder her Lorna.  	 Not being a fan of these types of novels, I decided to at least give it a chance but this story got me nowhere. By the middle of the novel I wanted to give up and skip to the end of the story, but when I got to the end I had to go back to the middle to figure out how everything ended. I stopped caring about the whole murder after so much more emphasis was placed on so much side stories and it seemed like Grafton did too. The ending left me with a strange feeling and I didn't know if the book had actually ended. All in all, it was just not the right kind of book for me but if you're a murder mystery fan, try any other of Grafton's alphabet themed novels besides this one 
 I found this book very boring. Tyler does a good job on detailing the charictors but I kept waiting for something to happen. Poor Maryam never developed into a person she was so caught up in trying to be a proper American. I will read another of her books since she is so well thought of 
 This was one of the WORST movies I have ever seen -- and I LOVE college movies!  The acting was horrible and the plot was dumb and simply a rip-off of other movies.  It simply wasn't funny, and the gross-out jokes really pushed the limit -- anybody's limit!  The lead actor does a HORRIBLE impression of Chevy Chase during the whole movie -- go rent Fletch if you want to watch a quality movie with that type of character.  And, most laughably of all, one of the main characters is Teck, from the Real World on MTV!  He's not an actor, he's just a reality tv nobody, so what the heck is he doing in this movie?  This movie went straight to video for a reason, so avoid it at all costs 
 Angela continues to exacerbate the the polemics within the Catholic Church today.  Her vision of a Church, and that same vision shared by Joan Chittister, Frances Kissling, Rosemary Reuther, et. al. exists.  It is called The Episcopal Church.  One can find within the Episcopal Church a framework and a theology that shares elements of the Catholic Church, including The Eucharist.  Why do these women insist on trying to make the Catholic Church over in their own image? If a woman, or a man for that matter, is having problem with authority and the way it is exercised by our Holy Father in Rome, then please have the conviction to leave the Church and enter into a Church that offers everything you desire.  Or is it that, like Satan herself, these women cannot stand anything beautiful and seek to destroy that which is beautiful and has stood the test of time? The Catholic Church has always championed the role of women.  It is also obvious that the sexual revolution of the 1960's and widespread use of contraception has done nothing for women as a whole except perpetuate the myth that women are men's playthings.  we must remember that in the 1500's, when Martin Luther was arguing that women should be barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen, the Catholic Church supported women in the role of Queens, teachers, nurses, doctors, and spiritual guides, among other vocations.  If one wants our Catholic Church to become Episcopalian, then please enter that same Church, for one obviously has no desire to submit oneself to the authority of the Holy Father, who was given his authority by Christ Himself. Without the male only priesthood, we would cease to be Catholic, and we would cease to have access to the Real Presence of Christ in our Holy Eucharist. 
 i loved marques houston in immature/imx.  his first solo cd was good.  he's a decent actor as well.  this cd, however, does not match up AT ALL with other stuff he's done.  all because of u and naked were good songs (and naked was a good video ;) )  i think there was one other good song - but, i sold this cd to a used cd store about 2 weeks after i got it.  i couldnt even listen to most of the songs all the way through.  boring.  vulgar language.  mh is just trying too hard by using the n-word a lot and talking dirty.  sex music can be classy - but not on his cd.  i was soooooooooooooooo disappointed with this piece of crap cd.  do NOT buy it!!!!  
 This "author", and I use that term loosely, has the nerve to write several "customer reviews" (as opposed to editorial reviews, which she is obviously not qualified to do) on several ground breaking amd creative books regarding social and economic conditions. For what reason? To shamelessly promote her own book. This is a pathetic attempt to plug her own work, and its a disgrace to legitimate authors. She ought to be ashamed of herself, not only for her comments, but for this pathetic literary attempt. Shame on you Kathy Sherman. 
 The reason why I do not think this is a good book on Nietzsche is because, even though I admire Deleuze outside his Nietzsche schoarship, it is the attempt to systemize Nietzsche's thought.  This text is notorious, at least I believe and from the conversations on it that I have had with others, for being just down right bad because of the way in which Deleuze attempts to appropriate Nietzsche into some sort of systemized philosophical position.  I know this does not get to the particulars of the book and what Deleuze argues, take this review as a gentle warning: if you love Nietzsche for all that Nietzsche is and what he has done, this book may proove to be a dissapointment.  Honestly, I find it all to often (and i do realize that there is a level of interpretation at play) that students and readers of Nietzsche go about their studies of Nietzsche in a very casual and lax way, identifying with his style as a means in which serious and penetrating study of Nietzsche is overlooked.  All I can say, is read Nietzsche for yourself (in German if you can) and dont think that the will to power counts, for more info on that read my review on it 
 Richard Dawkins has been the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University for quite a few years now.  And he regularly lectures on evolution in the USA. Yet that same period of time has seen a decline in the number of UK students wanting to study the sciences at university, and a significant rise in various forms of opposition to evolutionist ideas, particularly so-called Intelligent Design.  Whilst I DON'T want to make a direct link between these two facts it does appear that we can learn a lesson here - and one which both Dawkins and Shanks have noticeably failed to grasp:  However good the case for evolution may be, and however flawed the opposing arguments may be, the "war of words" is NOT being won by the defenders of evolution theory.  Hey, guys, wake up and smell the coffee - YOU AREN'T MAKING CONTACT!  And this book, written in a manner that is virtually guaranteed to re-inforce every reader's existing viewpoint, be it pro or anti, is nothing but a waste of perfectly good trees.  As in so many other books on the subject, the author depends on allegedly "rational/factual" arguments to make his case.  But what he overlooks is a simple fact known to every psychologist - people don't make decisions based on reason, they make them on the basis of "gut instinct", for want of a better expression, then they rationalize their choice later - if necessary.  So, if you already believe what Shanks and Dawkins believe, then you'll believe what's in this book.  If you don't, you won't.  And like it or hate it, THAT is a genuine "fact" 
 This 1958 film of Graham Greene's novel is interesting today mostly as an historical artifact. It is not a particularly outstanding example of the art of cinema, just a dated melodrama in which the location exteriors in Saigon lead to interior dialogue scenes that are stagy and leaden and obviously take place on unconvincing studio sets. It is admittedly fascinating to see some of the exact same Saigon locations that were used in the 2002 film, and Michael Redgrave does bring a weight and soul to the role of Fowler.  Sadly, however, the film brutalizes his character. Where Greene's novel was about a world-weary Brit, confronted with a blindly idealistic American willing to sacrifice innocent lives in the name of his goals, the film inverts everything. Pyle is a virtual saint and Fowler merely the gullible old man who plays a part in Pyle's downfall not out of a desire to protect the innocent, but simply to rid himself of a romantic rival. It is not difficult to see why Graham Greene was incensed by the film and disowned it.  Fascinatingly, director/screenwriter Joe Mankiewicz manages to make this total change largely by the addition of one scene at the end. His film basically follows Greene's novel, up until [SPOILER WARNING!] an atrocious final scene in which we learn that Fowler has been hoodwinked all along by the Communists, and has destroyed a noble American who was genuinely bringing freedom and hope to Indochina. A prescient warning about America's doomed involvement in Vietnam becomes a piece of jingoistic propaganda to support the war.  The 2002 film, in comparison, is amazingly faithful to the novel. I don't always hold that as the measure of a film's success, but with a master storyteller like Greene, why mess with perfection. Do not choose this film if you want accomplished filmmaking, or an accurate interpretation of Graham Greene's intentions, for that pick up Phillip Noyce's 2002 film. Watch this only afterwards, to see how a few small changes can undermine an entire narrative. 
 A bit disappointing...  I guess I expected more, because I was told when I purchased this book that it was the best of the IN THE GARDEN trilogy. And that stands to reason when you expect the last to be the best.  After all, isn't that when it's supposed to all come together? Not to mention that I did enjoy Black Rose-5-star and thought Blue Dahlia 3-star was an average read.  Several of the novels with the NR seal have been about the supernatural and I have enjoyed most of those books.  Plus, when you see the NR seal, it's almost a given to be a good read. And you'll note I emphasized "almost", because, obviously, you can please some of the people some of the time, but not all the people all the time. And so it was with Red Lily.  The ending to this trilogy was a disappointment for me, especially after the first two novels. Hayley's character lost something in this book. Maybe I was just expecting her to mature. She didn't. Therefore, I have a hard time understanding how a guy like Harper could get hung up on such a childish person. And Roz, a very strong woman, just fizzed out. Grant it, the plot wasn't, and wasn't supposed to be, centered on her.  Regardless, she just wasn't the same as I'd expected. Overall, it was mostly the plot that didn't turn me on.  This one was just a bit too far-fetched. And to be quite honest, the ending just fell flat. Oh well, two out of three ain't bad. ;-)  
 I love Jim Lehrer's news program, and I had heard that he was a prolific writer, and I am a passionate student of Civil War history, so you can imagine my delight when I saw this book for sale at the giftshop at the Antietam National Battlefield, having just visited Burnside's Bridge. The cover blurb was fascinating, the story looked fun -- and the book is 10% off at the park!  Alas, I must add my voice to the chorus here. Mr. Lehrer ain't no Hemingway. The story begins well, then rapidly begins introducing one-dimensional characters and implausible plot twists. I finished the book wishing that the story had ended a chapter or two earlier.  A final comment: if Mr. Lehrer wanted to deeply address the subject of futile infantry charges, ordered by incompetent commanders and made inevitable by gaps between technology and tactics, there are far better historical places where he could have done so -- all within easy reach of Mr. Lehrer's home in Washington. Frederickburg and Cold Harbor come to mind, but I'm sure there are many others 
 We're deep into the formula now with computer animated films -- and Over The Hedge is one of the most tired of the bunch. Can anyone say Buzz and Woody? Chicken Run? The Exterminator is the stock villain in CGI movies --almost identical to the vintage toy collector in Toy Story 2. How many times can you do the A-bomb joke...  Worse still is the dialogue, the painfully unfunny one-liners, and the  see-saw animation that is either dull or like a pinball machine with sight gags and explosions. It is clear that each of these animators are trying to outdo one another, and that once again we see a cleverly-disguised lack of locations -- or interest. There must be nothing easier to craft and render than endless rows of geometric homes and a single proscenium of forest. This film is a by-the-numbers piece of merchandising with very little genuine artistry. 
 I've enjoyed Wendy Wasserstein's work, so I expected more from her. I THOUGHT I'd find some real humor.  This little book is boring.  A 300-word article would have been more than enough. It's not funny, not interesting, not entertaining, nor does it offer any real point.  These "books" will probably be the sort of thing you give as a joke birthday/retirement gift, or "collect"  yourself, just to have a "set," thinking they might be "worth something" or "meaningful" someday.  I kept hoping for the book to go from a dwaddle to a trot, but it was the same yawn.  A cursory read, 10 minutes tops, is about all you'll need-- it continues as it begins, so no need to read more than a few pages. I doubt I'd follow-up with the other 6 sins if they lack the depth and wit of this one.  
 Context: I've been developing software for 12 years (C++, Java, JavaScript, PERL and more).  I've been using .Net (VB) for 2 years and C# for about 1 year.  Another guy I know from work bought this book. He seemed to like it because of the short descriptions for each of the recipes.   That is exactly why I don't like the book.    Okay, short descriptions would be okay, except many of them don't even provide example code or completely explain the solution.  I'm looking at recipe "1.14. Manage the Global Assembly Cache" right now and there is nothing about the winnt\assembly directory in there.  Why not?  Instead the author only explains gacutil /i and /u.  Okay, but what does that do?  How is it significant?  Why do I want or not want my assembly in the gac?    Recipe "1.8. Create and Manage Strong-Named Key Pairs" is the same thing.  He tells me how to use the sn.exe tool, but he does not tell me anything more about why or how.  Very weak.  But the ones that really kill me are the ones where the author has a chance to really describe the thing using a code example, but then fails to do so.  For example, "Recipe 1.4. Create and Use a Code Library" begs to have some sample code, but none is provided.  "1.3 Create and use a code module" was the same thing.    The section titles promise so much, the text delivers so little 
 Silly me.  I thought perspectives meant more than one view.  This book,  while claiming to be an indifferent look at the New Age Movement, obviously  is written by staunch backers of the Movement with too few exceptions to be  considered balanced.  People shouldn't pretend to be scholarly when they're  simply being cheerleaders for an idea 
 I am a layman who is looking for a guide to herbs that would help me identify herbs in the wild. My expectation was that the photographs in  A Field Guide to Western Medicinal Plants and Herbs would be fantastic and would help me ID plants in the wild with confidence. I was not pleased at all.  The photographs in this book are thumbnail size and often show only the flowers of the plants in question. The book itself is of a tiny size and affords little space to have "real" close-up photographs of leaves and overall look of the plant in-situ.  I would contrast this "Reader's Digest" version of a book made to identify plants in the wild with Roger Phillips' Mushrooms And Other American Fungi Of North America. This book is a full 11 3/4" X 8 3/4" and has photographs that fill a whole page, in some cases. I think it is fair to say that every photograph in Roger's book is larger than ANY picture in A Field Guide to Western Medicinal Plants and Herbs, whose photographs are attributed Stephen Foster. A quick view of Foster's web site shows similar "thumbnail" sized photographs. I am greatly disappointed!  The text contained within A Field Guide to Western Medicinal Plants and Herbs pales in comparison with what can be found on line.  I am hoping RHS Encyclopedia of Herbs and Their Uses gives a better view and history of the plants.  In closing, I would say this book should be the last on your list - not the first 
 The book is definitely nicely dressed, but now I have no faith in its value. Lots of false reviews...Buyer be awar 
      This novel could have been a long short story or a novella. One event takes place in the story and Perez-Reverte milks it for all he can. There are plenty of  historical  persons such as poets, playwrights, and painters thrown it. This is basically a one episode tale. I rate this a B-. 
 I read a lot. A LOT. And rarely have I read a book that I really, really didn't like, but this is one of them. There is such a lack of dialogue, and the author repeats her same thoughts over and over. I swear, if I would have had to read the words "four years" one more time (referring to the main character's failed relationship) I would have hurt somebody. There was so much that could have been done with this book. But, by the time she actually gets the house, you've been bored stiff for four years and don't much care. It seems to be that it was poorly edited, and there is a lot of awkward grammar. I was really disappointed. 
 may be okay if you take it to a climate controlled office, but not much good as an outdoors job food jar. 
 An accessible story with all the elements of a Great American Novel was somehow transformed into a perverse, worst of the worst ABC Afterschool Specials. If you had not read the book, you would be unable to follow what was happening. Some of the worst directing and editing I have seen in a long time. The original Evil Dead, with all its flaws, is a better put together film than this one. This movie is flat-out painful to watch. You get no justifications whatsoever as to why the characters behave as they do. It all seems so random. Read the book. If you see this movie in a rental store, just move along, please, nothing to see here 
 I have nearly 100 'baby name' books. Lansky's books are among the most shoddily researched. He also employs tactics to beef up his almighty name count such as misspelling names and adding each misspelling as a separate name in its own right and he even sometimes gives these misspellings different meanings from its correctly spelled root name. He also garners more numbers by adding male names to the female side, euphemistically femininizing their meanings to match the switch. I check the accuracy of each book I get with some easily researchable 'benchmark' names (Alexandra, Benjamin, William, etc) and even with these 'gimmies' he has around a 60% accuracy. That's not even counting the names that comprise the majority of his books, tribal-type names, such as from Africa, Native American tribes, and even those from Celtic roots. I wonder, would Webster get away with 60% accuracy? Certainly not and the same standards of accuracy and research should be applied to name books as well. The thing I find redeeming about Lansky's books is that it's full of outrageously spelled oddities, making it perfect for finding a name for your elven wizard in your next Dungeons and Dragons game 
 This is a compilation of the career of Oasis thus far, eh?  How can the career and history of Oasis be summed up?  It makes sense to go right to the band's source, Noel Gallagher.  Here are some of his quotes.  Read 'em first if you are thinking of buying this CD:  "With every song that I write, I compare it to the Beatles. I didn't start writing songs until I was about fourteen, so I just used to copy theirs."  "We're the best band on the planet. That's not arrogance, that's just a fact."   "All I ever wanted to do was make a record. Here's what you do: you pick up your guitar, you rip a few people's tunes off, you swap them round a bit, get your brother in the band, punch his head in every now and again, and it sells."  Noel's brother Liam was asked about Oasis in general, and he had this to say:  "We are bigger than Jesus. We will be as big as the Beatles, if not bigger."  They are behind the material on this album (sometimes referred to as a greatest hits CD).  Think about it.  We can at least know that Liam's claim rings false.  Oasis (mercifully) is not bigger than Jesus.  As for the Beatles, this CD was put out on the same day (to rival, maybe???) the new Beatles "Love" CD.  Let's look at the Amazon Sales Rank.  As of today, Beatles "Love" is #3 on Amazon's top 10 Music list.  "Stop the Clocks" is at #3,715.  Music fans have made their choice.  Save your money!  Or better yet, spend it on good, original British music.  The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Jethro Tull...the list goes on 
 The book has a catchy title but do NOT expect to find anything of value inside. Just the usual comments like "always use a stop", "don't overtrade", "use a sound money management", "stay disciplined" and blah blah blah...  This book is a total joke, save your money and run  
 This book is poorly organized, badly written, and so difficult as to be virtually incomprehensible to all but the most advanced mathematics students. Even the infrequent examples skip so many steps that they are hard to follow. Do not torture yourself with this book unless it is absolutely required - and unless first you have vigorously but unsuccessfully lobbied against its use.  Pair this textbook with a sub-par instructor and you will be living a nightmare.  Surely there is a more user- friendly option available 
 I was so frustrated with those so called "sticky mats", my hands would slide forward in simple poses like downward facing dog.  So I decided to give the $50 skidless yoga towel a try. This worked pretty well for my slipping hands, but i had a new problem.  I was unable to get traction for my feet and felt as though they would slip up when in many of the commonly practiced poses in yoga.  (downward facing dog, even poses like triangle and extended side angle).  I really tried giving this towel a chance but ended up purchasing a harmony yoga mat (those rubber mats) which greatly reduced my slippery yoga experiences. I would not recommend the skidless towel for your entire mat, maybe you may have better luck with just the hand towel. I realized with yoga mats that every person is different, so what doesn't work for me, may work for you.  I just thought I would give my 2 cents 
 Only the gullible would believe this slanted garbage. The sex list is a major break in the understanding of Kerouac, too bad Amburn tries to make him a one dimensional person. The main premise in the book is that Kerouac  was afraid that his homosexual leanings would become common knowledge. In  many interviews mentioned by Amburn, Kerouac talks about his homosexual  activity. He shouted in a NYC bar that he had sex with Gore Vidal. The  sexlist kept by Kerouac includes homosexual encounters. The more  information Amburn gives about Kerouac's "fear" of being found  out, the more laughable the book's premise becomes. Amburn's weak claim of  being a friend of Kerouac (over and over he mentions that Vanity of Dulouz  is dedicated to him) is amusing when compared to his own words about  Kerouac and previous editor Robert Giroux, "Failing to realize that  the author-editor relationship is strictly business, Kerouac had naively  assumed Giroux to be his friend for life..." Amburn knew a positive  book wouldn't sell so he took the low road and dug up a bunch of stale  dirt 
 Too much psychobabble with little practical help that hasn't been offered a thousand times before.  The book should focus more on the opportunities the giftedness creates for the child both in education and in living a richer life.  Developing the "hungry mind" is key, and not letting the child's curiosity be stifled by a lowest-common-denominator public schooling system.  A much better book was "Bringing Out the Best:  A Resource Guide for Parents of Young Gifted Children.&quot 
 more thought needs to be put into the design of this produc 
 If you think these songs are familiar, with a familiar arrangement, you are right.  This CD is IDENTICAL to "Bluegrass From Heaven: The Essential Gospel Collection, Various Artists".  If you already own the latter, don't bother purchasing "The Absolute Best of Bluegrass Gospel".  Actually, the music is 5-stars *****, I just considered it deceitful marketing to re-release a CD under a different name 
 I have not recieved this movie yet.  I am still waiting for it 
 Nickel and Dimed is about the author's experience of being a poor white women trying to pass off as a part of the working class. The book hits on several good points but she could have gotten the same information in an interview. A better book on the poor and not getting by is The Working Poor: Invisible in America 
 One has to wade through quite a maze of disinformation in order to arrive anything of real value in this palimpsest.  But, for those with extraordinary patience, there is some small modicum of value.  Bamford bores the reader at first with a very detailed, and absurd, recapitulation of the government's ridiculous tale relative to the "911" disaters, complete with impossible "cell" phone calls from high up in the atmosphere and implausible reactions on the part of government agencies that simply failed to act.  Most of this seems to be intended to portray George Walker Bush as the bumbling fool that he is.  We didn't need all this evidence, Mr. Bamford.  That case has already been well made.  Finally, near the end, Bamford gets to the thesis:  that the "911" disaster was nothing more than a pretext for the Iraq War.  One wonders why the reader was taken on such a convoluted path to arrive at such an obvious conclusion.  More than anything else, this book appears to be a partisan attack on the absurdity of the Bush administration and its foreign policy.  A more factual account would have been more efficacious.  We cannot, in good conscience, recommend this book 
 In concept, this is a great toy.  In design, however, it has many flaws.  The backdrop piece just does not stay attached!  (I actually fun-tacked it to the wall behind where Cloud Kingdom sits in my daughter's playroom.)  The Clouds pieces, while very pretty, are just not solid enough to hold up.  And be sure to make plenty of space for this toy because it takes up 3 feet of room and does not fold away for storage.  My 4-year-old does not seem to mind any of this, though.  It really does inspire her imaginative play as she flies her pegasi through the sky 
 I needed to purchase this book for my graduate class in biochemistry.  I found it to be NOT user friendly in the least.  Most books I have used for biochemistry come with a great set of definitions.  This book not only doesn't come with an appendix with definitions but doesn't explicitely define words in the text.  I finally found the "definitions" appendix at the only website (how nice of them...and how cheap can you get.  Most books if they have a website also have definitions in the back).   I should also mention it does not have a thorough index.  Major subjects are neither defined nor shown in the index.  Several times I had to go to either my organic chem book (Morrison & Boyd...great book), the Lippencotes (spelling) biochemistry review text (also a great concise book), or my under graduate biochemistry book (and study guide.  Garrett and Grisham) to find information due to either the lack of information in this book or difficulty in finding it. Also, the layout of the book is terrible.  Although proteins are now THE significant phase of biochemistry, the introduction of DNA and mRNA in later portions of the book is rediculous.  If you follow the basic flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to Protein it is much more easily understood.  Throwing in the flow of genetic information at chapter 5 and later in chapter 27 discussing DNA replication, RNA synthesis and splicing (ch 28) and protein production (ch 29) makes no sense whatsoever.  The order is correct but to place this information at the back of the book when it is necessary to understand some of the basic systems of the cell is rediculous.  It is like learning all the organic chemistry reactions without understanding the basics and reasoning behind organic chemistry. 
 I have issues with racism in any form but I find it equally as offensive when books like this come out which try and make a race out to be victims.    In a nutshell, if someone is complaining that they are being taken advantage of and still being paid 40 million, or even 1 million, one has to ask themselves, "Is this guy for real?  How stupid does he think we are?"  I place the authors intentions of writing as fair and just, but somewhere along the line he corrupted the concept into something grotesque, offensive, and just plain wrong.  I could have read and Ann Coulter book and been less offended by the implications 
 The stuff in this book might be true, but that doesn't mean I'm going to change my life just to please some man. I always have a choice and the man in my life can either accept that, or go find another woman. End of story 
 This book does not provide enough examples, and the few they do give are nothing like the work problems. Every teacher I've had has said if they were not required to use it, they would use a different book. And on top of that, it is ridiculously expensive!  I have finally been forced to get another text book, and it is much better (and cheaper). Do not get this book if you have a choice 
 This magazine used to be THICK, fun to read, full of information. But that was about 5 years ago. Now it's just a flimsy looking mag filled with vulgarities and non-sense. The editorial is almost always filled with political opinions. I won't renew my subscription 
 This book disgusted me. I have never read anything so incestuous. 'Tale of Genji' is an overindulgent, horrific story. Any man who covets a girl of approxiamately age seven for a wife is what I would call a 'pedophile' not a prince. Not to mention that he impregnates his step mother. I have to wonder about those who gave this book 5 stars. Spare yourself the disgust, and use your money more wisely 
 Makes good coffee but if I had it to do over again, I'd just buy a good drip maker and save the money.  Cleaning is the biggest problem.  I don't have a problem of coffee dripping down the front, but steam coming from the pot during the brewing process causes it to collect and drip down the front of the maker.  If you don't remove it when the brewing cycle is complete, steam continues to condense and drip.  The steam also forms on the lid of the brewer.  When you open the top, it runs to the back of the lid and drips down the back of the brewer.  Another contribution to water under the base.  Cleaning the pot is also a pain.  Bottom line:  I'd rather have a good drip maker and a good stainless carafe.  Lot cheaper too.. 
 Next to Branson's "Screw It, Lets Do It", the most poorly written book (short or long) I have ever read. Like his "Screw It..." book, appears Branson got this one published only because he owns the publishing company. Ditto from my review of his "Screw It..." book -- appears making a few bucks on his earlier "Virginity" book made him think he could rephrase content and sell as two more books with more or less merely different titles.  Apparently Branson runs his business world better than he writes. 
 "Fidel: Hollywood's Favorite Tyrant" is the kind of radical right-wing piece of hate speech so commonly published and rarely ever read or taken seriously except by radical right-wingers who've already made their mind up about the subject. Do the research and you will see that most of Humberto Fontova's facts are completely off. Che Guevara for example was not a Stalinist, he was a Marxist, true, but he even cautioned against implementing EVERY Marxist idea to a society (this is outlined in "The Che Guevara Reader"). Fontova's claims of the Cuban system are also off, Cuba has the highest life expectancy rate in Latin America and even the purest water sources for the population. Fontova obviously belongs to the hateful Miami Cuban Mafia that would be happy to see Cuba return to it's previous status of a virtual U.S. colony and racist state. Fontova rarely ever touches upon the fact that the United States waged an illegal terrorist campaign on Cuba that has killed hundreds (unlike the false "genocide" numbers Fontova provides here which are ludicrous), in fact, one of the key terrorist, Luis Posada Carrilles, is in U.S. custody and has admitted to blowing up a Cuban airliner with 75 civilians onboard, the Bush White House refuses to extradite him. Fontova calls popular figures such as Oliver Stone "idiots," eventhough he probably couldn't hold his own on a debate with Stone and goes on to lash at other cultural figures (I suppose Fontova also considers Nobel-Prize winner Gabriel Garcia Marquez to be a half-wit for his friendship with Castro). To make matters worse, Fontova has a dead writing style that borders on the monotone. The use of language is bare and simplistic, throwing accusations without facts, attacking others without valid reason and supporting terrorist actions against a sovereign nation. For the real facts on Cuba I would recommend the titles published by Ocean including "Fidel: My Early Years," "Che Guevara Reader," "Latin America: A Continent Awakens" and many others. If you want to read radical right-wing propaganda that would make the likes of Oliver North and Pat Robertson proud, this is the book for you 
 This might be the most painful Yes DVD yet just released last Month (03/07).   This is the classic Yes lineup back together since 2002. You wouldn't have known by the Evenings lackluster performance. What pressure they must be under to make a DVD. We should have got a new CD recording in 03.   You can see the stress on the Band. Jon Anderson who sounds like he is Sick, has his eyes shut or is squinting the entire night. The exception, when he glances over at his Lyrics Screen.   Rick Wakeman, tick free since he stopped drinking was ticking like a time bomb. He didn't tick in Concert in 2002 nor 2004. No smiles too. Looked great though!  Chris Squire was on fire, made the Show!.    Steve Howe. Something was wrong, yet he played strong all night long.   Alan White was there too. They all were just there, doing a Gig.   Don't waste Money on this new 2007 Release. I rented this online!.       
 While the price is right, it brews a quick cup of joe, and its has a little more capacity than most 4-cup machines, thats about where the good news ends.  My machine's heating element just crapped out after 5 months of use.  Its under warranty, but I am just going out to buy a different brand.  I find this unit is messy.   The caraffe doesn't pour as well as the Mr Coffee I had for 3 years.  Its ok if you pour very slowly, but if you are a little too fast you'll get liquid on the counter.  While brewing, the lid is flimsy enough that it pushes up enough to release a lot of steam, which over time will ruin the finish on your cabinets.  I also notice that if the warmer plate is left on more than about an hour, my countertop becomes extremely warm.  I believe the bottom of the unit lacks sufficient height for proper air circulation.  Rather than wreck your kitchen or burn the house down....buy another product 
 Most of the items in this book were not specifically focused on deals for seniors. I got the feeling that the same contents could have several different covers and be marketed to other niches. In addition, so many of the free things were "free catalogs" or "free recipes"...anyone can get that information off of the Internet without buying a book 
 I found the main character annoying and unbelivable, as she appears much too clever.  Maybe if she solved her crimes completely by accident it would be believable, but outsmart the police?  It is also somewhat offensive to make fun of the things she does--the senility and forgetfulness in old age, joking and laughing about death and funerals.  The sense of humor is an attempt at being silly but it is offensive.  Living in this kind of environment where one is losing friends and family to death, the loneliness and sadness found there, is a topic and setting of bad taste.  My guess is the author herself does not live under such circumstances, but when she does, maybe she won't make jokes about it anymore.  Just another example of how people in our society take lightly and joke about things that should be taken seriously 
 There's not much to say.  The book isn't confusing because the material is too technical--it's often confusing because the author doesn't go in enough depth; it's frustrating when a crucial concept is presented, such as Hamilton's Law, but no examples on its applications are put forth.  I find myself frequently searching the internet to suppliment this textbook.  It also doesn't help that the book doesn't come with a cd-rom, or any additional material, unless you purchase the teacher's edition...reading this textbook makes me yearn for Campbell.   
 Having read a lot of conspiracy theories over the last few years I can say without a doubt that this is probably one of the worst books I have ever read. Whilst some books create tenuous links supported by few actual facts, this author invents facts all on his own and then presents them as empirical research. I have no doubt that Mr Byrne has had an interesting time researching this book, and (as others have mentioned) there are some items of historical note presented in a highly readable way, this book should be taken no more seriously than Dan Brown - and has about as much a basis in fact as the aforementioned authors own books.  In short, if this was sold as a work of fiction then it would be reasonably entertaining, as a conspiracy theory book it borders on lunacy, and considering it as a work of research should result in someone being incarcerated 
 I took this guide to Oaxaca to carry in the field, as the Howell guide is so heavy.  I almost threw it over the cliff at Monte Alban.  It will help you remember which euphonia is which, but for anything more subtly marked it is almost no help at all.  Furthermore, there are no range maps, no details on alternate plumages, little to no information on vocalizations.  I would have done better to bring the old Peterson guide, even though it is out of date 
 I bought Usher's 8701 on tape long ago, and I remember liking it. Then a couple of years ago, I bought it again on cd, listened to it, and wondered why I wasted my money.  Maybe it's the fact that I've grown, but this album sounds so un-soulful now. It is just lacking any spirit, sort of like an over-produced record: all studio magic, but no magic from the singer. Even the songs that are SUPPOSED to sound heartfelt, don't. The album sounds dated, not transcendent of time and era like all the albums that become classics. The songs are very forgettable, and I don't see any of them being seen as classics twenty years from now.  Usher has yet to make a masterpiece.  Addendum: I was a little unfair in my rating. The album deserves 3 stars, not 2. Unfortunately, I can't change it. 
 COB from 97-03 were geniuses... it was such a fresh sound   but now, they decided that sounding like techno and playing SLOW is cool.  lame lame lame.  Stick with the first 4 albums.. k thanks bye 
 Minotaur initally grabbed my attention. The movie was set in a remote village, and the characters, setting and acting had me hooked. I really liked the film until the youths were taken away to be sacrificed.   Once at the "evil kingdom" and by the minotaur pit, the movie fell apart. The movie became cheesey, with near endless scenes of the evil bad guy sniffing gas from a skull. Yawn. Enough already. Bad acting. Over acting. No care for the characters. Etc.  I thought this movie had a lot of potential with the setting and theme, but sadly it flopped. I've seen worse movies, but that doesn't mean I would recommend Minotaur. If you are looking for something off the shelf that you haven't heard of, but that is good sci-fi, try the Triangle, Firefly or Serenity.  The Scifi has put out many, many quality movies, but sadly this is not one of them. One more comment: one reviewer compared Minotaur to Aliens. That is like comparing the Godfather to Ishtar, Gigli, Battlefield Earth, or Pee Wee's Big Adventure. I encourage you to watch both and judge for yourself.   Total Score (out of 100) = 21  10 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film. 3 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting? 3 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story? 4 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?  1 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting? 0 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase 
 I've been following Seagal's direct-to-video carreer the last couple of years, and it's been of mixed quality. "Mercenary for Justice" is his latest from Avi Lerner and the other producers at Millennium/Nu Image. They do make some very entertaining movies sometimes, but they also let too many bad scripts slip through, and this is one of those. The plot had be confused after the first few minutes. It starts out with some combat scenes. After that, Seagal's dead partner's family gets kidnapped and he has to rescue them. At this point I had already lost interest and wasn't sure who some of the characters were. The movie seemed to lose pace even more towards the end and I was glad when it was over.  Seagal has some fighting scenes but appear mostly in closeups, looking tired. One good thing, though, is that his voice never seemed to be dubbed by someone else, like it was in some scenes in some of his other recent movies. To sum up, this is a very bad movie, not because of Steven Seagal, but mainly because of the screenplay. I can not recommend it. 
 Billed as a book written by a Californian who moves to Provence, this book is actually written by a French woman who, after spending some time in Beverly Hills, moves back to France into a home that has been "modernized" for her.  If you're more interested in boring acounts of how to impress your neighbors than you are in the joy of living life in a beautiful part of the world, then by all means - buy this book.  My girlfriend and I were thoroughly disappointed, and returned this pretensious monstrosity for a full refund.  For a more substantial and joyful read, try "A Year in Provence" by Peter Mayle, the book that almost certainly inspired Lenard's shallow and uninspired effort 
 This brand is just awful!  It's made of cheap, flimsy particle board.  It dents and dings very easily.  Most inportantly, the runners are too narrow for the wheels so the drawers fall out.  Not only is it horribly made, but it's dangerous!  DO NOT BUY! 
 Flynn offers up a fast-paced, if unbelievable story.  Unfortunately, character development is paper thin and clearly portrays Flynn's political preferences.  Characters, like Rapp, with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles, have all the answers and are always showing those good-for-nothing politicians how the "real world" works.  Meanwhile, Flynn's politicians (the majority of whom are Democrats) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election.  While there are grains of truth in his characters, Flynn consistently goes for the cheap, partisan stereotype.  I was looking for a well-developed political/military thriller.  I'm still looking. 
 The CD does not match the book text. The first edition may have been a fine book, but this edition has not been edited to match the companion CD. I am very sorry I have bought it 
 Bio-identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be.  They have serious, dangerous impacts on the human body.  Please, if you are going to try these, do your homework first.  A growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects.  Some don't make it out the other side.  I am one of the lucky ones - I survived the blood clots in my legs and two near-fatal, year-long illnesses connected with use of "natural" progesterone.  Since that time, I have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones.  I hope this information will be helpful to someone else, too.  Please, safeguard your health - no one else is going to do it for you 
 the show started ok, but midway into the second disk, the shows started to have a sameness to them and i got bored. it was fun to see some of the cast of the 40 yo virgin in the series, but overall, if noone ever saw or heard from this series again, civilization will go on just fine. 
 Warning to goys: if by English to Yiddish, they mean Yiddish to some language that uses a Hebrew alphabet, this is great. But if you speak and read English and you want to know why somebody's calling you a shiksa, you'll be up shiksa creek.  (I like that you have to be 13 to leave a review for this book... is it 18 for the non-Jewish books? 
 We all know what we need to do.  Some of us know it better than others, but we all have a certain amount of self-knowledge and a certain understanding of our place in the world.  Caroline Myss seems to think a more perfect understanding of yourself would help you be a better person and to better fulfill your purpose in life. But if it was that easy, wouldn't you already be doing what you know you should be doing?  What Caroline Myss writes will not help fulfill your "sacred contract". Self-knowledge is not the same as power, in the same way as a driver's manual is no help if you don't have gasoline in your car. 
 Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears. 
 I finished it because a friend recommended it, but had she not, I would have quit after page 20. I wasn't interested in the story or writing. I didn't find the story grotesque; I've read a lot worse dealing with the various topics in this book, but I just didn't find the protagonist very interesting. He went a bit nutty at the end and it is understandable given the situation.  We learn about why he had to stick so tenaciously to his religious beliefs, to redeem himself. His actions didn't seem out of line, either during the war or during the plague, given his dire predicament and previous behaviors and experiences.  I know this is a great example of a book written in second person, and perhaps for that it is worth reading.  I wouldn't pick it up for enjoyment or leisure 
 I found this book very biased, which is why I continued reading.  The history is horrible, but I was curious the extent to which Mr. Davis wants to cement his moral crusade view of history in lay people's minds.  At one point the comparison is made between the opporators of the underground railroad and the people who resisted the Nazis.  By extention Mr. Davis makes the implicit and fallacious argument, slavery is like the holocaust.    The title should be "Don't know much about slavery:  How white men's stupidity continues in perpetuity. 
 This is my third Vince Flynn book, and I was thoroughly disappointed.  "Executive Power" incorporates two stories, neither of which have anything to do with each other.  It's as if Flynn had enough for two half stories and then squished them together.  The first is a story about an American family kidnapped in the Philippines. Lurking in the background is another story set in the Middle East.  I thought Flynn was going to bring the two stories together.  But he never did.  He resolved one in sweeping fashion and then focused on the other.  If you only read one Vince Flynn book, I recommend that you read "Transfer of Power."  THAT is an exciting book.  But stay away from "Executive Power."  You'll be thoroughly disappointed 
 I have read every Leaphorn/Chee book by Hillerman more than once and am a great fan. I just finished this book and discussed it with a friend.. we both agreed it was so disappointing.. we cannot believe it was written by the same person. The writing was awkward and heavy-handed... by the second page I suspected something was wrong here. It reads like some cheap Harlequin mystery/romance. The sensitive handling of Navajo spiritual beliefs, the beautiful rendering of the landscape, the terse but meaningful conversations are all missing.  All I can say is, the publishers need to pay more attention to future manuscripts and insure that a writer of Tony Hillerman's caliber is not allowed to decline in the public eye... he has given us much enjoyment.... he deserves better.  And if someone else is fleshing out Hillerman's plot lines.. the public should be warned 
 this is the cut down version of the 3 hour pilot that universel released in theaters after the show went belly up in '78. if you buy the whole series you can skip this pointless rehash that isn't that good or very well thought out 
 My brother bought this cookbook for me 2-3 years ago for Christmas and I have yet to crack it open. You can go online to the foodnetwork website and get all her recipes for free (but why would you???) after seeing some of her more recent episodes, I am ready to toss the book in the trash without even taking a glimpse of the inside. Her recipes scare me and I wouldn't feed half of what she makes to my dog. Don't waste the money. If you think you wanna try her recipes, print them free from the web first before you go investing money in her empire. 
 I totally agree with Amit's review.  For a practitioner's perspective Bruce Tuckman's "Fixed Income Securities: Tools for Today's Markets" is a much better choice than Fabozzi 
 James has always produced until this album.  Laid is outstanding and their previous albums have more of a full connection, but this is definitely an attempt to assemble Booth's poignant lyrics with music...all in vain.  If  you like James and lyricist Booth, get the sheet and read that greatness 
 I have long been a Dowd column reader, along with a half dozen other opinion page writers, and picked up this book at our local library.  There are many reasons why one writes a book, you have a story to tell, your editor / publisher gives you an idea, you want to keep your name before the public, you need the money, just to list a few.  I can't think that Dowd needs the money, unless she is being bribed because someone found out she is actually a conservative!  I also don't believe that she has the visceral need to keep her name before her public.  If she had a story to tell, one would think that it would be told in a more convincing, thoughtful manner.  Since I am male and a grandparent, I'm guessing that I am not the target audience for this book, and the positive reviews from several potential career women would seem to corraborate that they are the intended audience.  And herein lies one of my problems with Ms Dowd and this book.  It appears to have been written by a mid to late 30's woman surprised to find out that her options are running out, not by the 50 plus year old that she is!  Those of you with 50 year old mothers or aunts, I ask you, do they talk like this?  Is this the kind of advice you would expect from them?  Or has Ms Dowd, at least emotionally, stopped growing at about the same age as the ladies from 'Sex in the City'?  I expected a significantly more mature viewpoint from her.  I also quibble with several other points she attempts to make:  That Hillary killed feminism.  Well she didn't.  Feminism is alive and well, just ask my sisters, wife and daughter.  Some feminists lost their credibility attempting to defend Bubba's actions with Monica L (moral relativism), but what killed that part of feminism which was based on the supposed male belief that women were not their equals, was its internal inconsistencies---the same thing that doomed the USSR!  Please try to tell my wife that men are her equal when she had been leading her family--three brothers just like Ms Dowd--since she was 12!    Yes, drugs and plastic surgery are a problem--for folks with too much disposable income and too little to keep them out of trouble!  New York, LA and DC,while fine cities all, are not the entire US, and what passes for currently acceptable behavour, among the elite in those three cities, just isn't on the average person's radar.    As earlier reviewers have said, other writers have made the same arguments, much better, so I am left not having a reason why this book was written.  I am left with an hypothesis only, that Ms Dowd is questioning decisions she made over the last three decades, trade offs, questionable choices, etc. and is wrestling with those, not having yet come to a conclusion.  My data points are her lack of a response to Monica L; her acceptance of the job after her potential boss hits on her, giving a bye to Anita Hill for somewhat similar behavour, ditto Hillary.  I wonder what those nun she had in school would say?  As commented in the book vis a vis Elizabeth Vargas' removal from the Evening News, perhaps she doesn't have the 'gravitas' to write a book?  Or as Helen Gurley Brown said of Ms Dowd's initial effort for Cosmo 'pure pablum' 
 Poorly designed..

None of the possible sounds are programmable.  If your any kind of drummer, stay away from these 
 This gal is taking Weight Watchers to court.  I wouldn't suggest anyone waste a penny buying this dribble whe writes 
 The author tries to bring both the biography of Walsingham and a discussion of the birth of espionage together in the same book and succeeds at neither. It is a fine read if you would like a general overview of the time,  but, after reading the title and reviews, I was hoping for a detailed biography of Walsingham  or much detail on how he created the group of people who became his information gatherers.  Instead, it is a general overview of Walsingham's life with references to the work that he did. There are some interesting facts that the author brings forward that the reader might not find elsewhere , but the majority of the reading is rehashed from biographies of Elizabeth I. If you want details and a better understanding of Walsingham the man, and his life work and actions, you will need to look elsewhere 
 Somewhat better organized than the other Roseville books, however, the quality of the photos are horrible.  Looks like they scanned low resolution images from a catalogs.  A lot of incomplete model numbers in the pictures.  If you buy this book you need to buy another Roseville book as a companion so that you can validate the information.  I doubt the author is actually a collector 
 I have recently reviewed all the available Iliad translations for a twelve week book discussion on the Iliad that I am moderating.  I was extremely disappointed in the Fitzgerald translation, particularly because I consider his Odyssey excellent.  Fitzgerald has not produced a translation so much as a retelling.  In favor, apparently, of making the story more "accessible," whatever that means, he has used language that even an average eighth grader would find, in many places, simplistic and pedestrian.    If you just want a quick, easy read through the basic Iliad story, a step or two up from a Classics Comics, this book will do (though you would save time just reading the Cliff Notes).  But if you want more than just the story, if you also want to enjoy the richness of Homer, the depth of insights, the complex language that enriches the Greek text, avoid this translation.  Lattimore, though it is some fifty years old and modern research brings into question a few of his word choices, is still the richest, the closest to Homeric quality translation of the Iliad available.  It is definitely my first recommendation. It does, admittedly, require close attention to read in parts, but it well repays the effort, and once you adapt to his style, which doesn't take long, it is an engrossing and highly rewarding translation to read.  If you want a somewhat easier to digest translation than Lattimore, the more recent Fagels translation is your best choice.  He simplifies the languge without greatly sacrificing the richness and complexity of the original.  It is not as good as Lattimore, but it is still quite acceptable.  There are other translations out there -- Pope, Rieu, Butler, among others -- but they are more niche translations.  If you are into doggerel, Pope will give you more than you could wish for. Rieu and Butler are workmanlike translations, but both are prose translations.  They are useful for study; because they don't have to worry about choosing words to fit a poetic meter they can be more literally accurate than any poetic translation, but reading a prose translation of Homer is sort of like reading the text of the Messiah without any of the music; yes, you understand the content, but it's hardly an equivalent experience.   So my recommendations for Homer translations are:  Iliad:  First by a long shot, Lattimore; second, Fagels, third, no third place, last place, any other  Odyssey:  First place shared, Lattimore and Fitzgerald, second Fagels. 
 you can do much better on Fastweb and it is free. the book is not well organized, and I got a headache trying to figure out what we qualify for. buy it used or better yet go to the library 
 As far as the three Christy DVD's that you are selling, I think they stink.  I lived in Tennessee when they were filming the original series, and this is not the original.  Amazon should let customers know that these DVD's are remakes of the original series.   
 The only good thing about this book is the seaside atmosphere. The seaside restaurants were enjoyable. The storyline was acceptable but not my favorite 
 While this book claims to be for a broad variety of photographers, it seems more oriented towards those career-oriented people who want to shoot pro sports and make money at it. I am an amateur photographer who wants to learn to learn morea about digital photography and take pictures of sports, but I found it hard with this book to figure out how to best take photos with my camera, which isn't professional equipment, and then what to do with the photos. The author has some good experience, although it would have been nice to have a wider perspective of both photography as well as various types of sports--not just the big, typical ones. It's interesting to read about this kind of photography, but isn't that practical, at least for me. I have a reasonably good but simple digital camera, and I'd like to know best how to use it to take sports photos and then do something with them ... but I didn't get that from this book 
 This cd is boring. It is not jazz, or even smooth jazz, just instrumental pop music that would work great as background music for an infomercial. If you like monotonous pop, like Celine Dion or Kenneth Gorelick (aka Kenny G), you will probably like this.   I, however, would advise you to look into finding music that isn't so life-less and ordinary 
 I thought that No Logo had reached the bottom of the pit as far as the literature on anti-globalization goes but here we go again.   Naomi Klein does write her dispatches from a perceived front-line.  She strikes out against the very things that are making the world more open, such as tearing down regulation, allowing people to move around and opening markets (putting her in the same camp as neo Nazis and other nationalists whom she is against) but most seriously, her arguments ring flat and one is left wondering what the anti-globalization movement stands for.  Even the things for which it is against seem inconsistent.   As one of the apostles of the anti-globalization movement, Klein is a poor one.   She does not see the irony of Zapatista t-shirts, baseball hats and ski-masks.  She does not find strange the fact that Marcos, who leads the Zapatistas and with whom she seems infatuated happens to have his greatest following among middle-aged women. She fails to convince the reader that the anti-globalization movement is anything but some hazy new-age mixing of anarchists and doped up teenagers that haven't showered in a week.    What sense can one make out of her arguments that the movement is waiting for "something entirely unprecedented"?  Are we to wait for Godot? I have had the misfortune to have read her articles in the Guardian in the UK and like a bad dream; I am hoping that she fades away harmlessly.  But with the rise of protectionism around the world, which will hurt the poor world the most, the Naomi Kleins of the world are, unfortunately, the ones, who through their ill conceived logic and weirdness, will shape the thinking of the public. Reading this book gives one an insight into the anti-everything movement but one does not come out the wiser as to what they really want. 
 The first Jonathan Kellerman book I've read... And my last.  Too slow.  I'm a big fan of the murder/mystery genre but this one is a big flop 
 This book was so hard to get through due to the amazing amount of grammatical errors.  It was hard to focus on the content of the book with all the errors.  I have also read many other books on eating disorders that were much more helpful for dealing with my neice than this one.  I would recommend everybody to not waste their time on this book 
 The bed lift system is OK if all you want to do is sit up in bed and read. However, I did not like the way it bounced when trying to sleep on it and the edges or sides would collapse if you weren't centered in the bed 
 With the exception of JAWS and possibly DEEP BLUE SEA, you could take all these shark attack movies and lump them together; just change the actors, sometimes the location, but you end up with the same thing:  poor special effects, so-so acting and some occasional laughs and/or thrills.  This entry like the other two SHARK ATTACK movies is generic fluff, with little novelty or variety to distinguish it.  The cast of Thorsten Kaye (as the studly hero), Nikita Alger (the hot diver) and Daniel Alexander (the studly if obnoxious Steve Irwin clone) gamely tries to breathe life, but this is just another movie in which the shark should have eaten the whole bunch 
 I don't even know where to start.   If she wasn't so (as we are constantly reminded) well-educated and well travelled I would assume that the author just didn't know how to be a gracious guest. Instead of relishing this rare hospitality (Amish families very rarely invite Englisch guests to stay with them) she repeatedly criticizes her first host family (the wife isn't fit enough, the food isn't healthy enough, her room isn't big enough.) Then when a second family allows her to stay with them she thinks that being their guest for two weeks means she has a right to belittle their plans to expand their homestead to included a much needed birthing center for the community. And to top it all off, when she gets home, she's too special to share her experiences with regular people, and now thinks the people who were previously her social peers are like "sharks."  This book is not worth your time. There are several excellent books that include far more insight into the lives of the Amish and far less over-intellectualized, self-centered, whining and condescension. See "Driving the Amish" by Jim Butterfield 
 This is the sort of guy who sees a woman win a big settlement for spilling coffee in her lap and concludes that all lawsuits against corporations are frivolous.  As for Al Gore, he's no more a scientist than Milloy and no thinking person should take either too seriously.  They both tell people what they want to hear.  But would you rather err on the side of side of caution or go with a guy who thinks DDT got a bum rap?  Mr. Milloy is playing a sucker's game.  Pick anything that's happens slowly, then deny, deny, deny, figuring, if you're wrong, you won't be around, so who cares? 
 The book Yellow: Race in America Beyond Black and White to me is blatant and apparent proof that the Asian political voice has been hijacked and is fully rampant with an anti-white, anti-American viewpoint.  While I do not think the mind of Mr. Wu is reflective of the vast majority of Asians in America, his scripture is about as proof-positive as I have seen that while white Americans (European Americans) have fought hard against segregation for decades under a naïve spell for the benefit of minorities, Asian politicians as well as university professors of various minority races are actually promoting the philosophy and indoctrination for racial separatism.  The idea of racial equality is apparently not what elites like Frank Wu have in mind:  the condemnation of America and the same people who created pro-Asian immigration laws from the middle 1960s - whites -- is.  Far beyond equal rights for all, this new anti-anything-for-the-sake-of-it viewpoint, which airs in Yellow is nothing like what Martin Luther King, Jr., and the many other former civil rights activists were promoting.  The mindset of the author in this book (Frank Wu) is hyper-eccentric, seemingly hateful, dangerously irrational, and anti-establishment with no clear objective other than dissent for destruction.  To learn about the new form of hatred that a growing radical Asian intellectual base and other minorities are brewing, browse this book 
 This is a "common sense" approach to management.  There is nothing wrong with that approach but if you need more information such as how to motivate employees or deal with difficult people, you will not find the information here.  I am in search of a book with more details 
 I'm a big fan of her other works, but this one was so fragmented and uninspired that I quit without finishing.  Life is too short to waste time reading bad books 
 The book had an impact on me. It did, for instance, tinker with my idea of what dating should be (or shoudl be like). But the book is like a dogmatic pile of rules that people should abide by. And worse still, the book is interwoven with scripture to make it sound like the Bible says such and such about dating, instead of Joshua Harris.   I know that his heart is in helping people grow in their relationships, but this book is written from a perspective high up on an alter of self-righteousness - and down below, the rest of the world, broken and depraved. I mean, as a student (and now I am a teacher), I have sat through many college courses where professors talk about the ideal of education - every child can learn, every parent cares, and every child comes with some innate bundle of intelligence. But the real classroom is nothing like this. When Harris talks about asking the father of the girl you are about to date for her hand in courtship, or when he discusses going to his father for advise or for his pastor for guidance, I think he is talking about an ideal that few people actually have access to. Should they? Perhaps. But this book is written in such a manner that says that unless you do this, then it is highly improbable that your relationship can survive - or better yet, be as good as his. 
 High record sales are often inversely proportionate to the effect on the morale of the bands concerned. Blur became household names in Britain because of this album, especially through cheerful cockney singalong sinle "Parklife", but it messed them up in terms of moving on as a band: it is also the album which was responsible for singer/writer Damon Albarn's mental breakdown.   But what did they expect? This is , after all, the album that summed up Britain's geezer culture: where men are men and women act like men as well. Where the Thatcherism of the 80s has never really gone away, and it's okay to Look After Number 1 and act like a bit or a moron. This album, for better or worse (in my opinion, worse) is more representative of Britain in the 90s and noughties than anything else. If you're American and still think that Britain is all Hugh Grants and tea on the village green, forget it. And here's the proof.  The album itself is cheerful enough, but totally uninspired. It bears none of the influence from American acts of the 80s and 90s, like Nirvana, Sonic Youth, the Meat Puppets or Dinosaur Jr., or Brit acts like My Bloody Valentine. Guitarist Graham Coxon's love of these bands hardly shows in the songs, because they're written by Albarn. Just tunes, many of which are distinctly ordinary. Even much-lauded songs like "This Is a Low" are let-downs, because they don't display any real savvy for what makes modern music any different from the songcraft of the Beatles or the Kinks. Indeed, Blur are just like a modern Kinks. Just without the great songs.  It's sad that with this album, Blur confirmed what the title of their previous album had said. Modern life IS rubbish 
 After watching the newest version on television, this one didn't measure up. The movie didn't make you want to watch more. There was no romance compared to the latest version 
 I'm a huge fan of the DS9 relaunch, and I was eagerly anticipating this book as a continuation of the exciting storyline the various authors had established. However, after the great descriptions and plots of the previous books, especially the "Mission: Gamma" and "Worlds of DS9" series, I was very much disappointed by "Warpath". Like "Unity", the book does advance the plot, and provide some excellent action scenes, but not much else - it definitely does not share the depth and stand-alone nature of the other books. Furthermore, the author liberally reuses a number of plot ideas from previous Star Trek novels, such as the melodrama between Vaughn and Prynn, Ro and Quark. I also intensely disliked the ending, came totally out of nowhere, and didn't expand the DS9 universe at all, something the previous books were excellent at accomplishing. I hope the next installment follows the path established by the previous novels, instead of this new trend. 
 Even though I would agree that "Erin Brockovich" is an entertaining movie, Julia Roberts performance in it is no more Oscar-worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in "Pretty Woman."  I am second to no one in enjoying a good "David and Goliath" story, but this movie has such shaky roots in reality, it is more of a tall tale, than the "true" story of a historic class action suit that, I would imagine, left more unhappy plaintiffs, than it did satisfied ones.  However, as the movie title implies, this is indeed Erin Brockovich's story, in the same way that the "Xena" character is the main attraction in "Xena: Warrior Princess" (though it should be noted that Xena's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the Erin Brockovich character).  Erin Brockovich is a vain, brassy, boorish, single mother of three young children, with no marketable work skills, a transparently opportunistic manner, who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character Roberts played in "Pretty Woman" (prior to Richard Gere's character taking her on the infamous Rodeo Drive shopping spree).  The movie's beginning finds Erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident; her lawsuit is lost, primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony (swearing, cursing and shrieking from the witness stand) while being questioned by opposing counsel.   Unbelievably, Erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney's (played by Albert Finney) firm, mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk.   Later, while handling the paperwork for a run-of-the-mill, pro bono, real estate sale, Erin discovers the file contains the seller's medical records, that, for reasons she (correctly) does not understand, seem to be of particular interest to the buyer, the mega utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric.  Erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that PG&E had (for decades) negligently contaminated the ground water (surrounding one of their power plants in/near Hinkley, CA on the edge of the Mojave Desert) with toxic, hexavalent chromium.  This discovery leads to the queen mother of all class-action lawsuits (at least in terms of the award), in which hundreds of Hinkley residents sue PG&E (by and through the representation of Erin's boss) in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs.  Roberts gives a photogenic, if not especially gifted, performance in her role as Erin. The movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of Roberts (literally gushing out skin-tight, low-cut, bustier-inspired "work clothes" that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet) as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated Hinkley residents. While there is much to be said for Erin's apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit, she is not an especially likeable character; rather, she is rude, verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests.  Albert Finney is considerably more appealing and believable as Ed Masry, the aged and  weary attorney who is Erin's boss.  The bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing; unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work, the focus for these scenes seems to be more on Roberts (strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy, five-inched-heeled mules) than on the sometimes-interesting personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters.  Aaron Eckhart plays the affable, gentle biker and next-door-neighbor, George, who becomes Erin's boyfriend-by-convenience.  The "convenience" factor is totally one-sided and for Erin's benefit exclusively; she  unabashedly uses George for free, live-in childcare, thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist Masry as they put together the historic case.  Erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar "bonus" check  (from Masry) when the tort action case settles; contrastingly, George gets a "thanks" for his nanny services from Erin and his walking papers.   The plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life, who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant.  Though the Hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed, make no mistake-this movie is about Erin Brockovich (indeed, I do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present) and less about the brave struggles with life-threatening, generation-spanning illnesses that the real-life plaintiffs were forced to face, due to the toxicity in their water source.  Erin Brockovich is presented to the viewing audience (in typical Hollywood fashion) as a sort of heroine; but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people, walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich.  Is the movie entertaining-absolutely.   Inspiring- not even slightly. 
 I started this novel with high hopes....expecting something better  than some self proclaimed thrillers I had recently inflicted myself with, but it was not to be.The plot is simplistic and the protagonist blunders from one accident to another.He only manages to succeed in the end due to an unbeliveable set of good luck and stupidity on part of the villians.  While reading the novel there was a strong sense of deja vu .... of having been there and done that, especially with respect to the character of Dr Hemlock.There is very little that is original or likable about him.  In my opinion Ian Fleming wrote infinitely better novels of this genre, viz. spy thrillers, I have yet to come across any author with a better command over language and creator of more interesting characters than him.  My search continues..... 
 This novel is a collection of shallow bigotries of someone ignorant of what he writes.  It takes place in Texas.  All the main Texan characters are white and wealthy poorly educated hateful people. A cameo appearance by a family of migrant farmworkers contrasts them as heroic and well educated as they quote European philosophers. Besides the main hero, the other main protagonist is a Jewish Lesbian Vegetarian Harvard Law graduate there to "give back" and save the underpriveledged from their white masters. There are constant and tedious descriptions of how much the author doesn't like the Texas climate. For someone who writes about a hero who is a firearms expert from the military, this author makes some of the most absurd technical mistakes I have ever read. He even describes the primer of a cartridge as the "firing pin". I doubt he has even touched a gun in his life. This book is so full of obnoxious and insulting cliches I'm offended I read it. I only finished it because it was the only book I had with me on a hunting trip, which is ironic as this protagonist, who brutalizes or kills anyone who offends his sensibilities, thinks of himself as pure because he doesn't indulge in such an evil activity as hunting for food 
 Boring book, bad writing, inaccurate histroy.  Too much opinion, little facts 
 The people who put this flick together apparently don't understand the difference between combustion and nuclear fusion.  I don't want to sound like a Puritan here, but come on!  They shouldn't need a science advisor on the set to know something as simple as this ... all they need is somebody with a high school education.  Having said that, the movie wasn't completely worthless.  After I got over my initial irritation during the first ten minutes, I sort of got into the movie.  Some of the chases were sort of fun, and the special effects were pretty cool.  Morgan Freeman is always cool, even if he seems to play pretty much the same character in every movie.  Keanu Reeves did a marginal job, which for him is an improvement (we all love the guy, but even he knows that he can't act).  Near the end, there is more of the weird hydrogen combustion - nuclear fusion, which brought back initial irritation.  Do these people in Hollywood drop out of school after the sixth grade?  Duh 
 There is no doubt that much of what Holmes writes is true or solidly based in fact. However, there are glaring ommissions from this book that are quite damming.  Holmes quotes Col. S.L.A. Marshall at length throughout the book. And yet, despite this pattern, not once (that I could find anyway) did Holmes mention the massive WW II Marshall study which concluded that the *majority* of US combat troops did not fire in the heat of combat.   Marshall showed how many soldiers, in the heat of combat, exhibit "posturing" which is identical to behavior exhibited throughout the animal world. The idea is to look and sound aggressive without actually attacking to kill.  In combat this might mean shooting wildly in various directions, shooting over the enemy's heads, etc.  To the casual eye (e.g. watching archival combat footage) this looks like true combat, but it's not.  Marshall discovered this behavior through interviews with countless US soldiers who admitted (with much guilt) what they had done.    The result of that study was the overhaul of basic training and boot camp so that soldiers not only experienced the sights and sounds of combat, but that they also simulate killing as much as possible - which in turn has resulted in a huge majority of US soldiers (since Vietnam) actually shooting to kill.  Essentially, the Marshall study negates much of Holme's central thesis that warfare is "natural" for men and that most men seek it out willingly.  Holmes also gives lip service to women and combat and uses convenient examples to discredit. For example, many people use Israel as an example of a sexually intregated force. This is despite the fact, as Holmes points out, that women really don't handle weapons much in the Israeli military. However, there is at least one force that Holmes failed to mention -- the Viet Cong which consisted of over 75 percent women! Because he doesn't mention that example, he can easily sweep the issue of sex under the rug. The truth of the matter is, in war environments where one side views itself as attempting to liberate itself women usually play an integral role, including combat. This was seen throughout the 20th century.  Holmes' sociological ignorance is never more obvious than when he discusses the sexuality of soldiers versus those who oppose war. Soldiers biologically want sex with women more! Holmes issues this proclamation without the slightest effort to back it up or to explore other options. In Holmes' world all soldiers are heterosexual and want lots of sex. This would certainly be surprising to the many great homosexual military leaders in warfare history. And I think quite a few "peaceniks" from the 60's might have some contrary evidence to offer Holmes as well.  Holmes is a historian with a military background. He is not a sociologist and he lacks the experience, training and understanding to explore deeper issues and to look at contradictions to his beliefs.  I give this book two stars just because this is important field to look at. Hopefully someone with better understanding of the use of propaganda (from all sides), gender roles, sexism, cultural history (that isn't Anglo Saxon!) will come along and do this topic justice 
 This records is so badly made, unsharp, without contrast that it spoils the film: it is made for the trash. Stay away from this production  
 so very boring... i gave up halfway in. i usually hate to leave books unfinished but i felt like it was a waste of my time. my sister liked it though. 
 I was disappointed with the book. Like the others, the book lost what little integrity I was willing to give it to start when Catherine said she lived in 1863 BC. Given that the author repeatedly states that he is a traditionally-trained medical professional, his material is starkly lacking in any kind of verifiable fact or scientific questioning. The book reads like a personal diary of someone who is searching for meaning in his life rather than a case study. I think the thing that bothered me the most is that it is obvious he uses the patient for his own purposes in sessions that he allows to go on for hours on end to await messages from the Masters. Seems unethical to me (a lesson he must still need to learn.) I thought it especially odd that the first other professional he brings into to observe a session is his wife and not an objective colleague.  I read many of the reviews below and I like what one said about past lives recollection being born from the mental garbage of the Earth. That seems more likely. I encourage you to keep searching for the truth. Do not settle for the soul candy offered in this book 
 When I first heard that 4 Strings would be coming out with another album I was excited. I had so thoroughly enjoyed their first cd that I had high hopes for this one. The first single was amazing! The day it came out I ran out and bought it. I must have listened to it hundreds of times, it was so good! I couldn't wait for the actual album. Then it came out...My excitement diminished. First of all, I realized that Vanessa was barely on the cd. You don't mess with a good thing! Vanessa's voice complimented the music so well! Then a second problem arose: the music seemed like a rehash of the previous album's music only this time with different lyrics. What happened?! The only relief I found in this cd was the track "Euphoric Eyes." It's the only track that doesn't make me want my money back. (even both versions of the title track "Turn It Around" make me angry. I advise getting the single, as it has the best version.) So here's my verdict: Major disappointment. Why, 4 Strings? Why 
 This mix was very sour, and because of the way the fruits are dried, there were a LOT of crumbs inside the packets 
 I found this book is poor quality and an inappropriate gift for a six-year-old boy (who loves stories about ancient China). The paperback format is flimsy. The illustrations are all black and white, and have the quality of a photocopy. And, the text talks about burying laborers alive 
 Basically a small, expensive and dull text book printed on cheap paper for a specialist university course. There are too many sweeping statements and little detail provided. The book is poorly illustrated and the maps very basic. I had expected so much more 
 I ordered this by mistake- I used them anyway- I just have to say I've gotten better batteries at a dollar store-  dont waste you hard earned money 
 This quick-read is a cheap thrill. It has some eloquent prose and an interesting premise; however, the story as a whole is marginal and actually quite banal. The author seems almost desperate to convey "realism", but relying on photographic descriptions of sexual acts and equally graphic renditions of sadistic brutality are simply not enough to make this story exceptional.   The protagonist, Frannie, is "too constructed" to seem real. Her extreme cynicism is perhaps refreshing at times and her linguistic ponderings are often quite amusing, but overall her personality is meatless. The lover/detective Malloy is a tired police cliche with a knack for some extreme sexual precision. Frannie's student Cornelius shows some potential as a character but quickly disintegrates.  The ending is quite over-hyped and actually rather disappointing. Blood and gore and a meager "explaination" - wow, what a surprise...  Overall, Susanna Moore shows us in this book that she can be clever with words; however, her attempt to portray gritty reality comes across as merely desperate for attentio 
 Conversations with God is my favorite book.  It's the only book I've read more than once, I've given away many copies, and even after a decade of loving it, it's still #1 in my eyes.  I was really excited about the DVD release, and got it the first day out, but was thoroughly disappointed (and not just because I went to film school).  The movie barely reflects the book at all until the end.  If you want to see what it's like to be homeless and destitute, check it out.  We all have our own path.  If you want to be inspired by one of the best books ever written, skip the movie and get the book right away. 
 Do yourself a favor, read the book. It is so much better than this nonsense 
 I got through most of this book before giving up. My 30-second review: Having a Ph.D. might get you a book contract, but it sure doesn't make you any of the following: rigorous, searching, expert, or wise. There's no  command of the youth development lit here; there's no comprehensive  understanding of the lives of young people today; and there are few  sentences and paragraphs that don't beg for good editing! What's here?  Generalities and platitudes abundant. Don't waste your time as I did. There  are many better books out there 
 A thousand blood-thirsty Trollocks are on the way to kill you and your friends.  At your disposal you have the following choices of weapon:  1. The Troll-Kill 2000 which can kill 50 to 100 Trollocks at a time, has unlimited power, never misses, and never needs to be recharged.  2.  A machine gun which is not as effective as the Troll-Kill 2000, but still pretty good, or 3.  A pocket knife, which is great for cleaning your fingernails, but not very effective in stopping a Trollock.  If you are Rand you pick the pocket knife of course, but then either forget to take it with you, or vow not to use it unless you are absolutely sure the Trollocks are not female.    So Jordan has created a superhero with super powers.  He gave the superhero super weapons.  Then he realized that if the superhero uses his power or his weapons there will be no way to stretch this series from 6 books (what it should have been) to 12 books.  Solution:  make the superhero too stupid to use his powers or weapons, and fill the rest of the pages with useless drivel.    The books are filled with darkfriends, and other servants of the Dark Lord, that never seem to do anything, but watch from the sidelines.  They don't really need to do anything, since the good guys seem to pretty much muck everything up on their own.    The problem with creating 1000s of characters in gory detail is that you expect them to actually do something.  The other problem with so many characters is that you loose track of them and lose focus of the main characters.  When Jordan finally comes back to a particular character, they seem to have been placed in suspended animation for the past 1000 pages.  I dare you to try to read this one without a heavy dose of caffeine in your system. 
 amazon sells a one year subscription for $14 which includes a $5 amazon certificate that you get later.  in the actual magazine, the subscription card is 6.99 for one year or 2 years for $10.00  so use the card, save some money and also dont have to wait for your $5 back and then find something at amazon that you can use the $5 certificate on. 
 If you look at the March 2004 issue of the International Association of Bloodstain Pattern Analysts, you'll find a very negative review of this book. Given that the reviewer (Herbert Leon MacDonell, the Director of Laboratory of Forensic Science  Bloodstain Institute of Corning, New York) and all members of IABPA actively work in the field of forensics, I'd take their word for it. Here's an excerpt from the review, which can be found on the web at http://www.iabpa.org/March2004News.pdf  "Many fine books have been written on the general subject of forensic science but this is not one of them. It only takes reading the first page for the reader to discover that this book is not going to be a source of accurate forensic information."   The reviewer goes on to say:  "...the frightening aspect is that lay persons who purchase such garbage are unaware of how inaccurate the things they are reading really are. It is unfortunate that there are publishers out there who will print a manuscript without having some form of peer review to determine whether there are a few minor errors or is it so bad like this book, that they should trash it. 
 Folks, this is why people keep up with superficial "star" meanderings. Popular art has turned into a cheap thrill, to be digested and flushed away like a cheeseburger. Even a cheeseburger can be put together with more love and talent than a Nickelback song. Get this for your fix of convenient hooks and patronizingly "relatable" lyrics 
 Much too expensive, for such a kind of book 
 This book was used for an assessment class I took at TN Techological University. I'm sure the authors did not mean to, but the book is very dry and hard to read at times. However it gets easier the farther along you get. The sections with sample test questions were useful. Everyone in my class complained about this book. Our instructor used notes and powerpoints from other texts to supplement. I definately do not recommend this title. 
 and it holds up just as well today. in the past few years, the market has been flooded with wrestling-themed albums, mostly containing 30 seconds of generic entrance music stretched out 3 or 4 minutes to create a "song". at least these are "real" songs, which is about the best you can say for them. of the originals, the only keepers are jimmy harts suprisingly catchy "rick springfield" and the absurd yet moronically toe tapping "capt lou's history of music". as for the covers, hearing nikolai volkoff sing cara mia is worth a snicker or two, but not more than that, and mean gene singing at all is embarrassing (although not as bad as his "rock & roll hoochie koo" off the wrestling album II, barely). all the wrestlers chip in on "land of 1000 dances", although i cant quite remember if the original boasted the lyrics "i'm gonna rap you with my cane, you pencil neck geek" or "i'm gonna crush you with my avalanche". the in between song patter between okerland, mcmahon, & ventura is for the most part stilted and unfunny. please, i abhor you, spend your hard earned money on something a little better 
 As a person who suffered from OCD, I read the author's book "Brainlock" and received much help, in fact, I found it the best self-help book I've ever read, and I've read several, for people suffering from OCD.  As a psychiatrist in helping people with OCD, he is at the top of his field, but as a writer on the functions of the brain, he is a pseudo-scientist.  In "The Mind and the Brain", he takes the unscientific position of "the ghost in the machine".  His position is that we have free will to change ourselves inspite of the inclinations of our brains.  I don't disagree with this, but I believe that it is not a ghost in the machine that has the free will, it is you.  I believe that you are the brain and the brain is you.  They are one and the same.  If part of the brain, the caudate nucleus, is stuck in gear and keeps you obsessing, another part of your brain, the volitional part, can overide the caudate nucleus and resist giving into the urge to perform the compulsions.  In doing so, the caudate nucleus will strengthen and become better at changing gears to other behaviors.  Schwartz denies that one part of the brain can overide another part, but to me this is a more logical explanation than that the self is a non-physical entity.  How would such a non-physical entity come about?  How would it evolve?  How can non-matter act on matter?  Schwartz explains this through quantum mechanics.  Although I'm not an expert on quantum mechanics, I understand there are experts in the field of physics that disagree with his version of quantum mechanics 
 I read this biography not just because I'm a big and longstanding fan of Bob Dylan, but also because of the strength of many of the accolades the book has received, both in Amazon and elsewhere. I couldn't have been more disappointed. The biography is clearly well-researched, despite Heylin's proud but unconvincing defence of the fact that he has never met Dylan. However, the biography lacks any warmth or feel for Dylan and the huge and deep contribution his music has made to modern culture. The book comes down with detail, but much of it is incidental and irrelevant. Moreover, Heylin manages to be condescending and irritatingly opinionated, especially and unnecessarily so about other biographers. His constant use of direct quotes merely breaks the flow of the text and rarely adds much. Normally, when one reads a biography of a musician and songwriter who has played such an important part in one's own life, and especially when the author admits to being fan, one would expect to be driven back to the music with renewed vigour and interest. In the case of Heylin's biography this didn't happen. I can still recall the huge impact that some of Dylan's albums had on my life, and music more generally, but this does not come across in Heylin's often flat and at times self-important writing style. While there is plenty of gossip around Dylan's fondness for women, drugs and drink, few original insights are offered about his music. Indeed, Dylan's music is hardly assessed at all, apart from occasional references to the views of other critics. Dylan's life and music deserve a lot more 
 Recieved as a present from my wife, poor girl got sold on this thing at Circuit City. Anyway, it was alright...pretty average transmitter. The thing broke immediately after it's 3 month warranty expired. I contacted DLO's customer service and they were rude as heck. I understand the thing is off of warranty but they were no help at all, wouldn't even offer to fix it if I covered the costs. So basically I have a useless piece of plastic and electronics. I bought a Monster iCarPlay and have loved it. It's put together much better, better sound, no annoying little issues, and a more reputable company. Don't spend your hard earned money on DLO...get something that will last. 
 I bought this book after reading the two books published in the series(Earagon & Eldest). I was excited that it would have a list of creatures, people and other things about Alagaesia. It does mention certain aspects of the books, but it is more for children. I was disapointed that I paid almost 10 bucks plus shipping for this book. If you have a child that is interested in the series this is a good book for them, but for teens and adults it is a bit lame. It is a very thin book, and has few illistrations. I have a five year old and I read parts of the book to him and it was a little complicated for him. It has a section on how to see Faries, that includes a reciepe for a mixture of cloves and other herbs that are smashed then added into a ointment. Then the ointment is smeared on the eyes. Not recommended, and she states this in the book, but why put in a book designed for children?  I can see some poor child tring to make this mixture so they can "see" faries. Not a good purchase.I am very disapointed with this book 
 It is a mind projecting book, this is why Robert Bruce has never met any divine beings, it is a common sense that astral projection you are able to visit or seeing beings from other dimensions, and Robert Bruce has none.  This is why he cannot explain many paranormal phenomena during astral travels, because he has never actually projected out 
 I am always interested in the intellectual history of science, particularly the Faustian dilemma.  Often we want to sell our souls to the devil for an article or a grant.  For scientists in Nazi Germany, the Faustian dilemma was to sacrifice their Jewish friends and colleagues on the altar of Nazism. Hundreds of careers were made this way.  Overall, I was very disappointed with this book.  First, to fill the first hundred pages, Cornwell spends way too much time discussing WWI without any real connection to the ideological development on Nazi science and the danger of scientists who embraced Nazism fully.    Second, Cornwell deals rather efficiently, without finesse or surprises for that matter, with the usual array of popularized accomplishments of Nazi science during the war.  The book reads as a companion guide to a documentary on the History channel.  Stories of V1 and V2, zyklon B, radio navigation, and the A-bomb have been told better before.    Third, the book avoids the "big" moral and scientific dilemma in Nazi science: Lebensraum.  When the Third Reich occupied Poland, it relied heavily on economic analysis on the economic viability of the occupation.  Economists and sociologists walked hand in hand to analyze the most efficient way to occupy that country and to extract its human, capital, industrial, and agricultural resources.  Cornwell mentions the economic analysis of the viability of concentration camps, but that is only a small proportion on how social sciences supported the Nazi ideology.   Fourth, it was hardly surprised then that genetic experiments in the concentration camps are glossed over in the book.  Benno Muller-Hill is reduced to being a reference.    Fifth, the most glaring omission is the role of social sciences, which I tangentially mentioned earlier.  During the 1930s an entire generation of new academic social scientists were "manufactured" to benefit, polish, improve, and offer scientific backing to the emerging Nazi ideology.  In less than 15 years, history, sociology, economics, linguistics, geography, and political science were rewritten and reanalyzed by this committed cadre of bright, young Nazis.  Following the end of the war, these still young academics were not removed.  Although many of them wholeheartedly embraced Nazism, they were able to keep their academic appointments, except for a few of the older guard.  They sold their soul as much as the younger group; few of them were removed and some became marginalized not because they were Nazis.  Those who kept their academic positions served as teachers, professors, and advisors to a new class of students. Few of these academics retired before the 1970s and they dominated the German intellectual contribution in social sciences for over 50 years from Nazism to social democracy.  
 This book contains too many mistakes to be taken seriously, and its target audience is not Latter-day Saints, but those who know nothing about "Mormonism."  One of the criticisms levelled against the Church pertains to the practice of baptism on behalf of the dead, with the popular "pronoun" argument being used. Moreover, in Greek, this would indicate that Paul was writing, positively, pertaining to baptism on behalf of the dead.  Notwithstanding the English translations use of the pronoun "they," the Greek does not use such. Indeed, the Greek of 1 Corinthians 15:29, the verse in question, uses a present passive participle. Participles do not contain pronouns.  Furthermore, *tòn nekron* (the dead) is in the Genitive case, indicating that the preposition *huper* is in the genitive. This, too, is significant, as *huper* followed by a accusative means "under," with some tying the practice for baptism for the dead, again, with Paganism, with Pagans sprinking water on themselves on top of ancestors' graves. However, the use of the genitive case simply means *huper* carries the meaning of "on behalf of." In short, the Greek text is further conducive to the Mormon practice being that of ancient Christianity, contra the authors of this text 
 I lived in France. I know plenty of fat French women. And French women who drink hard liquor every day. And French women who drink coffee more than just in the morning.  French women don't have the market on thinness by any means. People all over the world have guilt about eating and learn bad habits. The author starts out trying to be objective but her arrogance comes out loud and clear as the book goes on. And her dropping of French phrases here and there throughout the book are downright annoying.  Nothing new in this book. Eat less, exercise more. 
 This is the type of feel good no meat and potatos thinking that permiates the liberal left.  An agenda designed to fail from start to finish because the author refuses to accept the reality that regardless of what you do money does not solve problems, accountability does 
 A slow, loggy movie about a philandering husband (everyone was guessing this was Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein in the Nora Ephron novel on which the movie is based; he was Ephron's husband). Jack Nicholson plays the husband and Meryl Streep the wife, and both are uncharacteristically bland. There is hardly anything to the story: they marry, she gets pregnant, he gets restless and wanders. We finish watching knowing and caring as little about all this as when we started. Very dull 
 I wanted to cry when I put this book down because I miss the Danielle Steele that wrote 'Thurston House', 'Family Circle' and others.  For years now I have felt that she is simply putting out books because she is contractually obligated to by her publishers.  I really feel like her heart just isn't in it anymore.  She has become very idiosyncratic and predictable.  Every book has her main character 'being honest.' I keep reading because I am a loyal Danielle Steele fan and I write this in hopes she'll read it and either decide she is writing because she loves it (like she once did) or decide to retire and let us love her through her earlier works.  This book was just awful.  
 Mr. Reichheld has impressive credentials and I respect his intentions, yet in this book he recommends using poorly-developed surveys to understand customer or employee loyalty.  That's extremely misleading!  That process and the results gained will only mislead management and will not truly indicate how loyal customers or employees really are.  The only true way to understand and manage customer or employee loyalty is to talk to them and let them express their own thoughts! Mr. Reichheld has missed the mark 
 I am writing neither to critique the movie nor to eplore the quality of the video or audio. I would simply like to warn potential buyers of the manufacturer defects that I have enconter with TWO copies of this DVD.   The first copy was scratched so severly it looked like a fat guy attempted to use it to ski down slopes of rough pavement. So Amazon promptly shipped out another. The second copy didn't have a scratch but the movie hung up in the EXACT same place as the first. ANNOYING! I am currently waiting on another copy, but if it's bad I'm giving up.  *IMPORTANT* Consumers, take my review very seriously because I suspect these other reviewers have no experience with the DVD, they're just fans of the film. And what an awesome film it is 
 To give you an idea of where Lipstadt is coming from, I need only recount what she called John Sack on Charlie Rose (see title of this review). In a phone conversation afterwards in which he reminded her that he had sent her a favorable note about her book, she told him (he said):  "You are worse than a Holocaust denier."  This should tell us all we need to know about Deborah Lipstadt's belief (or non-belief) in the indivisibility of the truth. John Sack painstakingly researched Polish concentration camps for Germans, mostly civilians where 60,000 to 80,000 perished, men, women, children, and babies.  According to his research, 3/4 of the camps' staffs were Jewish.  This is to be found in John Sack's AN EYE FOR AN EYE, whose facts have been carefully checked.  Lipstadt is a denier herself of historical atrocities that sort of provide some balance to the Holocaust.   I wouldn't support seeing her treated as Irving, Zundel, and many others have been for real or alleged Holocaust denial because no one should be jailed for their reading or misreading  (even intentional misreading ) of history.  But what she does is in principle no better than what they do.  She denies other atrocities she doesn't want to believe in.   But what is much, much worse is that she wants to deny any forum for those whom she targets.  She, herself, is even  worse than the Holocaust deniers, because while being a denier of another sort herself, she wants to shut up the other deniers.  At least they haven't tried to do that to her, with the possible exception of David Irving and his libel suit against her.  Still Irving has never advocated jailing people for their beliefs.  I'm not sure how Lipstadt feels about the many jailings in Germany and Austria for Holocaust denial.  But the only Holocaust denier or so-called denier that I know of that she says should be released from imprisonment is Irving himself, and her reason seems to be only that she doesn't want to see him made into a martyr.  That's not too impressive a record in supporting a humane, free society, my dear, not at all 
 Gail Griffith writes very well and this is indeed a gripping story.  Lots of compassion is demonstrated for suicidal and depressed teens.  Nevertheless the book is very one-sided and misguided in its presentation of the benefits of antidepressant therapy.  This is particularly surprising in light of the fact Will so clearly demonstrates adverse side effects, even the beginning of serotonin syndrome, well before his suicide attempt.  This is not surprising in light of the enormous doses of three different drugs that he had only been taking for a relatively short time - enormous for someone only 17 years of age, 6 feet tall and reputedly less than 150 pounds, very thin for that height.  He was nauseous, vomiting and had significant memory loss.  In addition his suicide notes are examples of a dissociative state, in which one feels one is watching from outside oneself with no real sense of the consequences of one's actions, that has been reported repeatedly by survivors of antidepressant harm.  The fact that his own doctor and the doctors who endorse the book do not recognize this is a sorry testimony to the influence of the pharmaceutical industry over the psychiatric profession.  The other endorsements come ironically from Andrew Solomon and Paul Raeburn who have themselves inadvertently described adverse events dramatically in their own writing.  I hope readers will examine more critically the differences between underlying depression and the adverse effects of mind altering drugs.  
 The whole point of buying casebooks like this is to have handy a collection of the most pertinent points of relevant cases presented in an effective manner that makes sense.  That said, Sullivan (who FAILED the CA bar exam) does a horrible job editing, and fails to make a decent casebook.  Many of the cases in this book are either significantly under-edited, leaving you to wallow through the entirety of all or almost all of the opinions, with no focus whatsoever.    The rest are merely noted in brief paragraphs, oversimplified and summarized beyond recognition, glossing over major Constitutional turning points (especially so in the sections on the incorporation doctrine and reproductive rights).  Sullivan especially oversummarizes and oversimplifies Rehnquist and Scalia's opinions in an unhelpful manner (displaying her extreme left-leaning).  The most telling sign of the poor editing is the very size of the text.  It is massive.  It is no surprise that inside Sullivan utterly fails to make her points succinctly or directly.  Chances are, if you are reading this, you HAVE to buy this book for a class.  Woe be to you.  Settle for a cheaper, used, old edition of this texgt, and go buy yourself a decent outline 
 Ridiculous, laughable! Written by a patriarchial mentality. If a man wants to know what a woman thinks or wants, then a man must ask a woman. No man understands women! The only woman who could be 'explained' by this nonsense is one who's been brainwashed by patriarchial idelolgy, and there are quite a few of that type in America (and in Saudi Arabia, and in Afghanistan, and ....).   For a book that does explain women, to both women and men, see Simon de Beauvoir's 'The Second Sex'. Excellent text, I've read and reread it many times, with greeat benefit. 
 This series obviously suffered horrible rewrite ambushing as the network slashed their future (& their budget) by axing a second series. It shows, the CGI sequences are weedy and the dialogue becomes trite & suitable only for simpletons.....shame....as an idea it had potential 
 Well let's start off with the obvious good things about the book: It has hundreds of listings of artists and groups, and... um, hmmm...  Now the bad things: Yes, although it does have loads of references and can be handy at the desk, this book is not quite the type of book that a true "Electronica" fan would appreciate.  First of all: if you have a regular & reliable connection to the internet, then don't bother with this book, because all AMG did was cut & paste all the Biographical info from their website's (Allmusic.com) Electronica genre, and throw it into a book, except the book actually has less Discographical information than the website, and Discographies are what collectors are truely interested in.  The website has much more info on releases from artists and groups.  Secondly: I would say that a full 1/3rd of the book is full of total no-name junk, or groups & artists that do not belong in the Electronica genre.  Yes a full 1/3rd I would say is junk, like loads of listing for groups in genres like "indie-pop", "Avant-Hard", and "Synth-pop" .  Those aren't really Techno type styles.  Speaking of wasted paper, AMG devoted nearly 2 and a half pages to a guy named "Amon Duul" Amon Duul??? Who the hell?  Yet, they gave "The Prodigy" just over 1 page, yes the most famous Techno act of all time got one page, and Amon Duul got 2 1/2.  Third: Let's not even get started on the dozens of Industrial and Drum N' Bass artists & groups that were left out of the book, however not to say that AMG might be doing a full book on those genres, because they include some Industrial and Drum N' Bass groups in this book.  Fourth:  For some inexsplicable reason AMG decided to leave out the following Techno artists, dj's and groups: Mauro Picotto, Giggi D'agostino, Mario Piu, N-Joi, AK1200, Blank&Jones, Seb Fontaine, Trip Theory, Messiah, Antiloop, Dj Venom, X-Dream, Armin van Buuren, Freaky Flow, Agnelli&Nelson, etc..  Fifth:  I guess AMG forgot about most of the important Females of the Electronica genre, because these women were not in the book: Dj Irene, Sonique, Lisa Lashes, Anne Savage, etc..  And to think, I was almost employed with this firm...  In conclusion, this book basically has an inkling of Biographical info on lots of Electronica artists, but it also wastes alot of paper with no-namers, and leaves out several important figures in the Techno scene.  I recommend cutting out the middle man (this book) and sticking with the Allmusic.com website for quality info 
 I was listening to water boil this morning. I preferred it to this album 
 I have always been interested in Critical Chain from a PM perspective and, more generally, the concept of Theory of Constraints.  I thought this book would be a great way to extend my knowledge of ToC and to learn about how to move away from critical path.    The real meat of this book doesn't even kick in until about Chapter 4.  Prior, there are lots of thoughts about the many sins of "critical path" and how we're all doomed to failure if we don't change our ways.  Then, the book starts to get into how to actually use the technique.  It's a long discussion... without a lot of "knowledge checks" to make sure you understand what is going on.  There are technical diagrams, lots of them, many of them without a whole lot of explanation.  I found myself occasionally having to re-read sections two or three times to really understand what the author was driving at.  I'm sure this is a practical book if used as a "complete reference" but in my opinion it's not a good guide for someone who wants to understand the basics quickly and then gain extensive knowledge of the topic over time 
 Considering the director's track-record, the high quality of the original movie (The Poseidon Adventure) and the budget available for making this remake, I found Poseidon to be an absolutely awful and uninteresting movie and a complete waste of time and money. I give it 1 star because I cannot go any lower than that. I read the reviews before watching it, so I was prepared for the worst, but it was even worse than I expected. Let's keep in mind we're talking about a film that is supposed to be a blockbuster movie here, not a mere TV-film. The only positive thing I have to say about it, is that it is mercifully short. While watching it on DVD, I barely overcame the urge to fast-forward certain scenes. The plot has holes so big an oceanliner the size of Titanic could sail through them and still have room to maneuver. There is no introduction, no explanation whatsoever as to where the ship is going, who the people are, what caused the monster-wave, etc. Calling the main characters two- instead of three-dimensional is giving them too much credit. You don't care at all whether they survive or die, the only exception perhaps being the little boy. The CGI effects aren't all that great either. I never knew so much things could explode on a partially submerged ocean-liner (a typical and, to me, illogical and extremely irritating Hollywood trademark). The movie really is no more than a boring and repetitious series of clims and crawls through poorly lit and generally burning areas. The water is supposed to be cold and salt, but that doesn't show, even for a second. Although they are just (first-time) passengers, the people involved know their way around the vessel remarkably well (even though it is turned upside down)and have an uncanny knowledge about its inner workings and where to go for escape. They know exactly which hatch or stairwell to take and which button to push, even scared and exhausted in the dark and underwater. Ever been inside a large ship or ferry boat yourself ? You don't know which end is which or where to go if your life depends on it. At the end of the movie, the survivors reach daylight and: lo and behold: there's just one piece of wreckage afloat and it is an inflated life-raft, conveniently located near the bow-thrusters. In typical Hollywood tradition, the ship sinks bare seconds after the survivors have climbed inside the raft. Mr Petersen's Poseidon project should have sunk well before he got started. A seriously uncool movie that is insulting even to people who are looking for 1,5 hours of brainless entertainment.      
 I did not find this book as helpful as I was hoping. First, and most importantly, I needed more examples. There was only one and it was a service organization and I needed to see an example of a manufacturing organization where the target customer was not so geographically limited. Also, I found that the way the book is organized was difficult. I felt the book was more oriented toward helping someone sort out their thoughts and feelings about starting a business than it was focused on actually structuring and writing a business plan. What I actually need are the hard, factual mechanics of writing a business plan and I did not find it to my satisfaction in this book 
 This book held a lot of good information as a reference volume, but it made for VERY dry reading.  It is overloaded with archealogical references, and sice it is written in order of topic and not region, it is very disjointed.  It is hard to follow the history, myths, and beliefs when they are spread out over several chapters.  I find that by the time I get to a second mention of a myth or regional story, I've forgotten what I read about it in a previous chapter!  It is especially not a good book for a beginner just trying to get an overview of older pagan traditions 
 The razor I bought came with packets of this gel, as well as the lotion.  Possibly due to the consistency, the gel gets used up more quickly. It is also not as comfortable to use as the lotion is.  The key ingredient that makes the difference is menthol.  The gel has menthol, so that's why it can be irritating.  I read a review of shaving basics online, and it says always avoid shaving with products containing menthol.  The lotion, on the other hand, always helps get a better shave, and is quite soothing 
 This antenna does not fit the Timex XM clock-radio antenna port.  Therefore you must guess which XM radios it might fit 
 I find it down right scary that this book is taken so seriously as demonstrated by the reviews at Amazon. Let me say from the outset, I agree whole heartedly with Hammes's premise. The DoD is not now and seems to have little interest in fighting the wars we are likely to have to fight in the next 25 years.  At least that is how it appears to an outsider. The problem is that Hammes then goes off in a long dissertation of muddleheaded thinking and analysis that tries to connect things that have no relevancy and missing the important points entirely. He further demonstrates his ignorance with factual inaccuracies in an effort to support his ideas. Here are just a couple of examples. He claims that his versions of warfare were only possible after various economic, political, and social developments took place. He demonstrated this, in the case of 2GW, with a comparison of Waterloo in 1815 where 200,000 troops were involved to Agincourt in 1415 where only 31,000 troops took part thus showing how development had allowed larger armies to take the field. Is he for real? Has he read any military history? What about Darius who faced Alexander with 134,000 to 47,000 in 331BC. How about Hannibal against the Romans at Cannae with a total of 130,000 troops in 216BC, or Genghis Kahn who led 180,000 troops against a Chinese army of 500,000. Here is another example; he dates 4GW to Mao in the 30's. Has he read Mao, who himself wrote about the origins as much earlier, particularly the Russians against Napoleon. Our own language betrays his ignorance, where does he think words like vandal, thug, and assassin came from? He goes on to dismiss what he calls 3GW which he mistakenly equates with maneuver warfare. He never mentions the most important development in military thinking in the last 50 years, the work of Col. John Boyd and associates. No where does he describe the Boyd cycle or OODA loop. He does say that international terrorist have the upper hand, "At the stratgitic level the combination of our perceived technological superiority and our bureaucratic organizations set us up for a major failure against a more agile and intellectually prepared enemy". This Col. Hammes is exactly what is called being inside your opponent's OODA loop, and that is the problem we must solve. All the rhetoric about evolution, 1GW, 2GW, 3GW, and 4GW. The long dissertation on social, political, and economic development are irrelevant. What is relevant is to figure out how we can get inside their OODA loop before they are able to exploit their current advantage. Admittedly not an easy thing to do but certainly not helped by mudding the water as Hammes has done with this book. If you are unfamiliar with the OODA (observe, orient, decide, act) loop get the episode of the TV series "Legends of Airpower" and read "Certain to Win" by Chet Richards, or go to the man himself, Boyd's works are available on the net. 
 I was disappointed with the whole thing:  mostly commentary and not much content;  I'd have expected and would have liked more of each show and less of the commentary.  It felt to me like the authors missed their mark and focused on their documentary rather than on the subject(s).  I wouldn't recommend at all, even at the reduced price from the original retail.. 
 i enjoy incubus they are a talented group but from hearing this it sounds like its written before they learned how to play there instruments properly.its way too intense even most metal heads would probably be a bit intimidated.fungus amoungus is an example of when something becomes so heavy its unlistenable.it sounds more like korn than incubus.in fact it reminds my of system of a downs debut (a much better album) just alot more intense and no real pause for melody ok theyve shown ability in creating something so intense and unlistenable but its just like people who want to go to see a guitarist who can play really fast for over an hour. i like incubus but all there other work is much better than this morning view make yourself science crow left of the murder this dosnt even compare to them i gave it to stars because the song shaft sounds like it could of been a filler of science and i like incubus but steer well clear 
 I received the sleepwarmer blanket last week and have been very disapointed--it is just not warm enough!!  Even on the highest setting it doesn't get warm enough initially.  It is fine for keeping warm during the night but I want to be able to turn it down to keep warm and have it pretty hot in the beginning and that is not at all what this does.  It is nice and soft but you can absolutely feel the wires as well.  Not worth the money at all 
 I only have three words for this bit of tripe Boring,Boring,Boring. 
 DO NOT BUY!!! Great movie bad studio!! It has been announced that NEW LINE is replacing Peter Jackson as the director of The Hobbit. The only way to stop this injustice is to hit them were it hurts the wallet. Do not buy or see anything New Line till The Hobbit is returned to its rightful director!!! 
 Unfortunately, I received this book for a holiday gift. As a designer myself, I was surprised that this book was published so recently, because it looks old and dated. Fussy rooms crammed with too many cutesy touches is not something I even want to share with my design clients, so I did not keep this on the bookshelf in my office 
 Here we go again--Leary's disciple R. A. Wilson is promoting drug use to reach "higher" states of consciousness. He's also a big fan of that old egomaniacal phony Aleister Crowley, of course. If Wilson ever got a clue what real enlightenment is he would have to repudiate many of his books, and this one in particular. Don't hold your breath waiting for it--like Leary, he'll go down waving the hippie flag all the way 
 This piece of filth was written by a self-loathing male and is bought by misandric, self-centered imbeciles. It's nothing but a grocery list of men's faults and an insinuation that women, in contrast, are perfect. Even violence against men is joked about: suggestions of women shooting men and even severing their private parts.  If there were a similar book about WOMEN being awful, NOW would have sent death threats to the publishing house. Ridiculing men for about a hundred pages is no different.  This piece of sexist garbage is for the woman who says how much she hates men -- and then wonders aloud why no one will go out with her. Who in his right mind would 
 I did not buy this book, but morbid curiosity DID get the better of me and so I stood in the aisle and paged through quite a bit of it. I wish I had not done that. When I decided I'd had all I could take, I could not get the book out of my hands fast enough. I even went to the magazine section of the bookstore to leaf through those cheesy celebrity rags, just to see pictures of smiling, beautiful, healthy people who were impeccably groomed and dressed. The contrast to what I had just seen was startling, and made Death Scenes all the more depressing. I stayed a bit depressed, and thought about the graphic images many times in the days that followed. Bottom line: If you want to see pictures that will make you think that the "good old days" were the most horrific, sickening, pathetic days in history, this is the book for you. I'll give the book two stars because it certainly does what it intends, but I just can't give it any more than that....I am STILL having trouble eating!! 
 We bought this book for our 3 year old who is fascinated with dinosaurs. I was pleased with the illustrations and the easy to follow layout, but when we got to the T-Rex, Xenotarsosaurus and the Yangchuanosaurus, the pictures became too graphic for my son. For example, the T-Rex is carrying what looks to be a severed limb from another animal in it's mouth. I realize that some dinosaurs are meat eaters, but I was hoping this book was a little less explicit. I think this book could be better for an older child 
 this movie is trash big time garbage it sucked big time 50cent can not act at all i rather watch my neice act in a grammer school play than watch 50 cent act in this crappy movie it sucked big time he should take more acting classes 50 cent do us all favor bro sticking to raping and give up acting please 50 for the love of god just give up tryin to be the next rapper - actor  just do all a favor  and do not do any more movies ps 8 miles was a lot better movie than get rich and die tryin 50 get lost pleas 
 The hypothesis is pretty basic and the book takes a long time to get around to it. Not worth the read. He could have summarized all the good thinking in this book into a fairly short magazine article. In fact, let me summarize it for you and save the time. Evolution doesn't inherently lead to more complex organisms (like humans), scientists just focus on those organisms at the expense of simple ones (like bacteria). There, now you can read something else instead 
 Parts of this story are entertaining, but parts of it tended to bother me.  What really bothered me was that Harriet did some mean things to people in her class, but her nanny never told her that what she did was wrong.  She seemed to tell Harriet to pretend to be sorry, even if she wasn't sorry.  That attitude is what really bothers me about the movie and the book 
 OK, this obscure slasher seems promising... good premise, attractive and interesting cast with a few known names, decent budget and effects, a sense of humour and witty, bitchy dialogue. I mean, you'd think a horror flick about competing for cheerleader queen would be a can't miss, no? So where did Cheerleader Camp go astray? In two major areas... pacing and body count. Nothing ever really happens until the ending, and after all the build up, most of the murders occur offscreen! So, basically, there's no payoff. What a waste of a great set-up an an eager, game cast. Don't buy, rent 
 I would first like to start by saying, "What Happened." I loved all three of Noire's other books however this book was a total blur. It had a decent plot, no rising action, a predictable climax, and a twisted ending. It would have been wise to concentrate on one or two characters. However, this books was maybe 300 pages but had like 20 different characters. Prince is the only artist that I know who has the ability to drop new material every three monthes. Word to the wise Noire, "All money ain't good money." In other words, putting 50 Cent's name on a book doesn't mean anything to an intellect. 50 cent can afford to flop he's rich, however you are not established yet. 
 I'm not sure there is anything here that was not originally in Simple Abundance save for the description of her recent moves and marriage. It all fees so "90s." And I feel just the opposite of the person who  said she likes the way the author quotes a lot of other writers in the text. It breaks up the narrative and feels like filler. I'm glad I just looked at this in Barnes and Noble and decided not to buy 
 So I finally rented this tripe as I was curious.  Gee, making fun of former Soviet block nations/people and rednecks.. now there's some seriously funny stuff..NOT! What's next? A cutting edge comedy on the rap culture?..oops, he already did this with the Ali G show. Gross out potty humour, now that's inventive and we've never seen that before! I also like the lame-o attempt to show how Americans are all anti semitic by putting words into the mouths of those trying to sell him something. These are your imagined demons/foes Sacha and overall your film is pretty boring and about as fresh as a Yakov Smirnoff comedy bit 
         This album, overall, was not what i was expecting to get.  I thought I was going to get an entire album of songs like "The Promise", however after that opening and amazing song, the rest of the album goes into some sort of adult contemporary music thing.  Bottom line: this album is only worth it for the song "the Promise", unless of course you're a fan of adult contemporary 
 This game was originally released for 10 dollars. Almost everything about it is pulled straight from Diablo and is not quite as good. Though this game has a few things about it that are interesting, and can be enjoyable to some people, I would just skip this game and go for Diablo 2 
 I like Domar's book but it's just not very fresh.  The Woman's Comfort  Book by Jennifer Louden and other books proclaimed this same message years  ago - and with more style and detail.  But I do love hearing it from  Harvard 
 I dont think the other reviewers are quite accurate in their assessment of this text.  The book does offer many examples, and the pseudocode is very helpful in implementing these methods.  The real problem with this book is that many of the explanations of the methods are written in pseudocode.  This makes learning the concepts extremely confusing and difficult, as they are written in code.  The proofs are helpful, but with the confusing notation in iterative methods, there is no way near enough information to correctly learn what is going on.  I took this class in graduate school and never used the book unless I wanted to see some code.  My advice: Take notes from the professor, and if you need to code up a method, go to the library and copy down what you need.  A VERY poor teaching aid 
 An incredibly bad film, whose only redeeming feature is Lana Clarkson, in (and out of) some skimpy outfits.  She's completely gorgeous, but even she can't save a disaster of a film.  Buy Deathstalker instead 
 Many of the ideas in this book are very contradicting to the bible. Read C.S. Lewis' responce to this book "The Great Divorce" 
 Because I like faster music with a beat that makes me tap a foot, I only liked the cut "Lucky To Know You."  "Seeing Through You" is all right, too.  Perhaps Reynolds will independently release a CD of his own with more songs like "Lucky To Know You."  
 In the fine print it says "The audio side of this disc does not conform to CD specifications and therefore will not play on some CD and DVD players." This should be in bold face, bright contrasting colors on the cover! I have numerous different CD and DVD players and it will not play on any of them. This is very disappointing as I can't seem to find a "normal" format of this album 
 As a specialist in the field of Autism I was interested in this families journey as well as the potential for new treatment ideas. I found the writing to be long and ponderous. It was not until I got to the final third of the book that I felt like the reading was worth the time 
 I can't believe the audacity of Brad Steiger. It takes a lot of nerve, or very little honor, to publish a tome of obviously fake photos and ho-hum ghost stories that were admittedly lifted off various Internet sites.   Steiger has little respect for his sources: He rewrites their testimony into his own words, so that every single story and anecdote sounds the same. Not only that, but several phrases are used over and over--I lost count of how many times he spells out his wife's entire name instead of merely referring to her as "my wife" or "Sherry."   It's also frustrating reading about some spectacular photo his wife took, or that was given to him, that shows clearly some spectral phenomenon or UFO--and the photo isn't anywhere in the book. The photos that do appear are of the tired and debunked ilk of orbs, double-exposure photos, even one photo of a paper cutout head GLUED to someone's shoulder!   The only thing scary about this book is that it's supernaturally LAME 
 I've read a lot of 'chick lit' in my time, but this is my first Christian themed novel. I bought it on a whim the other day and settled down to read it with high hopes. However, soon I was mumbling and getting frustrated.  Emily Ever After is clearly not the usual chick lit. It's much more... reserved than what I've read. Emily, the main character, seemed bland and weak. I wanted to push her, as she always seemed to hold back. Also, I found the plot to be very predictable, and even guessed the "twist" ending while still in the first few chapters of the novel. I doubt I'll be reading this again. Instead, I'll probably pass it on to a friend who might enjoy it more than I did 
 This was a mess. This movie gave me the feeling that I was was watching a really bad made for tv film. I was mesmerized at how deplorable the acting was. Everyone just seemed like they were sleep-walking through their roles. Viggo Mortensen is generally a decent actor but in this he acted like he was just acting in this so he could pay off a car loan. All in all, this film was predictable, formulaic and a bore. Please save your money for something worthwhile 
 	A foreign girl moves to North America, a place she was never suspected to have fit in, and manages to become the top student in her class. Ewa or Eva Hoffman was a thirteen year old, Polish immigrant when she arrived in Vancouver. She adapted quite well after a year of uncomfortable living. She became the Valedictorian of her high school, went to Rice University, and then Harvard. Lost in Translation by Eva Hoffman is a book not worthy of the reader's time. 	 	The main character in this book complained about her situation too much. Maybe Eva didn't want to move, but it turned out for the better. She was safer, she got a better job then what she was hoping for, and she got to experience a whole new lifestyle. Instead, Eva complained that she didn't fit in because she didn't wear make-up or because nobody understood her Russian jokes. The majority of the book was filled up with complaints. Another example would be how she was mad that her friend at college was just too stupid to understand her, but actually Eva was just over analyzing the situation. Everything that happened to Eva in America had a negative side to it, which the author always wrote about.  	This book was also very difficult to understand. The author jumped from time period to time period in an unsystematic way. At one point she was talking about high school, the next paragraph was college, then her childhood, then the boat voyage, and finally back to high school. The author could be talking about piano lessons in America and then she will write about her best friend in Poland and how much she misses her. If the book was in a regular pattern, readers may be able to understand her life story and maybe even enjoy it slightly.  	This book is completely uninteresting and it has no plot. The author basically wrote down a bunch of random events that don't form a story. Even if the book was in a sensible order it, the story would have no plot and it would still be perfectly boring. The author just tells a bunch or random events that happened. An example would be when she overheard her parents talking about books, then it was about her friend at a school for the arts, then the author moved on to a summer vacation. The author can move on to different events because this is a biography, but there is no sense in jumping from event to event without actually having a reason.  	Lost in Translation by Eva Hoffman is simply a book that should not be read unless absolutely necessary. Eva complaints were far too many, the book was difficult to comprehend, the book has no storyline, and it just isn't interesting.  A. Coffin 
 For beginners only. Written as if you don't know anything about the business, so if you don't then buy it. It will not open your eyes to anything new if you're in the business 
 The diagrams in the book where nice, but man this guy isn't an author. You can tell he knows what he is talking about but he just uses a lot of lingo. Thankfully, there is a glossary, but it takes too long to look up every word. He just tells you the different parts in mechanisms. He doesn't really explain how anything works. By the way, he has like 5 nicknames for every part. If you are a beginner too complex, if your an expert you probably know this stuff. If you have the money and your an amateur go ahead. If none of the above I wouldn't suggest this book 
 but it sounds like running bath water.  I too have had exposure to real woods, real rivers - this is not it 
    I originally bought this title when it came out as a four-part mini series in 1997 and it is still one of the favorites in my collection.     Kingdome Come is an Elseworlds (what if) story set approximately ten years after the retirement of Superman and subsequently nearly every other super hero. As the story unfolds, the reason Superman quit is revealed. A rival hero named Magog killed the Joker and was put on trial for murder. When the public cried out for his aquittal and it was granted, Superman quit in disgust. The results of the public choosing a hero that would kill are very apparent in the future.     The children of the super heroes we know are everywhere. They hold society in a state of terror as they enforce justice and fight each other in the way they see fit, destroying property and causing chaos. Wonder Woman approaches Superman in his self-imposed exile in the nuclear wastleland that is Kansas and asks him to return and lead the former heroes in returning order.     When Superman returns to the public eye in issue #2, it sets into motion an Apocalypse as described in the Bible, but with Superheroes being the catalyst. The new Justice League rounds up every violent super human and puts them into a prison designed by Mister Miracle(The world's greatest escape artist) called the Gulag. All this is shown from the viewpoint of Norman McCray, a disillusioned pastor and friend of the Golden Age Sandman. He is led on his journey by the Spectre (DC's Angel of Death)    I absolutely love this story by Mark Waid, the way he wraps comic characters and events into a Biblical epic is brilliant. The painted art by Alex Ross is jaw-dropping in it's realism. The re-imagined characters are god-like in their depiction, especially the Flash- a red blur wrapped in lightning wearing a winged Greek helmet.    Issue #3 ends in a cliff-hanger with all the villains rioting and breaking out of the Gulag. As Superman races to the scene, he is thrown to the ground by the only person that could, Captain Marvel. I still remember waiting for issue #4 to come out.     The fight scene between Captain Marvel and Superman was voted #1 all-time by Wizard magazine and is worth the price of this trade alone. Even  without this fight scene, I would rate this as one of the ten greatest mini-series ever, but with it Kingdom Come is #1.   The only possible negative to this series is that you have to already know something about comics to fully appreciate all the subtleties Waid and Ross weave into this story. Nearly every DC character is pictured at least once.(A geek's paradise I guess) After reading this I actually liked Captain Marvel, who I had always seen as an even cheesier version of Superman. The fear the other heroes have of him and his power level make him hard to laugh at, despite Jerry Ordway's Power of Shazam monthly series to the contrary.   I hope my description of the story has led any undecided mind to pick this up. Fabulous art and incredible writing. (This should be 5 stars, but I can't seem to edit my rating 
 I have owned this little hub for at least a year. I have an older PC which came without USB, so I added a PCI adapter. I soon realized that I needed more ports, and more convenience, than the two now located in the backplane of the PC on the floor.  I shopped around, and this item looked appropriate. As for the short cord, I solved that issue by getting a USB extension cord at the same time. Besides solving the immediate problem, this approach gave me the option of moving the hub to my laptop at some point, and using the extension cord for some other purpose.  For a long time it did exactly what it was supposed to do. I attached an external hard drive through it. I used it for a compact flash card reader, and a digital camera. I connected an inkjet printer. Everything worked, once the drivers were installed and everything was set up correctly. (This was all with Windows 98 SE.)  But after a while, things started getting less reliable. The system would tell me that various "drives" (on the flash card reader, or the external hard drive) were not available. Or the digital camera would not stay connected to its software. And the printer even started disappearing.  Playing with the cables and connectors would sometimes bring devices back to life, and eventually I deduced that there was something wrong either with the connectors themselves being too loose, or with wiring inside the device. Either way, it has finally become a big problem, and I am shopping for a replacement.  Most of the devices I connected were self-powered, that is, they did not need to draw power from the hub or the PCI channel at all. The hard drive, camera, and printer were all powered by batteries or AC adapters of their own. And the flash card reader, which did draw power from the hub, used to work fine. It does not matter what combination of devices I try, sooner or later the connection goes bad.  It is of course possible that there's something wrong in the PC -- but that would not explain why things are improved by messing with the connectors or the hub itself. So I have to recommend against buying it. I suspect it is discontinued and that this advice won't be necessary for much longer, but I want to prevent somebody from the bother I've been through, just in case 
 ¿Por qué se le ocurrió a Tim Burton hacer un remake de este clásico? El resultado no puede ser peor... Sólo fui a verla porque sale Tim. Que vestido de primate resultes igual de atractivo y apasionado que siempre es lo único que vale la pena de toda la historia.  Tus ojos siguen emitiendo fuego. ¡Qué no se apague nunca! You Are The Best! 
 This is junk. Since the end of the Soviet Union, it appears that "swarthy" Arabs are the new evil which the - guess what? - handsome, dedicated, sensitive-because-his-true love-died, intelligent, military-minded white guy has to single-handedly defeat and, of course, save Western Civilization from the narrow, evil-yes, "evil" again-tentacles of Islamic terrorism. And, as is the case these days in this whole genre of trashy spy novels, "Islamic" MEANS "terrorist."  And our Golden Boy does what we expect him to. This is so trashy and predictable, I feel Ludlum ought to pay us all back. Don't waste your time. 
 I am an avid Michael Crichton fan and have read pretty much everything he has written aside from his nonfiction books.  Crichton's writings are often full of action, complexity, character development, as well as a deeper underlying theme or message about society, technology, and human nature.  The Great Train Robbery was either lacking or painfully deficient of every one of these elements.  As I expressed in the title, it is written more as a historical documentation of an event rather than a traditional novel and is frequently interrupted by lengthy explanations of historical perspective.  The Victorian criminal slang used (although brilliantly) to tell the story makes it a slow, and at times, unintelligible read.  I give it two stars because it is obvious that Crichton has written a well thought out, well researched book; I only wish it didn't feel like I was reading his history report 
 The book is fine, except I had to skip lengthy descriptions about the dog trainer.  She's such a boring character.  She's young, but not motivated to work.  In fact, she quited one of her jobs when Macon covered her rent.  The dog training job was just a pretext for her to try to hook up with some men, and get support.  The point is that she doesn't enjoy the job, thus, a detailed description of her dog training job (which she doesn't seem to enjoy) was just a boring digression 
 This book was cute to look at, but completely useless. Seriously, who would do half of these silly ideas the author spouted? Dressing in your finest for dinner at home? Wearing a fancy silk robe? Using velvet curtains in the doorway, instead of on the window? Come on. By the tenth idea, I was bored to tears and regretting buying this book. Goodwill, here it comes 
 Just not funny, I returned the book and got my money back 
 I have to say I agree with some of the other reviews here, that this collection of poetry by "Rumi" is in reality modern American poetry by someone drawing only very loosely on Rumi's work. It is rather a stretch to call it a translation! If one were cynical, one might think the large number of books from this "translator" indicates merely a money-making exercise.  Much better collections/translations can be found, like Maryam Mafi's and Azima Melita Kolin's, but I would personally recommend Juliet Mabey's Rumi: A Spiritual Treasury. This is not only a gorgeous book to look at, but more importantly, both its selection and English rendition demonstrate a deftness of touch that make you think you are reading something very close to the original sentiment. A rare achievement 
 If you're planning not to buy a book, this is just the book. A well-to-do Brooklynite suffering from post-bourgeois angst (sometimes called idealism) moves to Vermont (does this storyline sound familiar?!?) to live simply and be a minimalist, something literally thousands, if not millions of other people have done (indeed are doing), except she decides to write a book about it. I'm not sure I quite I understand the splendidly ironic, oxymoronical (if not hypocritical) logic of consuming anti-consumption, but hey, there seems to be quite the market for it 
 First question: Did we really need another profile of Tony LaRussa, already the most over-exposed manager in major league baseball? Ever since he popped up in the early 80s, the media has fawned over his every move, evidently impressed by his ability to pull a double-switch and glower at the same time. Dude gets more ink than Brad and Angelina -- maybe they share the same publicist.  But if you're as big a baseball fan as I, it's only a matter of time before you succumb to the hype and purchase this universally praised account of (as the title suggests) three nights in August ... i.e., a feeble re-make of 'Nine Innings' spread out over three games so the writer won't have to concentrate as hard. I finished the book in two sittings, so I can't honestly sit here and say that it stank.  Or can I?  The central premise of the book is as obnoxious as its subject, namely the aforementioned manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, one Tony LaRussa -- attorney at law, in case you needed reminding. According to one Buzz Bissinger, LaRussa's an old-school throwback, a balls-out 'real man' in a baseball universe increasingly lorded over by timid 'thirtysomething' geeks who wouldn't know a jock strap from an iPod nano. Yeah man, those guys just sit in front of their computers all day, crunching numbers, but me, Tony L, I go by my gut! I've got 25 years of experience ovah heah, and I make my decisions the old-fashioned way! If the stats tell me to pull my starting pitcher, maybe I will, maybe I won't -- I'm going to walk to the mound and SMELL him first. Think those MBA Moneyball twerps know what a pitcher smells like? They don't even chew tobacco, mang.  Yeah, well, interesting theory. Trouble is, after taking cheap shots at such stat-head losers as Bill James and Theo Epstein, our man LaRussa gets praised for obsessively analyzing pitcher-hitter matchups. That's right -- the guy that every baseball writer hypes as a genius is making out his lineup cards based on some guy going 3-for-7 against Kerry Wood. What the *&^%? Per Bissinger, we shouldn't rely on statistics -- unless they're based on impossibly small sample sizes.   Another flaw in this anti-number, pro-intangibles screed is that we never actually see LaRussa go *against* his statistics. Seriously. I mean, if the whole purpose of the book is to illustrate that you have to look beyond the numbers and size up the player himself, shouldn't there be some instances where Big Tony plays a hunch that goes against all logic and pays off huge? or where T straightens out a player with a bad attitude, or picks up a guy in a slump? You'd think so, wouldn't you? Yet such instances are strangely absent.  Why? Because LaRussa's an arrogant jerk who doesn't relate to his players. Hell, he doesn't relate to his *family* either, as one of the book's better storylines makes plain. The book confirms the prejudices held against LaRussa by his detractors: namely, that he's a paranoid madman who micromanages his teams to defeat. This negative nutcase appears deathly afraid of *not* making a move, of being second-guessed by the press... or by himself, perhaps? Bissinger relates his relentless fretting about the #8 hitter on the opposing team possibly getting a hit, thereby allowing them to have their #1 hitter lead off the following inning. It's a mildly instructive bit of insider baseball, but LaRussa treats the issue as if he's launching the Market Garden offensive. Dude, it's the fifth inning and there's still fifty games to go! Pop a Paxil or bolt down some Jim Beam -- you're begging for this guy to relax!  But Big Tony never relaxes -- and his players never will either. Bissinger notes approvingly that LaRussa routinely expects his guys to play as if it's the seventh game of the World Series throughout the 162-game season. As such, his players are forever under the gun, terrified their manager's going to freak out when they fail to advance the runner to third, even if they're playing the Pirates in June. His players will always press, and ultimately, they'll always lose. That's another major flaw in the book: The author presents LaRussa as the ultimate authority on all things baseball, while side-stepping the little matter of his failing to win the big one. He's managed for 25 years and has won the World Series exactly once; he's also lost it on three occasions, getting swept twice. Fittingly, he lost the 2004 series to a team that famously embraced the very stat-conscious maxims that Bissinger aims to debunk. Chew on that, Buzz. (Blaming the loss on a late flight into Boston? Sell it somewhere else, bub.)  The writing, you ask? Let's just say that Boswell and Angell can rest easy. Bissinger's swinging for the fences (!) on this one, desperately throwing in highbrow references regardless of whether they fit. A spate of ill-placed phrases ranging from the Maginot Line to the Hammurabi Code culminates in the downright bizarre description of a blooper as "the kind of existentialist hit that would keep Camus or Sartre in the money." Overwrought much? I half expected to spot Vladimir Lenin Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers behind home plate. Add in a surprisingly irritating decision to italicize the phrase HIT-AND-RUN each and every time it appears -- imagine a Neil Young biography that wrote about all his FOLK ROCK BALLADS or a book on Bush that discussed the WAR ON TERROR -- and you have a sad case of a writer getting in the way of his own story. Bad Buzz, Bad.  What was that story again? Oh right, here it is: Tony LaRussa's a genius because he doesn't rely on statistics like those other guys, except when he does, and you can tell he's sharp because he wins, except when he doesn't.  Did I mention the author gives LaRussa a pass on the issue of steroids, even though Tony's teams benefited disproportionately from turning a blind eye to the problem? It just goes to show you: Never read a book recommended by Tim Russert, the man who ate Mario Cuomo 
 This monitor does not work well.  This is a lot of static and it is not sensitive to sound.  This one is going back 
 This essay may be worthwhile reading for someone getting started in the sport but it useless for the experienced sportsman. Little more than a superficial retred of what so many others have written. Save your money and buy something from the classic outdoor writers like Ruark, O'Conner, or Gene Hill. You could also try the nature writers like Teale, Carrighar, Thompson-Seton, Paul Brandreth, John Taintor Foote or many others 
 Mr. Irving is a renowned writer who has pleased readers with books like, The World According to Garp, Prayer for Owen Meany and Cider House Rules.  There is a creativity about his writing and a quirkiness in his characters that I find appealing.  What happened here?  I was so mired down in wordiness and child sexual abuse that my commitment to the book ended with the protagonist's early grade school sexual experiences.  If somebody walked into a person's home and found drawings of what was verbalized in the book, they would probably consider the individual a pedophile and his home would be marked on public records as housing a pervert.  It seems strange that a brilliant writer could go on ad infinitum, describing the same things in words and be considered worthy of praise.  Anything the book had to offer was lost on me because I couldn't get past being inundated with pages and pages dedicated to pathetic images of a young boy's penis; crude and rude, abusive adolescent girls; and body hair fetish.  Maybe had I been pulled in enough to read further, I would have found redeeming value in Until I find You.  As it played out for me, the book is not worthy of John Irving.       
 If you're looking forward to being entertained by reading a good novel, by all means buy this book.  If on the other hand; you're looking for facts... don't waste your money (and time) on this work of fiction 
 Unless you are cleaning the fishbowl, this thing is useless 
 I tried to read this book.  Then I flipped ahead and read spots of the book.  I could not, as a young Black Anthropology student juggling several more forward thinking and socially relevant books this summer, bring myself to include this backward-thinking, embarrassing 200+ pages of pompous garbage.  I have old classmates and distant family members that were actually raised in this way and on a daily basis measure themselves and those around them by this pathetic, haughty litmus test. It disgusts me that this deluded ideology still exists to this day, and we are led through the grandeur of the Black elite by Graham, who justifies much of it as he admits to eventually feeling obligated to get a nose job.  This book was offensive at best and frustrating in this day and age to understand.  I will grant that the book was accurate in its historical value, but after reading what led to this intra-racism, there is simply no reason to me as to why this should be glorified and perpetuated within Black American culture.  Perhaps Graham would have been better off with a more well thought out, less repetitive historical text expounding on just the Introduction through Chapter 2, with research that would be actually useful and insightful from a more scholarly source as well as accounts from these early Black entrepreneurs and their families in ways that don't come off so self-aggrandizing 
 Vasari's classic text is well written (translated, I guess I should say) but extremely tiresome.  For nearly every artist he simply lists their works, and rarely with more analysis than by describing them as "life-like" or "beautiful."  For example, here is what he says about Titian's Assumption of the Virgin in Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, Venice, one of his most famous and celebrated paintings: "He did a panel for the main altar containing Our Lady ascending into heaven, with the twelve apostles standing below her and watching her ascent, but since this work was painted on canvas and perhaps poorly cared for, little of it can be seen."  That's it.  The only exception to his utter factual tediousness is Michelangelo's Life, where, although he goes into almost no description of the works themselves besides his characteristic fulsomeness, he does provide some interesting anecdotes.  If you are looking to understand and analyze Renaissance art than this book will not help you.  If you are looking to engage in scholarly debate over the origins and documentations of the discussed works then you should probably read the original, unedited version in Italian anyway. 
 It is rare for me to open up a toy and find it not living up to its packaging or advertising. So I was surprised to find that the painting kit in the "Creative Spirit" box was pure garbage. The paint was half dried-up and not nearly enough to paint half of the umbrella. The paintbrush was awful. My son and I have to go to the craft store to buy more fabric paint to finish our umbrella (which is by the way pretty lame-looking already). Hope the paint doesn't wash off in the rain 
 It's rather dull and boring in my point of veiw.  I love musicals but the music for this one did nothing for me.  
 Ben Reed may fill his novel My Dying Breath with realistic jargon and a relatable boot camp experience, but his prose writing is down right terrible, his diologue is poor and his charactors are cliche and as dense as a piece of paper. His main charactors are dull and unrealistic, and  way too morally sound and flawless they become boring. Pass on it.   
 it's a waste of money. you can substitute it for any piece of plastic if you have carpet. if not, don't buy it 
 I'd heard the buzz (both pro and con) and thought I'd take an independent read. I was dismayed with this book. James Frey has insulted anyone who has gone through a real experience with substance addiction by trivializing the truth of whatever experience he really had. One of the hardest things an addict has to grasp is the TRUTH so that he can take ownership of his actions and take the 12 steps or whatever is necessary to save his life and often the lives of loved ones tangled up in the mess with him. Lies are what enable "slips" and "enabling" and "denial" and those other catch words that describe continued misery and failure. Recovery is nearly impossible without honesty. So, can we look at this man's "memoir" and expect it to offer anything of value? It's poorly constructed, repetitive, and narcisitic. Even if Oprah hadn't exposed him, the writing takes the tone of "whoppers" like Frey's account of the drug house visit in which he "rescues" Lilly. Other reviewers and Smoking Gun have written about the fantastic episodes one by one, and I can't improve on that. Suffice to say this mockery of misery and hope is no more real than a daytime soap opera.  Story lines in a soap may look like real life to one who is isolated from real life, the same way A Million Little Pieces might look to someone who has not been touched by real addiction. A real addict with typical delusion could be misdirected from a true course of treatment with tragic result. I was left with the impression he thinks institutions and people who help others with substance recovery are pitifully misdirected or inept. Like a joke of some kind. I'm not laughing. 
 Taut with international intrigue and frenetic action, Robert Ludlum's novels are generally highly entertaining and rich with suspense. The standard of The Cry of the Halidon, however, is well below his usual.   Unlike most of his other books, The Cry of the Halidon is rarely suspenseful and does not build to a recognizable climax. The plot is typical Ludlum fare, with Alexander Tarquin Mcauliff selected by a company, -Dunstone Limited- to head a survey team deep into the Jamaican forests. Minutes after successfully attaining the survey assignment, he is approached by British Intelligence and informed that the motives of Dunstone are far from honest.  Naturally, he finds himself involved not only with British Intelligence, Dunstone and the rebel factions of Jamaica but also with a third faction, an organization known only as the "Halidon." While initially this may seem gripping and interesting, the text quickly becomes confused and rambling. With so many hostile organizations and no primary antagonist, it is frequently difficult to comprehend the plot, let alone the actions of the main character.  Although the novel does become more interesting at its conclusion, I found The Cry of the Halidon to be ultimately unsatisfying, with its more suspenseful elements overwhelmed by a confusing plot, a sprawling diction and a lackluster climax. 
 I tried hard to read this book as an intelligent challenge to my faith - only to find that Dawkin's arguements require a leap of faith also- something about how irrational he is about religion - seems to dump his scientific mind and operate on raw emotion - sometimes something more like hate at times.  The man has something to say - but he really should stick with the things that he can talk about intelligently rather than straying off into a rant. 
 R Kelly's third instalment of the Twelve Play albums is downright horrible.Listening to this album gave me the impression that he lacked inspiration while he was recording it.Most of the songs are crass and forgettable.The only highlight of the album are the melodramatic chapters of "Trapped in the Closet".Overall this is a below-average album 
 Inane, useless information from a speaker so boring I could hardly get through the 3 CD's (but felt like I had to since I had spent the money on them).   Perhaps he is a great salesperson-but I cannot see it.  I bought this on the strength of the reviews and am now convinced they were his friends or family stuffing the ballot box.  I think this information was aimed at someone in grade school, not a professional sales person.  
 I thought they were going to just call it quits on Wild Things 2, but they really had to make a thrid one!!!  I was just curious so I rented it one night and I thought the acting was just bad enough.  I fell asleep though this one just like wild things 2.  Don't waist your time 
 This movie is no "Heathers."  It's not even "Mean Girls."  As hard as it tried to be witty, shocking, dark, and satirical, it just made me want to bang my head against a wall to make the pain of watching it stop.  Maybe I'm just too old for this drivel -- although I could watch "Clueless" and "The Craft" until my DVD player breaks -- but whatever entertainment value this movie was trying to push, I just didn't get it.  The movie wasn't funny (which is sad to say when one of my favorite comedic actresses, Carol Kane, couldn't even elicit a smile out of me), the plot was full of holes, and the writing seemed very rushed and contrived.  I wasn't expecting greatness when I watched Jawbreakers, but I was at least hoping for 1 1/2 hours of mindless entertainment.  Unfortunately, the "entertainment" piece was dropped and I was just left with "mindless. 
 If you want to see pictures that show parts of some great looking bedrooms, than this is a great book.  However, if you want to see pictures of the full bedroom, or to use it as a shopping mate - BUY SOMETHING ELSE!  I went to every single recommended website for bedding, and not a single site carried any beds like the bed that I liked in this book.  This was a complete waste of money for me 
 This has to be the most boring book I have ever read. Well, I haven't quite finished it yet as it's taking forever to push my way through it. And I'm sure that more boring books exist, I just haven't read them.    I wanted to learn about KKR and LBOs - particularly as a division of KKR recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer. I was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes. But this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved. There really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information. And a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material. It felt a bit like watching someone else's home video. It probably means a lot to the people involved, especially as they'll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants, but it's painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness.  I'm sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway. People don't reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years. What are remembered are broad brushstrokes - and this is what the author should have written.  There are occasional moments of entertainment - like Ted Forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds. But most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting.   The fact is: I wanted some of this information in this book. As it provided some of this, albeit with a lot of suffering on my part, I'll give it two stars.  Update: Well I did finish this book eventually. My final opinion is much the same 
 I read the book when it was first published and then a friend had a son diagnosed with leukemia and went through the same thing as the Mom in the book. Fortunately he had a lot of advocates that pushed him to ignore the insurance company and his son finally found a donor match but it was too late. So I feared that this movie would not be up to the book. My fears were unfounded, the casting was brilliant and I loved this movie, even though it is tough to watch, I still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and "must watch". That is how good it is 
 Schismatrix (1985) by Bruce Sterling  - 236 pages  - rating: 2.5/10  All the elements of a brilliant science fiction novel are here. Sadly, the author seems to have enormous problems in presenting them in a form the reader can enjoy.   His thoughts, sentance and paragraph structure are frequently incomprehensible. His writing style is rambling and confused. Then suddenly, 40 pages will go by which are interesting, compelling and straightforward. It is as if the author wrote 80% of the novel while under the influence of a mind altering substance and the other 20% while sober.  Its tragic. I can see the man has skill. Unfortunately, as a reader I am not willing to plow through the muck to get to the few moments of coherency.  If you like weird mind altering experiences you might enjoy this. I can see from the other reviews here that some people did. I have my suspicions that some of the reviews are intentionally misleading perhaps to promote sales or a new publishing.  If you enjoy interesting writing that flows with skill and allows the reader to enjoy the experience and the story without needing to decipher every second sentance then you should stick with authors like Orson Scott Card, Greg Bear, Gregory Benford, or Fred Hoyle.

 At first I didn't realize that you have to use Amazon's software to load onto the Zen.  Once I figured that out (actually my husband figured that out) the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do.  I wasn't able to edit the stars.  If I could I would give this 5 stars.  If you have tried some other sites for the Zen, they are much more difficult to use. Amazon's Unbox is great for the Zen 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 I really liked the first book--A Skeleton in God's Closet--as kind of a DaVinci Code alternative.  I was really looking forward to this one, but just could not get into it.   Besides all the alcohol usage and the semi-suggestive love scenes, the main character hardly seems to be a spiritual person. (The same issues could be raised in the first book, but the plot really [...] in.)   While I agree with much of the author's eschatology, I dislike the way that he makes fun of and dismisses so many Christians who hold the popular dispensational view.  Not all dispensationalists are raving lunatics.  Many have very solid minsitries--men like John MacArthur, Chuck Swindoll, Erwin Lutzer, Joe Stowell, Woodrow Kroll, Warren Wiersbe and countless others.  It seems that the author thinks more highly of the pope than evangelcials who hold a different eschatology.  However, there is a little chart in the book that illustrates all the different millennial views.  I used it in my Sunday school class and it was very helpful.  Bottom line--just too much stuff I want to read for me to stick with this one.  Disappointed 
 Generic advice available in any meditation book.  The author makes it clear that he was not predisposed to depression because it didn't start until he was 37.  It probably would have gone away if he had done nothing 
 While the concept of this book makes sense, application in the life of  a mother doesn't. I have four children and can't possibly retrain myself to think only in terms of my stomach. Basically the author wants you to think about how you sit, stand, carry your baby, cough, sneeze, lie down, get up and that's on top of the daily excercise routine. As an added bonus, she tells you that one jacknife can undo weeks of work! I know that at 3 am if one of my children starts crying, I don't stop to think about how to properly get out of bed first. I'm just trying to quiet my child before all of the others are awake too. That's too much of a time investment for me to make just to mess it up with one mistake.  
 i kept waiting for him to stop writing about his research and start writing the history of the screwdriver 
 I read the statement: Will send in two to three business days. It's been almost one month. I never received the video.  I'm not happy 
 Now, I could just be biased-I'd just finished "New Moon" by Stephenie Meyer the day before-but I honestly can't say I was very fond of this book. There wasn't really any character depth and I have serious doubts Raven (the main herione) would act the way she did half the time; it just didn't fit the persona at all. Like I said, I might just be biased, but the authoress didn't even put her own spin on the whole Vampire legend, or make the existing belief interesting. But, I will say it was an interesting enough read to finish. That much I can give it 
 While reading this book I found that I was rolling my eyes every page. The author rambles on relating tidbits of information that don't seem to fit together at all and are, at best, poorly organized with no discernable order (chronological, by topic, context, etc). I have no way of verifying the authenticity of most of the information (it is after all a book on secret intelligence), but I know that some of the stories are so inconsistent as to make all the information in the book suspect. 
 I don't know what I expected, but I didn't get it.  This novel has almost completely unexplained genetics and it needs more since the entire series hinges on us believing the genetics are possible.  I really don't believe the characters since the author doesn't take the trouble to develop them. She fails to explore Megan's psionic ability enough for us to care about why she's had to flee.  Nor do we have an explanation of the villain's motives. The plot seems to be a framework for some mediocre to okay erotica.  I'm slightly offended by the assumption that pheromones and hormones are all it takes to create a true mate for a human (and I include the Breeds).  These people don't know each other from Adam's off-ox but we're supposed to believe that they're mated for life--just because lions do.  Argh!  That makes the Breed the animals their detractors claim they are and reduces their genetically human lovers/mates to the same level. I hope that if Leigh continues the story, we learn more about her characters and that she treats them more as feeling and thinking people. I'll sample the second one and if it's as underdeveloped as this one, I'm through 
 i was so disappointed in this book, it made me angry. It was the first time I ever wanted to rush out and buy a book and pay full price upon hearing reviews. People were gushing over this thing. While Messoud is a beautiful writer, I beg to differ. This was stinky chic-lit. I was insulted by the stereotypical characters and didn't really see any "twist" to them at all. I thought the use of the events of Sept 11 to be really blah. The characters don't seem to grow. they all just seem like whiny, pathetic, bougie snobs. I really expected more. Don't bother buying this book. Just drive by my house and pick it up out of the trash. 
 Did not like, thought stories were full of Idealistic nonsense. Unrealistic options for the family farmer. 
 This book nicely discloses the ghost of Heidegger in much of Arendt's writing. In short: forget your 'banal' bourgeois 'jobholder' worries about material things! leave issues of redistribution or poverty to the animals! instead, stick your toga on, leave the slaves and wives indoors and ... let's do manly politics! Arendt should have ditched this hyper-masculinist, romantic Grecophilia after it got us to Auschwitz. Go read Hobbes or Montaigne if you seek a far more humane perspective on life after human carnage (in their 'bourgeois' determination to keep romantic-mystical yearnings out of the public sphere). Physically, this book just about slips inside Arendt's larger monograph on the origins of totalitarianism. I fear it is ultimately where it belongs 
 I agree with another reviewer below that this film could have had the same point without the zombies.  It was a good try but in my opinion failed at a few levels.  The zombie make up was pretty good but the pace and overall acting left a lot to de desired.  Was it just me or did they not explain why the older sister had that living fact/head on her body 
 It will not work on this drive.   Period.  I switched to Maxell and Fujifilm disks, and now I'm a happy camper 
 i tried reading it, and made it about 3-4 pages.  i'm pretty sure that's a bad sign.  i seem to recall mr. sedaris writing about his mother's bedpan or something.  the impression i instantly got was "BEEP BEEP!  PRETENTIOUS YOUNG WRITER PEDDLING SO-CALLED BAD CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES FOR FAME, MONEY AND SYMPATHY."  guess what, mr. sedaris?  i don't give a (expletive deleted) about your so-called bad childhood.  millions of people have bad childhoods and don't play the sympathy card.  check out augusten burrough's books, they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style.  
 I never really knew what a bunch of jerks these guys were until i read an interview with them from AP. Let me just start off by saying that MBR are average. Not bad, not wonderful, just average. SO anyway, they do an interview with the lead singer, and he starts talking about how he's a musical genius (LoL, thats funny), a math-rock something or other, and continues to say that the next record will be neo-progcore, and that if the fans didn't like it, then (...). "we don't make music for our fans" he said, "we make it for us". Mmhmm, thats funny, cuz generally you DO make music for your fans. If you're just making it for yourself, why should it mean anything to anyone else? More over, why do you deserve a record deal? It's selfish crap like that that leads to so many band break-ups. Anyway, MBR is watered down generic crap, stealing lines like "tell all your friends" from other bands like TBS. However, that isn't my beef. I don't care if you're generic, most bands these days are. But don't do an interview for the kids who pay your bills and tell them you're now a "math-rocker" and you don't give a (...)if they like it or not. What a jackass. If you like supporting egotistical jerks who couldn't care less about their fans, buy "stories and alibis". 
 A brainless, predictable soap opera with some of the most laughably bad dialogue I have ever heard.  This is easily the most embarrasing "serious" film I have seen and is argued to be one of the worst films of all time (the film "won" several Razzies, including Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay).  Adrian Lyne -- whose credits as a director alternate between the interesting and the unpleasant/sleazy -- directs this movie as if it were a shampoo commercial.  A woman (Demi Moore) and her whiny, annoying husband (Razzie recipient Woody Harrelson, who unfortunately disappoints) are in a state of financial crisis.  Because the couple is, well, spoiled and none-too-bright, they go to Las Vegas with the intention of winning money in order to buy their dream house.  Their plan fails, and I personally did not care because neither character is especially sympathetic.  Along comes Robert Redford, who offers them 1 million dollars in return for sex with Moore.  Then, the marriage collapses in emotional turmoil and numerous bad scenes play out (including a curious one in which a classroom of immigrants learning English from Moore miraculously understand English all of a sudden and laugh at a bunch of jokes told by Redford).   The story is trashy and sleazy, and there's not one sympathetic character in the bunch.  The seasoned Redford has some good moments, but even he cannot save the picture.  Overall, this is a Razzie "classic," to say the least, and it contains one of the most laughably bad lines I've ever heard in a film: "I really wanted you to have that hippo."  (note: If you are now wondering how a hippo ties into the film, I advise you to not bother giving it any thought) 
 In today's world not many woodworkers make things by hand. The book is hard to work with, difficult to find basic stock requirements and measurements. I would not buy again 
 The plot is ridiculous. The characters make absurd decisions that have me screaming at the book and teeming with anger. We are supposed to believe that Hank is a "normal, good" person who commits evil acts out of necessity, but really there are many other more logical, non-criminal steps that could be taken. He continually chooses the immoral path. I totally hate this book and the only reason I gave it two stars is because I am still reading it. Obviously if I hate it, but continue to read it, there is something in it that won't let me put it down. Maybe that was Smith's objective all along. 
 I loved every Elizabeth Peters book I had ever read until this one. She is one of my favorite authors and I am a huge King Arthur fan. My expectations were high. The book was horrible. The plot was loose and the writing was like a bad romance novel. The only good parts were the descriptions of the towns and sights in the Enlgish countryside. From the copywrite this must be one of Ms. Peters early books. She should be ashamed to leave it in print. This is the only book that I ever bought that was so disapointing that it made me angry that I had spent money on it.  (For some reason following this review it says it is for the audio version of th book only.  I have never listened to the audio version.  This is referencing the actual written book. 
 The plot in Final Analysis is trite and overused and the characters are flat and stock. Tedious and painful to read 
 I own a few Indonesian cook books already, so I browsed the index of this one carefully before ordering it. The recipes looked pretty standard until I noticed an entry for compressed rice, or lontong. I love lontong and was excited to think I would learn the secret to making it myself.  When I got the book, the first thing I did was turn to page 114 to see how to press lontong. Instead, I found a superficial overview of popular tropical fruits. I turned the page and under the heading "Puddings and Cake" found a capsule summary of the Badui culture of Sunda. Then again, for a cookbook, it was actually a pretty long section considering it said nothing about Badui cuisine other than that it is fascinating to watch them boiling palm sugar to sell.  I scanned every page looking for lontong. It appears only in the index.  The photos are lively, well-composed, and apt, but the text reads like an outdated travel guide. If this author's next work is a coffee table book of photos, I will buy it--provided she gets a partner to write the captions.  
 Having seen much of the work presented in this book in a gallery in Manhattan earlier this year, I can testify to its quality. Experiencing it live is pretty overwhelming - one really gets sucked into the world of each photograph. I'm afraid this volume does not even come close to recreating the experience. The reproductions are quite small-scale & printed on non-glossy stock, losing huge quantities of the vividness & detail which are these photographs raison d'etre. In person, I was able to spend hours standing in front of these photographs, absorbing the tiniest details. Those same details can't even be made out here. I was truly looking forward to the release of this volume, but I'm afraid after seeing it that I wouldn't bother to purchase it. A real disappointment - hopefully at some point a monograph will be released that's actually worthy of Crewdson's work 
  The People of Sparks by Jeanne DuPrau is a horrible book that I would not recommend to people under the age of eleven. This story takes place in the city of Sparks. Lina & Doon have just lead the people of Ember out from underground. After coming to the city the Emberites are mistreated, malnourished, and misunderstood. So Lina goes out into the Empty Lands with a roamer that is looking for treasure. The Empty Lands are full of owls, coyotes, and other odd animals. There are also destroyed homes and buildings. Following this she comes back, and there is a large fight involving everybody. After that the climax is still climbing, and the most important part is ... I can't tell you!  	The above ground city of Sparks is an incredibly small city. The population is only three hundred twenty-seven and then to make matters worse, four hundred odd some people of Ember come to live with them. With food being scarce and people on the brink of war, Lina leaves with a roamer and goes to the Ancient City. This roamer that Lina left with is very rude, odd, and is looking for buried treasure that isn't there. When the roamer leaves, Lina leaves with the roamer's partner and head back to Sparks. When the two meet a new roamer, that is going to Sparks, they travel with him. The Roamer tells Lina the clues to the treasure, and Lina tells him that it is... I can't tell you, you have to read it.  	Truly, I thought the book was horrible, and weird because I don't like Fantasies, but if you like Fantasies you should read it 
 It is interesting to see all of the gushing reviews of this film.  I found nothing socially relevant, compelling, insightful or even remotely interesting in this film.  The pace is like watching a turtle race and creates a film that IS dull.  There is nothing to like or empathize with in any of the characters.  If your going to waste your time with any of the "Three Colors" films, watch White 
 Moore sets out to blame guns, rather than the people who make Prozac and other 'designer' seditives for the massacre at Columbine High School and runs afoul of Mr. NRA himself, Moses, better known as Charleton  Heston. Heston, gentlemanly as he is defeats all futile arguments Moore, an anit-gun (mostly) leftist has v. the Second Amendment. Long live the second Amendment, otherwise the First Amendment is gone, too! Moore should wake and wise up. Better Moore efforts that are highly recom- mended are: The Big One, Fahrenheit 9/11, Roger and Me and even the un- derrated Canadian Bacon 
 Wow.. can this book get anymore boring.. I usually enjoy reading books by Robin Cook.. but what was this??? The only time I read it was when I was going to sleep, so that it would help me sleep. If your interested in reading books by Robin Cook don't start with this one. : 
 Yes, it is pretty. No, it is not a good teapot. I have made tea for over 40 years, in all sorts of pots, and this is right up there with the worst. It drips A LOT! Perhaps those who think it does not drip were just looking at the spout. And no, it does not drip from the spout. Rather, lots of tea runs down the underside of the spout and ends in a big puddle under the pot.  This happens with both fast and slow pouring, with full and near empty pots.  This teapot will most likely have to become a pretty red flowerpot. Just too much mopping up 
 The ad and description clearly state that it includes both a receiver and transmitter.  I received only a receiver. This is false advertising and is patently illegal. They ought to be ashamed of themrselves 
 ... but very little real information.  At 65 pages of large print and sprawling cartoons, rather devoid of anything exceptional.    I'd skip it and find something more informative for your child.  
 I found the book to be a slow read primarily because the use of the English language is so different. 
 I count myself, perhaps presumptiuous, as an intelligent person, and I have managed to make an A in Biochemistry using this text; BUT it has everything to do with my ability to see the mistakes and editing errors in this edition!!  From mixing up abribiations to flip-flopping ratios this text is full of poor editing mistakes.  Not to mention the website connection is more confusing and limited.  It takes more time to figure out the wierd 5 graders level of programing that defines their "living graphs" than it takes to simply memorize word for word the page the equations come from in the text (if the equations are correct in the text in the first place!)  I am befuddled by the overwelmingly possitive reviews this second rate text has.  Did I some how get my hands on a first run of this text that should have been recalled like a lemon?  Every chaptor I take my text to my TA in the course and get an error clarified and she and I stand amazed at the amount of confusing errors in this text. I have since aquired a Voet text and look forward to reading it.       As a side note: the "study guide" to this text that I bought is more acuratly a "confuse you guide" written by monkeys who took on female human names.  They add things up incorrectly for God's sake!  Even though it will cost me more money I hope to God that my second semester of Biochem uses a different text book 
 Populated with unlikeable and frankly, stupid characters, this was a tough read. Predictable in its plotting, the narrative style was reminiscent of a poorly told joke - anticipation of a punchline replaced with impatience for a conclusion 
 Be sure you are planning to use this mug tree with large-handled mugs. Small mugs, like those that come with dinnerware sets, may not fit over the knobs on the ends of the arms. Also, two of the arms did not screw in properly 
 Williamson might be a leading figure in his field, but he can't seem to organize ideas to save his life.  It's almost as though he wrote the book in one stream of consciousness, and no one ever went back to check that things flowed, language made sense, etc.  One of the most painful books I've ever read 
 If your school or professor says otherwise, take a different prof. or transfer to another school.  In fact, this text is purposely cryptic: Total BDSM engineering-style. If your course doesn't use the Schaum's outline, then you are probably being duped intentionally or by a naive prof 
 This book, How the Other Half Lives by Jacob Riis, had several very distinct themes.  First, the life of immigrants to New York City in the late 1800s was deplorable while housing for others was splendid.  "To-day three fourths of its people live in the tenements, and the nineteenth century drift of the population to the cities is sending ever-increasing multitudes to crowd them" (Riis, p. 6) Sections of tenement houses were divided by streets and alleys which divided the nationalities.  "As emigration from east to west follows the latitude, so does the foreign influx in New York distribute itself along certain well-defined lines that waver and break only under the stronger pressure of a more gregarious race or the encroachments of inexorable business." (Riis, p. 21)  Each nationality had some very distinct characteristics but they also had some very great differences as well. 	The next theme to emerge was that of work.  In some sections of the city, it was acceptable for everyone to work while in other sections, only the men did physical work while the women "kept house" or there was even mention of the men just standing in doorways, streets and alleys.  "The men sit or stand in the streets, on trucks, or in the open doors of the saloons smoking black clay pipes, talking and gesticulating as if forever on the point of coming to blows." (Riis, p. 49)  Money was earned, at very small rates throughout the tenements, by someone in the family, if not multiple people.  "Often there are two, sometimes three, sets of sweaters on the job.  They work with the rest when they are not drumming up trade, driving their `hands' as they drive their machine, for all they are worth, and making a profit on their work, of course, though in most cases not nearly as extravagant a percentage, probably, as is often supposed.  If it resolves itself unto a margin of five or six cents, or even less, on a dozen pairs of boys' trousers, for instance, it is nevertheless enough to make the contractor with his thrifty instinct independent.  The workman growls, not at the hard labor or poor pay, but over the pennies another is coining out of his sweat, and on the first opportunity turns sweater himself, and takes his revenge by driving an even closer bargain than his rival tyrant, t his reducing his profits." (Riis, p 94) 	Finally, the third theme centered on bringing about change via real people, real stories and images of real life in the tenements.  "Riis made maximum use of photographs, however, not only to illustrate six of his books, but also as lantern slides to illustrate lectures he began giving in 1888 and continued until his death." (Riis, p. xvii)  People are drawn to real life situations to which they can relate.  The accounts, photographs and images of Riis bring real life accounts to the reader, sparking more interest, creating a deeper relationship between the characters in the story and the reader.  And by doing so, Riis encourages others to take action to remedy the sad situation.  	As the previous themes are analyzed, connections can be made between them and education and society of today.  It is important to first note that in today's society, there are still sections in certain towns and cities that are divided predominantly by ethnic diversity.  Not only is housing situations but also in educational systems the divisions are found, although it is encouraged that the lines be broken down.  "The many philanthropic efforts that have been made in the last few years to render less intolerable the lot of the tenants in the homes where many of them must continue to live, have undoubtedly had their effect in creating a disposition to accept better things, that will make plainer sailing for the future builders of model tenements.,  In many ways, as in the `College Settlement' of courageous girls, the Neighborhood Guilds, through the efforts of The King's Daughters, and numerous other schemes of practical mission work, the poor and the well-to-do have been brought closer together, in an every-day companionship that cannot but be productive of the best results, to the one who gives no less than tto the one who receives." (Riis, p. 207)  Obviously different locales call for difference measures of tolerance and defend certain levels of intolerance but the lines exist nonetheless.  "The experience of this landlord points directly to the remedy which the law failed to supply to the early reformers.  It has since been fully demonstrated that a competent agent on the premises, a man of the best and the highest stamp, who knows how to instruct and guide with a firm hand, is a prerequisite to the success of any reform tenement scheme." (Riis, p. 205) 	Secondly, work was important in this book. Riis did an excellent job of documenting the working conditions and who was responsible for certain jobs in the tenements in each section.  Just as Benjamin Franklin valued an honest day's work, so did the people of the tenements.  The biggest difference between those two accounts of work was who was actually responsible for the work.  Depending upon the culture of the area sometimes it was the men, women or children, or all three, that completed work to earn money or keep house.  "Men, women and children work together seven days in the week in these cheerless tenements to make a living for the family, from the break of day till far into the nights.  Often the wide is the original cigarmaker from the old home, the husband having adopted her trade here as a matter of necessity, because, knowing no word of English, he could get no other work." (Riis, p. 105)   But how did people in this situation become educated to work?  "The old question, what to do with the boy, assumes a new and serious phase in the tenements.  Under the best conditions found there, it is not easily answered.  In nine cases out of ten he would make an excellent mechanic, if trained early to work at a trade, for he is neither full nor slow, but the short-sighted despotism of the trades unions has practically closed that avenue to him.  Trade-schools, however excellent, cannot supply the opportunity thus denied him.  Home, the greatest factor of all in the training of the young, means nothing to him but a pigeon-hole in a coop along with so many other human animals.  Its influence is scarcely of the elevating kind, if it have any....With no steady hand to guide him, the boy takes naturally to idle ways." (Riis, p. 136)   	Finally, it is important to note the third theme of bringing reality into the lives of the reader.  In education today, it is important to show real life application of concepts and ideas for learning to take place.  Riis was a pioneer in bringing photographs, real images and valid data to people to create a felt need for change and response.  Most photographs in the book are very dark and only add realism to the stories told.  For example, the photographs on pages 93, 104 appear very dark and the subjects unhappy.  The fact that Riis was probably standing, himself, in the darkest part of the room and photographing the lightest part of the room, near the windows, only tells the reader that even in the lightest part of the room, the darkness and dreariness ruled over the tenements.  "Riis's use of photography to point his words and flesh out his anecdotes is no less important, endowing an entire legacy of its own." (Riis, p. xiii)   	I believe the intent of the author was to simply bring a big picture view to narrow minded people.  He very much accomplished his purpose.  By using stories of families, shocking details and everyday photographs of real people, he was able to bring people to understand the reality of life in their own city and encourage them to help make changes.  It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words, and Riis is a prime example of this.  Not only are his accounts vivid and horrific, but also his images leave nothing to the imagination.  The reader can not be left to imagining a rosier picture than was intended.  The illustrations both verbal and nonverbal are graphic and moving. 	The appropriate audience for this book would have to be very broadly, mature, adult citizens of our world.  The language used in this book can be, at times, a bit complicated to comprehend; this is why I believe it appropriate for mature adults.  I also believe very firmly that adults are sometimes the most difficult to convince to take action to help those less fortunate or those in need.  When we read real life accounts and see pictures of people just like us in deplorable conditions, it is difficult for us to sit back and take no action.  I also believe it is important for citizens of our world to understand the underlying message of helping those less fortunate or those in need who may be right in our own back yard.  This book is a stunning example of one man giving factual accounts of events to produce concerned citizens ready to take action to improve conditions for fellow human beings.  
 I love Linda Howard, but I didn't even finish reading this book because it was so boring and annoying!  The heroine was a whiny martyr--she drove me crazy!  And where was the suspense?  I truly can't believe that people liked this book!  If you want to read a good Linda Howard book, read "Mr. Perfect" or "Dying to Please" 
 the other reviewers are correct in that there are a few nuggets of knowledge in this book, but nothing that hasnt been written somewhere else. they are also correct that the budgeting, beauty, and food ideas are basically bad advice. i found this book underinformed and uninteresting. the author seems to know a smattering about everything but an expert on nothing... dont waste your time 
 The part about the plain soldiers of the revolutionary war being dealt with so much in detail is boring and tedious. Better to have written about the founding fathers of the US Army who were at least colonels in the army's birth. 
 This book will not give you any help into the mechanical workings of the human body.  The illustrations are weakly done in white chalk giving almost no basis of form.  I would now recommend spending the extra money for a  medical anatomy book breaking down all the muscles and bones for you.  I am  still astonished this is a reprint from the 70's, they should have just let  it go out of print and never brought there mistake back to life 
 The silver "metal" paint wore off within a few months and the plastic clip broke off so it can no longer be clipped to a pocket.  Also, the turning mechanism that exposes the pen tip no longer turns without great effort.  I bought this for my boyfriend and he got a few months of use out of it, but now it's basically junk.  Neat design and fine quality of sound, but not lasting.  
 North Country has a few things going for it and plenty against it. The magnificent photography and gritty settings give a rare view to the forboding Iron Range in Northern Minnesota and the script and performaces by major-league talent have the best of intentions. Unfortunately, the sum of this film is less than its parts. The storyline is simply too familiar and cliched - even the run-down town and factory settings smack of "Silkwood." The backstories of spousal abuse, family dysfunction, and (gasp) Lou Gehrig's disease are right out of a "Lifetime" movie.So are the "dramatized" scenes of a labor meeting and the tepid courtroom confrontations.  The perfomances are mixed: while Harrelson walks thru his role with one eye on his paycheck, Theron - "uglied up" yet again - has her eye on Oscar. She scored an undeserved nomination for this role as she fails to convince on all fronts.   The best performances come from supporting players: McDormand is excellent as the ironically named Glory who is beaten down the the Union and by life. Spacek is equally effective as Theron's Mother (she played a similar role in "Marie" in 1985). Overall worth watching for the scenery and supporting cast 
 I can not describe how painful this book was.  The first quarter of the book goes at the pace of a moderately entertaining tale, but then grinds to a halt as soon as Silas is leashed with the orphan girl.  This book stands out in my memory not just for instilling a loathing of the written word that nearly took my away from literature for the rest of my life, but for the great amount of negative space it left in my brain when I try to recall some of the "excitement" of the drudgery of Silas's everyday life.  Truly a GREAT classic to unload on junior high children 
 I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it.  I'm upset.  Any advice 
 This is an ok album but the 'revolutionary' sound is definetly no where close to richard hell and the voidoids. The 'saturated' punk guitar sound is also no comparison to robert quines mastery on blank generation. Infact no single member of television can compare to his voidoid counterpart, especially tom verlaine, whos writing, although good compared to popular artists of his time, is still no match for richard hell 
 The theory's not bad, and, unlike Robert Venturi, Frapton can string together four or more sentences without self-contradiction.  HOWEVER.  The text here is so dry you'd almost rather eat it than read it.  Of interest  to students and serious scholars only.    Altogether too often Frampton lapses into what Robert Campbell calls archispeak, an impenetrable wall of words borrowed from, in this case for example, phenomenologist philosophers.  I appreciate that a lot of thought went into the theory Frampton puts forward, but this is not a theoretical text.  Frankly, if you're authoring a history you ought to take a cue from Wittgenstein instead:  Speak clearly or not at all.  William Curtis's book is a much better history, or at least a far more comprehensible one, as is Spiro Kostof's more wide-ranging text.  This should be seen as a companion book to either of those, a dense, theoretical appendix, perhaps.  Frampton's syntax is almost torturously overwrought, a sure sign of someone who spends much more time thinking about and researching things than communicating them (and of a real dearth of good editors in the community).  There has got to be a middle ground between the coffee-table picture book and the kind of history aimed squarely at other writers of (and future writers of) architectural theory.  (And I say this as someone who routinely reads architectural theory and loves the Modernist movement.)  If only Reyner Banham were alive to write the reply (or even clarification) this book begs.  Come back to this book in grad school, and even then sample it in small doses 
  I'm of a mixed mind about this book.  While it might be useful for somebody to build one or two of the easier projects with a bunch of hand power tools when bored on a Sunday, most of the designs are rather flimsy.  The book seems to be designed around making things out of a 5 piece power tool kit and cheap wood you can get at home depot.    What it does NOT do is teach you anything about Fine Woodworking.  It seems to attach everything together with screws, which is probably the least effective long term way to put a wood project together.  The entire subject of basic joinery is skipped, and it has you buying hardwoods like Oak even for painted projects where cheap pine would better serve your needs.  The subject of wood movement is almost completely ignored.  There are far better project-based books out there, if you want to learn about woodworking, and not screwing scrapwood together into some not-very-attractive furniture. 
 I also have the problem of random disconnects.  We had a techie come in and try to set it up for us, he got it working, but the thing still randomly boots us off.  It does the job, I guess, of giving us a connection, but it's got almost no reliability.  I hear it's got a lifetime warranty; good, we can return it 
 Check it, So I got my new headphones I had been waiting 2 weeks (free shipping deal) for and when I opened the box, I was like, sweet, these look pretty tight.  Then I went to put them on, ya know, test them out, and the darned things would't fit over my big dome. I went to adjust them and i was like, they can't be adjusted! I went to lift them up and Oh snap... them things snapped!! I got mad and threw them against the wall, packaged them up, and sent them back. I still havent received my refund.. 
 I absolutely loved the John Irving book that this was based upon.  Very quirky (especially for it's time), hilariously funny, and the characters he created were magnificent.  In my opinion however, the movie was uninteresting and only mildly funny.  Not many movies do justice to the books they've been based upon, for many reasons.  This is no excuse for Hotel New Hampshire however.  Irving's "World according to Garp" was a superb book (similar in length and complexity to Hotel NH), and was made into a very good movie.  I'd recommend checking out that one instead if you want to see a John Irving novel of this period on film 
 I find it interesting that the same woman who makes money off the writing of talented erotica authors now offers advice on how to write erotica.  From what frame of reference is she writing?  This book might have credibility if it were written by someone who wrote from experience -- but once again, she's sponging off the work of others.  Susie Bright DOES NOT WRITE EROTICA, she merely profits from it 
 I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It is completely useless. There are only exersises in this book and Ravenwolf isn't bothering about any safety methods. Some of the exersises are fine, but you would find them in other books too 
 If you bother to parse the author's execrable writing, you find that he has very little to say about whatever it is French people do to avoid obesity.   Instead, he goes off on tangents. He tells cutesy anecdotes about family members that probably aren't even interesting to his other family members. Having established the the French are more inclined to eat organic produce and natural-sourced food than Americans, he then fills PAGES with irrelevant (and dumbed-down) factoids about chemicals in food.  If (as he says) the French aren't big on surgical solutions to obesity (e.g., stomach stapling and liposuction), why has he included an entire rambling chapter on them?  In fact, you might wonder how how someone as apparently incapable of getting to the freaking point as Clower got a PhD.    But if he just stuck to the point, he wouldn't have a book--he'd have a short, not-well-supported essay suitable for peddling to one of the less-renumerative ladies' mags.  Unsurprisingly, he sticks to the hard-to-quantify, touchy-feely (and generally useless) explanations for how the French stay thin and avoids mentioning the one contributing factor that most epidemiologists agree on: The French smoke like chimneys 
 an astonishingly bad book. i'm amazed a respectable university press would put something like this out. incredibly breezy, sloppy writing, many typos, little theoretical sophistication...just atrocious 
 a better title for this book might be, strange signposts in an otherwise interesting world.  He became a devout Catholic while the rest of us were questioning its relevance. C. Pierce's psychologic discovery or insight does not seem especially significant.  This MD does not provide the right presciption for our times 
 On November 28 two better versions of this collection will be released.   The first is entitled "The Christopher Reeve Superman Collection".  This release is listed on Amazon.  This version will have 8 disks including a 4 disk special release of Superman I with both the 1978 release and 2000 expanded edition (don't know how that relates to the longer TV version only shown twice).  There will be a two disk version of Richard Lester's Superman II which will only contain one version, not the longer TV version (a darker film), which has not been rebroadcast.  There will also be one disk versions of III and IV with some new special features.  In the case of IV it is not clear whether it will be the version released in the US or the 20 minute longer version released in the rest of the world.    I and II will also have remastered productions of the Fleischer Studios Superman cartoons, long overdue since the special edition VHS versions of those cartoons (no longer available) were of superior quality to the DVD releases.    The four Superman movies  as described above supposedly will also  be released individually.    Most importantly, the long hoped-for Richard Donner's version of Superman II (a noticeably different movie from Superman II heretofore available) has been completed and will also be released seperately at the same time.  This is not just a modified cut, but actually a noticeably different movie as Richard Donner had a different view of the basic story.  For one thing, Marlon Brando as Jor-El has a major role in Richard Donner's version, while he was totally writtten out of Lester's intrepretation.  Marlon Brando's appearance in Superman Returns was made up of alternate takes of what he did in Superman I.  What is in Donner's Superman II has not been seen publicly before.   Donner's Superman II is not planned to be part of the collection above.  Superman Returns will also be a separate release in one and two disc versions, although this is not yet shown on Amazon   On November 28 the Ultimate Superman collection will also be released.  it will include all of the above along with the Richard Donner cut of Superman II, the 2 disc version of Superman Returns  and a host of special features.  Not yet sure if Supergirl  will be in the package, although a new release of that (not yet listed on Amazon) comes out the same day).  Still some speculation if 13 or 14 discs.    There is reportedly another package, also called the Ultimate Superman Collection, that will come out the same day, consisting of 19 discs.  Not sure what's on the extra discs relative to the US release.  That version will be released abroad, not in the US, at least not now.  Maybe later, after they've sold as many US versions as they can and want to see if they can sell the collection agian with these extra discs.  
 First, let me say that by quality film standards this is a terrible movie, in many respects. I live to walk on videos of this type with football cleats. But, this movie falls into the "I hated this movie so much, I couldn't help but watch it whenever it was on" category. And now I love it. I don't know what it is about this movie. I tried to put my finger on it many times. I always have and always will hate "Sleepless in Seattle," which is a totally contrived load of crap. But "You've Got Mail" has an undefinable charm to it that forces you to look past it's simplified portrayal of a happy go lucky, skip around the neighborhoods of New York atmosphere. It makes you question why you buy into such sappy dialogue and situations. It's not just because of the Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks chemistry, because I hated the despicable "Sleepless in Seattle" and always thought the entire premis of "Joe Versus the Volcanoe" was a joke. But in this movie, contrived as it may be, that interplay between the two works. Though their acting is also hammy at best, I also love the contributions of Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey, Stephen Zahn and Jean Stapleton. This is one of my guiltiest pleasures. I'll only watch it with the remote on toggle to some type of sports programming in case my friends walk in on me while I'm watching it so I can jump inmmediately to the "Binford Lumberjack Finals," or something like that. But were they to walk in at the end of this movie and find me glossy eyed with a lump in my throat, I'd never hear the end of it. I love this movie. There! I admit it. 
 I had this book for a college class and it is terrible. I found it to be very, very vague on it's topics and just barely skims the surface. The diagrams are drawings, and they are not very good for the representation. If you want to learn about equine science, this is not the book 
 A bit of a disappointment. Anecdotal and reflective, but not really informative about how the process of creativity works. A little bit scholarly and pedantic 
 I purchased this product for my niece,having had positive experiences with similar items,and finding the price to be too tempting.However,what had been the hope of introducing her to the videogames of my generation turned into an exercise in frustration from the outset.The screw to the battery casing stripped with very little application of a screwdriver,the titles suffered from redundancy,and many of them required the use of too many buttons.What was the most disappointing aspect of this item was the potential it possessed; perhaps fewer similar titles and a re-configuration of the button commands would ensure the promise of this product 
 JIll gave me her recipies for Prime rib,Yorkshire puddin, mushrooms, brussles spurouts, Pasta melonaze and others years ago and they are a staple in my home.  I gotta get her book before it is too late 
 The book, while full of interesting facts and data regarding traditional and indegenious religions in Africa, is quite frankly, a dull read!  The book tends to be overly clinical and does not delve deep into any one particular ATR.....in fact, one of the biggest sections on Yoruban religion is minimal.  This book would be wonderful for anyone researching Comparitive Religion within the continent of Africa or someone dealing with superficial data 
 You are just as likely to need the assistance of the above referenced title as you are to gain information from this book. It could be re-titled: "Gardening for Dummies" and possibly pass muster as a helpful guide.  For landscaping - save your money and invest it in plantings. Most of the text is dedicated to construction projects (decks etc.) what plants are good for what purpose (height, width), and the value of good landscaping.  Unfortunately the text discussing HOW to landscape effectively is breezed through with only the briefest nod to the MOST elemental concepts.  A (with liberties taken) paraphrase,"  You will need dirt.  Dirt is available at garden centers.  Plants will not grow without it, so make sure you have some before you attempt to establish your plants." For any but the most significantly stupid, this book is useless for the purpose it alleges to serve.  I would have given it a "0" star rating, but that isn't an option 
 I was hoping for a book that had actual plans and dimensional drawings of various coops.  Instead, this book is more of an "ideas" book or a grand tour of various coops that people have built.  Definitely a disappointment 
 I have purchased AK in the past but this is the first time i was disappointed. The shoe felt cheap to me and not very sturdy. I would not recommend this shoe to anyone 
 St. John's book is fun to read if you're a college football fan and been involved with tailgating and RV'ing to a game.  He isn't a very accomplished writer with a lot of poorly phrased ideas, strangly structured chapters and several out of place remarks.  That's really criticizing his style more than substance, so others may not be as annoyed by it as I was, but on almost every page something showed me his writing could have used a good edit (or rewrite).  I love the topic he picked and thoroghly enjoyed reading about the Alabama football culture.  It's a lot of fun to read about, but I'd be surprised if anyone outside of the college football universe would care much for it 
 I bought this pump because it had the medela name and I thought it was reliable. I was wrong. This is the worst pump in the world. Everything the other poster said is true. This is the worst breastpump. I would NOT recommend this breastpump to anyone 
 This band has had some interesting moments over the years, particularly their seminal release, "Up In It", which featured alt.punk classics like, "retarded."  THey made an MTV worthy breakthrough with "Gentleman" but after that their legacy just sort of trailed off... This album yearns to be a come back album, along the lines of "Gentleman" but it comes up short in every way.   The main plus to this album is the funky, groovy drum beats and guitar hooks, but they sound dry and uninspired compared to earlier whigs efforts. Also, the lyrics are grating and monotonous.... you'd think he'd find something else to sing about after all these years, right!? If you are a die hard fan, then of course you'll want this album for your colleciton, but if you're new to the whigs, start with Gentleman 
 "Looking Backward" is considered a classic of its type: Utopian literature, which was popular from the sixteenth century into the beginning of the twentieth.  But of course, the vast majority of lives were lived in desperation then, and any escape into a better world was well received.  Bellamy was 31 when this book was published.  As the narrator, he relates his experience of being put into a hypnotic trance as a sleeping aid in 1887 only to be awakened 113 years later, sound of body and mind just as he was when he went to sleep.  But the world has changed to a completely socialistic system.  Bellamy goes into interminable explanations of how the new world operates.  His characters go into long winded, somewhat repetitive, explanations of all phases of this new order.  These tirades become brain numbing in their length and use of archaic words.  I believe it would have been much easier to take if he had made his explanations through dialogues instead of monologues.  And then his character goes out into the world of 2000 Boston.  But, what does he see that's new, different, and exciting?  We never find out, because he doesn't tell us.  In fact, the only new inventions he describes in the entire book are water fountains whose spray works as airconditioners in buildings, awnings hanging over the entire street to keep out rain, pasteboard credit cards, and music and sermons piped into the home through telephone wires.  Too bad he didn't talk with some creative visionaries about what the world might be like in the year 2000, and incorporate some of those concepts in his tale.  He says nothing about changes in fashions, transportation, or any other aspect of his new surroundings.  And there is a glaring error in his utopian world:  He does not take into account human nature.  He glosses this over by claiming that the new socialist order was so successful, that all humans immediately fell into step and laziness, jealousy and greed are no more.  As if that would happen. There is one thought in the entire book I found illuminating.  Paraphrasing here:  Credit can be compared with nothing else but the plight of a man building a house with dynamite for mortar.  With that, I agree.   
 The author cites the evolutionary and empirical evidence of modern day science and presents a convincing picture for justification of God, then completely deviates from reason and fact and concludes that science is a type of mythology - that we know nothing.  It was a boring read but I hoped for a climatic or at least informative ending...neither manifested.  
 The "bottom-line" on "Brainless" is that one has to be "brainless" to take time to read Coulter's writings, and even more brainless to waste the time to read an analysis of them.    Yes, it is mildly interesting to learn of Coulter contradictions (eg. bashes the elite, then takes on Harriet Miers - partly because she didn't go to an elite law school, and "I believe everything I say," vs. "Most of what I say, I say to amuse myself and amuse my friends."  And then there are the infinite number of brainless "Coulterisms" and unsupported assertions - eg. "public schools have more sex scandals per year than Catholic priests - thirty times more," "Liberals lie about the science on stem-cell research because they warm to the idea of destroying human embryos," "I've never seen people enjoying their (9/11) husbands' deaths so much."  On the other hand, Maguire really doesn't have that much to say that IS INTERESTING!  On the other hand, if you hadn't figured out already that there is someting seriously wrong with Ann Coulter - this book won't help.  Save your money and your time 
 I heard tracks from this album on Putumayo's World Music Hour.I'm glad I didn't plunk down any music for this CD,as much as I like Putumayo.  "Nouvelle chanson" isn't my cup of French coffee,that's for sure.I reccomend Lo'Jo to those with Gallic tastes;they are a spicy ratatouille.The selections from this are as sappy as cream puffs;chocolate-filled croissants are great,just not in excess 
 This is a fast-paced book with all the formulaic elements required of a political thriller. Nothing here particularly surprised me. I would guess that if you have enjoyed Mr. Flynn's other works you will enjoy this one as well.  Mr. Flynn needs a more assertive editor. His use of language is so sloppy as to distract a reasonably sensitive reader from the finer points of the story. This probably isn't detrimental to the reader's comprehension, but it is irritatng.  Finally, one very minor quibble: non-standard spellings are used throughout (such as "harken" rather than "hearken"). This may or may not matter to any given reader, but I found it to be worthy of mention 
 This book is political punditry done poorly.  The doctor should stick to medicine, and try to do a better job there.  Instead, he ventured into politics and criticized the Bush administration for fighting terrorism.  The left, and in particular the elite media, might think that terrorism is not a real danger because a particular person's probability of being harmed is very small.  Granted we have not executed well, but most Americans believe we must take it seriously because these beasts are driven by ideology to destroy our society.  The doctor also decried the U. S. pharmaceutical industry for charging high prices for their products.  He completely ignored that fact that the U.S. pharmaceutical companies are the ones with a steady stream of new drugs because they have the financial incentive to investing in research and development.  The Europeans and Canadians are getting a free ride by their governmental price control.  If we did what these governments do and force our drug companies to sell at low prices, no one will invest in developing new drugs.  When the doctor stuck to the theme of the elite media exaggerating fear, he did have a valid point.  But the real motive of the book was left-handed political sniping. You know it when Bill Press is impressed. 
 First of all, you'd think a movie called Leatherface would tell us something about Leatherface, but it's just something used to sell the movie.  Now that that's out of the way I'll say this:  I don't think I've seen less happen in a 90 minutes movie.  Honestly, the series of events that take place in this movie only goes by so fast because nothing much happens.  That said, this is A VAST IMPROVEMENT OVER TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2.  They didn't yank our chains trying to make this into some goofball comedy, and rightfully so, Tobe Hooper wasn't even realistically considered to direcy.  Unfortunately, no one really was, not even the director, Jeff Bur, who's vision was stripped of all its gorey glory.  Like he says in the short documentary on this disc, The movie is called Leatherface - The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, so what are people surprised about?  Particularly the MPAA, who seem to live for the ruin of directors making studio horror films.  Well, fortunately this is New Line we're talking about here, and just like they did with their Jason Goes to Hell DVD, they give us the R-Rated version that saves us the trouble of looking away from the gorey parts, and the Unrated Version that actually does make us look away.  Too bad the movie just isn't good.  It's not bad either.  I put it right in the middle because of the strong comeback it makes from TCM 2, but it really just doesn't grab the audience's attention.  Not even Viggo Mortenson's unknown roll in the movie really does anything for the movie, but I do recommend this to horror fans, or TCM fans.  The DVD is nice, with a 30+ minute documentary that's very honest about the making of the movie and the frustration faced by the director.  There's a commentary as well, with deleted scenes, and alternate ending, and trailers 
 My 3 year old son received this puzzle as a gift from a friend and he was very excited to carry it around in the Thomas tin, and look at the picture while he was putting it together.  Great Fun 
 This author is certainly not the best writer. The story was dull and so was the writing. It was predictable with no twists. I was disappointed. NOT a pageturner 
 Coelho has really gone over the edge with this nonsense.  Not one single incident is to be believed and instead of penetrating is funny.   He either overdosed on drugs or alcohol or was hallucinating.  I couldn't stop laughing at what I know was meant to be a very serious book. If Coelho believes this actually happened to him, he's in bad shape and can't be taken seriously. The promising author of Veronica Decides to Die is quickly deteriorating.  How sad 
 I have read all of Mary Higgins Clark's mysteries and found this one a huge disappointment. I found it almost totally lacking in the kind of tension and suspense that made her other books page turners.  In fact i twice skipped 50 pages just to "get on with it."  I was curious who the real killer was but that question was raised at the beginning and resolved at the end with very little in between 
 After the first 20 pages of the book you will already have heard everything the author has to say, it's all about racism and sexism.  It's good to see someone exposing on the fact that anti-sexist, anti-classist and anti-racist thinking is shaping the way many things are handled, some good points are made in this book but the truth is that once you have read 20 pages you have read the whole book, all it does is blame the same factors on everything and I found myself skimming thru the 3 later chapters trying to find something new to read about, but it just keeps on going on the same thing.  This book may be novel and insightful, but the author lacks the writing skills to put it together into a coherent and readable essay on the subject.  not worth buying, not by a long sho 
 Their new stuff is even worse. But this is still sexist, boring, annoying music at its worst. There are much better artists out there, so why listen to these two untalented rappers 
 Grisham's worst book by far.  90% of the story is preaching to the reader that homeless people just have bad luck and are good guys.  It would be ok if that was woven into a good story, but it is not.   For great Grisham read The Firm and The Partner.  For very good, read Runaway Jury and Pelican Brief.  All of these are page turners.  Street Lawyer is a stomache turner.  Really bad.  What happened 
 I haven't read this book, although I expect that it is probably very good since J.A. Jance wrote it.  I have buying all her books for some years. However, I have been buying paperback books for a lot longer, probably longer than Jance has been writing.  But NOW, book publishers, not satisfied with an average increase of more than 30% in the retail price, have come up with a "new" size for more comfortable reading.  BALONEY!! It's for greed! I do not intend to buy this new size.  Having carried paperbacks in my briefcase for more than 50 years.  I doubt that the publishers will even notice.  After all, I am 80+ years of age and the volume of my book buys are of little interest to the new breed of publishers. I will miss my many favorite authors but not for long. Goodbye, Adios, Adieu, and vaya con DIOS.  J. Dwayne Taylor - jdlet@tstar.ne 
 After completing my first year of law school, I really wonder why so many professors use this textbook.  More than half the people I spoke with in my class thought the casebook's usability was poor or worse.   Property is not a difficult class, aside from future estates and related issues (Rule Against Perpetuities).  The hardest thing about property is knowing the jurisdictional views on various aspects of property law, and this casebook does only an OK job highlighting that.  It is basically a lot of memorization and the learning of that material could have been substantially aided by organizing the book differently.  Additionally, many of its cases are not sufficiently edited, thereby necessitating that one read through too much irrelevant information to get to the legal issue.  My other case books are much more balanced on this issue.    As a last note, the production quality is lower than what I would expect for its price.  The paper chosen and the fair reproduction of what photos exist in the book contrast strongly with its price.    I suppose this sounds like a laundry list of complaints, but the book compares poorly to my other casebooks, simply stated 
 In short, why a 1 Star Rating you wonder?  Took forever to set up properly; long wait time and poor help from tech support; automatic set-up I doubt will ever work for anyone.  Though it does work once finally set up. __________________________________________________________  So I decided to go wireless at home with a new laptop, new wireless router, and a wireless print server (PS), so I can put the printer in the garage and free up space in the house.  I did a lot of research and decided to get a Belkin router (F5D7231-4) and this PS from the same manufacturer so hopefully they would set-up easily together. This is definitely not the case!  First be warned this product IS NOT WPA compatible!  Thus, even though the router is WPA able, you cannot use WPA with the PS and thus have to use WEP for the network once this product is used.  Hopefully in the future this product will support WPA, but it would only hopefully do so thru a Firmware Upgrade.  Do not think this PS is WPA compatible.  Next, be warned the box says "3 Minute Easy Install" - well it took me about 12 hours total to get the PS working now wirelessly.  I am not a computer techie, but I am smart, a great problem solver, and savvy enough to teach myself how to create a whole html website with hundreds of pages.    I tried to set-up the PS on a static IP address, as recommended by my techie friends, but this just did not happen.  Thus, next time I restart the router it may assign the PS a different IP address and then I'll have to find it thru the router interface and reconfigure the printer set-up for that new address-so I plan to spend more time in the future revisiting this issue.  The crux of how I got it to work is by using the router interface and entering the MAC addresses of the PS and computers in the network.  This is the golden key I searched for for hours trying all permutations of all the other settings in the router's and PS's web interfaces.  Only this way was I able to unhook the LANd-line from the PS to the router and get it to interface and thus work wirelessly.  Belkin tech support had medium wait time, friendly techs (not always speaking English without thick accents though), and they were unable to solve my golden key for me.  They even promised a chief tech would call me back but that never happened.  So, yes, the product works fine but just be warned from someone perhaps like yourself that I had to learn way more about this whole network/configuration issue than I ever wanted or expected to, and I had to manually configure the whole set-up to get this product to work. 
 The Seeds have been dismissed since they first arrived on the scene. This collection won't help that appraisal. Too bad. This is primal, grinding stuff that in the original vinyl configurations rocked with a unique, twisted snarl like few others from that era. The first album in itself, in its mono original form, is unlike any other. But this collection is just another excuse to recycle poor-sounding replicas of the masters. Plus, it lacks one of The Seeds classic, "Out of the Question, often covered by bands in modern times. Too bad Audio Fidelity and Steve Hoffman were unable to secure the masters as they attempted to do several years ago due to "Sky's people," whoever they may be 
 I'm puzzled as to why anyone should pay $59.39 for these three DVDs that currently retail on Amazon for $11.24 (Signs), $14.99 (Unbreakable), and $26.99 (Sixth Sense*) totaling $53.22?    *There is also a less expenseive "Collector's Version" of the Sixth Sense that only costs $14.99 if you'd rather not pay the $12.00 for the "Vista Series" extras.  I'm also skeptical as to whether the version of Unbreakable sold here has as much content as the Vista series edition sold seperately that contains 2 discs (I assume this edition does not because this box set only includes 3 discs, 1 per movie).    I love the movies, but where's the price break on buying them all together when the package is $6.17-$18.17 more than purchasing these DVD's seperately???  
 Extremely difficult to dig through the excessive examples in order to find the relevant theorems and results. Because of this, the problems at the end of each chapter become exercises in tedium, as more time is spent searching for the necessary theorems in the text than in actually working out the solution.   I do not recommend 
 I have had 2 faulty units right out of the box. The first would not hold a charge for more than a couple of days and that did not improve after cycling the battery a number of times. I returned it for a replacement and that 2nd unit never indicated a full charge - even after being on charge for several days. I am moving on to another brand.  Don't waste your time and money on these poor quality items 
 How could anyone call DEL HEDGEPATH a success when all he is doing is ripping off poor college kids by renting out delapidated, unlivable houses to people can't afford otherwise. Better research should be done not to martyr a con artist 
 Get the book, this one covers off on some of what he went thru but falls flat on the time he spent in combat. I remember AMC showing this movie and the host commenting that Audie Murphy went thru a lot trying to get his book on the screen. Basically, they sanitized and cleaned everything up to the point where if you were young enough, you might think war is not that bad even if you get killed. I have had a copy of the book for about 20 years and have read it about 3 times, viewing the movie once ws enough for me. It is amazing how "all is quiet on the western front" made much earlier when standards were even more rigid was able to pack a bigger punch, make a point and be more satisifying than this watered-down mess. Get the book, wait for the movie to come on TV 
 In the Cthulhu Mythos, Clark Ashton Smith's The Book of Eibon ranks up there with Lovecraft's Necronomicon and Derleth's De Vermis Mysteriis; imaginary works of such soul-searing occult horror that readers put their own sanity and salvation at risk to peruse them. They form the basis of several story cycles and Mythos writers "quote" from them regularly. Chaosium's newest book in their Mythos series is an attempt to recreate The Book of Eibon using stories and poems written by Clark Ashton Smith, Lin Carter, Richard L. Tierney and others. At the bottom line, the attempt is courageous, but sadly, a failure for several reasons:  First, trying to create a legendary work of cosmic horror is impossible. Though many of the stories in the book are worthy of the Mythos label, reality cannot compete with the imagination. I wanted a good read to keep me up at night, not just a few hours of amusement.  Second, there is too much of Lin Carter in the book. Like Derleth, Carter was a rabid Mythos fan in love more with the idea than the atmosphere and thought it sufficient to make a story unearthly through simply listing a long litany of Mythos terms and names. Though some of Carter's stories are worth reading, such as From The Archives of the Moon, most are quickly forgettable.  Third, Price, who has edited most of the Chaosium works stumbles terribly as an editor. His introductions to the stories give too much away, the worst example being his introduction to Lin Carter's In the Vale of Pnath where he reveals the ending, ruining what is probably one of the few actually disturbing stories in the collection. Also unnecessary to the point of distraction are the innumerable comparisons of the literary creation of The Book of Eibon to the formation of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. Yes, Price is a seminary professor, but not every reader is interested in lectures in the questionable science of Biblical Higher Criticism.  Readers who are collecting the Chaosium Mythos series will want to purchase The Book of Eibon and there are a few gems between its covers,.. 
 History and folklore make this book mildly entertaining.  There is no dish named "Pickelsteiner" (p.31), the correct name is "Pichelsteiner". There is no Red Wine Cake "Duerkenheimer" Style (p.171), it is "Duerkheimer" style.   The above are two examples of sloppy editing, and some of the recipes do contain serious errors; here is one example:  The Recipe for Green Sauce on page 61 lists Oregano as one of the ingredients. Although there are almost as many authentic recipes for "Frankfurter gruene Sosse" as there are citizens of Frankfurt, this local specialty never ever contains Oregano.  While no recipe ist carved in stone, an ethnic cookbook does, in my opinion, require a greater degree of accuracy.    
 In contrast to the title " advanced concepts ", this is an introductory book. Readers waste time if they read advanced concepts chapters. Only lists of refernces are useful 
 I'm sorry, but this movie is clearly nothing more than and overdramaticized and historically inaccurate retelling of the story much more riotiously and enjoyably portrayed in the film "Dick." "Dick" is funny, this is not. I'm sorry, but Dustin Hoffman simply does not have the acting chops to stand up to someone like Kirsten Dunst (or that level of indefatigable cuteness).  Just go rent "Dick" instead. You'll thank me, yourself, and those fine ladies who saved our country 
 Just as the previous review states: I bought this toy for my daughter, age 3.5. At that age, kids are supposed to LOVE paint or anything to do with it. Well, after trying for half an hour to make it work for her in the 90+ degree heat in Florida, she asked to go inside.(that should be your first clue)  It wasn't any fun at all, and here's why:  1) The paint is very thick. I thought it might just be from sitting inside in the cold air conditioning. But after being outside (in 90+ degree heat), the paint didn't thin out at all, and when we turned the machine on, hardly any paint came out. I was *expecting* a Spin Art for the sidewalk. We got some little paint splatters, but nothing like is shown on the commercials.  I called the Toys R Us I bought it from and they agreed to take it back: being used with a destroyed box.. 
 It is bloated.  If there is any good information, its hidden very deep and i'm not patient enough to look for it.  I want my money back 
 It takes too much time to receive the first book. I haven't received the first book yet 
 The "theory" expressed here is really nothing new, and seems like repackaged emotional intelligence and other ideas. The author continually uses personal stories and anecdotal evidence as proof of many of his ideas. While I agree that IQ does not tell the whole story, this book doesn't add anything new or unique to the discussion 
 Corbusier's theories, as much as anyone's, led directly to the dis-integration of the city in favor of the elements that we currently know as sprawl. And he specifically celebrated the things that today, we are trying to painfully wean ourselves from. For example, he exulted over the fact that "I will live 30 miles in one direction from the office, while my secretary will live 30 miles in the other direction from the office, and together, we will consume enough gasoline and rubber for tires that we will keep several people busy producing them." OK, so that's not an exact quote because it's been several years since I read the book, but that's the essence. Look it up, and others like it, and you'll discover that this guy's ideas are responsible for greater destruction of western urbanism than World War II. Seriously. Look at maps of cities in Europe before the war and after. Then look at them in 1970, after Corbusier's ideas came to fruition. You be the judge 
 All of the curse words are bleeped out. I just can't get past it. Why put in curse words if you're gonna bleep them? Its really irritating 
 If the church is our example of marriage Christ LOVED us first. He did not need to be respected first. I agree with the main idea of the book, however the author puts more pressure on women than on men. Men, lead the way in love as Christ did, even when he received no respect but crucifixion 
 I'm reading some of the recent reviews and most of them are 5 star reviews. I wonder if they ever sat down and listened to the album or are they aware if Jay-Z is capable of much more.  Anyway Jay-Z's fourth album Vol.3: Life And Times Of Shawn Carter is a semi-decent album at best. In 1999, Jay-Z was possibly enjoying the mainstream status of his career, to the point that he has been lacking on the microphone. He hasn't improved since Vol.2: Hard Knock Life. His rhymes seemed to be slapped together, as shown in the second track "So Ghetto" with rhymes like "Jigga man, Volume 3/I'm back looking like me/stop the presses/ladies drop your dresses." Some tracks just fall flat on the ground like the Mariah Carey assisted "Things That You Do", and and the weak hook on "S. Carter". Awkward moments are on this album like Dr. Dre appearing on the song "Watch Me" as Jigga doesn't shine lyrically on the track. "Come And Get Me" could have been shortened and condenced to three verses, since I've ever heard Jigga do a solo song lasting longer than 4 and a half minutes. Amil, Beanie Sigel, and Memphis Bleek colab with Jay for "Pop 4 Roc" and that fails causing me to loose my attention towards it.  Now there are some good songs on this album though. The first single "Do It Again (Put Ya Hands Up)" was probably a club banger back in late '99/early 2000 with the help of Beanie Sigel. "It's Hot (Some Like It Hot)" Jay turns to his lyrical side and it works somewhat on the better side on this track with rhymes like "I'm about a dollar, what the f*** is 50 Cents" (a response to 50's "How To Rob"). UGK hooks up with Jay on the hit single "Big Pimpin" that is one of the standout tracks (If you remember when it was on the radio/television, Jay had an extra verse, that is not on the album). Mostly the production on this CD saves it from being a failure. "Snoop Track" featuring Juvenile is one of those tracks that carries a good beat.  The bonus tracks "Jigga My N****" appeared on the Ruff Ryders first comp album and "Girls Best Friend" appeared on the Blue Streak Sndtrk. A couple of bonus songs that are better than the ones on the album.  As I said before Jay-Z is capable of doing much better. Many Jigga fans want to hear the same man that was on Reasonable Doubt, and this album is far from what that is. The production saves this from being a complete failure in my opinion. Luckly Jigga stepped his rhymes back up on future albums. If you want to hear more Jay-Z or you have never bought this album and are curious, I recommend this to you. Otherwise pick up other Jigga albums.

 I'm sure this is a very nice book, just like the Writer's Market books about agents and publishers. The problem with these books is that unless you have a close personal friend in the publishing business or the theatre world, you will never get anything published or produced. No book can help you do that. It's a matter of luck and coincidence, and if you weren't lucky enough to go to college with someone in the business, you're out in the cold, and no book will alter that fact for you. Have a nice day 
 Sorry, that's just not possible.  I've read Neal Stephenson's books and he is a very, very good author.  This book is bad.  The story is extemely disjointed.  It jumps all over the place from character to character with no sense that things are coming together.  And things don't come together.  It's a very disappointing book.  Rather reread Snow Crash, The Diamond Age, Cryptonomicon, Zodiac or the Baroque Cycle.  Even The Big U is better than Cobweb 
 I am an adult with ADHD inatintive type. I have struggled all my life with this condition.  Howevere, I have managed to earn a BA in psychology and I am currently working on a masters degree.  Because of my expierences in psychology classes I know something about scientific research and empirical evidence.  This book was a major dissapointment to me because it lacks the  simple scholary research to prove the claims made by Dr Lawless. I am afraid this book is nothing more then modernday snake-oil that will cause more harm then good.  This book is so full of pseudo-science that I fear it may cause a great deal of harm to children and adults with ADHD.  Dr. Lawless is a psychologist and should now how to read the scientifice research on the subject found in peer reviewed journals.  While, I believe that the chemeicals in the foods we eat are a major cause of illnesses, ADHD and obesity, There is little scientific evidence that add is caused by diet. However, their maybe more evidence in the future.  One of his clames of red dye has been proven completly false.  Another one his claims about magnet theropy are so out of the scientific mainstream that he comes of as a snakeoils salesman.  Please do not buy this book.

 There is nothing "lighted" about this mirror, unless you use it under a hundred-watt ceiling fixture. The dim glow from behind the mirror is completely useless--I have to use it next to a window in broad daylight to see a thing. This would make it pretty much the same as an...unlighted mirror!

 This album was largely responsible for a lot of nu metal, and it was the last gasp of this once great band. It's just not enjoyable. I actually like a lot of world music and tribal music, but if you want to hear tribal metal done right, listen to Neurosis.  I have a some Brazilian relatives, and I've heard from them that, in fact, a lot of Brazilian natives took issue with Max and the other members of Sepultura claiming Indian ancestry. Most of the guys in Sepultura are 100% Portuges 
 President James Monroe is cheifly remembered for his important role in defining the relationship of the United States with the rest of the globe with the Principles of 1823 (later known as the Monroe Doctrine).  No one would argue the significant impact of this contribution to the American political landscape.  However, Gary Hart is unable in his portrait of the fifth President to enliven Monroe or to rescue him from relative obscurity.  He does make a noble attempt to present Monroe as the first "national security" president (a leader who never wavered in his commitment to keeping the United States prepared and safe).  Unfortunately, Hart fails to create an engaging portrait.  At the end of the day, despite Mr. Hart's effort, Monroe cannot possibly command the interest and respect that a John Adams or a Thomas Jefferson would achieve.     In fact, the man who was arguably greatly responsible for the Principles of 1823 and who served as Monroe's Secretary of State (who would himself become the sixth President) John Quincy Adams, upstages James Monroe's bland personality. 
 OK, so where the heck is Vince Young, Matt Leinart, and Reggie Bush in this version?  You see Reggie Bush on the cover, so you think you're going to get the opportunity to play with the Heisman Trophy winner, pair him up with Lendale White and Matt Leinart, and take on the Longhorns to try and replay the Rose Bowl.  But none of these players are to be found.  In fact, Ohio State is listed as the #1 team.  Am I behind the times?  Or is this how EA Sports does their football games?  Do I need to buy NCAA 06 in order to use these players in their prime?  I was hoping to be able to play them with updated "abilities" that would reflect all of their outstanding years in 2005.  Any ideas out there?  Is this a code or a "cheat" I need to unlock?  HELP!! 
 It took me 3+ days to get this thing to work with my notebook.  Cannot get it to work with my desktop.  Tech support was no help at all.  They just had me retrying things I already did.  If your not a networking wizard do not buy this router.  Newer models don't need the manual setup of this one

 I recently bought the Sibelius Volumes 1 and 2 in 2-in-1 sets. I wont comment on the artistic content as they are covered in others reviews of this page. The sound quality of Vol 2 is decidedly degraded - almost unlistenable - compared to the much much higher quality of Volume 1 (with magnificient artistry). The transfers are AAD on the Phillips label which, like DGG, of the 1970's are not meant for better quality music systems (even of that period) and unless remastered disappoint the listener. It is possible that reissues for this particular packaging could be faulty or may be that the repackaging is so cleverly done that all the goodies are on Volume 1 and the second-best on the second. Davis is redoing the Sibelius Synphonies with LSO and that may account for the rush to get this set out of the way 
 Not much has changed from the original diet.  You might be able to stay on it for a week and loose some water pounds, but you will not be able to survive on this one. Look for something else if you want to loose weight that will stay off 
 This is a very well-researched detective work on what in it's bare particulars is a complicated and  powerful story in the annals of sexual politics, modern media and the darker recesses of professional medicine.   However, what interest is inherent in this material is lost amid the  author's refusal or inability to write in a direct, accessible manner.   Academic history needs to be saved from academic prose -- this book is  exhibit a 
 I'll agree with a lot of the other reviewers here in saying that the music is great and Lady Day is classic in her own right, but this cd sucks for audio quality.  What day and age are we living in when this is the best they can put on a CD?    Overall very disappointing.  There are other much better quality recordings out there of Lady Day.  This one's not even worth the discounted price 
  This book doesn't even deserve a star. I just fell upon it, on a bookshelf with loads of old books in my house. I'm nearly 17 years old, and perhaps this book is the kind that you appreciate as you get older, but honestly, I don't see myself enjoying this book even in 20 years... I've read so many reviews raving about how 'poetic, sensual, wonderful' it is and what a talent the person is...sorry I don't see it!  Anyone can write a bunch of sex stories. I didn't see anything poetic in the writing...it was plain. As for sensual and arousing? Hardly. It was crude, and vulgar. It was sex, sex, sex... and presented harshly, with none of the sensuality, the sweetness, the gentle pleasure one likes to associate with sex... it was boring, repetitive, and I'll admit disturbing.  What was the point of the story where the Hungarian whatever forced himself on his adolescent children? Or the raped little boy? It was just weird. There's just the sex, and no development of any points she may be trying to make. It's kind of just left there...unfinished... unsatisfying. Frankly, it was so distasteful (VULGAR), I was shocked. And I'm not religious, puritan, conservative or any such thing...quite the opposite, I have an open mind. But this book left me cold 
 With all that happens in this book,and much of it is somewhat far-fetched, the only thing that I did not buy were the choices made in the end. They were inconsistent with the character development throughout the book. I felt cheated 
     DVD had sticky substance around center of disc which was unnoticed when loading into machine. It required taking machine apart to remove 
 I must be the only one who didn't like this book.  I felt it was written in a one-tone, endless stream of the bad events and bad people in her life.  Not one good thing or good person.  Didn't pack any emotional wallop because she didn't seem to react to the bad things that happened to her.  Now maybe she had to be that way in order to survive, but it didn't make for interesting reading.  It was hard to sympathize with her because she had no reaction herself to all these traumas.  It's unbelievable that she and her sister turned out as well as they did, but I found myself not caring about them and therefore, not caring about this book 
 I may be alone on this boat, but my thoughts on this book are more on the negative side than positive. Although the story presented traits of originality, human flaw and truth, I couldn't help but think it was all too predictable. One could imagine what would happen from the first mention of an experimentation that would increase a person's IQ incredibly. Like that saying, "What goes up must come down." right? I found Charlie's efforts of finding an answer to what was going to happen to him next were stretched and unrealistic.  All in all, ignoring the predictability, this a phenomenal example of realization, "coming of age", and loss of innocence. Charlie's yearning for intellect slowly turns into yearning for emotional maturity as his IQ raises. He notices that with his new intellect, people started treating him differently. He realizes that the world wasn't as nice and comforting as he thought it was  before 
 I took so much time for you to put the order that I cancelled 
 I hate this book. It is extremely boring and it is way too long.  There are too many characters to keep track of and many of them are extremely similar. Do not read this unless forced to. I like to read, but this nearly put me to sleep.  avoid at all cost 
 This may be the first time you hear me say this, but Go Fish was too artistic and dated for my enjoyment.  I think that if I had seen this film when it was first released back in 1994 I would have been impressed.  This was a very avant-garde film that tried very hard to discuss an issue that was very "hush-hush" back in the early 90s.  Lesbians were very closeted back then and were not a major part of the culture norm as they are today (well, as much as we recognize them today).  This makes for a very provocative film, but it also makes for a very dated film.  This was my biggest issue with this film was that it nearly felt like a comedy instead of this symbolic struggle to pursue happiness like any heterosexual relationship.  I realize that director Rose Troche was trying to show us that a lesbian relationship is no different than a male and female relationship and even lesbians talk like men talk about women, but somehow it just felt very dated and clich for me.  It didn't open more doors in my mind to the lifestyle of lesbians, but instead gave me this dated image of this butch lesbian that is rebelling against something instead of embracing the true lifestyle.  The black and white photography, while symbolically trying to show the black and white of the situation and relationship, just felt like an art film.  This was an art film, so what am I griping about?  I guess I just didn't want to see an art film with this topic.  I wanted to see something along the lines of Kids or even a documentary, not something where the uneducated will laugh at and ridicule even harder.  I wanted a film that was going to punch me in the face, not build upon dated/old clichs that instead poked my mind randomly and not very hard.  It was unimpressive.  It wasn't bold filmmaking, but instead just this random, average production about a lesbian love story.  Was it to be educational?  I think there were elements that could have been explored greater and into detail to cross that education/lifestyle acceptance line.  The scene dealing with bisexuality is the first that comes to mind.  This probably sounded great on paper, but when it was actually filmed out, it seemed high schoolish and bland.  The inner voices were not struggling with the character, but instead causing confusion and chaos that will never be resolved.  Another scene that could have played out just a bit better was the dinner scene where a group of lesbians have gathered for a party.  There could have been more discussed between the lesbians like lifestyle, issues, and current problems (that would help with the dated feel) instead of just sex, sex, and more sex.  That was a huge downfall for me was the constant reminder that all these women wanted was to have sex.  There were times when I was watching this film where I felt a bit of sweetness in my mouth because I thought there was some candy-coating happening.  This does not need to happen in a film that is supposed to bring the lesbian lifestyle closer into the spotlight.  I never felt that these women in this film were given the best light to show their stuff anyway.  From the beginning of the first scene until the last (and all those snippets in-between) all they could talk about was sex.  They wanted to have sex more often than I honestly think about in a day.  It really made the rest of the non-existent themes seem blurry and unimportant.  There was just a consistent lack of togetherness for this film that ultimately hurt it in the long run.  This wasn't a film about women's rights, but instead a dire attempt to show the similarities between homosexual and heterosexual relationships.  I agree that this happened, but just not very coherently.  There seemed to be other elements strewn together in a very loose fashion that took away from the overall power of the film.  Don't get me wrong, this could have been a very powerful film about a lifestyle that this world is still not accepting, but instead it went too far to the left (which isn't bad, except in this case) and chose to go the bleeding artist route instead of the informative, here are the facts route.  The black and white photography, the lack of character development (who really was Ely's partner?), and the cheesy moments between scenes where women talked to me about the illusive "honey pot".  It just wasn't coming together well for me and eventually fell apart all together.  Overall, I was not impressed.  There are greater films out there that express the power of the relationship and do not create this unimpressive "raw" sensation by trying to shock the audiences.  One of my favorites is the film Big Eden which accepts homosexuality like it is commonplace in society.  If Go Fish would have been done in a similar style, I think I could have walked away from the film with a better taste in my mouth.  Instead, I am stuck with an unimpressive story that did nothing except joke about why lesbian women like to play the game "Go Fish".  Ha ha ha h....it just isn't working for me.  I do not recommend this film in the least bit.  There was one, singular scene that made me chuckle and for the likes of me I cannot remember why.  It was an unmemorable feast of bad cinema.  Skip it.  Grade: * out of **** 
 I read this book for school, my sister said it would get better, but it turned out to be the worst book I've ever read. I rest my case. 
 I ordered an HP printer, which does not come with a cable, on Oct. 17th.  Based on advice in the ad for the printer, I ordered the subject cable, also made by HP, in the same order.  The printer shipped on the 19th of October.  An ink cartridge for the printer arrived Nov. 15th, but I have not received the cable.  I do not know how to rate the printer or the cable and I have already lost 30 days on the printer's warranty!!  I sure would like to be able to rate the cable and printer.  To date the order is 2 weeks late since it's estimated shipping date of Oct 28 - 29.  I have not even been able to find a way to contact customer service to see if there is going to be a long lag time, in which case I would know that it would be wise to cancel and order from someone else.  Bottom Line:  Not satisfactory at the moment 
 This book reduces Terragni's buildings to a series of graphic exercises in alignment and proportion.  Each elevation is studied separately but there is almost no sense of the building as a whole.  Totally disappointing exercise 
 This book shows the dichotomy that exists in modern-day America between the cutthroat environment that supposedly exists in the private sector, and the easy-does-it culture fostered within the public sphere of schools, government agencies, etc...  The book makes the case that America's youth are basically coddled K-12, and end up playing catch-up during and after college when working in the free-market culture of the private sector.    These conclusions have been elaborated on before in other publications, and are only true to a certain degree.  For example, the author gives examples of how Americans working in the private sector excel and achieve like citizens of no other country.  The author forgets to mention that nearly all the successful industries in this country, especially those that have gone to spawn copycats in other countries, were and are all supported and protected by government largess.  For example, automobiles would only be rich men's toys today if it were not for all those roads and parking lots built by taxpayers.  Another example, US agriculture would not have survived the Great Depression and become the world's leader in food produce if not for the introduction of farm subsidies, government-funded agricultural research, government-operated satellites and weather stations to monitor the weather, and other government programs that directly or indirectly help farmers.  These and other established, successful private industries would be nowhere without some "coddling" from US taxpayers.  Even if we dismiss the previous points, I believe the author has only shown half the picture; specifically, the author does not fully examine the question of why "coddling" occurs in schools and students are not prepared for the competition of the "real world".  The answer to this question connects the dichotomy so well illustrated by the author.  Specifically, American adults are so busy surviving in the private sector that they have less time and effort to raise their kids to be good competitors themselves.  For example, the character traits that makes for successful businesses: willingness of employees to relocate, works long hours, toeing the company line, etc..., are exactly the worse traits to follow when trying to raise kids well.   Raising kids well means living in stable communities with low turnover - this means minimal relocation of employees by businesses.   Raising kids well means spending time with them, and not spending long hours at work.   Raising kids well means teaching them to stand up for what they believe in, not what their peers (boss, coworkers, etc...) want them to do.    This then is what the author has totally missed out on in this book; an explanation of how the dichotomy between private sphere hard-nosed competetion, and public sphere cushion jobs came about.  Because of this omission, this book is merely commentary and observation, and lacks insightful thought 
 I bought one of these a year or so ago, and now it sits idle on my counter. It started producing sub-par results after about 9 months.  I have tried many of the grind n' brew products, and none have lived up to the hype or price.  After spending a week in London, I found that most coffee shops use a Bialetti type brewing system. I bought one, and my morning coffee is strong, flavorful, and brewed right... with little or no clean up or prep.  Anyone want to buy my used Cuisinart? 
 This is a messy book that succeeds (to the degree that it does so) despite its flaws.  Some of the subjects are covered well, some covered poorly, and even where there is coverage, the discussions are maddeningly inconsistent.  First, the good: author Otto Friedrich was energetic in finding many former residents of Berlin as sources for this work, and some of the best parts of the book are their colorful reminiscences of their lost and ruined city.  Friedrich also included interesting chapters about the social milieu of the time, particularly the cultural scene: classical music, drama and the nascent motion picture industry.  And there are some nice character sketches of some of the leading artists of the era: Lotte Lenya, Bertolt Brecht and various musicians.  In general, despite the crazy-quilt nature of the coverage, Friedrich is best on the social history aspects of Berlin.  Now, the bad:  The book is very scattershot, a mile wide, but mostly an inch deep.  For example, in the discussion of the German movie industry of the time, although Marlene Dietrich and Emil Jannings are discussed, Peter Lorre, Ernst Lubistch and F.W. Murnau are discussed only in passing.  Among the pictorial artists, George Grosz is covered and discussed, but Becker, Nolde and scores of other artists get superficial or non-existent coverage.  And maybe it is inevitable to try to discuss the tangled political history of the Weimar era and the rise of the Nazis in a history of Berlin, but Friedrich is not a professional historian, and his weaknesses in this area are glaring.  Any reader with even a passing interest in the Weimar era will find far better accounts of the politics of the period than Friedrich's book. And even if you grant that he needed to discuss the political events of the day in  his work, there's a lamentable lack of focus to his political coverage, which mirrors the overall unevenness of this work.  For example, his descriptions of the combat in the streets between the Freikorps and the Communists in the immediate post-war period have the freshness and vitality that come from the testimony of eyewitnesses, and they give the reader a sense for the chaos that became horrifyingly prevalent in Berlin.  But his discussion of Germany's policies toward the payment of reparations (the Dawes plan and the Young plan, etc.) is, at best, superficial and misleading.  If you read this book, you might consider reading the sections that deal with the social history of the period and just skipping (or finding better sources for) the political history. 
 I bought this and 5 vehicles for my 3-yr-old.  I was frustrated and disappointed with the quality of the flimsy cheap track and the way the track fits together.  It just seems cheap (the track) and getting the track to store as it should underneath the lid is something a younger child will NOT master.  (I even have to play around with the track a bit to get it to work so the lid/roof shuts!)  Booo!  Stick to the real stuff 
 Sebastian Mallaby certainly can tell a story and is an excellent writer.  Unfortunately, in his latest book on the World Bank and its President, his sharp and witty pen is often aimed squarely at the wrong target.    In order to maintain his narrative thread, Mallaby resorts to broadside attacks on any non-governmental organization that has the gall to critique Bank projects and policies, and insist that the Bank adhere to minimum social and environmental safeguards when dealing with the overwhelmingly corrupt, authoritarian regimes that comprise its borrowers.  It is disturbing that he would choose to "shoot the messenger" (i.e. the NGOs) rather than take an honest look at their valid concerns. In this way, Mallaby does both the Bank and his readers a disservice.  Despite the heavily footnoted text, he ignores inconvenient facts and information that is readily available, and uses clever put-downs and caricatures to demean the NGO community when he cannot respond to their genuine concerns with a viable argument.  His examination of a Chinese government-sponsored population transfer project in an historically Tibetan area is a particularly egregious example of the excesses and intellectual dishonesty of Mallaby's book.  It is most unfortunate that such a gifted writer approached such an important topic with such an incredible bias.  Too bad that Mr. Mallaby did not put his cleverness to better use 
 I had no problems burning to these discs, its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore. After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them, my discs started dying after a few months. In addition, in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become. This is true for all the discs (about 150 of them). I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 The Rebel-With-A-Heart-of-Gold-Who-Learns-The-Meaning-Of-Love scenario is put aside for a kind of soft spoof of spy pictures, which were very popular in the movies and on TV at that time. The "European" setting got  Elvis off the beach and away from the resorts but the script and direction  were basic, to say the least, and the music was uninspired and badly mixed  on record. The movie does have one of Presley's best set of opening  productiom numbers: "Long Legged Girl.." and others are rousing  tunes delivered with that Presley panache often missing from his late-'60s  efforts. But about 20 minutes into the picture even the most ardent fan  reaches for a magazine. An interesting sidelight is that his co-star was a  true "discovery" - an English teenager making her screen debut  with Elvis Presley! She handles the light-hearted assignment very well  indeed - even the "Old MacDonald" sequence which usually is  reprised on documentaries as a typically ludicrous excuse for a soundtrack  album cut 
 Having read "The Millionaire Next Door," as well as most if not all of the classics in this category, I expected life-altering experiences with this book.  There were too many statistics, and statistics that contradicted one another, not to mention generalizations about various subgroups that, try as I did, I had to put my copy down and use it at first for a door stop, then because the cover art is great, I decided leaving it on the coffee table makes a great conversation piece.  
 This author is no expert in this field. The book says nothing that I and anybody else doesn't already know. A complete waste of money. Reads like a book for kindergarteners 
    Another anxiety-driven media clown with nothing remotely clever to say.  Save your money. 
 Not much else to say about it other than that. Oh but wait we fresh it up with some different yarns. Seriously are you going to spend $100 on yarn to make one boring bag? They are pretty... pretty simple. Don't waste your money 
 I love a dark comedy more than the next person, and laugh at things that I probably really shouldn't.  So I thought this movie, hyped as a very dark comedy, would be right up my alley.  Sadly, apart from a few moments here and there, "Very Bad Things" simply fails as a comedy.  And it fails as a drama, because every single character is unlikeable and unsympathetic.  That's too bad, because the actors are fantastic and do their best with the material given to them.  I fault the script, which has problems at best, and the direction and editing, which give the movie a strangely languid character at inopportune times.  You could do worse, but this is strictly a rental at best.  
 I'd be okay with a story that had 1 or 2 last-second escapes, but this book has at least 10, if not more!  I think the author spent too much time watching action films and incorporated every single escape trick into one book.  Even a Bond film would not go this far out on a limb.  They only other Reilly book I've read is The Contest, which I suppose was just as far fetched, but I give that one more latitude since it was science fiction and this one is not.  Another complaint is that a 16th century manuscript is woven into the story - which is not a bad idea - but there was no effort at all to change the language to the appropriate era.  The book does have a lot of action though... so if you like wild adventure and can completely suspend reality, you'd probably enjoy.  Appropriateness:  I would like to have recommended this as a fun action book for teens, but be aware that it contains a lot of language and a lot of violence.  There are many gruesome deaths of all varieties.  There is no sexual content or discussion of it 
 I decided to pick this book up when I was waiting for my movie to start. I have read book after book after book from the black political left, and so when I saw this guy's book, I decided to pick it up. See, I saw him on HBO debating against Dame Dash about hip hop, but I caught the tail end. I must admit that I did pass judgement on his "blackness" based solely on his demeanor and speech pattern (not his syntax, but pattern/accent.) But I said to myself that this couldn't be right. I'm not too far off myself, being a california black academic who was always told he "spoke white". So I got "Authentically Black", as Loosing the Race was not there and I was therefore unaware of it.   QUESTION: Why is it that in Liberal California, these negroes feel an overwhelming need to be conservative for no damn reason??!? I figured that if I read this guy's work, SOMETHING WILL MAKE SENSE and help give my own leftist vies some sort of perspective. Sorry, no. This man has me academically by 15 years (him finishing college in the mid eighties, me finishing Morehouse in the late nineties) and you'd think that in that time, he'd know how to research things or at least observe society and his own surroundings. As I try to read through this work, trying to give him the benefit of the doubt at every page-turn, he never ceases to amaze me. On page 28, I was forced to grab my pen and fill the pages with ink, which upset me because I didn't spend this money to have to correct someone who just by sheer numbers should be my academic superior. But on page 28 I just could not take it, where he says that profiling is necessary to protect the black community. He makes the self-defeatist presumption that it must be okay because it is the little black boys who are pushing the drugs. OF COURSE IT IS, that's all who's there. That still doesn't explain why I get hustled by cops all over Southern California and profiled for the same thing, though I'm an attorney and damn near thirty! It also doesn't take into account the complexion of the people who are the real problem. Id suggest he sit down with congresswoman waters, but judging by his books and how he almost lies about some other author's intentions and efforts, he'd probably be so rude to her in presuming her stance that she'd slap him. (Or at least want to. I've met with her on many occasions.) He'd likely call her an opportunist and move on.  He also has the habbit of "supporting" his ludicrous points by noting two or three bad examples from his conversations with students. Usually, he'll say things like "I asked black people xyz and they are left without an answer" or "such and such happened and they chalked it up to racism, when it clearly was not, but so and so was so upset by it!" Some girl was waiting for a bus and a man dropped a quarter in her cup assuming she was homeless, or so she presumed and she was distraught. Okay, citing the overly dramatic black girl is not going to bolster your points, but makes one wonder how weak your point is that you have to (a) ask idiots questions about race, and (b) use the worst examples available as proof. Time and again he asks idiots.  Speaking as a man born and raised in the Bay Area in the community around where this man works and lives as one of "those kind of people", I can't help but to feel this man is just trying too hard to fit in, and it is not entirely rare in Bay Area black politics. He uses the propensity of negroes in that area to be able to get any kind of white woman they want as a sign that race relations are getting better, disregarding the fact that it's always black men and white women. I have yet to determine his propensity, but if I were a betting man, I would be able to pay back my loans and a housenote wagering on HIS desires for white women, which would not surprise me.   But enough of this point by point dismantling of his views. I'll do that as I prepare to write my work about the black political left using the dismantling of the works of black conservatives as a conduit through which to do so. Potential names are "Negrodicious Tendacies" or "You're Just Not Like The Others!" or "Why Are All the Black Professors Left Sitting By They Gyatdayum Self??!?" Instead, let us look at te most offensive premise of this man's "work":  Blacks are self-proclaimed victims in a world wherein racism is merely "residual", but keep up the image of victimology to make whites feel guilty so that they can give us - wait for it - hand outs and social programs. Guess what: I agree we as Blacks will die of starvation if we wait for the Larger Society to give us what we are either OWED or are EARNED (for nothing is a "HAND OUT" in america, you will always pay for it somehow if not already). But what planet did he grow up on wherein Blacks in private talk about how good they have it? I grew up almost exclusively around black professionals and millionaires amidst links, boules, masons and Jack & Jillers, and even WITH all the success and money in the world, the majority view - yes, even in N. California - was that things were worse. No, this is not just some act to make whites feel guilty and give us stuff, because none of us needed white hand outs. We already had money. In fact, we knew that problems were severe, because in no way could we buy our way out of racial problems. My father had to budget in time for being pulled over by cops whenever he left to go somewhere due largely to his fondness for expensive german engineering. Let us not get into the racism we as a people face in Law Offices and Medical Offices and Corporate America day in and day out. This cat needs to get out of the office, Turn on some Boots Riley and just look around at his people. Maybe sit and talk with them. We're not as stupid as he thinks, even though we came from the less intelligent and civilized west africans of which he speaks. Maybe he might want to check out a little something about Afrikan history. You know, since he's at one of the biggest UNIVERSITIES ON THE PLANET! I'm sure he can find a book or two on the subject that he can breeze through in a couple days. Maybe a Van Sertima here, a Yochanan there, garnished with som Diop and Mwalimu Baruti. I won't tell him about Marimba Ani. He may run and start protecting his beautiful white women...  For a more academic/less ad hominem review, wait for the book. There will also be a rap soundtrack made for it. I got Ward Connerly and Shelby Steele harmonizing on the hook.. 
 This book is boring as hel 
 This magazine recently (April 05) featured what they felt were the 100 greatest movie moments of all time.  Number 1 was the sing-along scene from MAGNOLIA.  Other moments in the top 10 included the credits from AUSTIN POWERS 3 and one of Eugene Levy's quotes from AMERICAN PIE.  Keep in mind, these are the 100 greatest movie moments of ALL TIME.  This mag/rag is nothing more than the film section of FHM stretched out to full-issue length.  Utter trash 
 my other management textbooks were able to cover nearly the same amount of information in 1/4 the space without being needlessly complex or as paralizingly boring. it would be an excellent cure for insomnia. professors PLEASE don't make anyone buy this thing. 
 I thought the book was appropriate for a young adult. I ended up giving it to my neighbors three year old son because it was more of a toddlers picture book. I felt the book was misrepresented online. 
 I had never read a Danielle Steel book before, and decided to give her a try, given that she is so popular and has so many books published. I was pretty disappointed. I agree with the other reviewers that the plot is unrealistic; however, if a book is unrealistic but well-written and engaging, I would still like it. I think the biggest problem with this book is the author's excessive repetitiveness. Yes, I get that this character is really cold and unloving---that was already covered 50 pages ago! In addition, character traits could have been better conveyed through situations, rather than simply stating, "so and so was a devoted mother" and repeating this fact again and again and again. These flaws in the author's writing kept me skipping through whole sections of the book. This book did not leave me wanting to read more of Ms. Steel's books. It is an ok book if you like romance and very easy, repetitive reading. 
 When I bought this book, I was looking for info on how to price a photo assignment for sale.  The title and short abstract of the book led me to believe this would be a great reference for my purposes.  However, when I  got the book, the first few paragraphs pointed out that its focus was on  assignment stock photography, not for pricing photo assignments in which  the finished prints are to be sold to individual clients.  If I were  submitting stock photos to publishers, it would be a great reference for  me.  It gets 2 stars only because it didn't suit my purposes at the time 
 Go to eBay. There is one seller whose ebay ID is valuecrate. They sell metal pans that are durable and tough 
 If you are like me you like a book that really gets you into it no matter where you are in the book. In other words if you are interested in the material at lesson nine that is where you start. Well this book doesn't even come close to doing that. I am an advanced computer user and pick up things easily. This book forces you to creep your way slowly through the lessons. Forget about looking up how to do a specific task. You may find this book usefull if you are an absolute beginner to the computer software interface. Otherwise I suggest you get something a little more advanced 
 I own one of these, it came packaged in my Dell XPS Renegade. Sound in a Windows environment is good, as indicated by other reviews. But in a gaming environment for example World of Warcraft, and not just this game, I and other user's have experienced the squeal of death, wherein the sound will become replaced with a high pitched squeal, and may hard lock your computer. Either way this can only be corrected by rebooting. Check out the forums before buying any creative labs products. BUYER BEWARE! 
 I can't speak to the content of this book, having only skimmed it in the library, but buyers should be forewarned that it is one of the most shoddily printed books you will ever see. It looks as if it were typeset with an inkjet printer and run off on a photocopier -- both badly in need of new ink cartridges. I understand that there isn't much money to be made in academic publishing, but this is disgraceful. In such a case, it would have been better to publish this exclusively as an e-book, and skip the paper altogether 
 I had to wait so long to get this book! The seller did not reply to any of my emails and did not notify me about the shipment 
 Carter Rila's assessment of this book is correct.  It is an older title, and while it is well written and contains useful information, it is misnamed.  It appears to be a survey of US Army uniforms and personal field equipment - the text contains little else.  Weapons, organization, history are all absent.  The bare bones descriptions of uniforms fail to address the subject adequately, and the use of direct quotes from Army regulations seems to be more of a waste of space than a selling point.  Good photographs from contemporary sources, though these can probably be found in Stanton.  Current photos of artifacts photographed in harsh lighting and not terribly useful; especially photo of divisional and army shoulder patches which is murky.  Colour plates would be only reason to buy this book.  Collingwood has a gritty, softer style than Chappell, Volstad or Hook, but illustrates well the major uniform types.  Facial expressions don't seem to change much - all the figures look so grim! - but there is a bit of variety in the poses and facial features.  Much useful info on uniforms - the main purpose of the book - but this info is found in greater detail in many other volumes.  The author and illustrator can be forgiven as I am sure that when this book first came out, much of what was contained had not been published in the mainstream 
 OK. If you're going to create a pictorial accompaniment to a controversial movie, AT LEAST PUT IN THE BEST PICTURES!!!  "The Passion of the Christ" intersperses stills from the movie with snippets from the passion section of the gospels. But whatever its value as a devotional or meditative aid, it is missing nearly all of the over-the-top images from the movie. There's no snake in Gethsemane; no clear image of Satan; no Jesus hanging off the bridge; no demon children hounding Judas; none of the nastiest scourging scenes; no long stairway to ascend with the cross; no shroud image on Veronica's cloth; no flipping Jesus on his face; no shoulder dislocation; no eye-piercing crow.   Virtually none of the images that stayed with me from the movie are included. I wonder why not? Were these scenes too gruesome when transferred to the printed page? Or were they rendered silly when they could be studied at leisure? I can't figure out Mel Gibson for adding these gruesome scenes to the film. I understand less why he left them out of the book. Weird 
 What a shame that gems such as Longfellow Serenade, Signs, Lady-Oh and Both Sides Now were left off this release in exchange for several low quality live recordings that DO appear.   Given Mr. Diamond's long and illustrious career, this release disappoints. Again, what a shame. So much potential and so little fulfillment 
 What does it mean when a writer of this caliber admits--in interviews and in public, to friends--that he is publishing a book that isn't his best effort?  Lethem is a somewhat talented writer, but he betrays his audience by publishing a half-baked book that serves only as a stop -gap, and then offers it to the film world as a gift.  A gift--Lewis Hyde would agree--is meant to be given in good faith.  You wouldn't hand someone a half-baked cake as a gift. But he gets to have his cake and eat it too by assuming the position that this novel is worth handing over as a gift.  It was light, not finished, and too easy for a writer of his skill.  As Kundera states in his new book: "Artist fame is the most monstrous of all, for it implies the idea of immortality.  And that is a diabolical snare, because the grotesquely megalomanic ambition to survive one's death is inseparably bound to the artist's probity.  Every novel created with real passion aspires quite naturally to a lasting aesthetic value, meaning to a value capable of surving its author. To write without having that ambition is cynicism: a mediocre plumber may be useful to people, but a mediocre novelist who consciously produces books that are ephemeral, commonplace, conventional--thus not useful, thus burdensome, thus noxious--is contemptible."  I don't think Lethem is exactly contemptible. But he is selling out to the idea of fame itself.  
 I am disappointed because this is a really flimsy toy. The launch button doesn't push most of the time (so Superman doesn't launch) and the foam Superman tears easily. 
 Although Hoffman's book gives an adequate overview of the "epidemic" and reinforces to the reader the seriousness of the problem, his solutions are lacking.  He never really gets to the root of the problem but shows many variables.  Marcia Zimmerman's The ADD Nutrition  Solution is a much better resource for the parent or teacher of a child  with ADD 
 The back cover of my copy of Stranger In A Strange Land has a quote on it from the Washington Post.  It says that it's "the best of (Robert Heinlein's) many books".  Well, if this is the best Mr. Heinlein can do, then I won't bother reading any more of his books.  Stranger In A Strange Land is one of the most disappointing "classics" I've ever read.  If you think you'd like a book where the Muslim character is nicknamed Stinky, the women are called "wenches", and one of the female characters says the following, "Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her fault", then this is the book for you.  I could probably overlook these missteps if only the rest of the book wasn't such hippy-dippy pseudo-intellectual garbage.  Stranger In A Strange Land may have been a classic in the Sixties.  Now it's little more than an embarrassment.       
 If you believe Britain made what Africa is today than this is the book for you. Pakenham portrays the scramble for Africa as a two-player game between Britain and France, with little attention being paid to the portuguese, german, italian or spanish presence and interests in the continent. As a result, Pakenham's book is really a book about the British scramble for Africa, neglecting some of the most curious cultural and political aspects of the heterogeneous european presence in Africa. Focused in Britain, Pakenham also misses the opportunity to explore the reaction of african cultures to colonial advances and the position of independent african states. It is therefore a rather poor book and one in which prejudice against other european colonial powers is too often evident 
 Oh my word.  I have only ever not been able to finish a book twice in my life -- and this was number 2.  The first few chapters were ok, but when things really started cooking plot-wise, the writing style became, well, high-schoolish.  I wanted to like it, so I plowed ahead.  But, half-way through it, I gave up.  The writing style is amateurish, and clunky.  Characters act in a melodramatically, with no realism.  There are patches of good writing, but these patches are quickly followed by a clunker or two.     I would hope that the sequel to this book improved, but since I can't finish the first, I won't be trying the second 
 Run Before the Wind was the second book in the Lee series.  At this time, Will Lee IV is in law school and not doing well scholarly.  He decides to take a year off and travel England and Ireland.  In the course of his travels, he meets up with a couple who sail and are in the process of building a boat for a reclusive businessman.  He joins them on their adventure which includes problems with terrorist.  I was disappointed in this book.  It's not the suspenseful, can't put down this book that most of Woods work is, and the book is more of a disappointment after reading Chiefs, the first book in the Lee series 
 While I don't know the whole story, Wolff seems to have a lot of experience, and little business smarts. Heck, from the few descriptions of his wife, SHE seems to have more business smarts. This is certainly an interesting, well-written book (he's a writer after all,) but the fact that he drove himself to near insanity as well as bankruptcy all in the name of pure greed leaves me feeling this book has no real point other than "How I wanted to get rich, or die tryin!" He described endless begging for money, which seems to be the central point of the book. You will find an interesting set of stories here, but the message is a rather shallow one if there is one at all. But then I guess that was the point of most of the internet bubble as a whole 
 I immediately fell in love with the fragrance, and my husband bought me the really big bottle.  I wanted to savor it, and make it last.  Much to my dismay it turned an ugly pee yellow and now smells like pure rubbing alcohol.  It also formed a nasty, crusty substance all over the pump and bottle.  I am soooo disappointed!!! 
 I am 15 years old and was required to read this book as summer reading for my school. Let me just say that this is the most punishingly boring book I have ever opened. I say opened because I just could not finish it. I was doing fine until I reached his section about the future of computers. I had to skip the entire section...about 50 pages or so. It, along with almost every other section of the book is impossible to understand, at least for a 15 year old. After that, the book just kept going downhill, and I gave up. This book is not interesting in the least. Avoid at all costs 
 Really, the only keeper on this Volume is the first episode, "And When the Sky Was Opened" in which three astronauts crashland on Earth and are recuperating in the hospital. Things start to get weird when each in turn begins to disappear, as though Final Destination-like, they were not supposed to have survived the crash, and some force is trying to set things to rights after the fact. Rod Taylor plays the lead and along with his two co-stars give some brillant performances that convey terror without the ham. "In His Image" is an hour-long episode and runs an hour too long! Alan Talbot goes back to his small town birthplace with his fiance to introduce her to his family and finds it changed...like 20 years have gone by. And he also has these uncontrollable urges to kill. This episode felt like a rehash of earlier Zone and spirals down to a truly goofy ending that will leave you gasping "Whatever!". "The Last Night of the Jockey" showcases an aging Mickey Rooney as an aging jockey named Grady who's played with the rules and Pete Rose-like betted on races one time too many. He's been banned from racing and has no idea what to do with his life except drink it away. That is, until a face in the mirror who claims he's his "alter-ego" and can grant him any wish he desires starts talking to him! I thought Rooney's performance was great in this one-man show with one set, but the story just wasn't compelling enough to keep me from getting bored. 
 There's nothing really bad about this slim book, but the writing is bland and cliches abound.  I found the book neither enlightening nor funny.  I'm a big golf fan and like Peter Jacobsen as a player.  I always like to see him win or do well.  I think that the problem with the book is that Peter is simply too nice a guy, at least in print (and that does not mean to imply he is not otherwise a nice guy), to be very interesting 
 Not only is the Text out of date Berkhofer never goes anywhere with his ideas.  He just ends up repeating himself over and over until they have lost all meaning.  It is amazing to me that a book that has no point could ever get published 
 The first several books were great, but about half way through, it just turned into porn. I have never minded a little sex in books, but this one is nothing but sex. There's supposed to be a big important vampire meeting/party after the ballet, but Hamilton doesn't even bother to write it, having Anita passed out from too much sex and magic. I lost count of the new people introduced in this book so that Anita could have sex with them. and not just sex, but multiple partner, kinky sex with an audience. This book finally crossed the line where I can't stand it anymore and will be selling the entire series as soon as I go back to selling books.  Anita has collected a harem of who know how many men that only have sex with her, and do whatever she tells them to.   She has created a triumvirate of her, Nathaniel and Damien, but she doesn't take care of them and Damien is forever on the edge of dying because Anita doesn't have enough sex to keep him alive, even though she needs a waiting room and a take-a-number machine for the people she is having sex with.  The preview of the next book features Edward, who's been missing for a long time with a personality transplant. As I read the preview, I just could not see this new Edward. I'm not about to read a new book and see Edward as a different person. Stick a fork in her she's done.   This book should not be sold to minors. The review should come with a warning. I gave it one star, because they won't let you not give it any 
 If a book thoroughly angers and frustrates you, does that mean it's a good book or a bad book?  In the case of MERCY, I'll have to go with the latter.  I found I could not get past my intense dislike of both Cam and Mia, truly two of the most despicable, selfish characters I've ever read in any book.  I've read murder mysteries with killers who had more admirable qualities.  Their sole intent were their own wants and needs, regardless of who (Cam's wife Allie) got hurt.  Allie was described early on in the book as someone who people walk all over.  I never got that impression.  She was the owner of her own business, and she was determined to help Cam's cousin Jamie.  She also happened to be a woman deeply in love with her husband.  It was her love and loyalty that Cam felt totally comfortable in betraying.  At one point late in the book, Allie asks Cam if he and Mia had laughed at her.  He tells her no.  However in a way, they did, considering they had no problem having sex in her flower shop and her bed.  I felt for Allie.  She deserved far better then Cam  I really wanted this book to be more about mercy killing and euthanasia.  Instead it was more about infidelity and how far a person is willing to go for someone they love.  Infidelity seems to be a pretty constant story line in most of Picoult's books (I understand her latest book, THE TENTH CIRCLE is no different.)  She is without a doubt an excellent writer, but this one just wasn't for me 
 No thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story.  The whole thing is based on who wants to kill Darby and why. And that is where it falls apart. The FBI or CIA could have easily investigated faster and easier then she could, and what is the point of trying to kill her?  To bury what is already out in the open? The FBI, CIA and White House all had a copy. What are they trying to silence? Nothing at all. Perhaps if it were just for revenge the plot might not have collapsed on itself 
 I never cared much for the soundtrack aside from a few tracks. this Film was wack the Acting,Directing. but the Story Line was cool. in fact if someone knew how to put this together with a stronger Cast this Film would have been interesting.this Film flip flopped Time Periods&it hurt it's cause.I will give Prince Props though for being a Black Film Director back at a time when it was really rare&truth be told in 2004 it ain't that much better on a whole 
 There is much ado about nothing in a good part of this book. Thomson has a habit of vast illuminations of celebrities that nobody has ever heard of, while ignoring many acknowledged and well regarded stars, especially the American ones. I bought his first book, which though well written, annoyed me in its cynical certainties, voiced by an author who apparently thinks he is an absolute genius and among the most sagacious critics. I bought his second edition of the same book, hoping that he would include celebs whom he ignored in the first edition. He included a few more in the second edition, and expanded on earlier assessments, most notably of the actor Robert Ryan, on whom he lavished well deserved praise. However, Thomson continued to ignore stars, Barry Sullivan, Vic Morrow, allotted about one hundred words to Dan Duryea. I saw a lot of damning with faint praise. He criticized Frederic March, Robert Wise, John Frankenheimer, and so on. I would not consider buying the third edition because Thomson is just so full of himself that it nauseates me 
 This volume represents the end of season one and the beginning of season two.  If you are deciding which volumes to keep in order to not have to bear the cost of all the volumes, this is one that you can safely leave out.  The first episode: "Operation Annihilate" makes for a passably good action adventure although as a plot and storyline it leaves much to be desired.  The second episode which begins season two is the weaker of the two weak episodes.  This represents the great horror-writer Robert Bloch's weakest effort as a scriptwriter for the series to date and clearly ranks among the bottom 3 ever episodes of any of the three seasons.  Still, we get to see the debut of Pavel Chekhov whose character develops very well over the entire season two.  Fret not as the episodes in season two represent the best overall episodes of classic Trek.  You won't miss this volume though unless you are a completist or one who absolutely needs to collect every episode 
 While the author is certainly knowledgable, the tone of the book is decidedly pedantic and offensive. He lumps all free trade skeptics together, from GreenPeace to Pat Buchanan, from Joe Stiglitz to Chairman Mao. And even throws Al-Qaeda in for good measure. People opposed to market worship "fall rather into the category of spoiled children" who are blissfully ignorant of reality. This is the starting point of the book, and this attitude continues throughout.  If you want to reinforce your market-oriented convictions, and have a tremendously belittling view of people who don't agree with you, you will love this book. If you want a measured, unbiased and well-reasoned discussion, keep looking 
 This is a poorly desgined humidifier that has four seperate pieces, on wheels, that are held together by gravity only.  They warn you not to attempt to move it unless you remove both water tanks(so why have 4 wheels?).  I believe them because nothing is fastened and it would fall apart if bumped. They call it an 11 gallon unit, but, that means it may be able to put that much in the air in 24 hours.  They fail to tell you that you will have to refill the 2 water tanks, about five times each, to do this.  It can only be used on level floors that are water resistant, so that eliminates 95% of my house as wall to wall carpet and hardwood floors are normal in many homes.  Before you can use the unit you have to soak the filter and they suggest you do this each time you fill the water tanks.   
 Whoa...my sisters have this set at their house, which I used extensively last night to cut with. In a word? Terrible.   They have not used them much, and all they had for me was a glass cutting board (I know, terrible). Due to the glass cutting board, I knew these edges, had they been used, would not be terribly sharp.  I made a point of sharpening them on the included steel using the procedure outlined in the manual.  Anyhow, I found myself both struggling and TEARING vegetables when cutting them. To slice red pepper, I was having to pull the remaining portion of the pepper up to tear it off of the piece I *thought* I'd just cut.   Perhaps this is a terribly unfair comparison, as I am used to my Henckels Pro "S" set. But for crying out loud, I didn't think it would be THIS bad.  While I cannot speak for the rest of the Henckels "International" (meaning "Made in Spain, not Germany") line, this set was very much unacceptable. You would literally get a better value buying a Henckels 4-Star Chef's Knife instead of this WHOLE SET. At least you'd get some real use out of it.  The steak knives feel cheap. This is definitely a $60-feeling set, no great "value," in my opinion. I would never, ever, ever buy a Henckels International product after this interlude and will happily return home tonight to my Henkels Pro "S" set...where cutting through ANYTHING is like gliding through soft butter 
 I read Armies of the Night for a graduate school class.  I found this novel/history very difficult to read.  I would sometimes find myself reading a page over three times before I could get anything out of it.  It was inaccessible, frustrating, and in short order I felt great hostility bordering on hatred for the author.  For example, early in the book Mailer announces to a room full of people that he had just urinated all over the restroom floor when he could find neither the light switch nor the urinal.  He is inebriated at the time.  Perhaps he intended this to be a humorous revelation, I thought it was obnoxious.  Another example of Mailer's ego, is when he states early in the book that he is "probably willing to die" for the anti-war cause.  This is revealed as macho swagger because at the moment of truth, Mailer is unwilling to even do a paltry five days in jail for the cause.  He complains about the conditions in jail; he can't shave and his clothes get dirty.  I thought the authorities were generous to provide everyone a bed to sleep in, as well as meals, coffee, and reading material but this was apparently insufficient for Mr. Mailer as he finds fault with all of it.    The book gets better when we leave Mailer's personal experience and are finally permitted to learn something about the brave young men and women who made up the heart of the protest.  Some of the protesters spent the night in the cold outside the Pentagon, some were beaten by the guards, and others had water poured on them while they were sleeping.  Unfortunately this part of the book is much briefer than Mailer's narrative.  For me, this book is ruined by Mailer's self-important posturing.  If the author's goal was to make readers hate him, I think he succeeded.  I have utterly no idea why this book won a Pulitzer Prize.  Perhaps it is an example of the adage "you had to be there."  I have read Mailer's other Pulitzer Prize winner, The Executioner's Song, and I liked it.   This book however, was awful.   
 Ms. Hudson can't resist the temptation to throw in dozens of obscure massage practices from her extensive travels. The result is needlessly complex and snobby. If you are willing to make the effort you will learn something here and there, although some of the techniques are quite difficult. I'm not convinced that even Hudson knows how to do them. To sum up, this would mainly interest a massage fanatic. It's hardly an "ultimate" book on the subject. In the end, I returned my copy 
 I'm a huge fan of Kathy Reichs and her Temperance Brennan character, so I was initially excited to see this book.  I couldn't even finish the first chapter!  The dialogue felt forced and the style was totally different (I didn't notice until after I received the book that it wasn't written by Kathy Reichs).  The constant use of the nickname "Bones" was grating and the whole story seemed implausible considering that in all of her novels, this detective's never been mentioned and Tempe's had chemistry with a totally different detective.  After starting to read this book, I realized there was no way I could watch the TV show either (where she's always referred to as Bones).  Ick.  Misfire all around 
 I think Arnold's philosophy was: "Use as little periods as possible. Who needs 'em when you have a host of commas, semicolons, colons, dashes--indeed, an assortment of methods to elongate your sentences." I pride myself on my reading ability, but this book was just too much. I have only encountered two books that I could say this about, and the other one (Book of the Wars of the Lord: Volume 1--Immortality of the Soul) is within my grasp--indeed, if I had a lot of time, I could definately tackle it. This book, on the other hand, uses so much complicated languages and elongated sentences that I got completely lost. My criticism isn't directed at Arnold (after all, such a writing style was almost expected in the Victorian era), but just at the fact that this is not a good book. While I may be wallowing in my ignorance (I notice that about every other reader gave this 4-5 stars), I don't see how one can stay awake for so long 
 Having never read a book by Danielle Steel but seen and liked a few of the movies adapted from her novels, I was looking forward to reading Answered Prayers, since I usually always find the books more deep and interesting. Sadly, I couldn't have been more disappointed... The first thing that bothered me about this novel, was the amount of repetition it has. I was just through the first few pages of the first chapter, and I was already being told things (usually insignificant) which I had just read a few lines before.  Secondly, the moment Brad is introduced into the plot, I could foresee with certainty, how it was going to unravel and how the book would eventually end. So as not to dampen my enthusiasm and continue reading, I reasoned that if the plot was going to be so predictable, the book couldn't possibly be Danielle Steel's "Number One Bestseller" as the cover proclaims...seems like I have a grave misconception regarding the criteria needed to make a book a "bestseller".  The major flaw of this novel is that it desperately lacks imagination. Even the main characters themselves and their situations are mirror images of each other. Faith is sweet and caring, has two daughters who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving her feeling lonely and sad. Her husband is cold, unreligious and gives her no attention.  Brad is sweet and caring, has two sons who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving him feeling lonely and sad. His wife is cold, unreligious and gives him no attention. Even Faith's "deep dark secret" is too unoriginal, and it is revealed to the reader at the very early stages of the book, leaving no room for curiosity and suspense.  Halfway through the book, I was so bored that I considered giving up reading it altogether. However I kept pushing on, praying that some twist to the plot would miraculously materialize somewhere, to at least make reading Answered Prayers worthwhile... Unlike Faith however, my prayers remained unanswered... It's going to require a lot of will power to attempt reading a Danielle Steel novel again...  
 I bought it because I had heard it was a good flick! Well after watching it I gave it to my brother. Save your money 
 We were disappointed in this DVD and thought it was a waste of money. We did not learn anything new.   They went through things quickly, everything was so basic, things that are mainly common sense.  I felt this was a big huge waste of money, and is now in the trash 
 I found essentially nothing new in this book that I had not already found in Delphi's DG.  I can't think of anything that I took away from it.  If this was advanced I better run and take my Mensa test 
 I was totaly disapointed with the ending in this series of books. I felt let down, and like I had waisted my time and money on the entire series 
 Toby, what were you thinking? Did you really set out to offend over half of your listening audience with this obnoxious song?   This song sucks and the only reason I gave it one star was because I was forced to by Amazon.com.  We already have seven million women and one million men with anorexia in this country and a total of 10 million people suffer from some form of eating disorders. I wonder how many more will join these ranks because of this song.  Incidentally, I USED to be a fan of yours 
 This book is getting mixed reviews. It seems like friends of the author say its great. Those who tried to actually use the book are disappointed that everything is so out of date. This edition was not updated since the first edition and is now really out of date. Things change, but sloppy research is always out of style 
 This is the first time I read J.L. Borges. The stories, somehow disturb me. Some are confusing, but all of them attract the reader because the are so well written and are full of memorable sentences. If you want to have a reference in latinamerican narrative you have to read Borges 
 This was a piece of JUNK.  Neither my husband nor I could ever get it set correctly -- we wound up throwing it away, going to Target and buying one of their 10,000-Steps pedometer.  THAT works great 
 I thought this book was totally mean-spirited and filled with sadism that would certainly scare any child.  In fact, I believe that there is little, if anything, positive to say about this book.  Children look up to the adults in their lives, especially to their teachers, and this book portrays the teacher as cruel and nasty. This book was deeply disturbing for both myself and more importantly, for my son 
  Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist [...] fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 the beginning of this book was excellent, but dont be fooled, the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book.  the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers. what's the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were.  this was one of the worst books i have ever read, i'd call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery. dont waste your time reading it 
 Not only are the other comments on the printing quality correct, but the EXACT SAME BOOK EXISTS in a 2006 EDITION!!  The "Science of Sex" is the original(?) 1996 edition.  The 2006 edition of the VERY SAME BOOK is titled, "Sperm Wars: Infidelity, Sexual Conflict, and Other Bedroom Battles".  Explain to me why the author would reprint his original book under a new title?  Anyway, I'm returning this one, since I bought both books at the same time, thinking they had entirely different content. Furthermore the new edition is of much better printed quality, with none of the problems mentioned about this edition.  One more thing of note...the new edition is HALF THE PRICE of this crappy version!!!  Can't wait to actually read it 
 Every track but one has a simple, thumping percussion line, an artifact of modern music which I increasingly find tedious. No doubt it is easier to appeal to the brain stem rather than the prefrontal lobes. Unobjectionable as background music, but not actually worth listening to. Perhaps best described as music which one may hopefully, in time, grow out of 
 it is juust a copy of the frist book. if you read the frist the world is flat, then don't waste your time. jo 
 Utter nonsense. Don't waste your money or your eyesight 
 If you can understand this book you are obviously incapable of living in  the real world. Sassen's dense, turgid writing style simply aims to  bewilder the reader into unquestioningly accepting her doomsday view of  socitey. Most depressing reading 
 I was very disappointed in this selection.  Maybe a MALE football fanatic would find something appealing, but I was VERY bored!  Take me back to court, to the lawyer's office, to the judge's chambers,...just about anywhere but these bleachers!! 
 That any reviewer can grant this book five stars, as some here have, boggles the mind.  I have to seriously ask them what books they read that they consider this one worthy of such a high rating.  Yes, the subject of the James boys is inherently fascinating and, yes, Ted Yeatman's research was extensive, which is worth one extra star, but as a writer he failed to present his material in an interesting fashion.  First, he is too much in love with facts and uses them whether they are necessary or not.  (I do not need to know, as just one example, the name of every insignificant Missouri militia outfit that ever marched in the same county as the James boys unless that name is relevant to them.  Footnotes would have been a better location if Yeatman felt compelled to include this arcane data.)  Another reason the narrative bogs down is that Yeatman failed to heed his word processor's grammar checker when it pointed out the thousands of passive sentences he wrote.  Or perhaps he had that feature turned off.  If so, he should flick it back on immediately.  Lastly, a good writer spins out a narrative that flows like water.  Yeatman's jumbled writing contains too many icebergs the reader must dodge or sink in the process.  I am not yet finished reading it and am not certain that I can continue to the end much as I want to learn about the James boys.  What a shame.  Bad writing made this book a great waste of the author's extensive knowledge.  I fail to understand why Cumberland House published this book without extensive editing or not publish it at all.  Obviously, they thought the subject material would carry it 
 I thought this book was a waste of money. It was too simple, suggestions were not worth paying for. I sold it on ebay. It wasn't worth returning it to Amazon, and losing money because of the shipping 
 It is well known that the Chomskyans don't listen to criticism, however well taken.  The result is the 1995 Chomsky essays, in which relatively well known and primitive problems of English syntax are clothed in practically unreadable technical language, to lead to highly artificial pretentious solutions which are as counterintuitive as you please. Not as if simpler solutions weren't possible.  In the meanwhile, the entire ivory tower of MIT linguistics has become an impregnable fortress of sectarians who will only deal with the problem of the most perfect formal presentations of well known linguistic problems in their own narrow theoretical framework, regardless of new research in the facts of language, as discovered daily by the language statisticians and the sociolinguists for example.   One cannot enter the fortress because they have made it inaccessible. But it is not uncomfortable to have the fortress in one's back, because nobody will come out, either, to meet criticism or to face new empirical evidence about language 
 I was not very impressed with this CD, and it is the first one that I ever purchased by Donald Lawrence.  There is too much speaking while the singing is occuring 
 The unabridged edition has 25 CDs. To abridge down to four is ridiculous. The story jumps around so much that it is very hard to follow and keep the characters straight. I was left wondering what the story was about, having just heard the highlights, like reading Cliff notes instead of the book. I subsequently ordered the unabridged edition 
 Dembski's very first sentence says his goal is to write so that he cannot be misunderstood.  He fails badly, even on key issues.  Consider:  Dembski insists ID is legitimate science and emphatically denies that ID is religiously motivated.  Well, let's look at the evidence.    Curiously enough, most of the essays and virtually all of the authors have a much stronger connection to religion than to science.    On the religion side of the ledger, co-editor Kushiner is the editor of a religious magazine.  Dembski himself teaches at a seminary and says that if there's a designer behind biology, the designer is probably God. Nancy Pearcey's degree from a theological seminary is not in science, and her essay, like several others, included heavy doses of Christian moralizing.  Jay Wesley Richards' degree is in theology, and he says ID is a valuable resource for Christian apologetics.  John West, Jr., writes and edits religious publications.  Patrick Henry Reardon is a pastor and edits a Christian magazine.  John Mark Reynolds teaches philosophy at a Bible Institute and supports his arguments with quotes from the Bible.  Part of his essay is titled "Intelligent Design Lets God In."  Behe supplements his arguments about irreducible complexity with quotes from the Pope.  Stephen Meyer teaches philosophy at a fundamentalist college.  Jonathan Wells' own website openly proclaims his religious motivation.  Paul Nelson is a philosopher, not a scientist (though his essay on the "tautology problem," though not really relevant to the scientific validity of evolutionary biology, was actually pretty interesting).  John Wiester teaches at a Bible Institute and is a prominent member of an evangelical organization.  Walter Bradley's essay contained this quote:  "We know that nature is described by the best of all possible mathematics because God created it."    The science side, in contrast, is very thin.  Phillip Johnson's last formal science class was in high school, over 40 years ago.  Only a mid-life, religious crisis prompted his interest in ID.  Michael Behe's contribution on irreducible complexity (IC) seems scientific enough.  Too bad both he and Dembski admitted the year after the essay was published that Behe's formulation was seriously flawed.  (Which makes the several other contributors' statements about the "massive evidence" for IC look that much dumber.)  (For more info on Behe's Blunder, see my review of "Darwin's Black Box.")  Wells' chapter mentions scientific issues, but his arguments for ID are based exclusively on analogies and negative arguments, neither of which constitutes affirmative evidence for ID.  DeHaan is a psychologist and Wiester has only a bachelor's degree, and that's in geology.  Putting their essay on the Cambrian Explosion on the "science" side of the ledger is a pure gift, since much of what they said was just unbelievable gibberish.  (Species should precede phyla???  There should be intermediates between living species???  New phyla should constantly be emerging???  These people are ID-iots!)  Plus, all their arguments were negative arguments against evolution, and, obviously, such arguments do nothing to support ID.  Putting Bradley's essay on the "science" side of the ledger is also a gift, since it amounted to nothing more than pure speculation about cosmology, an area in which Bradley, a materials scientist and engineer, listed no qualifications.  Listing Dembski's essay as science is also a gift, since it dealt with information theory, an area in which Dembski lists no qualifications.  Also, most of his arguments were mere analogies, and analogies are not evidence.  Also, he relied very heavily on Behe's IC.  In fact, since Dembski also proclaimed that "ID readily embraces the sacramental nature of physical reality.  Indeed, ID is just the Logos theology of John's Gospel restated in the idiom of information theory" (191) I think Dembski's essay should be re-assigned to the religion side.  Bruce Gordon, a philosopher of physics, displays his cluelessness about biology by gushing over IC.  Gordon's cluelessness is also reflected in his assertion that the McLean court's definition of "science" was a "put-up job" by evos.  If Gordon had bothered to read the trial transcript, he would have found that the creationists completely agreed with that definition.  In fact, as the May 2005 curriculum hearings in Kansas showed, most ID-iots still use the McLean definition!  How can that possibly be evos' fault???  Weighing the relative amounts of religion and science, religion obviously predominates by a very wide margin.  No wonder so many of the favorable reviews focused on religious issues.  So again, if Dembski's goal was to demonstrate ID's scientific nature, he failed miserably.    Also interesting was Dembski's claim that he was "startled" about how evos misunderstand ID as implying skill in design, or even perfection.  According to Dembski, "intelligence" actually means "nothing more than being the result of an intelligent agent, even one who acts stupidly."  Hmmm.  God isn't dead after all, just stupid.  That's reassuring.    In any case, there's no justification for blaming evos for misunderstanding ID's position on perfection, since the misinformation comes from ID's own textbooks.  The most widely used textbook is "Of Pandas and People" (see my review of "Pandas"), currently the focus of litigation in Dover, PA.  Pandas' authors take great pains to document the exquisite skill, i.e., perfection, of their examples of biological design.    Since the people who contributed to Pandas did such a horribly botched job -- Intelligence implies skill?  Ridiculous!  --  maybe Dembski would prefer that we simply ignore those poor, misguided fools.  Sound reasonable?  Well, the contributors to Pandas include such misguided fools as Nancy Pearcey, Michael Behe, John Weister, Stephen Meyer, and Walter Bradley!    Dembski also rails about how dogmatic evos are, and he stresses how necessary it is for scientists to remain tentative about their theories.  But Meyer teaches at a school that requires its faculty to swear an oath to maintain Christian beliefs.  Is that an example of being tentative?  And Dembski himself recently demonstrated his own open-mindedness by proclaiming that he would never abandon his faith in ID, regardless of the evidence.    And that's why we call them ID-iots.  
 While I enjoyed reading the first half of this book, the second was pure agony. I actually started to skim through most of the pages until I reached the end.  It is dense with detail; almost too dense. For instance, Finney spends way too much time describing an office building ablaze in fire. His descriptions are interesting for about 3 pages, but by page 10 of the fire, I was completely and totally bored. Now, I'm not saying fiction should always be a "quick, easy read". Quite the contrary. I found Finney's writing to be refreshing. But c'mon folks, this book should have been 100-150 pages shorter. (Strictly for over-the-top romance lovers). 
 I have had this coffee maker for about a month now and I HATE it.  I will first say, the coffe brews fast, tastes good, stays hot for a long time.  The one thing I just can't understand is why they made the carafe the way they did.  It is impossible to pour any liquid from it without it spilling everywhere.  Whether it be filling the tank with plain water or pouring a cup of coffee.  The pot is big then tapers down to a tiny spout and I just don't know what happens but it goes everywhere.  I have to pour my coffee over the sink now.  And I usually make only 10 cups of coffee, but since tons of water spill out when I'm filling the tank, I have to fill the pot to the brim to make up for all the water I'm loosing.    I just HATE this thing and really regret buying it.  Mr. Coffee should have just kept the old design.  This is just horrible.  I may even box it up and see if I can return it.  As far as I'm concerned it's defective 
 This is a less than one star book.  It is a waste of time and effort.  A huge disappointment.  I is just Awful 
 I know a lot of people liked this book, but it didn't work for me. The main character and his buddies run around like chickens with their heads cut off, acting as if they have committed a huge crime. The problem is, they didn't. There is no crime. I talked to several cops and a prominent defense attorney about this plot, and it makes no sense. It would make sense if someone comes after the McGuffin, early on, but no one does, not until very late in the book. So most of the story has no foundation. 
 I have read three books thus far by creationist authors dedicated to toppling evolutionary science.  This is one of them.  My opinion of these books is, to be mild, not that good.  The fact that these books have become so popular and apparently so convincing to many is indicative of one thing and one thing only: ignorance.  Do you really want to know what the problem is with evolution? It certainly isn't that it's false science.  Like it or not, evolutions biggest (and probably only) enemy is ignorance. The theory of evolution is being beset on all sides by a very clever, well organized and spectacularly dishonest group of men that intentionally target a desperate and gullible audience too fearfull to check them on their claims and too ignorant of science anyway to realize how and where they are being bamboozled. The science behind evolution is not easy to grasp, particularly for the fragile psyche of the Christian fundamentalist who would wilfully ignore the nose on his face, let alone a two million year old fossil, if it meant keeping his belief system intact. That is the only conclusion I can draw from reading these books. Its arguments are clever, but anyone with a reasonable grasp of how science is done and a little knowledge of biology should be able to dismiss it with ease. This piece of garbage will never convince anyone who actually knows what evolution is that ID is a superior hypothesis for the origination of all life on earth. To be as blunt as possible, only a fool or someone hopped up on Jesus juice will find this book convincing, but then merely being a religious nut in the first place is a good indicator of low intelligence to begin with. Sure, that's not a nice thing to say, but practically every study that's ever been done on the issue of religiosity and intelligence supports that claim.   There can be no denying that certain types of people simply don't accept the claims of creationism and ID or become bible thumpers. These include people the likes of Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking and a plethora of other gifted and dedicated scientists world wide with not only (real) facts at their disposal, but a respect for and a superior grasp of logic and, more apropriately, the ability to use it without bias or a priori restrictions. The types of people that uncritically and blindly accept the creation myth of Genesis despite its obvious conflict with reality are typically found in... well the bible belt states of the good ol' US of A. They may also be found dancing with snakes, relating their latest alien abduction stories to friends, riding around with shotguns in pick ups while hatching new conspiracy theories about the dishonest motives behind science's desire to hide the evidence for bigfoot.   Seriously though folks, is it more logical to be a Christian? Is religion the natural choice of a smart person familiar with more of the evidence? Not according to a broad consensus of studies on IQ and religiosity. These studies have consistently found that the lower the IQ score, the more likely a person is to be religious. To place these studies in perspective, it is helpful to know the general religious attitudes of Americans today. According to a February 1995 Gallup poll, 96 percent of all Americans believe in God, and 88 percent affirm the importance of religion. However, the degree of religiosity within this group varies considerably. Only 35 percent can be classified as "religious," using a definition that requires them to consider religion important and attend religious services at least once a week. And a March 1994 Gallup poll found that only 20 percent of all Americans belong to that politically active group known as "Christian conservatives."   The following is a review of several studies of IQ and religiosity, paraphrased and summarized from Burnham Beckwith's article, "The Effect of Intelligence on Religious Faith," Free Inquiry, Spring 1986: (1)   STUDIES OF STUDENTS   1. Thomas Howells, 1927  Study of 461 students showed religiously conservative students "are, in general, relatively inferior in intellectual ability."   2. Hilding Carlsojn, 1933  Study of 215 students showed that "there is a tendency for the more intelligent undergraduate to be sympathetic toward... atheism."   3. Abraham Franzblau, 1934  Confirming Howells and Carlson, tested 354 Jewish children, aged 10-16. Found a negative correlation between religiosity and IQ as measured by the Terman intelligence test.   4. Thomas Symington, 1935  Tested 400 young people in colleges and church groups. He reported, "There is a constant positive relation in all the groups between liberal religious thinking and mental ability... There is also a constant positive relation between liberal scores and intelligence..."   5. Vernon Jones, 1938  Tested 381 students, concluding "a slight tendency for intelligence and liberal attitudes to go together."   6. A. R. Gilliland, 1940  At variance with all other studies, found "little or no relationship between intelligence and attitude toward god."   7. Donald Gragg, 1942  Reported an inverse correlation between 100 ACT freshman test scores and Thurstone "reality of god" scores.   8. Brown and Love, 1951  At the University of Denver, tested 613 male and female students. The mean test scores of non-believers was 119 points, and for believers it was 100. The non-believers ranked in the 80th percentile, and believers in the 50th. Their findings "strongly corroborate those of Howells."   9. Michael Argyle, 1958  Concluded that "although intelligent children grasp religious concepts earlier, they are also the first to doubt the truth of religion, and intelligent students are much less likely to accept orthodox beliefs."   10. Jeffrey Hadden, 1963  Found no correlation between intelligence and grades. This was an anomalous finding, since GPA corresponds closely with intelligence. Other factors may have influenced the results at the University of Wisconsin.   11. Young, Dustin and Holtzman, 1966  Average religiosity decreased as GPA rose.   12. James Trent, 1967  Polled 1400 college seniors. Found little difference, but high-ability students in his sample group were over-represented.   13. C. Plant and E. Minium, 1967  The more intelligent students were less religious, both before entering college and after 2 years of college.   14. Robert Wuthnow, 1978  Of 532 students, 37 percent of Christians, 58 percent of apostates, and 53 percent of non-religious scored above average on SATs.   15. Hastings and Hoge, 1967, 1974  Polled 200 college students and found no significant correlations between religiosity and intelligence.   16. Norman Poythress, 1975  Mean SATs for strongly anti-  religious (1148), moderately anti-religious (1119), slightly anti-religious (1108), and religious (1022).   17. Wiebe and Fleck, 1980  Studied 158 male and female Canadian university students. They reported "nonreligious S's tended to be strongly intelligent" and "more intelligent than religious S's."   STUDENT BODY COMPARISONS   1. Rose Goldsen, 1952  Percentage of students who believe in a divine god: Harvard 30; UCLA 32; Dartmouth 35; Yale 36; Cornell 42; Wayne 43; Weslyan 43; Michigan 45; Fisk 60; Texas 62; North Carolina 68.   2. National Review Study, 1970  Percentage of students who believe in a Spirit or Divine God: Reed 15; Brandeis 25; Sarah Lawrence 28; Williams 36; Stanford 41; Boston U. 41; Yale 42; Howard 47; Indiana 57; Davidson 59; S. Carolina 65; Marquette 77.   3. Caplovitz and Sherrow, 1977  Apostasy rates rose continuously from 5 percent in "low" ranked schools to 17 percent in "high" ranked schools.   4. Niemi, Ross, and Alexander, 1978  In elite schools, organized religion was judged important by only 26 percent of their students, compared with 44 percent of all students.   STUDIES OF VERY-HIGH IQ GROUPS   1. Terman, 1959  Studied group with IQ's over 140. Of men, 10 percent held strong religious belief, of women 18 percent. Sixty-two percent of men and 57 percent of women claimed "little religious inclination" while 28 percent of the men and 23 percent of the women claimed it was "not at all important."   2. Warren and Heist, 1960  Found no differences among National Merit Scholars. Results may have been effected by the fact that NM scholars are not selected on the basis of intelligence or grades alone, but also on "leadership" and such like.   3. Southern and Plant, 1968  Studied 42 male and 30 female members of Mensa. Mensa members were much less religious in belief than the typical American college alumnus or adult.   STUDIES Of SCIENTISTS   1. William S. Ament, 1927  C. C. Little, president of the University of Michigan, checked persons listed in Who's Who in America: "Unitarians, Episcopalians, Congregationalists, Universalists, and Presbyterians [who are less religious] are... far more numerous in Who's Who than would be expected on the basis of the population which they form. Baptists, Methodists, and Catholics are distinctly less numerous."   Ament confirmed Little's conclusion. He noted that Unitarians, the least religious, were more than 40 times as numerous in Who's Who as in the U.S. population.   2. Lehman and Witty, 1931  Identified 1189 scientists found in both Who's Who (1927) and American Men of Science (1927). Only 25 percent of those listed in the latter and 50 percent of those in the former reported their religious denomination, despite the specific request to do so, under the heading of "religious denomination (if any)." Well over 90 percent of the general population claims religious affiliation. The figure of 25 percent suggests far less religiosity among scientists.   Unitarians were 81.4 times as numerous among eminent scientists as non-Unitarians.   3. Kelley and Fisk, 1951  Found a negative (-.39) correlation between the strength of religious values and research competence. [How these were measured is unknown.]   4. Ann Roe, 1953  Interviewed 64 "eminent scientists, nearly all members of the prestigious National Academy of Sciences or the American Philosophical Society. She reported that, while nearly all of them had religious parents and had attended Sunday school, 'now only three of these men are seriously active in church. A few others attend upon occasion, or even give some financial support to a church which they do not attend... All the others have long since dismissed religion as any guide to them, and the church plays no part in their lives... A few are militantly atheistic, but most are just not interested.'"   5. Francis Bello, 1954  Interviewed or questionnaired 107 nonindustrial scientists under the age of 40 judged by senior colleagues to be outstanding. Of the 87 responses, 45 percent claimed to be "agnostic or atheistic" and an additional 22 percent claimed no religious affiliation. For 20 most eminent, "the proportion who are now a-religious is considerably higher than in the entire survey group."   6. Jack Chambers, 1964  Questionnaired 740 US psychologists and chemists. He reported, "The highly creative men... significantly more often show either no preference for a particular religion or little or no interest in religion." Found that the most eminent psychologists showed 40 percent no preference, 16 percent for the most eminent chemists.   7. Vaughan, Smith, and Sjoberg, 1965  Polled 850 US physicists, zoologists, chemical engineers, and geologists listed in American Men of Science (1955) on church membership, and attendance patterns, and belief in afterlife. Of the 642 replies, 38.5 percent did not believe in an afterlife, whereas 31.8 percent did. Belief in immortality was less common among major university staff than among those employed by business, government, or minor universities. The Gallup poll taken about this time showed that two-thirds of the U.S. population believed in an afterlife, so scientists were far less religious than the typical adult.   Conclusion   The consensus here is clear: more intelligent people tend not to believe in religion. And this observation is given added force when you consider that the above studies span a broad range of time, subjects and methodologies, and yet arrive at the same conclusion.   This is the result even when the researchers are Christian conservatives themselves. One such researcher is George Gallup.   Why does this correlation exist? The first answer that comes to mind is that religious beliefs tend to be more illogical or incoherent than secular beliefs, and intelligent people tend to recognize that more quickly. But this explanation will surely be rejected by religious people, who will seek other explanations and rationalizations.   A possible counter-argument is that intelligent people tend to be more successful than others. The lure of worldly success and materialism draws many of these intellectually gifted individuals away from God. After all, who needs God when you (apparently) are making it on your own?   However, this argument does not withstand closer scrutiny. Most of the studies outlined above describe the religious attitudes of students, who have yet to enter the working world, much less succeed in it. Some might then argue that the most intelligent students are nonetheless succeeding in school. But "success" in school (for those who may have forgotten!) is more measured in terms of popularity, sports, physical attractiveness, personality, clothes, etc. Grades are but one of many measures of success in a young person's life -- one that is increasingly becoming less important, as many social critics point out.   The simplest and most parsimonious explanation is that religion is a set of logical and factual claims, and those with the most logic and facts at their disposal are rejecting it largely on those grounds 
 The author knows his stuff. And if I had NOT been familiar with spiritual writings (or self-help books) I might have gotten seduced by the 'logic' of the arguments or the promises for improving my relationships.   However.  To me, the emphasis of the presentation on the workings of the mind and spirit makes only more obvious its dissociation from the body and emotions. This book will help most people with their relationships the way yoga helps people to be flexible - through dissociation. In both cases a methodical disconnection from  the emotional markers held in the body creates a temporary sense of freedom and relief. But, these very markers hold in place personal history and uniqueness of one's life experience - not to mention energy trapped in suppressed emotions.   To say that I found this book pretty useless for me, is unfortunately not enough - I believe this book is dangerous in what it creates through its seductions - a sort of spiritual and emotional brain washing. Sure, it contains powerful techniques for change - so does brain washing. And. Dissociation works quite well at first - that's why people dissociate - because it works. But. Is this a choice I really want to make? No.  I don't doubt that Mr. Grayson has found a way to make the techniques in his book work for him. I also don't doubt that they worked for his clients - over time therapists polarize the clients they draw by the very nature of the approaches they refine. But. That doesn't make such an approach a good thing. The perspective which this book represents is not one I would choose for my own relationships - it would be insulting and hurtful to the people I love. I want to be close to the people I love, not float on a cloud of abstractions, basking in self-satisfied detachment. Neither would I want to attract into close relationships the kind of people this book would attract.  I'm 47 years old, married for 13 years, with two children. I am an illustrator-artist (27 years), organic grower (11years) and a licensed bodyworker (14 years). I've read spiritual writings and self-help books since I was 15, and until about 5 years ago. This book was recommended to me by a well-meaning, casual friend 
 I'm a Christian, but found this book too religiously pushy and lacking in the info I needed to help a troubled teen who is longing for an absent father.  It had some good info, but I found the idea of telling a teen that God was the only Father she needed, to be of little help.  Yes, we all need God, and especially when faced with life's hardships, but her longing for her father isn't going to be satisfied with that knowledge alone.  If a girl has never had a father in her life, it's certainly difficult for her to envision a heavenly Father in the same concept that I do because I was blessed with a wonderful earthly father.  I didn't finish it, and read Longing for Dad: Father Loss and It's Impact which had much better info on the subject 
 It's incredible that this yankee brat likened this drivel of book to Papillon, one of the greatest books ever.  How dares he, this spoilt NY brat who couldn't figure out if to smoke hash or pot or be gay or not. It's one of the worst books ever!  It has nothing to do with Papillon at all! It's a diary of a whiner, a naive primitive, spoilt American, and a criminal brat. Let's face it, he did attempt to smuggle and he was a drug user.  There's no way around it! Papillon is a march towards grace and soul freedom over elements and hurdles of life told in the most adventurous style.  This lowly tale is a strife of a spoilt New Yorker, who never once had to work in his life and had everything handed to him on a platter.  His tribulations are of personal nature only second guessing his sexuality and penchant for drug abuse.  Nothing in the book makes for good reading.  It's of no spiritual or uplifting value 
 Beware of the five reviews for the mysticmop. Although microfiber mops are relatively new, major department stores have approximately a dozen different mops with different mechanical designs. In order to standout from all the competition, five reviews were concocted for mysticmops in order to deceive buyers about the quality of their mops. Google mysticmop and you will find that all the sites with reviews have the same five identical reviews. Fortunately the "reviews" were fabricated about a month ago so, hopefully, not too many customers have been deceived. My experience has been that most reviewers give, helpful honest reviews. 
 Ridiculous, convoluted and unresolved plot with main characters that have become predictable and boring.   Did Cornwell even write this one herself? If so, she missed a glaring discrepancy when she proofread: On page 216 Marino remembers Mrs. Paulsson greeting him at the door "wearing jeans and a soft pink sweater", but later when he tells Scarpetta what happened during his visit to the house he describes her as having worn black books and a camouflage shirt when she opened the door.  Perhaps it was the author's attempt to let readers think Marino only imagined the pink sweater scenario because he was too ashamed to remember what really happened. However, to this reader it comes across simply as a mistake the author forgot to go back and correct 
 I bought this cable to connect an HP laptop (running XP) to an HP LaserJet 6L printer. XP did not recognize the cable as new hardware. I tried to install manually using the Install New Hardware feature, but that didn't work either. I finally bought a Belkin cable (about twice the price), and it worked like a charm 
 This brush was not as firm as expected.  I expected greater quality from the Sephora brand.  However, the price of the brush was rather cheap in comparison to "finer" brushes.  So in actuality you are getting whay you pay for with this item and nothing more 
 Elaine Risley was bullied by her friends as a child and was scarred forever after. Pile up as much philosophing and moralizing as you want, in the end what you are left with here is more than 400 pages filled with a depressing middle-aged woman's memories of her miserable childhood and bullying friends. Paragraph upon paragraph upon paragraph of childhood angst.  What twaddle. Dreary, dreary, dreary. 
 I was surprised at the ending of this film that I didn't see the above caption at the beginning of the film. This movie to me was comparable to American television movies where something terrible happens to a family and how they cope with it. It was an Italian film, but on the whole it was of the same viewing quality as these movies, maybe a little less slick in appearance.  Also some of the scenes were so banal. Like just before the boy drowns a sense of danger is created by the girl on the moped kicking one of her friends on another moped, the close passing of a truck as the father drives to his patient etc. Or when the boys' casket is nailed shut and is screwed shut interchanged with images of the mourning father. How fat can you lay it on?  Especially the beginning of the movie is excruciating. A very one-dimensional portrait of the family, if they were black, they would be called the Huxtables. This is of course to offset the second part of the movie with the first. First routine and happiness, the second chaos and sadness.  The above are just some things I noticed about the movie which didn't make sense to me. I won't even go into the storyline which is rather unplausible at some points even though it is completely predictable. What bothers me most though is that all of this must have been done on purpose, but why? The end result is a bland film which may have been made with a lot of care, but just doesn't come across. This is the first movie I have seen by this director. I have heard that his other movies are better. I hope so, because this film hasn't made a great impression on me 
 This was given to us as a present, but I would have never bought it for myself.  Here are the problems: 1) we have a platform bed and you cannot shorten the height so it was worthless as a cosleeper.  We still tried to use it as a bassinet but...2) the mattress is so thin and uncomfortable our daughter would cry when you put her in it.  I tried to put extra padding  which worked ok, but still not great.  3)Once she was bigger it would have been nice if this converted to a deeper thing like a pack and play to use in the living room, but the bassinet part is fixed.  I would have been happier with a regular pack and play which had a removable bassinet.  Ultimately we happily gave it away after about 5 months 
 Upon its initial release, the attention that Otto Preminger's "Anatomy of a Murder" attracted due to its subject matter undoubtedly deflected some attention away from the fact that the film had its fair share of problems.  When watched today after much of its scandalous elements have lost their power to shock, its meandering story and uneven characterizations are exposed front and center.    Attorney Paul Biegler (James Stewart) is asked to defend Lieutenant Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara) after a bar owner is found murdered.  Manion claims that he committed the murder in a fit of rage after his wife, Laura (Lee Remick), was raped.  While preparing his case for trial, Biegler finds that Laura is extremely difficult to work with because of her temperamental and flirtatious nature.  Nevertheless, the resourceful attorney continues to work on exonerating his client even though it is not clear whether he and his wife are being entirely truthful with him.   Stewart is his dependable self in "Anatomy of a Murder."  In fact, his performance as an attorney who is not afraid to stretch the rules is the one saving grace of the film.  There is little nuance in the performances of Gazzara and Remick and even the great George C. Scott misses the mark with an over-the-top effort.  Yet, the problems with the acting is secondary to the unfocused screenplay.  "Anatomy of a Murder" oftentimes seems more concerned with exploring the eccentric natures of its characters than in telling a good story.  The investigation of the crime is done in a half-hearted manner and the mystery behind the dual crimes of the rape and the murder are never resolved to any satisfaction.  For a film to run as long as "Anatomy of a Murder" does, one would think that there would be more than enough time to resolve all of the lingering questions posed by the film.  Yet, this is not the case 
 I really had a problem with this book.  This is my first encounter with Feist's work, and I'm finding it difficult to give him a second chance.  From reading other reviews, it seems that people who have read previous works by Feist derive some enjoyment from the world this book is written in, as well as the presence of some familiar characters.  Since I lacked this prior knowledge about Midkemia and its inhabitants, I was left to judge the book purely for the quality of the fiction, and I found it to be uninspiring.    Talon is an incredibly shallow character.  His thoughts and actions are polarized and always single faceted.  If at any time during a book you can describe the complete emotional state of the main character in one word, the author is probably doing something wrong.  While this is bad, it is not disastrous; except when you consider that Feist conveys Talon's emotions to us in a totally uninteresting way.  I believe the addage is, "show, don't tell."  It didn't seem like any of Talon's emotions were real because they were conveyed in such a mind-numbing manner.  It seemed to me that Talon was forced along by the plot rather than guided by his emotions.  Furthermore, Talon's transformation from mountain boy to noble swordsman extraordinaire was unbelievable to the point of being ridiculous.  How Feist can expect us to swallow this garbage while he skips over years of Talon's training and culturing is truly remarkable.  I do not have a problem with Feist's plot idea of turning a country bumpkin into a hero (it is a hallmark fantasy plot), but you have to make the reader believe it.  A few chapters of magic school, snippets of verbal training, and a few sword bouts are not enough to raise this character to the level that Feist has raised him.    Other characters in this book were similarly shallow.  I really saw no difference between any of Talon's trainers except their professions.  You could literally exchange the dialogue between Caleb and Robert, or Caleb and Magnus, or any other similar pair, and you would not notice the difference.  They all spoke exactly the same way, and taught similar lessons.  The battle sequences were dull, ambiguous, and failed to excite me.  The language Feist used was simple and boring more often than not.  Do yourself a favor and read George R.R. Martin's or Terry Goodkind's series instead of this one.    
 Having read the previous book by this duo about biblical archeology I looked forward to a good and interesting read.  I was hugely disappointed.  There was nothing new in this book: it seemed to be a re-hash of some of the material in the earlier book.  It may well be interesting to those who have not read the first book, but for me it was very tempting to put it down.  (However, I did read it through to the end. 
 This cookbook is just The Return of the Naked Chef with a new title. I already owned The Return of the Naked Chef, so now I have two. I really dislike publishers who mislead us by changing titles or changing covers just to get us to buy that which we already own 
 It explained very brod topics, the author goes on and on about his own experiances. I was just not pleased. Thank yo 
 With a bit more research, this book could have been a political thriller; with a bit less, it could have been a romance novel.  As it is, it has a mostly-implausible plot which needs far too much coincidence to save the day.  The villans are given some depth, which I appreciate, but the main characters are so good and clever (and lucky) that they are not terribly interesting.  The political and religious commentary was heavy-handed.    This book worked for me as a sick-day read (from the library), but overall I was unhappy with it 
 I totally agree with the last comment.  A lot of you gave this book five stars because you feel "minorities" are acting paranoid, acting out.  You're thinking, i've never had a racist thought in my life!  Never called anybody names!  My people give other peoples freedom, gives them jobs, saves their souls, and do nice things like correcting their English.  if you say that, then chances are you don't have any close friends who are not "White."  If you say you do, then they probably act and speak like you.  It's time for American writers to start talking about racial conflict in this divided nation openly, instead of pumping out these passive-agressive texts using political correct language.  Thumbs down to Schlesinger's one-sided book 
 This book does not include plates of birds that are included in Peterson Field Guides from Western North America, Eastern North America or Texas. So, unless you have their guide books memorized for these locations, the Mexico guide book is basically useless. Alternatively, you could buy all four books  (Eastern NA, Western NA, Texas, and Mexico) and carry them all with you. Or you could just purchase a different, stand-alone guide book with plates of the most or all of the birds in the region. 
 I bought this thing to stick on the underside of the hutch over my desk. I was very disappointed in the dimness of the light. If there was another light on in the room, it was hard to tell that this one was on at all.   The adhesive patches didn't stick for very long. Unfortunately, they decided to fail while my laptop screen was under the light. The falling light put a small permanent dent in my screen.   I don't recommend this thing to anyone 
 I received nothing of sailing value beyon paying attention to the local tide tables, along with ebb & flood flows... The story was interesting on how two fellows of different social levels were able to enjoy time on a small boat.  The ending left me empty and unsatisfied.  If you are from or sailed the North Sea area of East Friesland (Germany), it will be most interesting, because of the detailed maps of the area.  Looks simular as seen from GoogleEarth map 
 The cover of mine was decorated with the actress from the movie so I expected it to be the tragic romance with a happy ending on the DVD. Instead I got a description of a couple of college proffessors who cash in their investments to buy a million dollar run down house in Cortona Italy in which they only planned to live in 3 months out of the year.   It doesn't tell a story so much as it describes one, like an outline with too much external detail. It has no dialouge whatsoever so it's very one dimensional. The only thing I got out of it was a strong desire to go buy a lemon tree and see the landscapes of Italy. 
 There's too much caterwauling in this one. Not for meditation, maybe as a quiet background for ambience, I dunno. It didn't quite inspire any transcendental experiences for me 
 I found this book to repetitive.  It just keeps going on and on, on how bad Web feels about the death of his 7 team mates.  Also, it has harsh racist descriptions on some characters that don't really add to the story at all.  It just adds to the stereotype of how life is in Annacostia, Washington DC.  One such description is that of the black grandmother of the missing kid.  She is described as a big black woman about the sides of a small car with big breast and lives in a house full of rat excrements. I don't recommend this book at all, but if you are a narrow minded white male, who thinks that he is at the top of the hill looking down on the rest, this book is for you 
 It is bad enough that this is a poor book with no balance, but to require it as a text in post-graduate studies in education almost brings on apoplexy.  It is a secular humanist apoligia for multiculturalism in education.  It is singular in point of view, never straying from the thesis that multiculturalism is good and schools must support it; hardly the sort of reference work for a university level discussion of the issues.  The philosophy behind the book is that people are hardly more or less than those cultural elements which have been socialized into them with little responsibility for their beliefs or actions.  The main text is that every culture is equally valuable in society, forgetting that "society" is essentially American culture with its own priorities.  They go into great detail on the virtues of immigrant cultures and the vices of the American culture, hardly accepting that it has a right to exist as well.  The most difficult aspect of this is the authors' almost laughable inability to get outside of their point of view and treat the issues with something approaching objectivity.  The book is unbearable in its "holier than thou" attitude.  I don't know if this is typical of the ilk but if so, it is hardly a wonder that the multicultural mavens have difficulty selling their point of vie 
 There's a reason you don't know much about his earlier career.  If you want to listen to a sucky indulgent late 60's California band, get QuickSilver Messenger Service first album.  At least Sailor had a minor hit (Living in the USA).  I would be more lenient if this was the first album.  Seeds of potential can be heard on some of the tracks, but he's got a long way to go. He must have been connected, I would not have let him record another album after the first.  But, good thing they did because he was much better in the 70's.  
 Black and Blue is the story of a woman who flees an abusive relationship, taking her son and attempting to disappear into residential Florida, all the while waiting for her husband, a New York cop, to find and hurt her. The book is not Quindlen's best and while it is readable, and at less than 400 pages a manageable length, it feels like little more than a Lifetime "woman's" movie in novel form. I wouldn't recommend this book, especially in comparison to Quindlen's other work, although the lessons of what abuse is, how it happens, and how difficult it can be to escape are good ones to learn about, even in a fictional context.  Anna Quindlen is also the author of One True Thing, a book-cum-film about a daughter's experience with her mother's terminal cancer. That book is good--realistic, emotional but not maudlin, and challenging. Black and Blue is merely an example of weak writing that reads like a made-for-TV movie. It made its way into Oprah's book club but would never make it on to  my must-read lists. Facing the realities of abuse is a good lesson to learn, and so the subject is worth reading about, but Quindlen's portrayal is less than realistic or compelling. All of the checklist facts are there: abuse leads to abuse, specifically carried from father to son; some women are drawn to the type of men that are/become abusers; legal protection can be inadequate; violence can lead to death. So on, so forth. The list of facts is there but the emotional context is filmsy, centers on children (rather than personal strength) and strange, powerless situations. Even when she flees her husband, things seem to be done to the protagonist rather than done by her. It's unfulfilling and disappointing to the reader and detracts from the whole text. In fact, the more interesting characters are mere foils and supporting roles like her new friends and romantic interest. They seem to have more personality and depth than the protagonist.  It will take less time and energy, and induce the same emotional responce, to watch any one of the numerous women's TV daytime movies about the same subject. Black and Blue is gripping only because you want to know if her husband will find her or not, and presents very few challenges, either in the writing or the ideas, to the reader. It's readable and I was able to get through it, but it's still a poor example of literature and even of the lesson it attempts to teach. Don't waste your time on this one 
 I found this CD to have very dark-natured music, not very enjoyable for the most part as the individual tracks changed so often that the feel of the CD is not very cohesive 
 I got through about 6 of these essays when I decided to flip through the book and read the biography of the authors since it was all starting to sound the same.  All of these women are writers!!  How is this a good sampling of real women?  These are women with careers that can be translated into part time work through free lance.  And it is difficult to feel the struggle of the women that have full time babysitters when they are "stay at home" moms.  I am a working mom in a technical field where it very difficult to take off years and then go back to the work force or do anything part time.  It would have been nice to hear the voices of people in similar situations 
 If you don't watch TV, then you might find this book vaguely interesting. But I got this for an XMAS gift and I watch the show on TV. I found this book to be redundant at best.  Other than a bit of background info on the hosts and the producer, there is absolutely nothing in this book that you won't find on the TV shows.  All the info they cover is just a re-hash of each episode from the TV show, and given the choice, the TV show version is much much better than a print version that literally has low-resolution "screenshots" from the episodes to illustrate.  I was also surprised to find the last 11 pages of the book Absolutely Blank! This was not a mis-print, it was probably cheaper to print the book with those pages left blank than to physically leave them out.   The authors could not get enough information to fill in the blank sections?  The book seems to be a rush-job that just capitalizes on the popularity of the TV show. The TV series this book is based on illustrates everything in the book MUCH clearer than the book itself.   Given the option, buy or rent the DVDs of the TV series and forget about this book 
 Oh my God!  I love Beyonce......I honestly do.  But no matter how hard I try, I just can't force myself to listen to this whole CD all the way through (even though there are only 9 songs).  There are a couple of songs that I can deal with, though.  They are DEJA VU (because I lost 5 pounds working out to the beat) and UPGRADE YOU. And that's about it.  Everything else is not even worth playing on the radio much less making a video for. Also, even though I beleive that Jay Z is talented in his own right, I think the fans (including myself) are getting tired of the whole "Ashford & Simpson" routine.  I think Beyonce will do just fine without him always free-styling in her songs. Or if she just has to have some "street" in her music, choose some other artists for more variety.  But, I'll always support her and remain a fan. 
 I have read many books of Cherry Hill. Some of them contain useful information but most of them lack depth. The only book I can recommend from her is 101 area-exercises. This book descibes practices which should become forbidden. They would still work but there are better and friendlier alternatives with better results. I can recommend Bringing up baby from John Lyons and From my hand to yours from Monty Roberts. 
 As a US citizen, I am both embarrassed and angry.  I am embarrassed that anyone in the Federal government, and particularly anyone with ties to the military, would treat remote viewing with any credibility whatsoever.  I am also angry that my tax dollars have been used to support programs of this type.  One does not have to be a "hard core skeptic" to understand that McConeagle has found a niche for himself deluding others about his so-called abilities.  The basic difference between McConeagle and other charlatans is that (1) my tax money helped pay for his activities, and (2) his "work" may have influenced some important decisions.  No "psychic" or "remote viewer" has ever provided signficiant assistance in any criminal investigation.  They simply stand back and make general assertions about the "accuracy" of their work after the fact.  The same is true of MConeagle, who fails to offer shred of credible evidence that he has ever successfully performed remote viewing.  He has hand-picked some events for which he can at least claim that there was some similarity between his "viewing" and the actual circumstances.  It's amazing how a rough sketch can not only fit the profile of the superstructure of a sinking ship, but can also be interpreted as the collapsed walls of a multi-story building destroyed by a car bomb.  As a matter of fact, I think it looks quite a bit like the unfinished Death Star from "Star Wars", too.  I'm giving this book one star instead of zero stars simply because I think that it's important for citizens to read this book and then take political action to ensure that programs like this are never funded again 
 Decent starting point for cooking-impaired college students if they don't mind eating eggs and potatoes often.  A little more variation in the recipes would be nice as well as some pointers on how to substitute ingredients and an explanation on why some ingredients do (What is the purpose of using cornstarch?  I know, some of it is common sense, but heyyyyyyy.... I'm a stupid college student). For example, for one recipe for frying chicken, I used pork and it tasted fine.     Also, some of the recipes don't really work.  Baking chicken drumsticks at 375 degrees in the oven for 40 minutes is not enough for thoroughly cooked chicken.     On the upside, the cooking tips were really helpful.  The book could use more of those, like be aware that if you heat oil, it pops and it could land on your face or burn your arm.  Overall, this book provides some ideas, but I wouldn't rely on it too much.  Not really worth the purchase.  Flip through it in the bookstore like I did and save some bucks for uhhh.... buying food. = 
   This book was really horrible because.It was really bad.   The reason I didn't like it is because. It was really boring and   stuped. Because thay used old words like Mama, Papa and insted   of dinner thay use supper.    It was also really sad in the beginning because her father dies  her dad died in a stable accident. The stable fell on him. While   he was working on them.    The only part I liked was when she was going to try to get her   own room because. She bugged her sisters and her mom and dad. But  it really got anoing after a while.  Those are the resons I   didn't like like the book     
 I am an amatuer athlete and constantly try to update my skills. I have read a number of Sports Psyc. Books and feel this book is a little weak. To  much reliance on the same old stuff. Good stories, somewhat inspirational.  The best book I've read to date is an Amazon recommendation titled, The  Mental Edge. Excellent application of techniques that are the cutting edge 
 I was at the library, wondering if rabbits made good pets, and I picked up this book. It was right beside dog training books, books about cats, etc. But, unfortunately, as I found out when I got home, this book is about raising rabbits to sell for meat. The last chapter is horrific- after going into detail about how to raise these beautiful creatures, the author goes about telling the reader how to destroy it, and which spices taste nice on its skin. No thanks. I just want a Mopsy 
 Like Kenneth Haugks book, Antagonists in the Church, G. Lloyd Rediger promotes an approach to church conflict which will invariably result in individuals being unfairly labeled as clergy killers or antagonists which then is used to justify limiting their involvement in church communities. Dr. Rediger defines levels of conflict based on the histories of those involved. He therefore labels as abnormal any conflict when one or more of the persons involved have a psychiatric history especially a history of being abused. This is not a useful or valid approach. If you follow his reasoning to its logical conclusion, he is advocating that 25% of women (the estimated rate of sexual abuse in this country) be excluded from church leadership positions because they were victimized as children. His line of reasoning results in his labeling a business tycoons abuse of power as normal conflict since there is no known history of prior emotional disturbance. He also advocates that any lay person making a complaint against a minister be investigated to determine their psychiatric history. The ethics of his approach are never considered. Rather than label conflict as normal or abnormal based on individual personal histories, a fairer and more ethical approach would be to examine specific behaviors and find effective ways to promote positive outcomes for the majority of individuals involved. It is possible to reach consensus even when individuals are being difficult. Despite these serious limitations, Dr. Rediger does promote a healthier lifestyle for pastors and advocates that an effective grievance process be in place in all church communities 
 save your money.  my copy is going back to be sold as "used", i guess.  stories aren't bad but the narration is horrible.  probably better read instead of heard.  it's hard to get aroused when some man with a "not so hot" voice is telling you an erotic story and doing a poor job at it as well.  in a word, ...cheesy 
 This is truly a disappointing book.  It starts incredibly slowly and I found it very hard to become interested in the plot.  Another disappointment is Koontz's recycling of elements from other novels: (1) plucky, highly intelligent disabled girl (the young female protagonist in "The Hideaway" had almost identical deformities and personality), (2) devoted, super-powered canine companions, (3) bad guys driving around in ultra pimped-out RVs, and (4) evil bioethicists.  The Leilani character is patently ridiculous.  She conveniently has a genius IQ, but that does not make the absurdly adult manner in which she speaks any more believable.  I found it so disconcerting as to detract from the plot.  Koontz clearly has trouble writing for children, and this book is no exception.  Almost all the children featured in his books are either autistic/MR or genius wunderkinds; the latter, however, does not justify his habit of making smart children talk like genius adults.  Dean heaps the hardships on poor Leilani, with all the subtlety of an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger.  In case you miss the anvils, you are supposed to really, really like her and fear for her safety.  I don't know how or where Dean Koontz learned about bioethics, but he has a terribly misguided view of the field, taking an extreme sect of it to represent the main viewpoint of the field.  Further, he states multiple times that these eugenic bioethics principles are being taught to medical students at major universities (who will have to pay for their involvement with evil bioethics) -- as a medical student, I can assure you that this is patently untrue.  That Koontz could be so off-base on a topic that directly relates to the central motive is disconcerting and makes an already weak book even harder to swallow.  The final issue is Koontz's near-deification of dogs, particularly Golden Retrievers, which is a common motif in his more recent works.  It is ridiculous and unintentionally funny to an almost painful degree.  His obsession with dogs and their mystical powers borders on the psychotic (and I like dogs).  This novel probably features the most egregious example of Koontz's tendency to create overly sappy, sugary-sweet endings.  Dean Koontz has written many books better than this one.  Spend your money on one of his stronger efforts 
 This is the story of Alison who gets dumped by her boyfriend just before a dinner party to go back to his ex who he's had an affair with for months. This story was so disappointing: it's like Dunn took the same ideas as Jennifer Weiner's Good In Bed, i.e. being dumped, religion, pregnancy, friends, etc, but the end result is disappointing. The heroin is a girl who goes on and on about being an Evangelical Christian (who cares?), how she slept with few men, etc. This story is not realistic, it's not that funny, and the heroin is disappointing. If you want the real thing, read Jennifer Weiner, but not Dunn, sorry 
 I was so excited to find these, they seemed the perfect combination of elegance and comfort.  They look weird.  They went straight back, and after paying shipping and return shipping, I practically have to pay them to take it back:- 
 This is literally in the top 3 worst movies of all-time. Complete waste of time and life that I will never get back because of watching this crap. There's always some other movie, or show, or what have you that is a lot better than this 
 "Crank" is a disgusting and despicable piece of nihilistic porn for people with sick minds and sick souls. Like most Americans of my generation, TV and movies have inured me to images of violence and depravity, but "Crank" (and similar movies like "The Punisher") managed to overcome that insensitivity and simply nauseated me. It's not necessarily the subject matter; many other movies have just as much violence, sex, drug use, etc. without being so offensive. The difference is that those movies use the depiction of evil to develop a plot or character and that the demarcation line between good and evil is usually clearly understood. "Macbeth" is full of murder, but we know that he is an evil character and we see him get his comeuppance. Dirty Harry blasts bad guys but we know that he is doing so in pursuit of law and justice. William Wallace may slice off enemies' heads in battle but we see that he is fighting for freedom against tyranny. The difference with "Crank" is that this movie has no moral compass whatsoever. Its protagonist is just as evil and depraved as the people he's fighting. It throws violence and perversion in our faces ad nauseam solely to titillate the reptilian mind with violence and perversion, which is why I call it porn. Its ethic is nihilism and its view of humanity is purely animalistic. I give it 2 stars simply for its technical slickness. It was well-made but what self-respecting, healthy human being could possibly watch this movie and not feel dirty afterwards 
 I am amazed that all these so-called health foods will add artery-clogging "palm kernel oil" as an ingredient.  Don't buy anything with palm kernel oil, cocoa butter, and anything hydrogenated!!  No matter how many "organic" things are added to it.  For many years now, it has been established that palmitic acid carbon atoms increase the risk of coronary heart disease.  The World Health Organization in its report states there is convincing evidence that palmitic oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing of cardiovascular diseases. 
 I bought these dvd's expecting them to be good quality recordings of bad quality films. Instead, I got bad quality recordings period.They seem to be compressed like vcd pirate copies, and every now and again the company's insignia logo comes up at the bottom right hand of the screen for about 30 seconds or so. I was disappointed with the vcd-like quality, and annoyed to be assaulted with logos during the films in this way. Don't buy it 
 Reading Kelly Link is a lot like sitting next to a passenger with Alzheimer's who insists on talking to you on a long trip to an unknown destination. Rambling dialogue reaches new heights in this fantasy world. Whether this is done by shuffling word cards or sorting through old post cards from Tasmania is anybody's guess. At first, it's amusing, then it's tedious and you never really get to the point where something has been achieved. If you're a psychiatrist, you'll love it. If you're just a regular sort of reader, you're in for a bumpy night. 
 Metallica from the very beggining had huge potential but never lived up to it. They made some ok songs along the way but never had an entire album that was worth anything. This album is the only one of them all that I think is ok. It's the only one I can listen to and really the only one that is ok all the way through. Still not a huge fan of the album but its the best they did. Overrated but not to bad. Plenty of other bands that are way better 
 AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN OUT OF THE SPORT FOR 10 YEARS AND LOOKING TO GET BACK IN, I BOUGHT THIS BOOK EXPECTING MORE. THE BOOK STARTS OUT WITH A GOOD HISTORY OF THE 3 WHEELED ATV, BUT DOESN'T ELABORATE TOO MUCH ON QUADS. (WHAT ABOUT THE MID 80'S SUZUKI'S - QUAD SPORT/QUAD RACER?)  ANOTHER DOWN FALL OF THE BOOK  IS THAT IT STRONGLY FOCUSES ON UTILITY ATV'S AND RARELY MENTIONS SPORT MODELS. AS FAR AS THE MAINTENANCE SECTION OF THE BOOK... IT ... 
 Until reading this book, I loved just about everything written by Mr Clancy, although I've mostly read his older books. He has always been known for complex, realistic plots and impressive descriptions of military hardware and modern warfare.  He forgot to include any of that in this book, however. While the premise (a war between China and Russia) is very interesting, "The Bear and the Dragon" doesn't deliver.  The first problem is that it takes an extremely long time to get going. The actual attack doesn't start until 900 pages into the book, and there's really no justification for that much buildup. It doesn't really help that much of those 900 pages consist of Clancy giving his opinion about just about everything from communism, to abortion, to tax rates. While he does make a couple of good points (mind you, just a couple), for the most part it's irrelevant and awfully short-sighted: Mr Clancy spends an awful lot of time telling us just how stupid and barbaric the Chinese (leaders) are, while shamelessly glorifying the American Way (read, "Republican Way") at every turn. It's almost disturbing to see how much the writer is convinced of the moral superiority of his convictions.  The part of the 900 pages that aren't filled with political tirade fare a bit better, but there's still a lot of filler and repetition in them, including a murder investigation that ultimately adds next to nothing to the real story. Which is a shame, because there really is a fairly decent story (once you get over the fact that in this book, the bad guys are incredibly stupid) hidden somewhere in all these pages.  Anyway, I kept reading this "bear" of a book, hoping that it would get better once the action started. It really didn't. The Chines attack, and overrun the Russian defenses, but after that they're so utterly and totally slaughtered by the USA that it's hard to take seriously: American and Russian jets kill Chinese planes by the dozens while suffering marginal casualties themselves, hundreds of tanks are taken out in mere minutes, and the Chinese field commander conveniently and inexplicably gets himself shot by a sniper. Right.   "The Bear and the Dragon" is 900 pages of communist/China-bashing, flag-waving neo-conservative ranting, followed by 200 pages of more flag-waving and China-bashing thinly disguised as a number of battle sequences. It's not completely without its moments (hence the 2 stars) but it's definitely not recommended       
 With the elections approaching there are going to be a lot of changes in the House, Senate and among the nation's governors. Printing this almanac before the results of the election effectively makes a large portion of this book worthless.  
 I am so glad I borrowed rather than bought What Came Before He Shot Her. I have been a fan of  George's writing till now, but after this tome I'll proceed with caution. If George had stuck to the story, which certainly had plenty of tension, rather than breaking it with her sociological asides, it would have been much better. I got really tired of her explaining in depth why Ness reacted the way she did, how Kendra felt, etc. Aren't writers constantly told "show, don't tell? 
    Abolsutely one of the worst self-help books I have read. There isn't any structure, and it's not simplistic. The advice given is helpful but the authors then reverse the whole deal. Its like one chapter says this will be helpful, and then another chapter says it wont. It just goes all over the place and you cant really follow what the authors are trying to get at.      A book I highly reccemend for anxiety and depressive related disorders is "Feel the fear and do it anyway" Much more simplistic, easier to read and get thru. And much more cheerful.       I also dont like that these authors have seperated anxiety and depression from one another. I guess they do have a new book coming out that combines them both. It will be interesting to see if they have learned anything from their last two failures.       But for someone that wants quick and easy advice, this book is certainly not for them. I'm afraid that this book of jargon will make it more confusing. 
   I just wanted to get my 1 star recorded as payback to this movie for wasting my time, although I did start doing other things halfway through.  The only positive thing I can say is that the actor portraying Blevins, the third wheel, did a fine job.  When he wasn't onscreen I was wondering what he was up to and wishing I could be spending my time with him, instead of the other two dullards we are unfortunately stuck with.  Penelope Cruz adds zero to the movie.  Don't know if it's due to editing or acting and don't really care.  Can you tell i'm disgusted? If you're a movie fan or a western fan you should be too. 
 I completely agree with the prior reviewer -- this book was way too silly to be taken seriously.  I've read some of Stuart Woods' earlier work, which was VERY well written and believable.  This book was decently written (I finished it) but had so many ridiculous plot developments that I can't recommend it.  My advice is to skip this book unless you're looking for pure escapism. 
 ignorance and propaganda run amok...a good movie for a lot of american dumb guys who like war movies just because they're war movies...the nazi's made films like this in the 1930's with the poles portrayed just like the vietnamese are in this film...the vietnamese boy in this movie is named ham chunk???  are you kidding me???  the sad part is no...they're not kidding...which makes this movie all the more revolting...but i see it's quite popular...which is informative as to how george w. bush got into the white house and why american soldiers are now bogged down in iraq...the same war mongering fat heads who didn't "get it" (understand the consequences of putting your big american nose in other people's business) then, don't get it now.  Winston Churchill warned, "those who do not remember their past are damned to repeat it"...a fine vintage vietnam war movie for simple minded viewers...remember freedom is not free...freedom to make millions of dollars from selling weapons and war materials to the government costs citizens billions of dollars...this movie stinks...unless your sophisticated taste enjoys war as entertainment.. 
 My daughter placed this crib on her registry, mainly because of  the price. She didn't want anyone spending $500.00 on a crib and this one matched the style she was looking for. I found this set up at a "Depot" store and it was beautiful and sturdy, but didn't come in natural. So I went home and ordered it online. It arrived 4 days before the shower(8 days early from ETA)but it was shattered. The first 3 pieces we looked at were split, chipped & crushed. Quite a surprize considering the box wasn't in bad shape. We decided to return it and buy a more expensive model(at a local specialty store). Amazon's return policy was amazing, a click on the mouse and the next day UPS picks up. No packing labels to print, no lugging big heavy items to post office, very simple. Amazon gets 5 stars, Storkcraft - 0 
 WARNING: MOVIE SPOILER BELOW!!! I confess that my primary reason for buying a copy of this film, is grounded in recent history. I was around in the early 80s, when L. Ron Hubbard and his Scientologists were going full-bore with the logistics of making the book into a movie (the hero depicted on the original edition of the paperback looked like Chuck Norris, or so I thought), when all of a sudden Hubbard died, and the whole project apparently fell apart. Back then, I was close to 20 years old and I was curious about whatever it was that these Scientologists were turned on to that was supposed to help improve a person's quality of life... then I read about Larry Wollersheim's 1985 lawsuit. You can figure the rest out for yourself.  Anyhow, oh, yeah, the movie... the storyline is your basic alien invasion number, i.e., the Invaders arrived to make life miserable for the poor humans (in this film, the aliens look a lot like the Klingons from Star Trek), until your typical dashing young male hero organizes a band of his fellow humans to rise up and tell the Invaders to get off of our planet. Pretty simple and straightforward, but hey, there are other films MUCH worse than Battlefield Earth, and they've taught me that if you have good enough special effects, even the lamest sci-fi storylines can work!   The thing that stood out about this film, though, was its reliance on everyday talk and contemporary cliches for much of its dialogue, and as a result, it came across as rather corny... a film to be recommended for its comedy value, rather than for things like epic space battle scenes. Also, the "bad guy" aliens use some sort of psychic power to interfere with the minds of their human subjects, in order to keep them from organizing revolts... I must say, trying to depict mind-manipulation effects on film does pretty much the same thing to the movie as varnish stripper does when applied to a CD---it turns it into a confusing, incomprehensible mess! A couple of times, the picture would break up into a concentric blur, and I'd wonder what the heck was supposed to be going on.  How the makers of this film ever talked a great studio like Warner to help them film it, is something which will forever remain a mystery to me. I remember just before this picture opened, a group of Scientologists were trying to hype it: "oh, watch---this film is going to be bigger than Star Wars and Gone With the Wind combined!" You can guess what happened when those staggeringly huge box office numbers never materialized... can you say "oops" 
 If you are looking for an enjoyable treatise on bringing awareness to everyday life, this is not the book for you. The author does not have an engaging, easy-to- read style. Rather the work is much more scientific in tone and probably helpful to one trained and interested in psychology/psychiatry and counseling modalities 
 It's great that Dr. Weil recommends that we get fresh air, exercise, eat lots of vegetables, avoid fast food hamburgers,  breathe and think positive healing thoughts.  But that's the extent of his good advice.  He also gives some very bad advice that is effectively shredded in 2 new books that have come out.  "The Whole Soy Story" by Kaayla Daniel and "The Fluoride Deception" by Chris Bryson.  Between soy and fluoride you'll have a wiped out thyroid in 8 weeks (+ or -) and that doesn't bring optimum health.      
 I can't believe how many people rave about this book. I just finished it today and it was probably one of the most shallow, superficial books I have read in a very long time. New York women all acting like spoiled little girls, the whole story reminds me of the Barbie phenomenon. It they were to make a movie out of this book, they should use all the Barbie characters and let's nor forget about Ken! Such a waste of time 
 A friend gave me the audio tape version of The Minds Sky  and I was so disinchanted with what I heard that I visited Amazon.com,  read a couple of reviews then ordered the book version thinking I must have just missed ( again and again) the points and story line Mister Farris was putting forth. Fact is I didn't "get it" from the book version either - I have been amused, bemused and found some great themes opened up by Mr. Ferris but almost universally found his own comclusions to be way off the mark . The man does not know how to think. There is some flaw or serious ommision in his logic ( or in mime )  I suggest you get the book, study it then lets keep hammering on him with reviews until he rewrites it 
 Beware: This book is not the textbook Psychology: The Science of Mind and Behavior, by Passer and Smith but merely an outline of that textbook and should be labeled such on the banner for this item. If I already had the actual textbook and wanted an outline as well, this book might be OK, but it cannot be used in place of the textbook. I'm disappointed in Amazon, since the book is clearly misrepresented here 
 If you like nice big pictures without going to the full details of the x-men, this book is for you. If you are a long time fan, I would recommend get the previous edition, it still includes the annoying "behind the scenes" of the first movie (as if there were not enough DVD's with such feature) but includes more about the characters of the comics.. This updated edition includes just a few more pages but, some mutants don't appear or are not fully well described as in the previous edition, which you can still get here in Amazon. It's a nice book indeed, the cover and the quality of the paper and great illustrations, but they really need to get in touch with the fans to meet their needs. There is the need of a REAL X-men guide to all the characters, organized alphabetically prefferably 
 Caveat - I wasn't exactly expecting to finish PE a die-hard believer.  That said, I was unprepared for how much of my skepticism stemmed from the authors' willingness to believe anything, and mask their suspension of disbelief as objectivity.  According to legend, the US Navy conducted invisibility experiments on one of their ships during WWII.  Not simply invisible, the ship actually teleported from its berth in Philadelphia.  However, the little-understood process played havoc with the crew - even after the experiment's end, some crewmen would "blink" in and out of existence, become frozen in time or catch fire.  One man walked through a wall, never to be seen again.  Of course, the Navy denies the whole thing....  While the legend places the story during the dark days of WWII, the legend itself began in the mid 1950's, with the publication of "The Case for the UFO" by Morris Jessup.  (Aknowledging that Jessup is no scientist, Berlitz & Moore nevertheless refer to him as "Dr. Jessup".)  Believing that propulsion of UFO's (and perhaps future human spacecraft) lay in solving Einstein's "Unified Field Theory", Jessup encouraged readers to press for research in that area. Jessup's book caught the attention of Carl Allen (AKA Carlos Allende), who spent the war in the Merchant Marine.  In a series of rambling letters Allen insisted that Einstein had solved UFT, and the solution was successfully used to cloak a USN warship in wartime experiments.  Though claiming to have witnessed the event from deck of a nearby freighter, Allen goes further than detailing his observation - exhaustively describing the travails of the crew, Einstein's seeming retraction of UFT, his admission to Bertrand Russel that UFT was complete but had to be suppressed at least until after WWIII, the identity of one of the chief scientists attached to the project, and that UFT had anything to do with the experiment.  To get his point across, Allen/Allende even forwarded a copy of Jessup's book (heavily annotated with his own theories, many having nothing to do with the Philadelphia Experiment) to the Office of Naval Research.  There it piqued the personal interest of at least 2 officers, and slowly became the story-that-wouldn't-die.  A few years later, a depressed Jessup was found dead in his car.  Allende/Allen became something of a cult celeb, sometimes retracting what he had previously claimed, often warning against the ominous dangers of UFT even as he seemed to beg others to look into it.  Berlitz and Moore piece Allen/Allende together with what are supposed to be other pieces of a puzzle that will prove the Philadelphia Experiment actually occurred.  Instead, the result is far less than the sum of its parts: Berlitz and Moore place far more weight on any of the individual pieces than common sense would allow, and they find a better fit between the different pieces than you'd get in a jigsaw puzzle.  Nothing in PE lacks a more reasonable explanation than the authors can provide.  At the beginning, and towards the end of the book, the authors mention coming in contact with others who claim to have met alleged crewmembers of the ship involved in the experiment - but neither name nor any other convincing corroborating information comes out (Allende at least included his Merchant Marine ID in his letters).  The authors add to the puzzle, but never actually establish that the Philadelphia Experiment actually occurred.  An anonymous radar scientist, who doesn't claim to have worked on the project, clairifies how events would have had to occurr if the legend were true.  Another scientist - given a psuedonym because it would upset "the status quo" - describes wartime discussions on a project that we're supposed to believe developed into the Philadelphia Experiment.  Named "Rinehart" after a similar character in the novel "Thin Air" (a thriller inspired by the legend) the doctor describes discussions but never mentions witnessing the experiment, nor any discussions of its aftermath - obvious details for such a pivotal figure.  "Rinehart" never even mentions Allende, even though it had been Allende's letters that clued the authors into Rinehart's existence (under yet another pseudonym).  The authors never explain how they managed to find "Rinehart" - they need to protect his identity even though the government obviously knows who he is, and anybody else would have the same difficulty tracking him down as the authors of this book.  The authors describe how the experiments of another scientist in "electrogravity" never caught on despite their apparent success - suggesting they were suppressed.  Though Allende described reading stories about the Experiment's sailors in Philadelphia newspapers, the only article that could be found is obviously bogus: a xerox of an obviously fabricated article describing a bar-room brawl by sailors who mysteriously vanish -  but no mention of date, newspaper, or the reporter, nor any specific facts in the article about the event, like the name of the bar or those of witnesses.  The authors make the barest efforts to answer the questions they raise, and then merely add more pieces to the puzzle, without explaining how one piece corroborates any others.  Though appearing critical and objective, it's impossible to believe that the authors haven't already settled on the idea that the experiment actually occurred - they explicitly question Allende, yet never express their doubts, let alone attempt to deal with our own.   But what's the danger of that?  I mean, who cares if they can get their readers to believe the legend of the "Philadelphia Experiment".  Unfortunately, "Philadelphia" feeds on our prejudices of secret conspiracies, and relies on our willingness to do so with little prompting - never a positive thing.  Worse, it's not even interesting - barely substantive enough to raise the sort of questions that would make a more critical investigation a stirring story.

 WELL,GUYS JESSICA SIMPSON IS THR WORST OF THE WORST.SHE SINGS AS BADLY AS SHE LOOKS.THIS CD IS VERY,VERY,VERY BAD.AVOID AND WAIT FOR THE NEW IRON MAIDEN CD WHICH SHOULD BE OUT SHORTLY. 
 I knew that this concert DVD was an acoustic show so I wasn't surprised that the tempo was slow at the beginning. But to start the show with Gilmour tuning his guitar was a bit much.   Once he did start playing, Gilmour was having such a hard time finding his rhythm that I found myself praying for the drums to kick in.   By the time things settle down, the really glaring problem with this DVD comes to the surface. The mix is horrible. The crowd noise drowns out Gilmour at times when they cheer a song they recognize, he is almost inaudible when talking between songs and at many points the backup singers completely cancel him out. I found myself constantly adjusting the volume which really takes away from the "concert experience".  There are high points in the show, but the low points are rock bottom. Comfortably Numb is a song that millions of people know by heart. Two versions are provided on this DVD - from the concert and in the bonus section. Neither of the guest singers (Robert Hewitt and Sir Bob Geldoff) know the words, have to read from sheet music and based on their phrasing have never heard the song before. Gilmour would have been better off asking for a volunteer from the audience.   The very best thing on this DVD is, oddly enough, in the bonus section. Screamin' Jay Hawkins' I Put a Spell on You, a blues standard performed with Mica Paris and Jools Holland, almost makes the DVD worth buying. Almost.   Watch Jonathan Demme's beautiful treatment of Neil Young: Heart of Gold if you really want to see a great acoustic show. That is the gold standard. 
 Even though I never listened to Ray J's music I always thought he could sing.  When I heard "One Wish" on the radio I liked the song a lot because of the beat and overall sound to it.  When I found out it was Ray J, I was shocked because the vocals sounded kind of horrible.  Very recently he was on that show, "Showtime at the Apollo" and let me tell you it was embarassing.  This boy couldn't sing a lick.  It looked like he was in pain and his voice kept going out.  He was frontin like he was really doing something but you can tell he strains a lot when he sings and I bet the audience noticed it to.  This has got to be one the worst singers in music history.  He makes mediocre singers like Mario and Usher sound good.  I really don't know why he got a record deal with any company because his vocals are bad.  I guess because he's related to Brandy, who can actually sing.  When you have that instant name recognition it usually gets you in the door rather you have talent or not.  Even though I don't own this CD I just had to write a review because his singing is so bad it's hilarious.  His songs sound nice, but it would be a plus if he can actually sing.  So why would anybody waste money on this.  I don't care if the music is nice.  When a bad voice accompanies it, it can be quite annoying and unbearable.   
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea, provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: The REAL Rapture.  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's The REAL Rapture (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site for details on these items) 
 SHREDDER is filled with many of the cliches that abound in this ominously overused genre.  Slasher killer on the slopes who kills for revenge, and particularly those who don't follow the orders of the vacated resort.  There are some incredibly funny scenes like the poor girl dangling from the ski lift that no one seems to notice.  Brad Hawkins' horrible European accent, whatever country he's supposed to be from.  The horrid overacting of Lindsey McKeon; the deadpan awfulness of Scott Weinger.  There are few chills and those that do come are highly predictable. Not the worst of the slasher lot, but definitely a sign to leave this genre alone for a while 
 Much too stereotypical for my tastes and the storyline is not only unbelievable- it drags on and on. Sadly, from reading some of the reviews on Amazon, Mr. Hiassen's stereotypical, over the top books on the people of Florida are read by many as real and some reviewers state that they want to visit Florida after reading Mr. Hiaasen's books. This is sad- that  people actually believe that the state is chock full of characters like Twilly Spree, Clinton Skink Tyree and Palmer Stoat. Where does he get these names? During my 25 years in Florida, the people I met  had names like Robert, Jim, Mary, Chris, Michael, etc. By the way, for those of you who think I am just a Floridian with sour grapes- I have been a proud resident of the Northeast for over 20 years. I just dislike stereotyping of groups of people. It causes prejeudice, misunderstanding and in extreme cases- hatred. Read some Christopher Moore for your humor fix. He doesn't stereotype and although his stories are over the top in his own way, he makes them believable and fun 
 Give me a break.  MIchael Drosnin has written the worst book of the new century.  Actually think about what everybody is saying because there is nboway that these codes can even be valid.  Nuff Said.  I have done my work, read all the other reviews (including Kazuo, ahem).  gift?  WHo tags this piece of _____ with gift

 I purchased two cushions to use on small chairs.  When the cushions I arrived, I could hardly believe how small they were, smaller than the description stated.  In addition to the small size, the cushions had a lot of stuffing and seemed more like volleyballs than chair cushions.  
 After quickly exhausting the cultural significance of Jello-O boxes in her previous book, SYMPTOMS OF CULTURE, Marjorie Garber has now produced little  more than a book for realtors.  The result is banal and rather  stupid--anything but revelatory.  But perhaps the reader below doesn't take  the criticism far enough: this book has really nothing to say about the  scandalous cost of real estate in most major U.S. cities, the large number  of people who are homeless, and the millions of folks who are gouged every  month by unscrupulous landlords (how sexual is that, Professor Garber?).   Until recently, cultural critics expressed nominal interest in improving  our society.  Nowadays, concerned only about their fat publishing advances,  all they seem able to do is exhibit nauseating complicity with society's  ugliest elements 
 I chose this keyboard during a promotion as a "Bonus Item" with the purchase of a number of other toys, thinking that my [...] would love it.  From the moment we took it out of the box, it was terrible: 1 - NO instruction book 2 - more than half of the keys were out of alignment and had to be carefully popped back in 3 - when unit is turned on, it plays a LONG LOUD piece of music, not subject to volume control 4 - Volume control is basically a switch, and the only (unlabeled) choice is LOUD and LOUDER 5 - tone quality stinks  Yes, I know it was free - but it does sell for about [...], so if you are thinking of buying a keyboard, you probably need to spend a little more to get something that is actually useable 
 my review is written here only for seekers of obscure nine inch nails songs. for a full review of the soundtrack in its entirety read elsewhere-there are many other reviews. i have all 19 halos, and exclusive and unreleased remixes and demos, and i love all of it, including the entirety of the fragile, fixed, perfect drug versions, still, further down the spiral v1 and v2, the deluxe edition of the downward spiral, on and on, everything.... except deep. deep is truly the only nine inch nails song not worth having. painfully uninspired and recycled, musically, lyrically, and visually (the video was an embarassment- again, the only one in a catalogue of otherwise disturbing, beautiful brilliance), DEEP is a song and phase trent himself has admitted to wishing to forget entirely. my advice: take it as a mark that he is, after all, human, but leave it here on the tomb raider soundtrack, unpaid for, for it will never show up on an official halo as burn (originally for natural born killers), dead souls (joy division cover originally for the crow), and the perfect drug (originally for lost highway) all have in time (the former two on halo 8 DE and the latter on halos 11, 12, and 15 in extended form) 
 I'm a Chris Botti fan - make no mistake about that. And, when I viewed this DVD, I was very impressed with his band members - most notably his most excellent drummer. However, it is extremely obvious (even to the untrained eye) that this recording has been edited, and not edited very well! The editing is so poor, I would have to advise against purchasing this DVD.   Hold out - Chris is too good a musician for the record companies (you know them by their circling fins sticking just above the surface of the water) not to produce another DVD. The next one might just be worth buying - maybe they'll hire a competent team to record and edit the show. I am anticipating the event with great fervor 
 Greetings to one and all.  Just wanted you to know that if you are looking for a pretty good film called "The Desperate Hours," this is NOT the one you want to watch. You want to watch the 1955 version with Humphrey Bogart and Fredric March. This is the 1990 "remake" with Mickey Rourke and Anthony Hopkins. The original is a taunt drama in which a man discovers that his home has been invaded and his family taken hostage by a trio of gangster escaped from prison and focuses on his desperate attempts to save their lives. This remake is exercise in terror in which the sadistic violence of the criminals becomes the driving force of the story and the goal is to see how far they will go before they are finally stopped. On paper you would have thought Anthony Hopkins could do a marvelous job in the role of the father, but the script pretty much makes that impossible. Turning the bad guy into a major league psychotic just destroys the psychological chess game that made the original so compelling. Rourke is simply the wrong choice for the role, always coming across as a sick punk rather than a criminal menace, but then few actors are going to be able to play against Hopkins, even when he is in low gear. I cannot believe anybody would watch this film twice; I only watched it because I was interested to see how they updated the original, the ending of which I just watched again on television. Of course the ending would be more violent, but it was the elegance of the ending of the original, as the hero saves his family with an unloaded gun, that made it stand out. This one is just a splatter flick dressed up a bit to fool you. Go check out the original because like Rourke's character, you do not want this in your house anywhere near your family 
 I'm a serious amateur musician (singer), so I know that understanding the body and learning how to use it properly is crucial to making good music.  I thought this book would teach me how to better use my body through consideration of its various parts and relationships.  I was wrong.  Too many of the one-page sections start and end with simplistic lead-ins and ferverinos like these: "You can learn to have a pressure-free front" or "You can learn to organize your torso around your core" and end with "You have a pressure-free front? Gloat! and "If you already, just naturally, organize around your core, huzza!" In between these statements are anatomical diagrams  but nothing that tells the reader/student HOW to develop a pressure-free front or to organize the torso around the core.  And so on.  From the reviews this book apparently satisfies the needs of some, and that's great.  But if you're a serious musician looking not only to understand the way the body should work but also tips, advice, or exercises about HOW to use your body, you'll need to look elsewhere.  I am 
 I have a few concerns with the words Willie Jolley writes and speaks.  Never quote the bible then talk about going out and doing all you can to make more money. Do you really believe Jesus condones the desire to gain "worldly" things Willie? You talked the entire time about your riches and have the nerve to quote proverbs...   I have a little tip for you Willie, when you write or speak, don't use Microsoft  / Bill Gates as examples of success. You do know that they were found guilty in a court of law numerous times of illegal practices to get where they are right? They lie, steal, and cheat to get ahead.  Will you be endorsing Martha Stewart and Enron next? Maybe use Tyco or Halliburton as an example of how to succeed and make loads of money.  I have a little tip for you too Willie, maybe a little something you can throw in your speeches or possibly your next book: Tell the people you talk to, that no matter how much money they get, that in life, happiness is what really counts. Just, do something everyday that makes you smile. You don't have to brainwash yourself by repeating affirmations of "I am happy" 800 times a day. You don't have to force yourself to be a type-a personality. You don't have to climb the corporate ladder of achievement to have a wonderful fulfilling life. No Willie, all you need is to accept you for who you are, and strive to be happy. I smile everyday. I don't have to brainwash myself to get there.  You're either the bee or the windshield? Too bad life isn't so black and white as to only be reduced to such.  I say, seek out the fields of flowers and avoid the highway altogether.  
 .... how wonderful, talented, patient, loving, forgiving, honest, terrific, special and marvelous this man is - because he tells you that over & over & over & over & over & over again, page after page, as he wades through the ballbusting bitches and faux friends that have populated his fabulous and stunningly promiscuous 'life.' Eddie takes the kiss-and-tell theory to glorious new depths in this trashy book, which when I picked it up I had hoped was a TAD more objective and less venomous than it turned out to be. Thank God I only paid 33 cents for it at a library sale: at least I only over paid by 32... Eddie - get a REAL life and not one based on an obvious desire to hurt the ones who actually sustained a vital career, which you failed to do because your 'talent' was really a limited deal. Sheesh.. 
 This book is very complete and educational. However, it is historical and gives complex antecedents for topics such as: Faith, Worship, Culture and Customs. I do not recommended if you want simple, brief and easy to read explanations for Catholic Practices, but it is a good reference book for research purposes. 
 I hate to say it.  This book provides very basic information that lacks depth and the insider viewpoint I expected.  The limited info that did scratch slightly deeper than the surface centered on the cities of Phoenix and Tucson.  Other cities such as Flagstaff, Sedona and Winslow were barely mentioned.  I found this book of little real value to someone serious about Moving to Arizona 
 I was completely mezmorized by the first quarter of the book. Even though Anne Patchett is writing as a white woman, her characterizations of John, the black male ex-drummer and bar manager, and of the other bar employees ring true. The little details in the relationships between the characters, their idiosynchrocies and habits, are intriguing. The theme of loyalty and love surrounding John's longing for his son is equally compelling. BUT - when we get to the heart of the story, where John is pulled into alove-lust relationship with Fay, my stomach had a sinking "oh-no" feeling. And this instant reaction was correct. This plot line was flat and unbelievable, even repellant. So, too, are issues with Carl, Fay's drug-dealing brother. Anne Patchett is an incredibly talented author. I highly enourage you to read Bel Canto or The Magician's Assistnat instead. 
 Have a Zen Vision M and this thing does not fit. It is about 4mm too wide and 2 mm too tall to fit on the screen. It does not tuck into or slip under the plastic around the screen either. Go figure 
 THE STORY OF RUTH is the telling of the story of Ruth, the grandmother of King David (versus Goliath, etc.) and an ancestor of Jesus Christ Himself. Unfortunately, the film ends up being a very badly missed opportunity to make a great Bible movie, but it fails miserably by missing the overall message despite its attention to other Bible verses and historical details!  The cast, costumes, and sets are all great. The problem is the writing. They spend the first hour making up a non-Biblical origin for Ruth, as an orphaned  girl sold to the Cult of Chemosh in Moab. She grows to adulthood as a priestess in a cult that sacrifices a child to a stone statue annually.   The movie introduces many characters named in the Bible's book of Ruth. Naomi is the mother of Mahlon. Mahlon is a statue artisan who repairs Chemosh statues even though he is repelled by the concept of child sacrifice. Ruth learns about the God of Israel from the Israelite named Mahlon, and they marry, sort of, after an hour's worth of dramatic plot twists which all have NOTHING to do with the Bible story of Ruth. MAYBE it all could have been a reasonable setup for Ruth's origin, if only the second hour would have FINALLY brought out the correct Bible story.  Instead, the second hour is re-written so that Boaz has a modern, romantic tension between himself and Ruth, while Ruth is being courted by her legal next-of-kin. In the Bible, this unnamed next-of-kin wants Ruth, but quickly declines when Boaz reminds him that he will be raising a heritage for the deceased Mahlon. Ruth and Boaz finally end up right, but the story inbetween is foolishly re-written, so this movie ultimately fails as a Bible story retelling.   A major element in the second hour is that Ruth is accused of being an idolator, a former priestess of Chemosh, and the people protest for her death sentence.  The film has lots of small Bible verses portrayed correctly, but it totally screws up the major story arc. They show the scene and dialogue when Ruth decides to join Naomi to return to her homeland, and Naomi's God will be Ruth's God, etc. They also show other details, like exchanging sandals as part of a business deal, which is in the Bible, and one of my favorite amusing, ancient cultural moments in scripture. The movie has many of the pieces but the puzzle is not put together to resemble the Bible story, not nearly enough.  It is strange that the film makers seemed to have done their homework so well concerning the culture of the Moabites who worship Chemosh, but then they screw up the SIMPLE story of Ruth from the actual Bible, which is the name of the darn movie in the first place!   There is a much better RUTH story on DVD, which is an animated claymation 30 minute story, but is TOTALLY accurate to the Bible! TESTAMENT: THE BIBLE IN ANIMATION - RUTH, (1996). This animated version of Ruth is super cute as well as super faithful to the actual Bible story and details. This animated DVD is excellent and worth your time and money. If you like the cute claymation style of RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED REINDEER and THE LITTLE DRUMMER BOY Chrismas classics, then you will LOVE this animated RUTH DVD! Get that instead!   THE STORY OF RUTH, this DVD, is only of interest to the most hardcore Bible DVD collector, who needs to have it on their DVD shelf. It will gather dust 
 This book really stunk.  Most of the content was unusable.  I read the book in one day and was really frustrated with the lack of detailed information.  I perfer the following book "Windows 2000 Server :  Planning and Migration" by Sean Deuby.  It was better organized with  more tips from someone who has faced real life Windows 2000 issues 
 The authors speak of real problems, but address them ineffectively.  By peddling generalizations of the white race, they perpetuate the victim/victimizer dichotomy which divides instead of uniting.  Further, the boundary between victim and victimizer is drawn rigidly along racial lines.  They fail to recognize that any progress has been made in the decades since the civil war toward a more loving, color blind society.  This truly dishonors the memory of those whose blood and tears watered the garden from which African Americans now harvest financial and educational opportunities as well as self worth.  A better discussion, in my opinion, can be found in Joel Kovel's book by the same title 
 I read this book as it was a suggestion from my book group. I adore vanilla. Most likely more than the average person. However, the author of this book REALLY REALLY REALLY loves vanilla. More than I think it humanly possible. Patricia Rain's pacing is terrible, she opens the book with a list of incorrect facts in an effort to "trick" the reader and then show off her smarts. I think the person who would buy this book already knows such basics as "vanilla beans are green, not brown when they are growing" so her trickery just comes off odd. If you really want a book that is badly written, but tells you everything you could possibly ever need or want to know about vanilla, then this is the book for you! If you're looking for an interesting read about the cultural history of a spice, I'd skip this one 
 I was disappointed in the latest Lincoln Rhyme mystery. The book had more twists than a Chubby Checker song and in the end they strained credibility.  Rhyme and Sachs are called in to solve a string of murders by a serial killer calling himself the Watchmaker. Rhyme has met his match with the Watchmaker, a meticulous killer who leaves nothing to chance and leaves few clues for Rhyme to follow.  Running parallel to the story of the Watchmaker, Sachs is also lead detective on her first case - a case that appears to involve police corruption. Sachs is juggling a heavy case load as well as rumours that her own father may have been corrupt. Ron Pulaski steps up to help with crime scenes and proves himself to be a smart and resourceful officer but ultimately it is up to Rhyme and Sachs to solve the case.   The book introduces Kathryn Dance, a visiting Californian expert in Kinesics, the study of body language. Dance helps interview suspects and witnesses and plays a role in solving the case. There is also a hint of romance with officer Sellitto which is ultimately left hanging. The information about Kinesics is interesting and Dance is a character that could have used more development.   The title of the book comes from a season in the lunar calendar, which is also a time of death. The book also contains a lot of information about clocks and time courtesy of the Watchmaker. There was some fascinating information, but at times the book was bogged down in historical details about clocks.  The book lurches from one plot twist to the next. At first it was exciting, but after a while it became tedious. NOTHING was what it seemed. Further I found Rhyme less likeable in this book - grumpy, bossy, pedantic and sarcastic. The only hint of humanity was in his fear that he may lose Sachs.  At times I found the writing clumsy. Deaver uses cliched adjectives in his sentences to describes his characters, such as,        "the handsome, sardonic and impatient criminalist" I found it trite to describe Rhyme that way.   This book is not as good as earlier Rhyme mysteries.  
 I have just finished this lengthy and mundane tome. 564 pages of this author's ponderous personal philosophy,  gratuitous sexual dysfunction, constant and maddeningly self ingratiating referrals to classical music and composers, discussions on all the authors that ever walked the earth, and when finished with all the above, a good little story that could have been written with one third the pages.  As if all this were not enough, Styron pulls out every lengthy, obsolete, and arcane word that he can find with which to propel his story along. (One can imagine him, loaded with whiskey--which he freely admits to being his greatest source of inspiration--pouring over every dictionary and thesauras written in an attempt to impress the reader, or, at least the liberal East Coast intelligensia.)The end effect for the reader is a constant slowing of momentum of the narrative, in order to look up a new and confusing word every five minutes. (One does, however, come to learn what "simulacrum" means; he uses the word some 15 or more times throughout this laborious read.)  I will not go into the story, save to mention the three major plot lines: that it is one of about 10,000 treatments of the after effects of concentration camps; a love story about a deeply scarred woman, having endured life in one of the camps, and a mentally deranged man; and a young Southern writer coming to grips with culture shock in Brooklyn--this being Styron, or Stingo, as he endearingly calls himself in the story. In one of the more compelling passages in the book he realizes that he no longer wants to live in the South and turns back to the squalid and sewer like life of New York. Being from the South, and after having slogged through this tedious read, I only wish that he had been belched into the Northeast sooner.       
 This book was painfully bad.  If you are tempted to buy it, I strongly suggest reading an excerpt from it, or flipping through a few pages at the library or a bookstore.  It's pretentious prose, with thin characters and a plot with very little to recommend it.  Interested in the Hoover Dam?  He gets to it about two hundred pages in.  If gratuitous violence is your thing, you might be able to skim this novel for the parts about Lew Beck and enjoy the bits where he stomps on legless beggers, chops off fingers, or stabs people in the guts with broken bottles.  I wouldn't have minded the violence so much had the justification for it not been so very weak.  Nothing we see of Lew's childhood really illuminates his sadistic nature to my satisfaction. He just doesn't add up, which is frustrating because he's the only potentially interesting thing in novel.  
 I have been readung daily meditations/modivational readings for as long as I can remember.  I find this this is probably the most useful in that it covers all aspects of one's life.  I find myself unconsciously nodding my head as I read.  I would highly recommend this book to all of my friends.  It is amazing how much better your day is when you get your brain primed early in the day 
 Have you ever desperately wanted a book to end but hated leaving it unfinished?  That's the way Sappho's Leap was for me. I finally finished it over the weekend and am still wishing I hadn't spent good money, even bad money, any money on it.  Admittedly, very little is known about the only ancient Greek female poet besides where she probably lived and a few snippets of her poetry. Her words are searing, lovely and sometimes erotic. But Erica Jong's novel fictionalizing her life was banal and boring and droll. Sappho, as her heroine is not only uninteresting, but has no single aspect of her personality that makes me like her. Sure, she experiences heartache and longing, but Jong simply fails to give me a reason to care.  Jong just tells me, flatly, in first person, how Sappho feels and what she thinks, but doesn't make it real for me. She tries to make Sappho into a female Odysseus and can't figure out if the novel should be a fantasy or a semi-believable historical account. And all that wrapped up with a very disappointing, Hollywood ending, tied it off into an unequivocal piece of garbage.  I can't believe Erica Jong has actually written and published eight novels.  It honestly seems like she wrote Sappho's Leap specifically to sell to high school English departments to teach a bit of Greek history with a feminist slant.  Regardless of whatever pocket genre she was trying to exploit, Sappho's Leap is utter tripe 
 I bought the item, and as soon as I opened the packaged I was wondering if it was going to work and if so, how long it would last.  Needless to say, after about 2  hours of use, the item just stopped working.  I beleive it had something to do with the cheap button used to turn the product on.  Yes, it was a cheap toy to buy price wise, but I guess I got what I paid for 
 I was very careful to not press down as instructed when cleaning CDs, yet I was left with light circular scratches and smudges untouched.  As for scratches, you may as well use toothpaste for all the good this will do you. The solution does not fill in even the lightest scratches. I tried it with several different scatches and discs and the result was the same. Multiple applications fared no better.  The disc I bought this for primarily is in worse shape than when I started 
 After reading the product description and looking at the photos I was ready to buy, but when it came time to select a size, I couldn't start. Without a sizing chart, I don't know which size to order, not for a unisex item 
 The DVD is poorly edited and insulting to anyone keenlyinterested in trad. blues/Robert Johnson/ and modern bluesinterpretors.  The viewer is presented with only tiny segments of actual performers playing.  5 minutes listening to some psuedo intellectual bilge followed by 2 minutes of part of a song. Keb Mo and G. Love get their performances butchered into 40 second-two minute clips.  This DVD is like AM radio-you never get a full song from anybody.  Forget this and get "Can't You Hear the Wind Howl" 
 I bought that last cd and it SUCKED! The singer sings monotone the whole entire time and doesn't have any variations of tone. The music isn't half bad, it isn't great, but it certainly isn't so good that i can ignore the lame-o singer. its just terrible terrible terrible. if you listen to anything that i say hear this: do not buy this album, you will regret it for all of eternity!  -steve (music master) 
 I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it.  I'm upset.  Any advice 
 We purchased the GoLive software because it promised to do "everything" we could possibly want for our business website  ... we purchased the GoLive book because we needed help figuring out how to make this non-user-friendly software fufill its promises.  The book only covers the simplest of web designs and does NOT go into detail regarding anything that we require. We were very disappointed.  I would only recommend this book or software to those who want a very simple, very generic website 
 I usually read Stephen King for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well. I've read three previous King books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror, doom, and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story.  This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative. And this is exactly what "Insomnia" is. This isn't a spoiler, just the author's note: at the end of the book we read Sep. 10, 1990- Nov 10, 1993- three years in which King took to write this book.  Three years which were evidently wasted.  The other King books I've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification.  "Insomnia's" Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with.  He is strong, kind, has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable. His counterpart Lois Chasse doesn't come across as identifiable. Instead she serves as a  secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with Ralph. King doesn't usually do that with his secondary characters.  Other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable, like Ed and Helen Deepenau, the three bald doctors, and Ralph's numerous confidantes.  Then there's the whole abortion mess. This central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story. Though King does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker (albeit with a tranparently pro-choice slant), it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device.    I gave the book two stars because I am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer's arsenal. The devices were obvious and all thru the reading I asked myself, 'How is King going to get through this?' His weapon of choice was most often Ralph Robert's narration (via third person) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance. It seemed whenever King was in trouble in the story, he would use Ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him. This is a useful tool for a beginning writer, but King used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning.  One last thing, the villians just don't work. They are not frightening, they are not demonic, they are not vicious or malign. Three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors? Their defining characteristics are being small and bald- does that really frighten anyone? The real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness. Then there's the Crimson King, the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a Catfish in one of the most terrible, anti-climactic scenes ever rendered.  I rest my case.               
 Edmund Morris tossed away his reputation as a biographer on the par with the biggest names in the business, indulged himself in an unrealized ambition and made his book on President Reagan into a work of fiction. What was he thinking? And what were his editors thinking? It was hard to get past the slightly goofy/creepy concept of a non-fiction novel where the author intrudes so often into the story, but the secondary and damning fact here is that this is also not a good book at all. Morris says inexplicable things about his subject like when he mentions the clarity of our fortieth President's saliva. What was THAT about? Morris might recover from this, who knows, but my advice to anyone, Reagan fan, history student, lover of fiction, is don't pick up this book because it's not even slightly worth your time 
  Physical labor sucks.  Okay, you know that, I know that, even Paris and Nicole (thanks to their reality show) have gotten it through their puny little brainage, but it's news to Barbara Ehrenreich, whose previous stints as Ph.D earner, activist and writer did not expose her to the grubby working world of dirty hands and aching muscles that most of us have managed to live through.   It's a shame. This could have been such a great book, but B.E.'s got a preconceived agenda (welfare reform is never gonna work!) and an axe to grind (unless we raise minimum wage to 14 bucks an hour!).  To prove her point she goes undercover for the better part of a year, taking entry-level, low-skilled work while staying in expensive short-term housing. Of course, she could of just crunched numbers -"Let's see, 7 bucks an hour times 40 hours, while my pretend rent is $200 a week...carry the zero...nope, can't afford it" - but that would have just given her a puny little 2,000 word article for Mother Jones.  Book deals, on the hand, require more work, more commitment, but think of the royalties, so off she goes, just like Paris and Nicole, to work as a waitress, maid and Wal-Mart associate.  At least until it gets too hard.  B.E.'s got a litany of complaints - my feet hurt, my back hurts, piss tests are demeaning, my boss is a jerk, customers are rude, my back huuuurts - and seems to think that only the minimum wager has to suffer such indignities.  News flash, Barbara!  Every job is stressful in its own way.  I'm a RN and it's a rare day I don't come home feeling like I've been beat with a stick.  I've been verbally abused and cussed out more times than I can remember, and that's just by the docs.  I've been pee'd on, poo'd on, run ragged, and called  "girl" by my stupidvisor (My response: I'm older than you, and I've had sex, and I'm pretty sure you haven't by the looks of you, so, boss, who's the "girl" here, and who's the WOMAN.)  I will admit I get paid significantly more for my putting-up-with-BS than the average Walmartian does for his.  But then again I earned a college degree, I had to pass a difficult competency test and I work under the constraints of my nursing license, for which I had to get fingerprinted and background checked.  So that's why I get paid more than a minimum wager, even though our jobs, probably 97% of the time, are comparable.  I'll give B.E. 2 stars for her writing.   It's smart and witty and at times, she borders on hilarious, especially when she's mocking the minorities and poor that she claims to want to help.  Hey, I didn't say she was compassionate, I said she was funny.    B.E., if you're reading this, consider this angle next time you want to write a book about not getting by.  Write a book about being poor and uninsured.  Write a book about wanting to advance your position in life, but not being able to, because as soon as you take that better paying job or go into business for yourself you'll be kicked off medicaid, and you'll run out of inhalers for your asthmatic kid, and you'll have to listen to him wheeze all night, and when you take him to the charity clinic a week from Tuesday, because that's the only time the retired charity doc can see you, you won't be able to afford the prescription since it's over a hundred bucks for one inhaler, so then you have to quit your job so you can qualify for medicaid.  Then when you're done with that, write another book, this time about the lack of decent public transportation in the majority of the U.S., and how this results in needing a car to survive, which leads to excessive personal income spent on cars, more tax money spent on roads and highways, to say nothing of the hidden costs of car accidents and obesity from driving everywhere because it's too dangerous, with all the cars on the road, to ride a bike.  Those books would be worth reading.   
 To quote Matt Ruff in Sewer, Gas & Electric: Joan met Archie Kerrigan in November of '03 while researching a position paper on federal regulation of the genetic engineering industry.  Kerrigan was an Arkansas-born conservative, a tongue-in-cheek, right-wing iconoclast whose favorite sport was teaching stupid pet tricks to the hounds of the Lefty God.  He'd first gained notoriety after a correspondent to the Harvard Crimson accused him of "oppression symbolism" for flying a Confederate battle flag from his dorm room window. Progressive students mobilized quickly to express their outrage and demand the flag's removal only to be caught flatfooted when, at the height of their candlelight vigil, a passing political science major pointed out that Kerrigan's racist Confederate flag was actually a British Union Jack.  A photographer for National Review just happened to be on hand to catch the red-faced squirming that followed; Rolling Stone columnist P. J. O'Rourke joined in the heaping of ridicule a couple of weeks later with a piece titled "Bean Town's Culturally Illiterate Elite: Why Johnny Can't Tell Grits from a Crumpet."  Suspecting--a tad late--that they'd been set up, the flag-bashers reexamined the Crimson letter that had sparked their protest in the first place.  It was signed "A.K."  This bit of entrapment alone had earned Kerrigan a reserve spot in the lowest circle of Lefty Hades.  Hellbound or no, though, Archie was a crack biochemistry major with inside knowledge of the gene-splicing-for-profit business: he'd worked two summers for PhenoTech, a genetic engineering firm currently being sued by the city of Boston for gross criminal negligence.  Joan thought he would be a perfect background source--or devil's advocate--for her paper.  But when she went to look him up, she found the hallways outside his room jammed solid with angry women singing "We Shall Overcome."  "What blasphemy did he commit this time?" Joan asked.  "Andrea Dworkin," the song leader told her.  "Kerrigan's filed a complaint to block her from speaking on campus next week, and they say that he's threatening to do the same thing if Alice Walker tries to come in December."  "What kind of complaint?  How can he block someone from speaking at a university?"  "It's the new Sensitivity in Debate Ordinance that the Harvard Executive Student Council enacted in closed session last Thursday," a second singer chimed in.  "It bars students from hosting lecturers whose presence may create an overtly hostile environment for any ethnic, gender, physical challenge, or sexual orientation group, or other oppression category."  "Kerrigan," said a third singer, "is claiming that an appearance by Dworkin would create a hostile environment for white male heterosexuals."  "And what genius thought up this Sensitivity Ordinance in the first place?"  Joan asked.  "I did," the song leader said.  "It's an important step in the evolution of progressive society, but Kerrigan's action is a total subversion of the Ordinance's intent."  "Well, intent notwithstanding, if you got this beast enacted then Kerrigan is technically within his rights. Andrea Dworkin does create a hostile environment for white male heterosexuals; it's part of what makes her so interesting.  Of course a man who's read her essay on penile infibulation as street justice might not see it that way...."  "But the Ordinance is meant to safeguard tolerance by empowering students from oppressed groups.  White male students aren't oppressed."  "But if you make them the only group that can't censor hostile viewpoints, they are oppressed."  "Look," the song leader said, "you obviously just don't get it.  If any group can veto speakers they find threatening, even speakers with the correct point of view, then pretty soon there won't be any speakers left at all.  That sort of indiscriminate use of the Ordinance renders it worthless."  "We might even have to repeal it," the second singer added.  "By the way," said the third singer, jabbing an incisor-manicured finger at the rectangular bulge in Joan's hip pocket, '"don't even think of smoking in here.  It's antisocial behavior and we won't stand for it. 
 Though well written.  Mr Strobel's 'Case for Christ' cannot be logically concluded since all of his sources come either from the Bible itself, which indirectly Strobel is also making a case for, and people who are unabashedly Christian.  It is like attempting to prove the existence of god by saying that the bible says he exists.  Then when questioned on the validity of the bible we say it is valid because it is the word of god.  Strobel tries to make a case by stating biblical sources when in essence that is the very thing he is trying to make a case for.  Including other secular non-christian sources that provided validity for his claims would have helped his case tremendously.  As it was it didn't prove anything to me other than Mr. Strobel is a believer.  Good for him. 
 Not really sure if this is a good workout or not.  Be carefull when buying this DVD.  I bought this DVD twice from Amazon and both times instead of sending me Sculpt & Tone, which I ordered and in which my invoice specifically stated, they sent me Step & Tone.  I have now placed my order for Sculpt & Tone from Gilad's official website.  I paid a little bit more, but I am sure they will get the order right.  I usually have good service with Amazon but with buying this DVD the service has been poor.  I am still hopeful though that this will be a great workout.  I know the other DVD's I have of his, Step Aerobics, The New Best of Bodies In Motion, and Step & Tone are all awesome!  D    
 What about Once upon a time in America, The Untouchables,Cape Fear, Men of Honor, The Godfather, Taxi Driver and 15 Minutes?    I would have purchased this collection in a heartbeat if it included his best work. The films in this collection are good, but does not reflect his all of DeNiro's most popular performances (with the exception of Goodfellas).   This collection is like qualifying for the olympics.  A little taste of what you can do before you collect the gold metal. Analyze This should have been in a comedy pack along with Meet the Parents and Raging Bull.  Wag the dog, although ok, should have been left out 
 Have been using this for a couple of days now and sorely disappointed. If you move the compass (of your own choice or it falls off the windshield), you need to recalibrate it. I've been sitting at stop lights and seen a 10º swing of direction. I have no intention of keeping this because of its lack of user friendliness 
 The ending was the same as so many other books along the same line that I was sorely disappointed. Especially because there were many opportunities for it to turn into something a little less predictable. A saving grace was CJ Critt's narration. )I listened to BOT). It almost made the characters interesting. This was my first Carlotta Carlyle mystery and probably my last 
 The canopy bar broke only two days after Christmas.   Now I have a sharp end on the bed frame.  Not good for little fingers.  For the price, I thought it would have been a lot more sturdy 
 I wore Gold toes years ago and remember them as very high quality durable socks.  I discontinued using them because i started wearing  different styles than the crew/white/standard. Now after trying these fluffies i think i remember why i stopped liking the gold toes. perhaps they sold the co. or came under new management. in anyt case these socks have no stretch in the elastic, making them basically worthless. yippee 
 This album for sure sounds live.There apparently were no studio touchups.The way a live album is supposed to sound.But the songs selected are for particular tastes only. 
 Crudely written. A negative hero deserves better and Wharton has written some fine books. Sadly, not this one. 
 I expected to find this book stimulating and informative, but came away feeling that Dennett is vastly overrated and quite ordinary in his thought process, logical skills, and writing.  This book does not explain or offer a theory on -- as its title promises -- what consciousness is; it merely offers a lot of random observations on and stories about consciousness.  Dennett seems to start everything he writes somewhere in the middle of a conversation he has been having with himself; he doesn't know how to properly introduce a topic to the reader.  He begins the book not with an overview of his subject or a presentation of a thesis, but with a chapter on hallucinations -- a very specific area of consciousness.  I indulged it with the expectation that it would provide an entry point into a broader argument he wished to advance; instead it was just the first in a random string of narratives.    I suggest that in lieu of Dennett's writings on consciousness, one read John Searle or Robert Ornstein.  Or if you want an engaging, conversational style of writing on the subject, look into Oliver Sacks.   
 My wife wrote the review below, just after we bought our deck of Eker's cards.  We both liked them.  For about two hours.  Then we went to a local office supply store, where one of the stupid little cards fell out of my wife's wallet and she angrily shouted "Oh fine! That's really inspiring!"    Eker really is a shark with no spiritual conscience (try accessing his website without your secret "code"), and the more my wife and I tried to use the cards, the more annoyed we got.  If, after reading this, you still want a deck, check out the "Buy One Used" option here at Amazon.  Our cards are up for bid 
 This is one party I'm glad I wasn't invited to. Celebrity couple Joe (novelist and now director) and Sally Therrian (actress) throw a party to celebrate their 6th anniversary. It's been a rocky marriage with jealousy and petty squabbling. They throw a party with "close" friends, neighbors they are feuding with and a up and coming actress that Sally feels her career threated with. It gets messy as the night goes along and lots is said and done because they are tripping on Ecstasy.   Another the-world-spins-around-me movie. I don't know which would be worse, to have be surrounded by people like them or to be them. 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 Bad. The songs are only okay, and the dances are pretty bad for Fred Astaire. Astaire later said it was the worst movie he ever made. I agree with him 100 percent 
 This album can't hold a candle to thier earlier releases WRECK YOUR LIFE, TOO FAR TO CARE, or HITCHHIKE TO RHOME!  This is alt/country/pop.  Or poop as I like to call it.  Sold the album on ebay!  What happened to the real stuff fellas? 
 Two problems have surfaced using the TIVO unit. The first is the lack of a 5 pin serial port for connection of the tuning cable which causes the use of the funky light attachment at the front of the unit when hooked to a Direct TV box. Sometmes the tuning is inaccurate causing misfires when programs are recorded. The other problem is that internally the TIVO unit looks for a basic cable signal erratically for the second tuner. I have replaced all of the cables with new shielded cables so I know that is not the problem. I am replacing it with a Direct TV DVR. When the TIVO works, it is great, but it is not reliable enough for me 
 While there are many who feel it's not football if its not played indoors and for millions of dollars, I am inclined to  prefer college football, particulary the Ivy League. The history of college football is the history of the Ivy League schools, and it is a riveting and fascinating history. Too bad that this book is so poorly written that it hard to find. It has its moments when you get lost in the history you're reading, but then you're awoken sharply by a mistake - no, not a factual mistake (although it has some of those) but simply a gramatical mistake, or a spelling mistake, or a word where it shouldn't be, or a word missing. Normally I wouldn't care, but the frequency with which I was annoyed by these mistakes was too much to overcome. The material is good, but the author and publisher bring it down 
 Just can't believe that someone ... with that much money could put out a piece of crap like this!! so so disappointing Paul!! we need a direct live show NO FILM! and direct to DVD without 90% of audience... Pauls pretty taken with his old self!! nice dye job 
 First of all, I recommend everyone to read the book in order to have an idea where a lot of modern day values come from.   The book recognizes a problem women (as well as all other humans) have to deal with: how to find fulfillment in life. The problem is that Friedan seems to think this problem only concerns housewives and stay at home moms, and that the problem could be solved by those women getting jobs outside the home. An interesting hypothesis, but judging by today's women, clearly wrong. There are plenty of career women that feel rather unfulfilled.   She describes the problem as women slaving away to keep the house perfectly clean and the kids perfectly taken care of, and then getting depressed as a result. They do this out of a perceived societal pressure. To me, the solution seems to be to check whether this is really what their kids and husband want. In reality, probably no-one cares whether you wash the windows once per week or once per month, so you could spend that time thinking about your values in order to raise your kids as moral individuals, or learning about current events, so that you can actually have a real conversation with your husband, or reading a book for fun.   Getting a job because you're feeling unfulfilled trying to outperform Martha Stewart is as much of an escape tactic as becoming an alcoholic. Being a teacher is as much "living through others" as being a mother is. Shuffling papers around like people with average office jobs doesn't intrinsically give any more fulfillment than making a healthy meal for your spouse and kids does.  The book did some good in promoting equal rights for men and women, but also caused a harmful movement that indoctrinates modern girls and women that the *only* path to fulfillment is through employment, which is clearly nonsense. Housewives and mothers can be really valuable to society, which can give them a strong sense of fulfillment.  Aside from the above, the research Friedan did to back up her point was rather bad and biased, with frequent misuse of statistics. A list of factual errors and omissions in her book is listed on this website:  cf.en.cl  In conclusion, the book is important as a historical document, but has to be approached with extreme caution. One could call it propaganda.  - 22yo housewife and part-time science/engineering majo 
 Saddam Hussein has posed the United Nations (U.N.) with its greatest test since the Korean War. Security Council Resolution 687 may have mandated that Iraq eliminate its chemical and biological weapons programs and curtail its ballistic missile capability, but Saddam has treated U.N. weapons inspections with disdain, routinely preventing full, unfettered access, and finally, in 1998, refusing to comply altogether.  Deaver, academic coordinator at the Civic Education Project in Russia, correctly identifies international diplomacy's failure to limit Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program as worthy of study. Rather than analyze the history of the inspections regime or detail the U.N. Special Commission's success and failure, however, he examines power relationships, resistance, and the applicability of academic theory.  Disarming Iraq begins with a succinct overview of Iraq's weapons programs and the international response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait (though his summary does little more than regurgitate Anthony Cordesman's uneven work). However, some of Deaver's subsequent speculation is curious. Who outside the sheltered world of academe would state that Saddam objected to chemical and biological weapons disarmament out of fear of being left defenseless in a tough neighborhood? (The Iraqi army retained its sizeable conventional forces and those ballistic missiles with under 150-kilometer range.)  Deaver then examines the monitoring duel between Iraq and the U.N., relying almost entirely on U.N. documents and granting them a legitimacy possible only from someone who has never observed U.N. fieldwork firsthand. Analyzing U.N. monitoring in isolation, Deaver fails to consider how the U.N.'s willingness to compromise encouraged Saddam's widespread obstruction. For example, in May 1996, the U.N. and Baghdad agreed to a memorandum of understanding diluting the substance of Security Council resolutions to enable the oil-for-food program. Iraqis who I interviewed repeatedly pointed out that if the U.N. responds to Saddam's obstruction by reducing his obligations, then Saddam will simply increase obstruction with regard to the weapons program the U.N. holds most dear.  Also missing in Deaver's study is any attention to Saddam's trade politics. It is no secret that Saddam directed billions of dollars in oil-for-food contracts to France, Russia, and key Arab states in exchange for Paris, Moscow, Cairo, and Damascus turning a blind eye to unrestrained erosion in sanctions.  Disarming Iraq is an example of academic self-absorption that provides little satisfaction to real-world international relations practitioners. It illustrates the growing schism between university and practical politics. Theory should never substitute for on-the-ground research.  Middle East Quarterly, Winter 200 
 This album is way overated, let me tell you why.  Wack MC: MF Doom is a bad rapper, not the worst, just bad. He can flow but his rymes are weak, corny, and somtimes it doesnt make sense at all. The corniest ryme I heard was- "We rock the house like rock 'n roll/ got more soul Than a sock with a hole." LMAO! It gets worse "Take it from the Tec-9 holder/ They bit and dont know they neck shine from shinola" What is he talking about??? He is not a genius MC, Nas is, he is even worse than Aesop Rock. Which they rap with words and dont even make any sense.  Filler: This Cd has too much filler, they have like 10 songs that last only 50 secs. Some of them is not even neccasary.  Average Beats: The beats are either average or just sucks. I can make better beats on Fruity Loops. However Track 22 "Rhinestone Cowboy" had the best beat on the entire album. The beat was hot to tell you the truth, but that only gives it one star.  Overall this album sucks, just download "Rhinestone Cowboy" and call it a day. I think Madlib can make good beats its just that he didnt show it here. I dont recommend this album, if you want a good album get Mos Def "Black on Both Sides" It 10x better than this 
 Alton states on his episode titled "Raising the Bar" that he prefers a Boston Cocktail Shaker over traditional ones like this. So if you're willing to spend a few extra dollars you will have a much better shaker 
 I had to read this book for a college class, and it was not what I expected.  I liked "Defender of the Jews" but not the main novella, "Goodbye Columbus.&quot 
 I can't help by not like anything about this movie. The actors seem to be as uninterested in making the movie as I was in watching it.  I returned it so fast it made the cashier dizzy.  Skip this stinker. Trust me.  You'll have more fun at the dentist 
 I read this , but can barely remember what it said. Repetitive, stale, and  not well-written. I bought it for her name because I like the 'Best  American Erotica" books, but won't make that mistake again 
 The Raising Arizona part of the CD is almost exclusively electronic and only one 90 second track of the great banjo that I remember from the movie.  I recommend listening to samples before you buy 
 This is possibly the worst book I have ever read. The book is so repetative. The same event is explained at least three times 
 If you don't know anything much at all about Shakespeare and film and if you like criticism that is almost pure description with little argument or analysis to weight you down, then you'll probably like this book.  For scholars in the field, however, the book will be a major disappointment 
 If you are into the old childrens songs from the 50's, 60's, and 70's (you know the ones: they were played by your kindergarten teacher on a record player)- then this set of 4 disks are for you. Personally, I was hoping for something a little more modern. These all sound like they were recorded directly from a 45LP. Not the highest quality 
 This book has a lot of information in it, however it was information that I already had heard.  There are no really juicy inside stories but if you've heard nothing about the relationships of the actors then you'll like  it.  You can relive every Lucy episode and learn some of the technical  aspects of the show but chances are you know most of what is in this book.   Then again, to some, the pictures of Lucille Ball might be worth the price  anyway 
 Ms. Mayes puts her nose in the air about tourists - and what does she think she is except a tourist with a little more time for her travels than most of the rest of us?  Got news for you, Ms. Mayes - just because you can spend a month in a country when most of the rest of us have a week or 10 days doesn't make you any less a tourist.  And your sneers at your fellow/sister Americans aren't going to win you any more readers in the long run.  On second thought, this level of snotty self-satisfaction and loathing for America and Americans is what I guess I expect from academics these days. 
 Jesus, talk about the little girl crying "wolf." When I picked up this book, I expected to read a truly terrifying tale about how people got sick with a horrifying disease that no one knew/knows how to deal with. What I got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption.   The book starts out promisingly, even if Preston surrenders freely to flowery prose. We're given the account of Charles Monet, one of the first documented cases of the Ebola virus. From there on, Preston gives a description of the virus, what it does, how it does it - the works. Then, he moves on to the Human Component, the cast of characters, so to speak, for the big story.  The big story is, alas, not so impressive. It's a case of an Ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause awful problems to come about, but nothing of the sort happens. Basically, people run around in bio-hazard gear, fret a lot, and monkeys die. In between, Preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about other cases of the Ebola virus, cases of people being infected, "crashing and bleeding out," cases that are a lot more interesting than a shipment of monkeys, unless you're a PETA type.  The worst thing about The Hot Zone is just how self-indulgent Preston is. He starts to novelize his subjects a few chapters into the book, which is a noble idea, but not when they don't die at the end. Basically, he's trying to make you care about these people, and all for naught. And by the time that you're supposed to be truly concerned, you actually WANT them to die, because you're tired of hearing about him describe, in active detail, what they eat in the morning, what they do in the afternoon, and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night. When you're addressing a subject as fascinating as a Level 4 virus, why are you spending time talking about Nancy Jaax's hands and karate prowess? Moreover, when you've finally gotten to the monkeys, why are you talking about what kind of monkeys they are and how they dwell in the wild? Does anyone really care?  I wish I could say that this book moved me in ways other than to reverse my peristalsis, but I can't. Preston's ornate metaphors that pepper almost every page of this book are tiresome and unnecessary; he had the chance to write a compact little thriller about an averted crisis of global proportions, but he instead chose to "get into the minds" of his subjects. And what a bore that became. There were only two redeeming aspects of this book: one was the description of the African, human Ebola victims, and the other was the description of the virus itself, although, again, both were sabotaged by Preston's inability to write.   If you want to know something about Ebola, go get An Idiot's Guide to Dangerous Diseases and Epidemics. If you're pining for the namby-pambiness of the Human Element, read The Hot Zone. Personally, I like to avoid rereading the Uncle Tom's Cabins of scientific accounting 
 My good sense tells me that writing this book made the Matersons feel better about themselves.  My mind tells me to thank God I never went the way of abuse or criminal activity.  My experience tells me we all have a life story to tell.  Reading this book showed me most of us do not tell our story to make money or a movie.  If the Matersons want money and fame here's some advice:  try fiction or learn how to write without being so self-serving 
 I think that I am clearly insane, but I did not like this book. Everyone else in the world likes this book, but i am the insane person who does not. And I'm NOT sarcastic! I could barly read it a second time. I hated this book. 
 Don't waste your money.  This album is cheesy, sounds like a million other pop rock songs, and is nothing compared to their earlier work.  With Donnie Van Zant and Max Carl on vocals, all I have to say is:  they need the old  lead singer back!  The guitar work is ok, but the classic .38 Special sound  has definitely been lost 
 Having so much enjoyed the first two volumnes in this series, I was not prepared for this turgid list of self improvement. Yes Clive is well read, English and Italian, yes he does know the difference between a Donatello and a Michelangelo, but do we need to know every book he read in the two years, every painting he saw and how it moved him. The simple answer is no. Unfortunately it takes 250 pages to find out. The story of how a drunken extemely funny youth becomes a sober mildly funny old pseud 
 I purchased this DVD hoping it would relay information on coral reefs and the myriad of life living in them.  While the focus of the movie was on the endangerment of the reefs due to global warming, overfishing, etc., most of the movie was spent above the water focusing on the the filmmaker and his wife and their trivial lives.  The imagery was beautiful when they were under the water, but it's only a small percentage of film.  Very disappointing 
   I "enjoyed" viewing this film and seeing "the good guy" win. But, "there must be a better way" to resolve conflicts, "a better way" to punish bad guys,  "a better way to deal with evil" than just go out and kill everyone involved!  We live in a violent world with terrorists and suicide murderers and car bombings and killing our troops in Iraq and The Sunnis killing the Shiites and vice versa, etc..etc.   I always believe there MUST be "a better way" besides everyone killing the other guys.  So, that's what I have against this film.  As for the film itself, I enjoyed the musical theme and the acting of Clint Eastwood and the acting of all the other members of the cast. It is a "good film" except for the violence.   And, yes, "the good guy" does win in the end---I'm happy about that!  And, I enjoyed the photography also.  So, yes, definitely SEE the film but as you do, could you possibly think of "a better way" for resovling issues rather than the violence depicted in this film?  Email:boland7214@aol 
 In his "History of Warfare," John Keegan does not match the mastery that Victor Hanson displays in "Carnage and Culture." Keegan does not convincingly demonstrate that military superiority mirrors larger social, economical, political and cultural practices, which have little relevance to the art and science of warfare.  Keegan is not convincing when he attempts to prove Carl von Clausewitz wrong that war is not the continuation of politics by other means.  Although Keegan's analysis is sometimes interesting, it is mainly anecdotic and bogged down in detail that fails to capture the target audience.     
 last week I bought elastic girl and jack jack to my 3 year old daughter from italy as a gift and came back to turkey.it broke that day.she doesn't have an arm anymore and can not replace it.helen can not even hold jack jack and my daughter is very upset...... 
 I'm a big fan of Hooper's paranormal mysteries and was eagerly awaiting this latest in the series.  However, a FBI agent who is missing her psychic abilities throughout most of the book is not what I was expecting from a Kay Hooper book.  It was hard to get involved with the main characters when so little information was provided, and I found the Satan cult slant boring.   I think the book would have benefited from bringing in one of the agents from her previous books. 
 I found this book to be crude and distasteful.  Mr. Masterton uses many street/slang terms for body parts and sexual acts.  I found the use of such trash language to be demeaning and disgusting.  This book may have some good information, but how can you find it through all the trash. I sent the book back without finishing it, because I found it read more like a trash novel then a self-help book 
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 Hey, Mr. Kearney, let me tell you what I (and alot of other folks) look for in true crime books:  DON'T JUST TALK ABOUT THE TRIAL, GIVE US SOME BACKGROUND INFO ON THE PEOPLE INVOLVED!!!!!  PLEASE! This book barely had any background info on anybody involved in this book.  Instead it went over the night of Devon's murder, and other than a page or two hear and there, straight to the trial.  I disagree with the poster who thought the trial was probably 40% covered, instead I'd place it at about 75%, maybe more. And if that wasn't bad enough, it seemed like in the trial phase certain things were said over and over again. If you're into a blow by blow account of trials you'd enjoy this book.  As for me, I was so stoked to get this book, okay with the first part, started getting a little unhappy towards the middle, and finally I just gave up.  I couldn't even finish it. I don't think I'll ever buy another one of his books 
 I had to read this book for a Multicultural Literature class at my Uni, and, far from being informative, all it did was fill with me a contempt of my own. I am not a racist by any means, but when confronted with such a bitter, snide voice as the one Kincaid displays, I find myself unconsciously getting defensive. When she says, "you are a tourist; you are ugly," I find myself saying, "Fine, I'll keep my money and let you trade with seashells and beads." Kincaid is a master of the self-fulfilling prophecy: she says Antiguans are so oppressed and so downtrodden and so angry, and rather than doing anything to help it, she's exacerbating it by using such a bitter, over-the-top voice.   Other reviewers have stated that the vision of Antigua portrayed is a warped and extremely limited one, biased by Kincaid's apparent small mindedness, and I must confess that I'm glad to hear that. To think that the entire island is solely occupied by bitter people who imagine themselves to be ex-slaves would make me steer clear of the area any time I go on vacation.   Because, yes, I am a tourist. And no, being a tourist does not automatically make anyone ugly, despite what Kincaid's bitter rant might say. 
 If you are looking for Government regulated information, then you will find it in this book. I was looking forward to reading this book and learning from it, yet I find myself more than disappointed. Her views on natural medicine, herbs, and the like are far from enlightened or open. She has a dim view of anything not viewed from "scientific research". This book reminds me of the government propaganda in the 50's and 60's. I honestly would like to rate this lower, but the scale doesn't allow it. I will be glad to rid myself of this book 
 For the price this book is a huge waste of money. It seems like it was rushed out with no regard to all the errors, disorginization, etc, in the book. It's just a rehash of commonsense and information that is readily available on the internet for free. 
 Some years ago, a brazilian lend this book to me.It's a small and concise book.In fact the only quality of this bad book is his small size. All the rest are ridiculous Castro's propaganda. Well, I'm an (unemployed) brazilian agronomist.I must tell you that Cuba has nothing to teach about agriculture.In fact Castro's Cuba is, a complete agriculture failure.The big Cuba's crop is sugar.Well, in 1912, Cuba produced more sugar then in 2003,2004 and 2005. Cuba's experimente with organic agriculture was and is a failure.In fact, in Cuba, the general people has no flowing water, eletricity,etc. Outside privileges and money support to latin american marxists, Cuba's money goes to propaganda.And this is pure castrist propaganda. 
 As is generally the case, Dr. Laura directs her criticism/suggestions directly at her readers/listeners: "get your own act together and your life will fall into place."  There is, of course, a lot of wisdom in this.  Before making a laundry list of complaints about how other people are letting you down in your life, you probably should examine your own shortcomings.  This can definitely help put things into perspective (i.e., "yes my husband is insensitive and aloof, but maybe my constantly criticizing him isn't helping").  Dr. Laura goes on to give some decent advice on how women can improve their marriages: be friendly and cheerful with your hubby rather than bitchy and resentful, don't let yourself go to pot (keep your weight down and dress nicely), don't withhold sex.  Yes, your spouse will probably will be in a better mood if you are cheerful, look nice and eagerly welcome his sexual advances.  According to "the doctor" men are "simple creatures" (give them food and sex and they are happy), it's women who are chronically dissatisfied, constantly complaining and impossible to please.  She claims that the situation is made worse by the feminists who are always telling women falsehoods like: "men oppress women," "women who are housewives are unhappy," "women should seek, and expect sexual equality with men."  Of course, Dr. Laura isn't very clear about who "these feminists" are and she talks about "women's magazines" as if they were the voice of  "the feminists," even though most feminists would probably argue that magazines like Cosmo are more part of the problem than the solution.  There are a lot of women who call themselves feminists and very few see eye to eye on all issues.  However, I think most would agree that feminism is about giving women the opportunity to realize themselves in whatever capacity they choose.  This can mean as a wife and mother, as a professional or as both.  There may be feminists who look down on women who've chosen to be housewives, but there are at least just as many "feminist haters" who impugn women who have sacrificed motherhood in order to pursue dreams that were more important to them.  What's the difference?  Both are guilty of criticizing women who make choices different from their own in order to feel better about their own decisions.  Dr. Laura clearly errs is in her assertion that all women are happier being wives and stay-at-home moms and having a husband who provides for the family.  If this were the case, why did the 1950's (the epitome of traditional family-life) bring on the feminist movement in the first place?  Rather than becoming addicted to Valium or clamoring for more equality, why weren't women simply singing the praises of their wonderfully fulfilling domestic lives?  I think the answer is clear: a lot of women were extremely bored and unfulfilled without the intellectual and social stimulation that a life outside the home can provide.  Also, being economically dependent on another person puts you in a very vulnerable position if you are in a physically and/or emotionally abusive relationship.  It is very true that women today who are juggling careers and family are feeling their own dissatisfactions: they are overworked and feel robbed of time with their families and they feel like the do a disproportionate share of the work in the home. However, I don't think the answer lies in sending ALL women back to the traditional role of housewife.  At least now women have options.  If they decide staying at home and caring for children is the #1 priority in their lives, or that they simply cannot "do it all," then everyone should respect their decision.  If they prefer to juggle work and family or remain childless and free to pursue other ambitions, those are also decisions that should be respected.   Life is complicated and there are no one-size-fits-all answers to life's most important choices.  Dr. Laura tries to support her claim that ALL women REALLY WANT to be stay-at-home moms and cared for by a man with some study that "demonstrates" that partners in marriages that don't follow these traditional roles have higher rates of heart disease.  Rubbish!  You can always dig up some obsolete study to prove any argument you are trying to make.  There are A LOT MORE studies that show that single women are happier than married women (I'm not saying this so, I'm just saying that such studies say nothing about whether or not YOU will be happy in any given situation).  Particularly offensive is what Dr. Laura says about sex.  Essentially she argues that it is women's duty to provide their husbands with sex whenever they want it.  I agree that discrepancies in desire can be a problem in a marriage and that women should not make a habit of casually dismissing their husbands' sexual attentions.  However, there are "reasons" why many women are not as interested in sex as their husbands, the biggest one being that they are not getting the kind of sexual stimulation they need in the bedroom.  But, "the doctor" makes no mention of this.  She advices women to service their husbands and act like they are loving it ("men like to think that they are good lovers").  What about a little more communication?  What about telling your partner what you like?  What about some compromise?  No, according to the Dr. Laura, sex is what you give your husband in exchange for his ultimate sacrifice: his marrying you.  She even goes so far as to remind women that in some states we are legally obliged to do so (does she want to put women who don't behind bars?).  I guess on this issue I am "idealistic": sex should be something that is mutually satisfying for both men and women.  Life is probably more complicated for the modern woman, but this does not mean that it is worse.  In fact, I would argue that women have it better now than they have at any time in history.  Turning back the clock to a "simpler time" may seem like an appealing solution to today's overworked and highly-stressed women, but I sincerely doubt that it would provide any lasting satisfaction in most women's lives.  Women, as individuals, must decide for themselves what lifestyle is most gratifying.  The path Dr. Laura suggests is only one of many that "can" lead to a healthy, rewarding life 
 I am a huge fan of Ms Morrison. IMO she should have won a Pulitzer for "The Bluest Eye". But I find her increasingly difficult to understand. Beginning with "Beloved", Ms. Morrison novels have taken on a mystical quality that bewilder and confuse me. Often I have to go back and re-read pages to find out which character is speaking or remembering or dreaming or what. I gave up on this one somewhere in the middle. I am now plowing through "Love" in which she uses the same tactic and it's a guessing game. I really wish she would return to her earlier style as exhibited in "The Bluest Eye", "Sula" and "Song of Solomon".  
 Director of two `Scooby-Doo' films makes another comedy without the eye-popping CGI of the funny talking dog, and now what you get is `Yours, Mine, and Ours,' a remake of 1968 comedy that should have been left untouched. The only good thing about the newer version is the kids (and some of them would be seen in a much better film sooner or later), so if you a fan of, say, Dean Collins, please stop reading this review here, take a look at the film and enjoy yourself.  But I'm talking about the film itself, and Dennis Quaid & Rene Russo, and what I am going to say is not very nice. To their credits, they truly look like two adults Frank and Helen, widowed Coast Guard Admiral and widowed designer, who had been romantically linked to each other when high school students. Their story is sweet, romantic and convincing. Sadly their story ends in five minutes.  The rest of the film is about the predictable culture clash comedy between two sets of values with lots of badly-constructed pratfalls. Frank is an uptight military person while Helen is a free-thinking vegetarian. Frank has 8 children while Helen 10 (including the adopted kids). Frank demands his home should be `shipshape' while Helen wants her kids always `free.' So what would happen if they live in a same place?  One of the two terrible things about `Yours, Mine, and Ours' is its awfully made slapsticks which are just embarrassing to see. If you think it funny to see someone slipping over vomit on a yacht, or Dennis Quaid soaked in green slime, this is your film. And you can also see Mr. Quaid kissing a pig. Rene Russo is not the same sexy woman you have seen in `The Thomas Crown Affair,' but her stand-in who looks very tired.  But the most annoying thing is the characters of the kids (or what they do). These spoiled children are not only allowed to eat a bucketful of sweets, but they plan to break up the relations between Frank and Helen just because they want to live as they want! Of course they relent after getting what they want, and cue to the sappy ending.  This messy and unfunny comedy comes from four big names - MGM, Paramount, Nickelodeon and Columbia. The images are crisp, and shot in widescreen. Despite its beautiful package, however, none of the cast would like to remember the film and its contents that are simply dreadful 
 Mr. Rushkoff...what were you reading? The view you hold of the Scriptures, of Kadosh texts founded on revelation, and study..The Torah--the Navim - the Writings- seems to be another one than we have had as a people for these thousands of years. I can not recommend this book 
 We were led to believe that this book was geared for children because of the trading cards included.  However, the subject matter is crude and offensive on many pages.  I would definitely not recommend this book for children.  I also think that the contents reflect the downward spiral in our culture and therefore, would not recommend it for adults either 
 dispatches is boring. herr read too much kerouac and obviously writes stoned, as other reviewers said. the result: when you read this you think "what a wasted opportunity". it may be herr's version of vietnam, but it's so personal and biased that it can't really be considered a work of art.  in between the lines he seems to say that he has endured vietnam - and there's no doubt about it - but in what capacity? as a reporter?  this is an important theme in the second half of the book, and herr gets completely lost in his ramblings. he also wants to tell us that vietnam is a hell, but the reader doesn't feel it's hell. one only feels boredom. it's almost like herr is saying, "forget it, I can't express on paper what vietnam was". So, why write this? (herr co-wrote the script of apocalypse now and full metal jacket and probably contributed the boring parts). the book fails as a memoir and it also fails as a historical log - which we all know it's not. could this book be succesful?: yes. if it had a structure, if herr didn't waste time on stupid details, if he wasn't so egocentric, if the rhythm was improved.  contrast: the movie platoon is much, much better. or the deer hunter. those works capture hell. this book doesn't 
 This is one of the worst books ever, don't buy it 
 The most interesting part of "Uncle" Walter's book, nay, the only interesting part of this flimsy self-serving memoir, is the former CBS (as in "see BS") anchorman's statement that to avoid WWIII, "a system of world order--preferably a system of world government--is mandatory." He also speaks of "social and political and economic evolution, which will explode with such suddenness as to have the character of revolution." He adds that "the revolutionary forces are already at work today, and they have humankind's dreams on their side." Revolutionary forces? I thought he just said it would "have the character of revolution" but would, in fact, be an "evolution." Get your facts straight, newsboy.  Of course, I haven't heard about these "revolutionary forces" on the network news, and neither has anyone else. But then Walter and his fellow news reporters in the mainstream media are not and have never been reporters. They're propagandists, making and shaping the news according to the dictates of their corporate owners. If those elitists can benefit from a war, Walter and company will beat the drums so the American people will go along with it. As for that "world government," Walter promotes it because he's a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and other New World Order groups who are, indeed, the "revolutionary forces" of whom he speaks. They're forcing their "revolution" on a world that doesn't want it, and the beast of the Bible's book of revelation will rule the one world government of which he speaks. And he knows it, too! Like most CFR members, and like all those who are promoting the New World Order, Cronkite is an occultist whose broadcasting career was all voodoo, a way to cast spells--broadly--on the viewers to prepare them mentally for the godless dictatorship that is soon to come.  Uncle Walter is going to Hell, kids. Weeping shall be there and the gnashing of teeth. Don't forget the Poligrip, grampa 
 I agree with Michael Agostino's comment below. I think all of their holiday specials (Halloween, Christmas, and Easter) should be in one collection together. I would sort it this way:  Disc One: Mad Monster Party Mad, Mad, Mad Monsters Cricket on the Hearth The Mouse on the Mayflower  Disc Two: Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer Rudolph's Shiny New Year Frosty the Snowman Frosty's Winter Wonderland Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July  Disc Three: The Little Drummer Boy The Little Drummer Boy, Book II Nestor, The Long-Eared Christmas Donkey 'Twas the Night Before Christmas The Stingiest Man in Town  Disc Four: Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town The Year Without a Santa Claus The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus Santa Baby! (I know it may not be that good, but it is still from Rankin/Bass)  Disc Five: The First Christmas Jack Frost Pinocchio's Christmas The Leprechaun's Christmas Gold  Disc Six: Here Comes Peter Cottontail The First Easter Rabbit The Easter Bunny is Comin' To Town Bonus Features  Each special would be in its original version as it was first aired on television. However, I would keep Frosty Returns and The Legend of Frosty the Snowman out of this collection. This could be a best-seller for Rankin/Bass!    
 I'm only partway through this, so bear with me... The basic structure of the book so far is: XXX happens in Harry Potter's world.  Here's some real-life science that is tangentially related...   Here are some examples:  "Wizards are able to teleport or 'aparate', sometimes using portkeys, like Harry when he won the Triwizard Cup.  Maybe portkeys function by creating wormholes in the space-time continuum.  Or maybe they make use of technology used by real-life scientists who have 'teleported' a photon from one side of a lab to the other.  Such technology will probably never be able to teleport a whole person."  "Wizards at Hogwarts are sorted into houses by the Sorting Hat.  It must read thoughts somehow.  Real-life scientists can use functional magnetic resonance imaging to see what is happening in the brain when a person thinks.  Scientists aren't at the point yet where they can read thoughts like the Sorting Hat, and they may never be able to."  "After the wizards are sorted into houses, how does that society function, given that the young wizards of Slytherin House tend to be evil, including Voldemort, the evilest of evil wizards?  Real-life economists use something called 'game theory' to describe similar situations.  A classic example is the Prisoner's dilemma.  Imagine that Professor Dumbledore catches Harry and his archrival Malfoy's chum Crabbe.  One of them has committed a serious offense that could cost their house points.  He offers each one of them a deal..."  "Owls deliver mail at Hogwarts.  In real life, owls have some amazing senses and abilities.  Owls are not really that smart, but real-life scientists have trained parrots to do some amazing things..."  So basically there are a bunch of things in science that the author thinks are cool, and he uses Harry Potter as an excuse to talk about them.  He does a decent job of describing the science.  But the Harry Potter references are pretty gratuitous.  This could just as easily be "The Science of Star Wars" where Wookie language and society as an excuse to talk about game theory, and Luke's land speeder as an excuse to talk about some sketchy antigravity research 
 As a child I remember finding this magazine at my doctor's office and reading it because it was the only thing available. It has not changed much. There are no redeeming features to make up for the dated and patronizing content. This Magazine will neither stretch your child's mind nor keep him entertained. It only teaches the child what he already knows and feeds him what he has already seen. In the coming era of global connection, children must become aware of other parts of the world and lifestyles alien to them. Only telling them what is already common in their everyday lives helps to foster racism and xenophobia 
 Don't waste your time with this dreck. go get Dan Zevin's "The Day I Turned Uncool: Confessions of a Reluctant Grown-up.&quot 
 Unless you would like previously published commentaries organized thematically in print format or would like to supplement Victor Davis Hanson's income, there is no pressing reason to purchase this book.    Of the 39 articles that comprise the work, 35 are from the National Review Online and can be read for free in their archives.  You could even look at the Table of Contents provided by Amazon.com and then do a search for the related articles in National Review's archives.  Because the book is divided into fairly brief commentaries, there is also quite a bit of repetition.  The Kuwaiti's expulsion of Palestinians is mentioned in three articles, East Coast intellectuals' fear of what Europe thinks of them is in several articles, and strangely enough, Martina Navratilova appears in two.    Whether you agree with Hanson or not (he takes issue with Noam Chomsky, NPR, Europesns, East Coast intellectuals, and the New York Review of Books among others), why pay for what is available directly from the source 
 I guess this is an okay guide if you just want to get the game over with, but why would you waste your time doing that? This guide misses out on so much. I've found items on my own that weren't even mentioned in the guide. The bestiary has no organization and it's still missing many monsters/enemies. You can tell that they tried to make it in the order that you'll encounter the enemies, but many of them can be found before and many of them aren't even listed at all. The weapons, items, and materials information at the end is not detailed enough. "Side Areas" lacks organizations and it isn't very helpful. Where is the help on Enemy Skills? On the walkthrough section, they don't even tell you the right buttons most of the time (not that you need it, though). The numbering/lettering system gets a little bit confusing. A lot of their "strategies" are based on the same party that they like to use. Not everyone likes to use Aeris, especially if they have played the game before. I could go on and on but I don't want to bore you. On a side note, the PC version (black and white, I can't find it anywhere anymore) by the same author was so much better. Everything that this guide lacked was in the PC version (except for color, but they made that up by having color maps and stuff in the back) 
 I skimmed through this truckling tome last night and was delighted to encounter more run-on sentences than I have read in the entirety of the past two months.  Run-ons are a favorite of mine. Less impressed was I with how the good Professor Lesch covered Mr. Asad and modern Syria.  I picked up the book at my local Books-a-Million in the hopes of learning more about Syria.  Beyond a reminder of the percentage of Alawites in the country, I didn't learn much at all.  In fact, I think the "take-home message" is that the author is madly in love with his subject, at least in that intellectual manner that some academics evince for their specialties.   An ancillary message from the book is that the Bush Administration is incompetent and may have ruined modern Syria's chances of joining the rest of the world.  This, despite the noble efforts of the fine Arabists at the State Department to convince the Bush Administration of the errors of its Zionist, neo-conservative ways.   And, of course, Syria and its goofy-looking Lion King have absolutely nothing to do with the insurgency in Iraq.  Proof of this, in Lesch's curiously contorted synapses, lies in the Bush Administration's refusal to provide the Syrians with US intelligence on the insurgency.  I mean, if I were in charge of US intelligence, I would certainly let my enemies know exactly what I know about their activities.  That'd show 'em! In "The New Lion," Professor Lesch successfully surmounts his often-faltering mastery of idiom and sentence structure to scale the pinnacle of that renouned and beloved genre, the fluff bio.  If this work contains criticism of Assad, as the author repeatedly claims, I would certainly hate to to read a book that's full of paeans. Then again, if I'm ever a slightly bloodthirsty tyrant with a genocidal streak, maybe Lesch could polish some apples for me.  I think I'd choose someone with better writing skills, though 
 I hate Bright Eyes just a little bit more.  Bob Dylan he ain't 
 Many of the articles in this collection haven't withstood the test of time -- a mere three years.  The reason is an unrealistic view of patents and other IP as financial assets, without any regard for where their value comes from. In industry, for example, a naked patent license (i.e., without accopmpanying know-how) usually only has defensive value against a possble lawsuit. It has little enabling value for someone who wants to learn how to practice the invention.   However, this bit of reality doesn't prevent some authors from fantasizing about stock exchange-style markets for IP. These haven't materialized. Similarly, most (perhaps all) of the Internet-based IP exchanges that sprung up during the dot-com era have failed to survive to the present, at least under their original business model.  Another area that's way beyond reality is the discussion of securitization of IP assets. The original deal of this type -- the famous "Bowie Bonds" deal of 1997 -- was downgraded to junk status in late 2004. In 1997 who knew about Internet file-sharing?   Nonetheless, in 2002 one of the authors in this book claimed that there would be $500 BILLION of these securitization deals by 2005. (You might need to look on the Internet for this, I don't think it's in the book: search for Licent Capital, and you'll find this prediction quoted in an article by Deloitte & Touche, among other places.)   The actual market in late 2004, was around 0.1% of the prediction -- and actually less, since the market was comprised mainly of purchases (i.e. assignments) of royalty streams, not securitization. Moreover, that activity was mainly in the biopharma area. If you think this is less risky than David Bowie royalties, just recall the withdrawal of Vioxx and certain other painkillers from the market earlier in 2005.  Finally, if you do buy this book, just try this experiment (especially regarding Part 4, the most financially-oriented section): try finding the homepages of the various authors' companies. Good luck 
 It's not too difficult to understand how "Behold a Pale Horse" has become "the best selling underground book of all time"(according to a blurb on one pro-Cooper website)--after all, people want to(and do) believe in outlandish things. The problem with the late Bill Cooper's book is that it damages any serious attempt to examine the reasonable premise that every aspect of world affairs is controlled by a handful of wealthy, powerful men. Cooper believed this, Cooper was a nut...therefore it follows that everyone who agrees with the basic hypothesis is a nut, too. Rightly or wrongly, this is what people believe. (If you're looking for a serious treatment of this subject, albeit from the POV of someone who thought it was a good thing, take a gander at Carroll Quigley's monumental "Tragedy and Hope".) To all the "if you can't handle the truth, don't read this book!" reviewers who know little to nothing about Bill Cooper: I invite you to do a Google search on the man and acquaint yourselves with another truth, the real truth. Milton William Cooper was a certifiable headcase. Numerous former friends and acquaintances have described him as a hard-drinking, ill-tempered, violent man who was incredibly easy to fool. Cooper's contention that John F. Kennedy was killed by William Greer, the driver of his limo in Dallas, is of course well-known...but he also believed, and told audiences at his lectures, that the aliens on the Fox television show "Alien Nation" were real aliens. He wasn't kidding. Cooper would hear or read an outlandish tidbit of information, then take it--and repeat it!--as gospel. Fellow "fringe" writers and researchers like Bob Lazar shunned Cooper after he accused them of being government agents who were out to discredit him. There was, of course, no need for anyone else to discredit him: he took care of that himself. Nowhere in this rambling patchwork quilt of a book(mostly documents and articles from other sources, really, with a comment here and there by Cooper himself) is there a shred of proof to back up his extraordinary claims. Cooper made no attempt to verify the info he included, and it would have been impossible to do so in almost every instance, anyhow.   I'll go on record as saying that I believe the circumstances of Cooper's death were suspicious. I feel badly for the man because he came to such an ignoble end, and because his affection for his wife and daughter is so evident in the foreword to "Pale Horse". This was a human being with real feelings...but he was very, very disturbed. There are countless other books which examine this subject more rationally; so many that "Behold a Pale Horse" should NEVER become any conspiracy theorist's bible.     
 This book is fun for people who want to read a work of total fiction. However, for people who care about accuracy it is full of misinformation that does a disservice to readers who don't know any better. The sad thing is that there is good data out there, lots of it, especially on the Maya see Linda Schele's and David Fredel's "Maya Cosmos" and Barbara Tedlock's "Time and the Highland Maya," for example. Why do people who should know better write such stuff? And, perhaps more importantly why does anyone publish it? 
 I bought the book in the airport and started reading it during the 8 hours flight. I could not believe that such an uninteresting and painfully slow paced novel was a bestseller...I forced myself through the first 30 pages...but that was it. I just left it in the airplane.Maybe later got more interesting,I woudn't know that. But what I read was just plain awafull. Now that I look at the amazon's reviews...they are not so bad......makes me very cautious about reviews in the futur 
 inconsequential jargon  This pseudo-philosophical work is long, insubstantial and boring. The author tries to hide his sterility by avoiding the very basic and fundamental social and human problem, the problem of universal injustice. One wonders why on earth someone should attempt such a work! The title itself betrays the author's philosophical incompetence: "A Theory of Justice." Hasn't he read Plato? Doesn't he realize that justice is not a theory, but in fact practice? What on earth is a theory of justice, which cannot be put to practice? Right at the beginning of his book Rawls insists on a "veil of ignorance" in order to have fairness to start with.; that is plunging into a book, which has nothing give, which can do nothing to change the world we live in. We are not blind. We know too well that there can be no justice in a society whose members are not blind and deaf, and know too well that there are differences separating individuals. How can anyone insist on capitalism, annual growth and availability of goods for all when the world is limited and the earth with its limited natural resources cannot sustain unchecked human growth? And what is more, he can never define what good are, which must be available to everyone. Is raw materialism justice? Are we chickens in a coop, absolutely predictable? The author should have examined the history of philosophy a little more carefully, which is nothing other than a series of failures in putting the cart before the horse, that is theory before practice.  Haven't we learned the lesson from communism and its disastrous results? Marxism too was an elaborate theory, but in reality turned out to be a gross injustice to all. Is the unquestioned democracy the final truth? Before embarking on another long, empty and pretentious "theory" without foundation a thinker should make him/herself well acquainted with human nature. It is too bad that this jargon is often taught at colleges and universities, forcing nave students read this book, discuss it, and even worse, write term-papers on it. For those who wish to have a clear-cut understanding of social problems and a sound theory of justice I recommend Plato's Republic.  Academic jargon is not philosophy. 
 Colorless and high priced, though I bought it at the book store for 88.00.  Sections are laid out poorly, but key words and ideas a pre-highlighted. About the same information given in any material science book, just  different layout 
 Unbelievably bad.  The author is suffering from terminal paranoia.  He believes that the media suffered irreparable damage during the Gulf War because they didn't have access to all the information they wanted from the military.  It doesn't occur to him that the media, with their blatant liberal slant, can't be trusted to handle information and report it responsibly.  This is the same  who thinks that Ted Turner is "courageous" - the same bigoted Ted Turner who's been nailed time and again for hypocrisy.  Lastly, MacArthur has virtually no technical academic or professioanl credentials to make many  of the satements he does regarding military technology.  His assessment of weapons such as those used in the Gulf War is pathetically inept.  Don't waste your money.  You can become better informed by reading a Tom Clancy novel 
 What's wrong with all you Amamzon reviewers?  I actually quite liked Shutter Island but this was total garbage. The morose tone is totally overdone throughout, and the end is pathetic. The interesting situtation setup in the first chapter is never satisfyingly integrated with the rest of the story.  Avoid 
 I thought I could save money by printing some photos on this less expensive matte photo paper.  Big mistake.  Quality is so poor that   I'm ready to just dump it.  Can't figure what else to use it for. 
 Professor Ellis is a very intelligent man, but he plays fast and loose with the facts, and sometimes he uses his gift for writing prose in ways that mislead the reader especially in, American Sphinx.  Ellis has obviously covered all of the ground with regard to what is known about Jefferson--but he doesn't objectively present all of the factual scholarship existing about our 3rd President.   If you want to know more of the detail of what was all involved with Sally Hemings, you MUST read Douglass Adair's essay "The Jefferson Scandals."  This essay is found in the book: Fame of the Founding Fathers: Essays by Douglass Adair.  Published by W.W. Norton.  Sally Hemings was the daughter of Jefferson's father-in-law; and Sally's lover was not T.J. but T.J.'s nephew (his sister's son).  That's why Jefferson never talked about the "scandal" because his close family relatives were involved; however, not the way Prof. Ellis says.  The unfortunate fact is that Prof. Ellis mentions Douglass Adair in American Sphinx, but he never mentions Adair's research (which Ellis cannot reasonably be ignorant of) on the alleged Sally Hemings-Thomas Jefferson liason.  It's obvious from American Sphinx that Ellis has read Adair's essays.  Prof. Ellis must know that the best evidence exonerates Thomas Jefferson, but he never tells us about that. The well publicized DNA test does NOT prove TJ was the father of any of Hemings' children.  TJ never fathered any children with Hemings and Ellis knows it. Prof. Ellis is intellectually dishonest on this point, and on many other points of Jefferson's life.  Too bad because he would otherwise have written a tour-de-force.  Instead it's a tour-de-FRAUD 
 I found the frequent inconsistency of terminology disconcerting.  There are concept checks,  while helpful are necessry because the authors have trouble explaining key concepts.  Not intending to be spiteful,  the  authors could gain a lot from reading Strunk and Whites book.  The author  has the need to write clearly and directly.  Insufficient explanation of  key concepts 
 I purchased Eldredge's "Wild at Heart", and I didn't think it was scripturally sound. I was given "Waking the Dead" as a present, so I tried to read it as well. I finally gave it up.   John Eldredge's writing is typical of today's movement to bring the world into the church. Trying to show a young Christian the religious aspects of movies like "The Matrix" may work, but to my 48 year old ears it rings very hollow. Perhaps it boils down to how much you will dilute Christ's message to get people to listen. For better or worse, I have little patience for it.   The author also presents the image of God as "my friend". To me this is nothing but another watering down of the Gospel message to get the world to accept it. Giving the Creator human attributes brings Him down to a level where we can work things out between us. I can't find that kind of relationship in any legitimate Bible translation. After all, my friend wouldn't let my saintly mother die, and save a worthless drug addict now would he? God my friend probably wouldn't have sent His Son to die for my worthless self anyway.   This is exactly the same theology as building the largest "Christian" church in the United States, and not putting any crosses in it so as not to "offend anyone". It's the same as getting on a nationally televised program, and stuttering about whether you believe those who don't accept Christ are doomed to hell. When you profess to be a Christian minister or author and you can't speak correctly of what Christianity teaches, it's time to examine just what you really believe. God's word is not always easy to swallow. Either it's the truth or it isn't.   Mr. Eldredge also speaks often of "setting hearts free". While I do believe hearts are free when released from sin, a Christian is bought and paid for with Christ's blood and not "free" at all. Titus 1 (KJ) begins, "Paul, a servant of God,and an apostle of Jesus Christ"...Christians ARE freed, but to begin a life of service.   For a more accurate and fulfilling study, I recommend "The Way of the Master" books and videos by Ray Comfort/Kirk Cameron.  
 I don't know why anyone would buy this book when you can get the catalog for free. All it does is tell you to buy the stuff at Pottery Barn and how to use it - like we don't already know how to use a bookcase?? Don't waste your money 
 I bought this book immediately after we found out I was pregnant and was really expecting it to be "the guide" to pregnancy.  Basically, it gives pretty accurate and complete information, but every time I pick it up, I am quite turned off by the condescending tone (i.e. if you eat a slice of white bread with butter, vs. whole grain with nothing, you are probably not fit to be a mother sort of notion).  This book doesn't even make me feel guilty...just irritated that an authority on the subject could be so demeaning.  As a first time mom, I would advise you NOT to get this book.  I know I am not alone either because every time I see used pregnancy books for sale or for free, it is among them.  Many of my pregnant friends have gotten rid of this book for the same reason.  In terms of getting good info, the internet is great and of course there are many many pregnancy books out there.  It is really unfortunate that this is considered to be "THE" pregnancy book, when it is such a disappointing read.  If you insist on buying this book, check a garage sale or Goodwill.  There you will probaly find an abundance of rejects.  
 I waited six months for the item and never got it.  Go elsewhere 
 This is the worst book in a long time I've tried to read and get a story out of it.  Ms. Steele rambles on for chapter after chapter---and not much of anything happens!!!  It's just plain BORING!  About 1/3 through, the book went into the trash.  After reading Nora Roberts' books, this book is abominable.  It's back to Roberts for me 
 Jeez, maybe I am getting old, but I really found absolutely nothing about this film to be interesting or original in the slightest.    A brilliant scientist.  Disfigured.  Angry.  Finds temporary techie fix for face.  Goes to get bad guys.  Fighting.  More fighting.  Still more fighting.  Ex mate learns he's alive.  He leaves her anyway (he's too ugly).  The end.  More to come, if successful.  Not recommended 
 Wright presents no new information about Al-Qaeda, leaves out plenty of information about Al-Qaeda and neglects the USA side of "the road to 9/11."  Understanding Qutb's radicalization of Islam is important to understanding why Ayman al-Zawahiri and Usama exist and also why they failed at creating theocracies and were lame ducks until the USA found a use for them as an enemy.  What cannot be neglected is the myths spread about the United States by the Neoconservatives and followers of Leo Strauss.  The United States is not a unique and beautiful snowflake.  The liberal idea of individual freedom was decried by Strauss as destructive of the society of the USA and he told his followers to keep the public in line with grand myths about US exceptionalism.  After the the Soviet Union was kicked out of Afghanistan, both Qutb and Strauss' followers believed they were the cause of it.  Since the Cold War the US has been working off of the "friend and enemy" model of policy formulated by Carl Schmitt and 9/11 presented the US with what Schmitt called a "state of exemption."  If you think jihad was the cause of 9/11, ask yourself why Richard Clarke found Bush and his advisors saying find a way to tie this to Iraq hours after 9/11.  See the BBC documentary, "The Power of Nightmares" or "From Secularism to Jihad: Sayyid Qutb and the Foundations of Radical Islamism" by Adnan A. Musallam or the Political Ideas of Leo Strauss by Shadia Drury for a better analysis of Qutb and Strauss than Wright has in his book.  If you prefer to stick with fiction about "the road to 9/11," check out Patrick S. Johnston's novel "Mission Accomplished.

 I am sorry to say that I thoroughly disliked "Of Human Bondage."  I know it is on every must read list for fiction (which is why I decided to read it) however, I just wonder how such a boring story can continually be relegated to such a hallowed position in literature?  Not only did I find it dull but I was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the main character's perception of women!  I'm not a feminist in the least but most of the female characters were described in such pathetic ways.  "Yellow teethed"  "Sallow skin"  "Dirty Hands"  "Tear stained over powdered face", it goes on and on.  I wondered if the author was uncomfortable women?  I looked online for some information about Maugham.  To my surprise I found out that Maugham was bisexual.  He did marry and have a child but for most of his life it sounded like he was involved with men. In no way can I say this substantiates or confirms the tone of the book -- but in some way it answered my question or concern.    Instead of this book I'd recommend the following classics:  Beautiful and Damned by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Madame Bovary by Flaubert.  At least in these books, maybe the female characters are not the most virtuous but the characters are written with such sensuality that even though they might not be described as gorgeous they are brought to life in the pages by the author with a kaleidoscope of words that makes them multidimensional -- good or bad.   
 I bought this book hoping to get clear, technical know-how from its authors.  These other reviewers here helped to solidify my purchase.  What a huge mistake.  Chapter 1 thru 6 are CONSTANT repeating of the same points, over and over.  I swear, chapter 2 is like chapter 1, as are the next few chapters.  How many times do I need to be told about "transitive properties between forests, and compatibility with Windows NT and 2000... "?  I kid you not, many many pages are repetitive. Chapters are repetitive.  Did the proof reader not compare chapters between the various authors and red-line?  It's as if they did not compare amongst each other, if indeed that's how the book got compiled.  Ok... Worse: I think this book is for the human administrative guy who needs to learn some concepts so that he does not appear like a complete idiot when speaking with Network gurus in the coffee lounge.  This book is like trying to help people who know little about Networking to make a plan on how to migrate and create policies that should be enforced, etc.  I feel like I'm in a mixed class of Psyche 101 and Business Relations 202 when reading this.  I have not yet read past chapter 6 but I have definitely skimmed ahead to see of the content seems any deeper and I'm disappointed.  Are there many scanned images of the Windows 2003 Server screens?  No.  Very few.  To me, this is not a book for people who want to know the ins & outs of how to make the OS fly like lightning and all the tips & tricks one comes to expect for a book of this size 
 Sentimental and uninteresting.  Ethan Canin seems to think that the same kind of character is interesting over and over.  And I hear this book was a best seller--no wonder nobody reads good books anymore when this is offered as great literary fiction 
 I'm gonna get some flak for this but I had to get it out: This is probably SLAYER's wrost album. Maybe "wrost" is being a bit too extreme; let's say it is their least inspired. After releasing the thrash masterpiece "Reign In Blood", many fans wondered wher SLAYER would go next. So the band started to flirt with less screamed-out vocals and some slow songs for a change. "South Of Heaven" and the subsequent "Seasons In The Abyss" showed SLAYER maturing AND changing while still being loyal to thrash. The songs themselves became a bit more intricates and the melodies more memorable and even haunting. But drummer Dave Lombardo's exit and a 4 year hiatus made a lot of us fans wondered what was going to happen to the mighty SLAYER. In the interim, Death Metal took over and bands like CARCASS, ENTOMBED, MORBID ANGEL and DEICIDE were determined to steal SLAYER's extreme metal crown. So when their "comeback" album was released, all the progression and maturity shown on their 2 previous albums were flushed down the toilet in favor of a more stripped down sound. "Divine Intervention" tried to bring back "Reign In Blood" tactics along with a few melodies left over from "Seasons...". The album was more like a statement aimed at the new pretenders of extreme metal. This brings us to "Divine's" follow up, "Diabolus in Musica". Forget the frantic, unrelenting thrash of thier earlier albums. Forget the haunting and creepy melodies of "South of Heaven" and "Seasons...". What SLAYER gave us here were probably left overs from "Divine". It is clear that both, King and Hanneman were NOT particularly inspired while writing this album. "Bitter Peace" is an OK opener in typical SLAYER fashion and "Desire" tries to evoke the creepy melodies of "Seasons..." . The rest (and I feel REALLY bad in saying this) is "generic" to say the least. A lot of metal fans give METALLICA a hard time for their musical experimentation but no one dares to say anything bad about SLAYER just because they never turned their amps down. Very few of the riffs you'll hear on "Diabolus in Musica" are particularly memorable and at times I even felt cheated by one of my all time favorite bands. You only have to see one of their current concert set lists to find out there AREN't any songs from this album....maybe one.  Buy only if it's on sale 
 When I bought this book, I didn't realize it was mostly just a consolidated writing of Friedman's collumns in the Times.  I think Friedman is a great author with lots of great insights, but he isn't able to go into his ideas in depth as much as I would have liked in a bunch of detached 750-1000 word segments.  Since the sections are arranged chronologically, there also isn't the opportunity to tie the themes together.    If you really like Friedman, then it's worth a read, but if you are in it for just one, I'd read The Lexus and the Olive Tree first.  It is by far his best 
 I was looking for a real thriller, and thought I would try one by David Baldacci. I had read a very favourable review a while back, and I have also seen and enjoyed the movie version of Absolute Power.  After reading reviews at Amazon, I picked Last Man Standing. However, I was really disappointed. For me it wasn't thrilling at all. Several times I had to force myself to pick it up again to continue reading. For me, a good thriller is a book you can't stop reading, even if it's getting late and you really, really should try to get some sleep instead of continue reading.  Examples of great thrillers I have read are: The Firm by John Grisham, The Day After Tomorrow by Allan Folsom (nothing to do with the weather-related movie of the same name) and Angels and Demons by Dan Brown.  But Last Man Standing was quite the opposite. Sure it had its moments where it got exciting for a while (the final shoot-out for example), but those times were quite rare.  I've been trying to figure out why I didn't like it, but I can't say I know why. I do think that a lot of what happens in the book is quite far-fetched (especially the reason the hero Web London froze during the ambush) and that the characters are pretty one-dimensional, but that's not enough of a reason. Both The Day After Tomorrow and Angels and Demons have plenty of far-fetch twists and one-dimensional characters, but they were still exciting reads. I can't come up with a definite answer as to why I didn't like Last Man Standing - I simply just didn't care for it.  Writing a negative review like this will probably earn me a few unhelpful votes, but I think it is important to also review books you didn't like. Otherwise you risk getting an unbalanced view. However, I do admit that it is much more fun to review books you really liked.  But to finish, if you are looking for a good thriller, skip this one and try one of the other three I mentioned above. 
 Let me start off by saying that if you haven't read any of Gerritsen's books featuring her two main characters, don't even consider reading this book. So much about the characters deeply depends on your being familiar with their history. Even if you have read other books with these characters, The Mephisto Club, while starting off with a lot of suspense, is a disappointment. The plot drags and requires you to suspend belief way too much, there are too many subplots that are left dangling, and the ending -- what there is of one -- is weak and unsatisfying. All in all, I'd advise you to skip The Mephisto Club. Your time and money are too valuable to spend on a book that, at best, is mediocre 
 The photo on Amazon isn't representative of the product I received.  The frame is white, or an extremely light silver.  I also bought a LaCrosse Technology WT-3122A 12-Inch Wood Atomic Analog Clock, which didn't match it's photo either, but at least I like it.  
 Please don't waste your money.   It was told in First Person in which it was hard to get into the book.   I didn't complete beyond 7 chapters.   I tried!    
 The gist of the argument herein is that since Westerners either A) arn't Muslim or B)arn't native speakers therefore all their reporting is biased.  It is an interesting theory, and given it one must conclude that therefore the West should either A) only hire muslims to report on Muslims or B) not report on the Islamic world.  This is not however the conclusion.  Rather the conclusion is that the West becuase it is 'bad' and 'colonial' is projecting a false image of Islam everywhere it reports about it.  Let us take some examples and see what this is talking about.  The argument is that the west is always biased and always giving us the wrong view of wonderful islam.   1)  Saudi Arabia-where women cannot drive, cant vote and can be beheaded for adultery.  All this is a fact but apparently to report these facts would be biased, thus by doing so the western media encourages the unfair analysis that muslim countries discriminate against women, even though they do.  2)  Chechnya, Bosnia and Israel- in both cases the media is strongly pro-musim in the West, however this is overlooked in this case.  In a case where the media is pro-Muslim this book simply ignores the fact.  3) Afghanistan and Pakistan:  to islamist states where blasphemy is illegal, where a woman can be beaten by her husband and where a woman who is raped can be killed by her family.  WOnderful, and if the media reports these things then the media is anti-Islamic, becuase it dared to report something that might make westerners who are used to this 'colonial' idea that women are equal, wonder about Muslim societies where they are not.    The myth is clear and the argument is clear.  90% of Muslim countries have laws that discriminate against women.  For the media to report this would be wrong becuase then westerners might getthe idea 100% of Muslims discriminate against women.  Since this is the basic argument here then probably the conclusion should have been that no culture should ever be allowed to report about another culture since by doing so the one culture might be coompared to the home culture and thus it would be biased reporting.  Total nonsense.  Seth J. Frantzma 
 I purchased this book for my daughter, who is a new quilter, and she loved it.  I have the first printing and I preferred it.  Overall it is a good book to start your quilting 
 "The Accidental" by first-time Scottish novelist Ali Smith has to be one of the most irritating books I've read in a very long time.  It's so modern, it's really hard to tell what happened or why you should care about it.  This book won the Whitbread Novel Award.  According to another website, the Whitbread Award lost its sponsor and ceased to exist the same year.  Would it be fair to label this book as the one that killed the Whitbread Award?   The jacket also labels this book as a finalist for the Man Booker Prize whose website says that they award "the very best in contemporary fiction."  For me a requirement of the very best fiction is to be able to affect the reader in a positive way.  My only positive is that I finally got to the end of a dreadful book; & no, it did not get better.  Eve Smart is a novelist.  I usually try to avoid books where writers write about writers.  It's like a movie about movie stars or a song about songwriting -- it seems quintessentially self-indulgent.  Who knows what happens to Eve at the end of the book?  Why is she in some lady's house near the Grand Canyon?  Is it just to present another character as irritatingly self-absorbed as the main character?  Why is Eve unconcerned about her children?  Why does she see her dead mother floating above the Grand Canyon when this wasn't a book about her parents?  Wouldn't it have been more interesting to have her be eaten by a mountain lion?   Michael is Eve's husband.  He's a university professor that sleeps with his students.  His wife Eve knows and doesn't care.  Are they progressive people because they sleep around?  Is this supposed to make us care about them?  What is the effect of their loose behavior on their two children?  Do we care or applaud when Michael gets fired?    Astrid is the youngest child.  She is going through typical adolescent behaviors.  Yes, she is one of the most real of the characters, but she doesn't change throughout the book.  She gets mad at her mother for not being home and refuses to speak to Eve when she calls on the phone.  Astrid was right to be mad at Eve, but so what?  Magnus, the son, was the most interesting character to me simply because he loses his virginity in a church.  It's a bit of a mixed message from author Ali Smith.  What does it say about the church?  Is the message that "The Accidental" is man because there is no God proved because the church is empty?  Who knows?  Amber shows up as the family summers in Suffolk or Norfolk as Eve tries to write.  She buddies up with Astrid smashing her expensive camera.  She has sex with Magnus.  She insults Eve and gives her a knee massage.  She kisses Eve on the lips, right before Eve leaves for the Grand Canyon.  She ignores Michael.  Who is Amber?  Why is she in the book?  Magnus tells Astrid he knows who Amber is after she's disappeared, but Smith fails to let the readers know.  Is this a puzzle?  An illusion?  A nightmare?  Then when the family returns home, their house has been completely stripped.  Who did that?  What's the point?    I did not care for Smith's repetitious use of pages of short sentences.  It doesn't further the story.  It basically just says, "Look at me.  I can write in short sentences."  However, it was enough to have her awarded the Whitbread Novel Award.  I didn't mind the poetry.  I liked it because I could get through the book faster.  To what point it was there, I cannot say.  Perhaps you will be more modern than I and not particularly care if a story makes sense or whether there is anybody about which to care.  For me, this is an award-winning dud.  Taxi!                
 The only good that could come of this book is using it to start a nice balefire.  Sure it's hip, trendy, and easy to read, but all at the cost of truth and spiritualism.  I've not figured whether Ravenwolf is deliberately trying to misinform teenagers to protect the Craft or because she's really -that vapid-, but either way: for shame.  This is not Witchcraft.  It's not even Wicca.  All "Teen Witch" contains is more glamourous fluff to appeal to the masses who have as much faith in the Craft as GWB has brain cells.  And if you're looking to start a balefire, just pick up fallen branches from the woods.  At least that's free 
 No thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story.  The whole thing is based on who wants to kill Darby and why. And that is where it falls apart. The FBI or CIA could have easily investigated faster and easier then she could, and what is the point of trying to kill her?  To bury what is already out in the open? The FBI, CIA and White House all had a copy. What are they trying to silence? Nothing at all. Perhaps if it were just for revenge the plot might not have collapsed on itself 
 This novel highly disappointed me and I'm a big James Patterson fan. The usual short chapters don't bother me, but this novel was running over with characters...okay...so I don't like too many characters that I have to remember. But I stayed with the book and when it came to the ending, I kept telling myself...NO WAY. But, it ended the way it ended. I purchased this one, but I think maybe I'll get the next Patterson release from the library. I think the two star rating pretty well sums it up 
 I too bought the Southern Country Cooking from the Loveless Cafe to obtain the Scratch Biscuits recipe, as seen on a T.V. program.  Carol Fay did not provide the ingredients but eluded to the fact that to get it, we should buy the cookbook.  The description of the book refers to the biscuits but does not contain the recipe. Another lesson learned. 
 This is an invitation to compare this translation of Shinji Shobogenzo made by John Daido Loori and Kazuaki Tanahashi and the translation made by  Master Gudo Nishijima. Nishijima was assisted by Michael Luetchford and Jeremy Parson in the final version, published in 2003 by Windbell publications. Both books are the translation of the same Dogen's anthology of 301 koan stories in Chinese. Nishijima added a brief comentary to each koan and highlighted what he considered the crux of the matter. He has the right expertise on the subject because he translated into English the complete version of Shobogenzo and so he knows how to separate the wheat from the chaff in his comments to Shinji Shobogenzo. Master Loori adds a comment, verses and notes to each koan but smudging what is the heart of the matter and introducing all the gimmicks, the technical jargon, and Chinese and Japanese usage that grow in Mount Tremper. Everything becomes a blur under Loori and crystal clear under Nishijima. Loori's comments are a good example of what Master Bankei (1622-1693) considered a way of studying and disseminating "old waste paper" as compared to the direct teaching of Nishijima on each koan. There is a lapse of two years between the publication of Nishijima translation of Shinji Shobogenzo and that of Loori and Tanahashi. They mention the translation of Shobogenzo in four volumes made by Nishijima but not that of Shiji Shobogenzo in one volume. Their silence is highly suspicious because experts in a field cannot ignore the state of the art on the subject and should not cold-shoulder the work of other experts in the same subject. The translation of Nishijima has been available in the bookstore of zen centers where both teach and lecture. One may appreciate or not the translation made by another expert but it is a matter of courtesy and rigour to mention it to the readers.  So this is an invitation to read and compare made by a Zen practitioner in Spain who is used to study Dogen's texts translated into English and into French. Quiet often it is like looking for eggs and finding out chestnuts in the egg box 
 Im comparing this album to social distortions self titled album so of course it is not near as good.  If you are going to buy this album make sure you listen to this BEFORE you listen to social distortions self titled because if you dont your gonna hate it like i did...honestly i wouldnt even buy it.  the songs are so-so but i think they could have done way better.  only two stars for me 
 One of those books which is more fun and rewarding to discuss than to read 
 I'll put my opinion first, so there won't be any doubt in your mind.  I don't believe that you can write useful books about national character.  Is there really such a thing as "national character"? People are  just too different, too unpredictable. How well can you predict the  behavior of the people closest to you ?  How well can you predict what  people in your own country will do ?  Would every Italian, if they could  write well, have written the same book as Mr. Barzini ?  I seriously doubt  it.  So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one man's views on the conglomerate  nature of 50 million Italians.  After reading it, I felt even more strongly  that such books, though possibly entertaining, are a waste of time.  An  informative book about unicorns--but do they exist ?   Anthropologists have  been concerned, for many years, in getting the "inside view"--the  view of a culture as seen by the person within it.  While Barzini is  indisputable Italian, he tries to visualize Italians as seen by foreign  visitors, then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there, why  they are as visitors see them, or why they are not as foreigners may think.   This is not a successful gambit.  Cultures are based on many general  factors--like history, socio-economic patterns, religion, family,  etc.---but the specific results are just that, specific.  Barzini covers  many topics--the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of  something rather than actually having that quality; the family vs. the  state; Italian modes of achieving success; the north-south split; Sicily  and the Mafia; and last, the tragedy of Italy's long domination by  foreigners.  But nothing really connects.  There are only superficial,  scattered impressions, nothing very concrete to grasp.  The reader is left  with a handful of stereotypes.  Barzini is at his best when describing the  lives and modus operandi of particular characters in Italian history.   These sections were well-written and interesting.  But his portrayal of  Italian "character" is fuzzy, contradictory, and ultimately,  unconvincing.  Finally, if you are a lover of lists, you will thrill to  this book, because there is a list on nearly every single page.  Myself, I  got pretty tired of those lists.  If you want to know something useful  about Italy, read another book.  If you just want entertainment, which  might support any stereotypes you have about Italians, then this book could  be for you 
 While I found the writing style good and the information interesting, the actual diet was unrealistic, too restrictive and lacking fun basics that make other diets tolerable. I found myself longing for spices (how bad could pepper really be?) and questioning the validity of their restriction. I couldn't stand the ground-up flax seeds in my cranberry cocktail - the texture reminded me of trying to drink mud with little bugs in it (or what I imagine that to be).  I'm not writing this to disparage anyone from trying the diet - if you can handle the restrictions and you have the self-control required, you might find this diet doable and rewarding. I tried the Fat Flush with a group from work - inspired by one woman who is able to do the flush again and again every year (she always gains the weight back). The rest of us, while successful for varying degrees of short periods, found the diet unrealistic for any long-term results - all of us gained the weight back and spurred by instant weight loss, some even picked up worse habits than they began with.  The funny thing is I found much of the health information useful or interesting, but I got rid of the book b/c sitting on my shelf it reminded  me of unrealistic goals and failure - not what I want out of a get-healthy  plan.   I'm writing this review so that others don't get sucked in by all of the positive reviews hoping for lasting results - 3 of us didn't have any 
 Title says it all - it simply does not work, yes it turns and trims a hair here and there, but I would not purchase this again.  I am happy with my other Wahl product 
 This book flows along nicely but never actually goes anywhere. The book simply ends with no action, and no questions answered. It left me very very annoyed 
 Sorry but if this movie gets better with time I wouldn't know. I was too impatient and bored to wait. If a movie doesn't capture me in the first 5-10 minutes I'm finished. This could be a five star movie for someone who has some patience and willing to invest the time 
     Should have been a pop-up book so as not to confuse people with all those words strung together.  Thinking for ourselves is dangerous, let's all hide under Ramtha's skirt and see if she says it's all right to come out.    Cliff-Notes For the Retarde 
 Major disappointment. Probably a ton of good content. But the little stick drawings of plants, at best, and no drawings a lot, for most, is a real let down 
 Really, the whole movie sucks.  Let's start from the top, the plot.  Now, as you probably know, the plot has nothing to do with the game, at all.  In fact, the only thing remotely close they have is the name, and the BFG.  The plot is genetic monsters take over some research facility and marines go in to save the day, you know the drill.  Nothing horribly bad, except for it doesn't follow the game at all.  However, this sad bunch of marines are the stupidest people on Earth, and now Mars.  Really.  First, we have the Kid, who is horrible at everything, he talks while he's supposed to be stealthy, he gets high on mission, etc.  Yes, it's his mission, but I thought this was an elite military team, not some club that just anybody off the street can join without having any military training.  And Portman, not only is a moron, but has a stupid grin on his face no matter what he's saying.    Now, as for genres.  For a horror movie, it's not scary at all, not even a little suspense (though I kinda wanted the characters to die, so I guess that lost the suspense to me).  For an action movie, well, simply put, there's little to know action, until the very end.  And yes, there's a first person shooter sequence towards the end, but don;t be fooled, that is a gimmick and nothing more.    Without spoiling anything,I'm just gonna say that the ending is incredibly generic.  All in all, this movie is a waste of time and money.  
 I wish this book had been titled, Science Fiction: MY favorite 100 novels. I can see what authors Mr. Pringle likes (Dick, Heinlein, Moorcock, to name a few) and what his taste in sci-fi is and can even probably determine his age, but objectively speaking (if I am in fact, being objective) I think a lot of novels that should have been in the top 100 were left off off his list. Of course we all have our opinions of what the best science fiction is, and if you like science fiction that usually means you love it and therefore probably have strong opinions, so if you find you share his tastes then this is the 100 for you.  I did get a few suggestions from it so it was somewhat helpful. 
 I'll give this two stars rather than one, for actually quoting some of the more outrageous things Bashar has said so we can all see them.  But the author fails to condemn any of this or even point out that such acts are counterproductive both in the short term and in the long term.  I'll give just a taste of the things Bashar has said that are quoted in the book.  In a speech in front of Pope John Paul II in Damascus, Bashar claimed that Jews were "aggressing against Muslim and Christian holy sites" in the Levant.  He mentioned al Aqsa, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, and the Church of the Nativity in particular!  That is the opposite of reality.  And no matter what Bashar is trying to accomplish, absurd taunts like these are not going to help.  Truth has value.  And Leverett ought to tell us so.  In addition, the author should have pointed out just how far from truth such statements are.  The author quotes several more atrocious libels against Israelis and Jews.  These include an illogical and preposterous comment that Israel might not want peace (presumably, he expects us to think it is true and natural that Israelis would all want poverty and death instead of happiness, life, and prosperity).  And the even more untruthful remark that Israeli society is more racist than the German National Socialists (something further from the truth would actually be hard to find).    I do not recommend this book 
 If you like Constantine from American Idol, you will hate this album.  This is some straight out gravely rock.  A little rough, it seems like this was rushed out, or it could just be the case of a new band that is not yet polished.  I am a fan of most rock, but I didn't care that much for the album.  Nothing truly stood out from any of the countless bands I have heard in clubs around the city.  If you want to hear Constantine from Idol, go pick up Killer Queen, a nice tribute album that has some great vocals from him 
 If I wanted to listen to Interpol-I would. So what if they're British. I'm Texan. How does this fact make these schmucks better than American bands creating that "brit-rock" sound? That's right it doesn't. Now I'm not defending bands like The Bravery or The Killers (I am defending Interpol) but at least these guys jumped on the band wagen at least two years ago. Where were the "Editors" in 2002? Still struggling? Interpol had their debut out way before the "Editors". Just because this Tom Smith putz has an accent people are flocking to him. Fine. Slap an accent on Paul Banks and call it a day. The fact is "Antics", Interpol's weakest album (but still freakin' brilliant) surpasses anything from "The Back Room" 
 OK. I am a neophite and what better book than this one. Or so it would seem until I tried to install the included DVD which contains Fedora Core 2 Linux. Insert the DVD and reboot then the get the intro screen asking if you want a graphical or textual install. I selected graphical and it started then rebooted the PC. I tried this several times. The PC I am using is based on a VIA EPIA Eden CPU motherboard and Fedora Core 1 installs just fine 
 Worst Quality I have ever seen - bought three and all three are horrble. Scratched, screws won't tighten... shocked by the lack of quality control. 
 This is the second time I've been dumb enough to buy these- both times, I saw an uncluttered surface (no loud logos!) and the sony brand name, and assumed it'd be good quality. Only after my burning software failed again & again, and then my cd drive stopped recognizing any discs at all until rebooting, did I realize that I'd been through this before- with Sony discs, a year ago.  I can't imagine what could possibly make these so bad. I've used just about every other kind of discs with no problem. Reading the other reviews here makes me realize it's not just me. It's pretty upsetting that I've wasted $40 or so on these things, for a grand total of maybe 5-10 usable discs 
 This is a clear case of false advertising!  I ordered this item from Amazon/Target because it was described as stainless steel.  It arrived and was chrome.  I contacted customer service and they said they shipped the right item but would resend another one.  The second item showed up as chrome too!  I can get a chrome one for 40% less by picking up locally.    
 yawn.totally pointless to watch. it was about as funny as a fart joke(which are not funny btw). i guess i don't think its funny because i'm not a "red neck". sorry but the cable guy blows. as i said before, ron white is the only funny guy on here. the rest are lame. if you like something actually funny then i suggest dane cook or Jim Gaffigan, maybe even lewis black. but if you're a moron then yeah i'd stick with the fart jokes.... 
 I really, really, wanted to enjoy this book. I'm a girl, I believe in magic, and equal rights, and her writing is beautiful. But I didn't leave a patriarichal religion to run to the same thing, only replacing a male God with the female Goddess. I want equality, and I really don't understand how a person can claim they're being oppressed, then decide to oppress their oppressors. I guess, if you believe her tale, that balance must be achieved by ignoring the God as the Goddess was ignored. Myself, I prefer the "Be the change you wish to see in the world (Ghandi)" approach. I want to see equality between men and women, not the subservience of one to another. I come from the South, where alot of the guys are take-charge, outdoorsy, macho types. I like that, and I think I'm secure enough in my own power that I won't be taken over by them. I don't feel it neccessary to reaffirm my power by taking someone else's, which I feel Starhawk does. If you can take the rampant feminism and reverse sexism, then this book does have some spiritual value 
 Bought this to replace my old 2200 Ipaq; Man what a mistake! The battery is always dead, even after the HP tech support for hours on 3 seperate occasions; Patch downloads done nothing, lost information, reloads, Bugs to many to mention. I wished someone would have warned me of this pda model before I purchased it. All the good features it has don't hold a candle to all the troubles it has. I'd be very careful if your looking to buy this model. Da 
 An easy read, this book is not necessarily accurate.  One example is in Lexa's claim that Turmeric (Curcuma longa) is the same as Goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis).  It's obviously not.  The confusion probably stems from one of Goldenseal's other names, "Indian Turmeric", which is NOT the same as Turmeric the common spice.  Like many herbs, proper preparation is essential; goldenseal can paralyze the central nervous system and cause convulsions and respiratory failure in improper doses, so don't follow Lexa's advice to take it internally unless you are properly trained and/or medically supervised.  My suggestion to readers is to use this book for inspiration, but back up your research before working with the herbs by checking other sources for correspondences and toxicity.  Some herbs Lexa recommends for baths, ointments, incense, teas and the like are poisonous or carcinogenic.  Know what plants you are working with -- and how to do so safely -- from a reputable source before inhaling, wearing next to the skin, or ingesting them.  
 Chatwin never understood Patagonia, moreover he never liked it. I know this because Chatwin himself said so. Anyway, all the wonderful people who lives there and fight their lives over day after day, don't like Chatwin either.  So we are even, although Chatwin passed by, and wonderful Patagonia is for ever 
 What happened??! I have really been enjoying the Sneaky Pie Brown series - up till now. Found this one to be extremely disappointing and far off the mark for all the characters- they weren't very likeable. Conversations were too preachy and had little or nothing to do with the basic story line. There was very little focus leading up to how the mystery was solved, and  the condition in which the murder victim(s) were found, more graphic than it needed to be.  Ms Brown needs to go back and review her earlier books in this series and refresh her memory on why this series has been so fun to read. Jud 
 I was steered toward the blood type diet by my physician, and believe that the diet works well for some people.  My low rating for this book is based on the recipes themselves. I found them lacking in flavor and interest (at least for the A diet). I think the author would do well to consult with some recipe and cuisine experts and combine his theories with more talented food makers 
 A fascinating history that gave me a thorough understanding of the world of the Commanche.  That said, I did have some serious issues with the book, which in my opinion was racially biased.  American Indians were continuously referred to as "Savages" and "Barbarians" (Cherokees having the dubious honor of being referred to as "High Barbarians").  The book illuminated the reasons why war between the Commanche and anglos was inevitable, but while atrocities were certainly committed by both sides, violence perpetrated by the indians was described in brutal, bloody, cruel, detail.  In contrast, a U.S. Cavalry massacre of entire camps (typically mostly women and children) was noticeably abbreviated.  In fact the author even makes a point of trying to assert that these women and children "were as dangerous as the warriors themselves" in defense of the wholesale massacres.  White armed forces, who were essentially waging a war of extermination, were typically described as "valiant" and "courageous".  The Indians "murderous", "bloody", and "mindless".  In a war between two cultures, how one side can be "heroic" and the other " murderous" is very questionable.  But then we all know that history is written by the victor.  Seemingly the only Indian the author express any real admiration for is Chief Quanah Parker.  But then coincidently Quanah was half white.  The book is determined to unfairly dehumanize an entire people, and succeeds in doing just that 
 The author of this book, Warren Wagar, is apparently a professor of "Future Studies." I certainly hope he has long been fired from that post. "A Short History of the Future" was  written in 1989, but the writer is so ignorant of politics, and so WRONG, to be blunt, it reads as if it was written in the 1940's. Orwell's 1984 is more on the mark than this.   He shows barely any creativity in his "predictions" and clearly was barely even aware of much of the contemporary political developments of his time. The fact that he assumes the Soviet Union will continue plodding along well into the 21st Century is incredibly naive. The fact that he assumes the nation's socialist economy system would survive equally long is similarly bizarre. Did he read the newspapers? Did he pay ANY attention to that Gorbachev fellow and the path he was bringing Russia down?   And honestly, did anyone really expect that Germany would remain divided into two states until time immortal?  Or that Latin America and Africa would remain dictatorships forever? Or that black rule in South Africa would not occur until 2014?  If this book had been written 30 or 40 ago, it would be excusable. This book is just sloppy. He doesn't even do a good job describing how his corporations take over the world. Everything is just described in these overly flowery sweeping generalizations. Like "and then the capital lords seized control of the governments and made the state wither like an autumn rose." That sort of thing.   The author is clearly an "ivory tower" academic who believes history can be predicted sorely through dry Marxist theory and analyzing dubious vague "trends." The fact that this book became horribly dated something like three years after it was published is quite a strong indictment of a man whose entire job was devoted to predicting the future.   
  The only thing Milton Friedman has going for himself is that he says out loud what other reactionaries will only whisper.   Ayn Rand would have loved Friedman's disdain for the poor--for anyone, in fact, lacking the "initiative" famously shown in a 1963 cartoon in which Barry Goldwater stands in front of a poor person in a Southwest ghetto and says, "Why don't you show some initiative? Why don't you go out and inherit a department store like I did."  If you think the status quo was ordained by God, or that capitalism is the best that humanity can come up with, this book is for you. If not, start reading Trotsky, Lenin, and all the people with vision, compassion, and utter disgust for the sad mess that the fat cats have made of this planet.   
 This book is an attempt to reduce Judaism to a secularised entertaining and entertaining agglomeration of historical and cultural accidents, aimed primarily at amusing a contemporary non-Jewish reader, who might want to learn about the Jews in a non-threatening hollywood style. The perspective presented as a result is both "naughty and nice" as pre-empted by the opening quote from I.B.Singer talking about G-d as a writer "your novel G-d; too long, too cruel, too little love. Too much sex. .. But about one quality we all agree: G-d's novel has suspense."  The Jews and Judaism presented is a carnivale of hotch-potch traditions, fascinating in "a junior historian - did you know?!?!?!?" kind of way and unthreateningly heterogeneous. Far from a people a people unified by a single ethos and fate. Why draw attention to the unity of vision of return to the land of Israel from  diaspora, when you can talk about different recipes for charoset between the Sephardim and the Ashkenazim? Why focus on evolution of spiritual vision, when you can scintillate audiences with historical allusions of ritual sex, "witches, demons and magicians" and lots of intermarriage. Not even a member of KKK would feel threatened by conspiracy theories, when all these multitudes of jews and "judaisms" have barely anything in common at all.  It's all been a bit of a historical joke and an accident and misunderstanding. Look Jews are just like everyone else - ...had cruel and stupid rituals, worshipped silly g-ds. This whole thing with anti-semitism and persecution has all been a bit of a mistake............  This book was not written out of love for Judaism and Jewish people. It was written out of fear of the suffering that being different has brought to the Jews over the past four thousand years. At a time when it is more critical than ever for humanity to unite in acceptance, tolerance and celebration of diversity of what it is to be human, Kirsch delivers a story that seeks acceptance for the Jews on "Hollywood terms". He "re-packages" the Jews as people that "we all" should be able to relate to - spiced up with a bit of sex, suspense and action and ultimately just as real as a "Hollywood ending" 
 I wish life could give me back the 4 days of my life wasted reading this trash. Why anyone should be interested in these people is a complete mystery to me. They are vain, shallow, self-absorbed, artless and tasteless faux aristocratic social climbers with no redeeming value other than to be at the right place at the right time armed with a well-honed ability to suck up to those in power.  Especially sickening was Liberman's angst over not being accepted as an artist, when in fact he was simply a diletante who milked his connections and power to get his works placed and reviewed in forums which he would never have access to otherwise.  Thr book's only value, as best I can tell, is that it should be read as a cautionary tale exposing the shallowness of those, like Liberman, placed in positions of power to dictate public tastes, and the nepotistic back-slapping that too often gets them into good colleges, professions, galleries and museums while those more talented but less connected struggle on.   The book might also have been partially redeemed if the author were able to make us understand what motivated the characters to be so vain and stupid; however, you finish the book no closer to understanding or knowing the protaganists than you did at the beginning; in spite of du Plessix's frequent criticisms of her parents, the author never seems cogizant of exceptional loathsomeness of her parents.  Shame on du Plessix Gray for foisting this garbage off on the general public. I'm assuming she used the same connections her parents did to see that it got published. Shame on us for taking the bait and buying and reading it.  If you want to know about New York's REAL artistic and cultural scene in the 40s-70s, read the recent biography of Willem De Kooning, DE KOONING,  and not this 
 Stephen Hawking's Black Holes and Baby Universes and other Essays is a compilation of approximately a dozen essays and presentations made by Hawking from 1976 to 1992.  Though some of the essays deal with scientific issues (e.g. physics, cosmology, black holes) most of the book is autobiographical in nature discussing the author?s upbringing and struggle with ALCS.  Written in the aftermath of the popular A Brief history of the Universe, the current work is a rather blatant effort to exploit Hawking's popularity with minimum effort.  Although a short book (approx. 175 hardcover) there is much repetition amongst the essays.  Readers with even a passing knowledge of Hawking will find no new information in this book.  Overall, a disappointing book that has little to offer.  Only for the most dedicated Hawking aficionado 
 WOW, THIS ALBUM REALLY SUCKS! IT'S VERY HAPPY SOUNDING, VERY ANNOYING,THE SINGER IS AWFUL 
 This one is worse than "Don't Kiss Them Goodbye" in the aspect that I wish she would have included a LOT more readings and a lot less of her personal stuff.  
 I hate to say this, but my daughter and I disliked this album. We have an extensive music library including everything from the MOldy Peaches to They Might Be Giants to Ralph Covert to Dan Zanes. And as a whole we love musicthat makes you want to dance. As my two year old stated yucky. And I have to agree, we rather listen to CSN original verision of Teach Your Children or any of CSN songs, And Madonna album has better sounding songs then the Little Star honestly get the original verision of the songs. We did not get any further then song 6 which is Baby of Mine, so the album may improve after the 6 song, but I would be suprised. 
 Fox uniquely attempts to give suggestions on how to keep the best employees. Fox divides his book into fifty short stories that sometimes include a real life situation.  Many of his anecdotes have serious flaws in the basic principles of Organizational Behavior, while others do not fully explain how to handle potential problems.   There are instances where his suggestions can be very useful in becoming a good manager.  At other times, his stories have good concepts, but do have loopholes.  If you were interested in only seeing a small picture of the steps to becoming a great manager, then I would recommend this book to you.   Fox's numerous weaknesses on motivation make me believe that he does not understand some of the basic concepts of motivation.   Furthermore, his continual discussion of avoiding mishires, without any description on how to do that, further weakens his arguments.   I believe this book is for more experienced managers and educated employees who know to extrapolate the good ideas in the book, and ignore the bad 
     What can you say about a book that introdouces three characters in one chapter? Or has a character thats entire vocabulary seems to consist of "Hotcha, Gotcha" and says that nearly 10 times a chapter. I would honestly not care if all the people upped and died. This book has no surprises but one, a "plot twist" that was obvious 6 chapters away. Did I mention I hate the annoying, underdeveloped, characters. Oh yes. I usually like Bruce Coville, but with this book, he has bought himself to a level of unreadability that is only outclassed by the sequel 
 "A Walk to Remember, is my favorite book.  I have read it at least three times.  You have all kinds of emotions when you read this book.  First you will smile, then you will find yourself crying.  It almost takes your breath away when you read about the love these two young people share.  Has you read this story, Nicholas Sparks makes you feel like you have know this couple all there lives. I highly recommed this book to anyone that loves romance.  And that believes in fate.  
 Do not buy this mattress, it is not safe.  This mattress does not fit either of the cribs we have for our twins.  When I called Kolcraft to inform them, the CS rep was rude and insistent that this mattress was standard size and would fit, and that they haven't had any complaints.  She also implied it was my crib that was the wrong size.  We have 2 cribs and the sealy matress in the crib the twins still share fits nice and snug.  The Kolcraft has at least an inch gap and can move around quite easily 
 While you may find Bill Maher's performance "thought provoking" or "vomit inducing" depending upon your political slant, the fact remains that this is an UNFUNNY comedy show.     Bill rants and raves about the same topics he has in the past, but its a political stump speach, not a humorous standup routine.  If you have misfourtune of watching this, you will notice that there is almost no laughter from the audience.  Sure, he gets applause, because he's preaching liberal ideals to Californians, but there is little laughter.      If you want political stumping, turn on the TV.  If you want Comedy, go watch someone funny. 
 Which party used a 6 million dollar team of expert lawyers?    Deborah or David?    Which party testified alone before the court?    Which party refused to testify in court?    Which party provided trial transcripts available for all of you to read on line?    Which party is currently sitting in jail, for the crime of exercising free speech?  Deborah or David?  This book is obfustication and spin.  Read the original court transcripts 
 To quote Paul himself 'There's a fine line between recklessness and courage' and this is simply reckless.  It's brave of McCartney to still think he can put out a record that people will actually want to listen to but on this form he's wholly mistaken.  These are, quite seriously, the worst lyrics i've ever heard in my life and the sad thing is that McCartney is trying to be serious.  The nicest thing I can say about this record is that it exists, unfortunately.  I'm sure there are worse artists than McCartney, but can anybody seriously think of one? Answers on a postcard please.  Woeful.  
 You might waant to read the review I posted on vol 2, it was scary nor will I be nurnt a second time 
 I tried 4 DVDs with different DVD writers and still doesn't work.  This stuff is junk.  In addition, the manufacturer never sent the rebate.  Don't buy anything from Velocity 
 This movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great, including a phenomenal cast, lead by Cate Blanchett, and great scenery and cinematography. The actors playing Elizabeth, Cecil, and Walsingham spoke and acted admirably, each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling, but the words themselves rendered the performances useless. The director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material. They should have read Elizabeth the First's biography by Elizabeth Jenkins. It is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain: had the author and director been more historically accurate, they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in Elizabeth, who is in turn hysterical, defeatist, overbearing, childish, tyrannical, who never shows her core intelligence, her great love of her people, who had a private core described by her motto "Semper Eadem", be always one. Elizabeth ruled with her advisors, she was not totally ruled by them. She would not have put up with Norfolk screaming at her across the council table, nor would Burleigh have allowed it. Cate Blanchett's wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine, wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity, much less truth. How could the director think that the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman? The ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all. We are laughably given William Cecil as wimpy and ineffective, and Walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne. One of the reviews said that the director inspired Rush to play Walsingham much like the Hindu god Krishna. I suggest that he should have first read some English history 
 I bought this best-of cd wanting to hear a band I liked and saw a few times back in college. The problem is, Amazon doesn't let you know that the songs are the "singles" versions that were shortened for radio. "Promises" is hacked down to practically nothing. I'd recommend just buying their original cd's as opposed to this 
 This album has them best STP song ever.  Paper heart is in my opinion the best song this awesome band has ever created. Unfortunatly i can't say that about the rest of the cd.  Lack luster album i'm afraid 
 I found this book to be far too shallow to be of any great use. While it does gives an overall picture of the situation, much of the contents lack depth that neither practitioner nor student would find it to be of much help when dealing with real life problems. Not recommended 
 My original order was 1 pair of tennis shoes missing so when I had to re-order the 2nd pair of identical tennis shoes, I was overcharged & also had to pay shipping fees again. I tried several times to resolve this problem via Amazon & the shipping co. Bealls Florida, but was basically ignored & never received my refund. I find this to be deceitful & poor customer service 
 The title says "Erica Jong on Henry Miller" but it should read "How Henry Miller impressed & influenced Erica Jong". This book is completely subjective, filled with impressions Jong has digested  from reading Miller's works, as well as from correspondence &  conversations with him. It is mostly blind praise & back-patting,  loaded with Jong's running commentary on American morals on such topics as  sex & lesbianism. While of intrest to fans of Jong & Miller,  reading this work to find out about Henry Miller's life & works will  leave you still needing to find out about Miller's life & works 
 One has to admire the career of cult director Joe D'Amato. He's made everything from action, drama, comedy, westerns, horror and even porn. And porn/horror.  According to the IMDb Joe D'Amato has 198 films credited as director and with all the names he used I wouldn't be surprised if he had more.  Anthropophagus: The Grim Reaper was directed by Joe D'Amato and written by and starring cult actor George Eastman.  The Grim Reaper has become quite infamous for the gore scenes and in particular the fetus ripping scene, all which I will touch upon later on.  Fans are in the middle on this one. Some see it as slow and boring, others as a really scary flick.  I normally like movies like this that move at a slow pace, but this time it just didn't work.  The slow pace worked great in D'Amato's Beyond the Darkness. The movie was weird and disturbing and that is what kept it from being boring. But here things in my opinion didn't work as well.  The first hour is painfully boring. What Joe D'Amato was aiming for was a feeling of dread, which just didn't seem to work like it did in Beyond the Darkness.  The characters also were quite boring. Had they been interesting than maybe what D'Amato was going for would have worked. The cast though is excellent.  Serena Grandi who is known as the Italian Dolly Parton is one of the stars as I mentioned George Eastman (this guy is great). And Tisa Farrow, yes Mia Farrow's sister.  But 3 good actors still doesn't make this movie rise above. Had the characters been good well I think what Joe D. was going for would have worked better.  As for the gore it's really not that much, the final gore scene is quite graphic, but the rest wasn't much.  The late 70s the gore films really began and the 80s it blew up and Italy capitalized on that. But The Grim Reaper really isn't the gore movie it's made out to be and even the fetus-ripping scene isn't a big deal like it's made out to.  That's not something we see a lot of in film so I understand why people talk about it.  I just never felt the dread D'Amato was going for. Eastman like always is great, but really not used to his potential. The guy is 6'9! But he wasn't as intimidating as he should have been.  Fans of Italian cinema and of Joe D'Amato might wanna check this out. Despite my feelings I understand why some love it.   I felt the tension built up didn't work, but if you watch it and think it does this movie will deliver.  Regardless of how I felt I'm still a fan of Joe D'Amato and will always buy his flicks. 
 This set of CDs is a fraud!  Nowhere does it say in the ads that it is not Chaucer that is being read but a "translation" by some hack poet.  So, if you are only interested in the stories but have no sensitivity to the sound and rhythm of the second best poet in the English language, then this is the stuff for you.  But it is definitely not Chaucer 
 Maybe it was just that this book was too simple but I found it very boring and the story line is basically what people go through in their lives. Someone close to you dies and you move on I would not recommend this book to you basically because it is a played out storyline and I do not think the author spent too much time on this book which I think was probably thought of in ten minutes and written in twenty minutes and published. I mean come on dying from a bee sting I find that more comical than sad in my eyes 
 The product is flimsy, the step is too close to the toilet to be practical for a child to step up on, the deflector is not tall enough to deflect any urine, and the seat is too large for a toddler.  My child does not feel comfortable using this potty 
 I can't believe this actually got a Newbery Honor.  It is barely mediocre. I just read this book aloud to my two boys, age 11 and 14.  They usually love good war books like "Hornblower goes to sea".  When I got to the middle of this book, in what should have been the most exciting and interesting part, all three of us wanted to just throw it in the trash.  In the first chapter, Chris decides he "hates" yanks because one of them steals his buck skin jacket.  The whole rest of the book is a boring and repetitive temper tantrum.  He says about 50 times how much he hates the Yanks, but the author fails to convince the reader that the hatred is sincere.  The only suspense is whether Chris is going to kill himself before he realises how stupid he is.  What kind of hero is that?  And why should the reader care if he gets killed or not?  The ending is anticlimactic.  Chris just comes home and tells his Pa he's sorry for being so stupid, and his Pa says that's ok, and says some antiwar cliches. The several mysteries surrounding Silas are just red herrings and never resolved. 
 This movie was captivating and interesting for the first 3/4ths of it.  It is a psychological thriller/mystery and you obviously want to find out the big explanation at the end that resolves all your questions.  Well, the ending was so incredibly far-fetched and crazy that I can't believe that anyone who read the WHOLE script actually wanted to work on this movie.  It ends up being a stupid "sci-fi" type ending.  So, if you want to get all into a movie, only to have them resolve it with the most ridiculous scenario possible, buy this one!! ....or....DON'T 
 If you think you'd find a lot of unrelated platitudes interesting, then you'll enjoy this book. 
 I have been reading Sandra for a while now and while "where there's smoke" is not my absolute fav (envy is, and is a must read)it ranks up there in the top three. the twist and turns keep you glued till the final page and you are not going to want to put this one down. Sometimes a little rough in places( name calling and such).But all in all a very good book 
 This book is absolutely flawed in its arguements.  Schlesinger ignores the context of the times; he ignores basic truths; he is jaded in his outlook.  By all accts., Mr. Schlesinger is a New Deal Democrat who tries to firmly tie in the New Deal Democrats into the Democrats of old.  This is not feasible as the Democrats of old and the New Deal Democrats had differing perspectives and ideals.  He reaches and stretches with the intent of the Democrats in the Age of Jackson, that they were always for the laboring classes, when this is not the case, especially in Southern Democrats who were aristocratic in nature and outlook.  They could not comprehend the plight of the ordinary laborer, as their world view was quite skewed.  Further, divisions that were slowly emerging between Northern and Southern Democrats, primarily over the slavery issue, are discounted and Schlesinger merely goes back to his jaded perspective that the Democrats were the champions of the common people.  Schlesinger imposes his own view of politics and parties on politicians from the Age of Jackson.  There are other works out there that are 100 times better on the Age of Jackson that this work, such as The House Divides: The Age of Jackson and Lincoln, from the War of 1812 to the Civil War edited by Paul Wellman and Lewis Gannett or The Era of Good Feelings and the Age of Jackson, 1816-1841 by Robert Remini.  However, I will give the man credit where it is due, he does his research.  Pity he doesn't know what to do with it 
 The awfully titled "Food of Love" was Catalonian director's Ventura Pons first English-language film, adapted from a not very good book ("The Page Turner") by American David Leavitt.  The result, I regret to say, was Pons' worst film to date.    The story concerns an 18-year-old aspiring gay pianist, his recently-separated mother and an older pianist with whom he has his first gay sexual relationship during his summer vacation in Barcelona (with his mother).  However, this is not a "coming out" film; all the problems are generated by the mother's feeling due to her divorce and, especially, the intergenerational conflicts between the two leading men.  (Sex is fairly tame too, and the nudity consists of shots of the young man from behind.)  Unfortunately, the movie is poorly scripted (the lines of dialogue are quite laughable at crucial moments) and, worst of all, badly acted.  Kevin Bishop, who plays Paul, the young man at the center of the story, gives a really terrible performance.  He is cute, though (the blonde, blue-eyed boy type), which may explain why he gets compliments in other reviews and even by David Leavitt (in the interview he gives on the DVD).  I'm sure if he were ugly everyone would comment right away on his bad performance. Paul is not a very likable (save physically) or believable character, either. (He also doesnt seem to be having much fun in his sexual relationships and he really mistreats his mother... and she lets him get away with it.)  The other male leads give bad performances as well, with zero nuances or depth.  To be fair, their dialogue is pretty bad to begin with.   The film's only saving grace is the great Juliet Stevenson, who is truly wasted in the poorly written (and cliched) role of the mother who is clueless about her sons (and his lovers) sexual orientation.  Still, Stevenson is such a talented(and funny) actress that she manages to make you care about the character by the end.    I recommend you skip this and rent any other of Ventura Pons' films.  He's an interesting director (hence I checked out this movie) but this film was a misfire from beginning to end.  
 'Human Rights' is a small book that discusses some current issues pertaining to human rights from an idealistic western foreign policy perspective.  Ignatieff is a Canadian born foreign policy commentator who has spent the majority of his professional life in the United States and the United Kingdom.  Ignatieff's two opening essays are followed by observations from other commentators; which in-turn are followed by closing remarks from the author.  This type of discussion format is normally quite beneficial in helping readers to gain an appreciation of a given subject from a different perspectives.  Unfortunately, in this work the additional commentators are to close to the author's ideological view to be of any real value.  Dianne Orentlicher's observations were ok, however, the others were weak - characterized by too much flattery and self-aggrandizement.  The opening essays introduce a range of concerns within the contemporary human rights movement.  Ignatieff identified relevant concerns such as; the tension between individual and collective rights, the view that the human rights movement is a type of Western imperialism, whether secular human rights is a form of cultural relativism as well as the need to balance rights and security/stability.  I have heard the author speak on foreign policy issues and find him to be a generally capable foreign policy commentator.  Overall, there is not much of value in this book. If handled from a broader perspective these issues could be a worthwhile read.  In its current form, however, I do not recommend it. 
 I guess the biggest selling point of this boxset is disks 4-6, because you have digitally remastered songs from chicago 16-24.

They choose not to add anything from IV carnegie hall, such as "a song for richard an his friends" they could of added a live version of "25 or 6 to 4". you can't not exclude music from one their most successful and popular records. I didn't like that excluded music from "live in a japan" they should of added "lowdown (japenese ver)" and "questions 67 & 68 (japanese version)" I would of used different songs from VII such as "aire" , "devils sweet", and "italian from NY" They sould of added "where do we go from here ?" from "chicago".

 I was forced to read this book because of a teacher of mine, for a topic at the university. She came to the classroom with this book, as if it were the ultimate guide on teaching. First of all, I thought it's not a topic for the kind of subject we were having/discussing in the classroom. Secondly, the things the authors wrote are so obvious, at least for some persons, that all I can say is that I really had a very good time reading it as a comic book, nothing else. I laughed very much with all the explanations a teacher would give to a 7 or 9 year-old pupil, because he touched her on the arm. It was a lecture, not a simple explanation! Clearly we have to be polite, encouraging and nice towards the students. But this book really exagerates some points in such a foolish way, that I could only laugh. I never had problems with students in my classes, I always tried to encourage them to like the subjects; I am sure they learned many things, as well as I learned from them, too. This book was just a waste of time. The worst thing is that the teacher I am talking about, the one who came to the classroom telling how wonderful the book is, doesn't practice what the book preaches! She is hated at the university and never behaves as the book says to. How is it possible? She didn't learn anything from it???  Maybe it's good for people who are starting a teaching career - then I would say read it, but even though I would be very cautious. But being recommended by someone who does exactly the contrary than the book states, I could imagine it wouldn't really be that good. 
 I truely wish I had found the prior reviews for this product before I bought it. Unfortunately, I am now stuck with a product that will not start and will not run on my pc, running WinXP2!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! Support sucks all around and there appears to be no fix now or in the near future to get software working...I lost $100 bucks on this one!! 
 I was very disappointed in the book which I received as a Christmas gift. I, too, dislike the light yellow print which is a strain on older eyes! It is difficult to find the recipe on the page because of it.  This might seem trivial to some; but, to others it is a real pain.  Also, the recipes are nothing special.  I am glad that I did not pay for this book 
 Not sure about these other reviews but all I can say is make sure to buy yourself a package of Tylenol's with this book, because after reading a few pages your head will be ready to explode.  I am trying to read this book with other 25 people and not one person has said that this book is good.  Make sure that you have alot of spare time if you are going to read this crap, because you will be taking more naps while trying to get through this book, then all the naps you have taken throughout your whole lifetime.  Geoff Huston would make a great lawyer but not a book writer 
 It is interesting that the reviews of this book are quite bipolar. Most reviewers seem to love it; others hate it.  It is also interesting that people find the positive reviews much more helpful than the negative ones. Who is kidding whom?  In fact the book is awful and I would give negative stars if I could.  Saying that an author is courageous in bucking politically correct sentiment and implying that that sentiment somehow blocks "true science" is a cheap defense.  This book may buck a common concensus.  But it is nonsense and courageous only in the sense that the author loves to attract attention, even in the form of the disgust of other scientists.  Rushton's "scientific research" in volves a wonderful array of adhoc definitions and types of "proof" carefully twisted to serve his purposes. They are a disgraceful parody of scientific method.  some examples  1/ inventiveness?  the earliest development of farming, civilization, paper, large scale construction, writing etc. were actually in the Middle East-among people who don't fit the race classification at all. Europeans were quite late to achieve civilization and they learned it by and large from the Middle East. -  2/ the notions of R and K selection are so badly abused that Rushton actually uses them backward. Relatively steady (typically tropical) environments not northern ones are the ones that produce populations making few babies and investing heavily in them. They are not the ones that make many offspring and take little care. That tends to happen in areas of the world where lethal crises (such as freezing) regularly intervene, making heavy investment in children a questionable strategy.The proof? Two of the most highly K-selected species in the world, People and Gorillas come from the tropics.   3/body design: large breasts and buttocks are ways to store body fat (which all women store more than men) without it putting it under the skin where it acts as an insulator.  In short it is an adaptation to hot climates where getting rid of body heat is essential.  In colder climates people need the fat as insulation and therefore spread it over their bodies.  Besides the assumption that these,particularly big breasts, are sexy is an American fetish not shared by most populations nor by most Africans.  Over all body fat, tending to signify fertility is a more common basis for evaluation.  fertility: In fact there is very little if any evidence that natural fecundity (the biological basis of fertility) varies by biological group except as a consequence of disease, malnutrition or significant breastfeeding. Fertility depends largely on how one makes us of that fecundity. The most fecund and fertile population on record is among some groups of white North Americans who work to maximize their reproduction.    Breast feeding is perhaps the most significant "investment" that a parent can make in a child.  Moreover, significant breast feeding is well-established as being a powerful contraceptive.  European populations led the way in eliminating breastfeeding.  African populations continued to breastfeed until they were taught by whites that it was "uncivilized"  or even tricked, as by Nestle, to stop.  IQ--just a wee bit of controversity about what it means and how to measure it.  One thing is clear.  Purposely (or even naively giving people tests irrelevant to their lives and even the language they speak or the degree of their education.  can generate any "results" one wants.  Such methods have been used to estblish an "average IQ" of 70 for subsaharan Africa.  Such an IQ implies that most Africans are retarded to the point of being dysfunctionat; that societies could not survive and could certainly not produce  rich artistic and religious lives.  Anyone with any experience or even reading about Africa knows how silly this is.    violence:  given slavery and world conquest and mass destruction which people have actually been violent?  Given slavery, it is virtually certain that black women have been raped by whites than the other way around.  Race related IQ--how do Native Americans on reservations, known to be genetically derived from "very smart" Asians do on IQ tests?  How did Ashkenazi Jews, a loosely defined genetic group but hardly a race--unless you suddenly argue that whites aren't monolithic after all, (Jews haven't always been considered white)--went from doing so badly on IQ tests as to be considered unfit for American citizen ship to doing so well that they are one group of "whites" who compete successfully with privileged Asians. How do we explain the fact that the same biological groups do poorly or well depending on their status in the society in which they reside.  the problems can't be in the genes, they have to be in the tests or in the social conditions in which they live.  early age at menarchy.  Age at menarche is heavily dependent on the accumulation of body fat by young women.  Menarchy is not reached until the body has stored enough fat to support a preganancy.  In fact age at menarche is HIGH in cultures (most)where fatness is hard to achieve.  It has declined everywhere (for example in Europe and the United States in the last century and a half  It is a nutritional variable, not a racial one.  Crime rates: are we talking only about storefront crime or white collar crime.  Murder is clearly a function of the availability of guns than of color  race: what do we do with the fact that there are several different dark skinned groups in the world.  Black Melanesians and Australians are more closely related to whites than they are to Africans.  What race is that?  What about the fact most people are intermediate in color which shows a clear latitudinal gradient.  What of the fact that many African groups have narrow noses and short limbs, and that the shape of ones nose or lips or even the sickle cell trait don't correlate with color.   I could go on and on.  Anyone who thinks that this is a good book better become familiar with some of the realities of human biology and history..  I will be very happy to debate any of this with anyone, any convenient time 
 Coming from a family of exquiste southern cooks, my Grandmother being the best of the best I was saddened and very disappointed in these books. Hoping to find a long forgotten recipe or at least a tweaked version of some of my long remembered recipes what I found was an exercise in opening cake mix boxes and soup cans. Sorry but with  these books "The Lady doesn't Cook" 
 I love biography. I never thought I would abandon a biography unfinished and feel no desire to pick it up and continue. I found this dull, self-serving and boring.   Lessing seems to be busy making excuses and justifications for her 'fellow travelling' with Communists in 1950s London.  Oh, pleeeze! So what? Heaps of people were members of the party or fellow  travellers. many have also renounced or reassessed their former positions,  but they don't feel the need to go into tortuous self-denial as Lessing  does.    I find her cold as a person - that's fine, one doesn't have to  LIKE the subject of a biog/autobiog to be interested in them. But her  writing is cold and detatched as a cold-water flat in misty wintry London 
 I bought this CD to relax me being a medical student, but this is the worst meditation CD that i ever bought. It's very boring and its very repetitive. I hate it. I wish i never spent that money on it. Not worth getting. 
 I should have checked this out before registering for it.  The lid won't stay shut, the bottom wipes brown, the unit leaks.  I contacted the manufacturer.  When telling him about the lid not staying shut, he asked, "are you sure there isn't a ghost in the house"...they offered to replace it if I returned it to them,  offering to compensate for shipping charges with some of their other products.  After reading these reviews I think I'll just trash this unit and buy a different manufacturers product 
 Useful for traveling and basic translation purposes, but very limited in word meanings. This is particularly true for the English to French section, where a word will often have only one corresponding meaning 
 That should have been the title of this movie as it describes the use that the talents of a high-profile cast & normally respectable director are put to.  Another possible title is "It's All About the Groceries", 'cause I'm hard-pressed to think of a reason, other than money, why anybody involved would've signed on to this project.  It starts promisingly, with atmospheric shots of the Golden Gate Bridge rising through fog over San Francisco.  The camera plunges through the fog to hone in on the image of a knife being held to a woman's throat. Once again, Ashley Judd is a victim in jeopardy . . .so it seems.  Then the 'victim' proceeds to open a can of whoop-a** all over the perpetrator and beats him to a bloody pulp.  One starts to think that this might be getting good, especially after Ashley's apparently super-competent police detective is revealed to have anger issues, a pretty hefty drinking problem, a propensity for picking up strangers in bars & having rough sex with them . . .and some grisly skeletons in her closet.  I was interested to see what Judd would do with this opportunity to play a character with a dark side instead of her usual noble victim.  Unfortunately, not enough.  Ms. Judd is a luminously beautiful actress, even with a severe short haircut meant to make her look tough, I suppose. It is not hard to believe that men would be drawn to her like bugs to a flame.  She has not developed the range of emotion to really carry a complex character like Jessica, though, playing it distressingly one-note.  Is she ecstatic?  Depressed?  In a drug-induced stupor?  The way Judd plays it, it could be any, or all, of the above.  I like Ashley Judd, but she is in danger of turning into the female version of Richard Gere--a performer with real potential who keeps choosing flashy junk-food roles that do not challenge her talent.  "Kiss the Girls" was the high-water mark & each subsequent film has been weaker than the last.  This movie is worth the price of a rental, but I'd take a pass on purchasing it.  For a better treatment of female-cop-with-dark-secrets-and-Issues, & a stronger movie all-around, I recommend "Murder by Numbers" with Sandra Bullock 
 We found this product less than appealing.  The first box the product was poorly made and the drilled holes were not in alignment.  There was large dark knots in the wood that were covered up poorly with paint.  For a target item in this series, it is very poor construction.  The second box was some better but the whole bookshelf is not well made.  We also found the shipping on this item EXTREMELY expensive.  Unfortunately, our Target stores do not carry the item or we would have looked at the product first in the store.  We have several items from this line and so far this is the poorest value and worst mad 
 this is not the eric clapton i know. when he does blues that is clapton. i wish he would do another blues like "from the cradle. 
 This book is a typical Toffler mishmash of speculation and rambling incoherencies.  Even if you can get through the first few chapters, it's not worth whatever mark-down price the stores are offering it at.  Suggest you read the work of more cogent futurists 
 This book, as stated by a previous reviewer, is not really for younger children.  Even worse, it presents rumors as fact .  Warren Harding was rumored to have joined the KKK, even though  most of the evidence comes from Klan members themselves.  Many historians doubt this happened and have sited far more reliable sources.  One of my students, for example, takes this book at face value.  It proved a positive learning experience about taking this stuff as is in the book, however, I wish I had not had to do that.  
 After listening to The Power of Love, it was clear that Celine was either lip syncing or singing along with a taped version of the song.  Any musician can tell that the band behind Celine is not what's on the audio track: live performance does not sound exactly like "the record".  The fact that you can't tell if Celine is really singing (on many songs) even makes this more disturbing. Applause is faded in and out like a laugh track on a sitcom 
 While waiting for my daughter in an orthodontic office last month (July 2005), I read through what I thought would be the familiar Redbook magazine of the past. Instead, I was shocked to come across a new sexual advice section in which the explicit techniques for giving your man satisfying oral sex without tiring yourself out was described. Another article within this section explained how a taller man can have sex with a shorter female partner while both standing. I felt embarrassed and outraged that this magazine was out on the tables in the waiting room for any age group to read. I am age 48, college educated and the mother of 2 teenagers. I would not want my 13 year-old daughter to consider this light reading or helpful advice, nor do I think it appropriate for a magazine such as Redbook.  Parents please seriously consider whether you want this magazine on the end tables in your homes. IT HAS CHANGED 
 Why are people giving this film so many stars? Not only is the movie incredibly short (a few minutes over an hour, which in and of itself makes it not warrant a $20 price tag), but it is also incredibly bad. Whether it be from a bad script (which it was) or by bad performances, the piece lacked a certain depth that is required for a good movie. This could have been a very good film - it had all the potential, but that potential was never realized.   Lesbian cinema is somewhat lacking in good films. Are we so desperate that we clutch onto any movie we can and call it good? There are standouts like 'Fire', 'When Night Is Falling', and more recently, 'Nina's Heavenly Delights.' Those films are not only contain good, well-rounded plots where even secondary characters are not two-dimensional, but they feature excellent acting performances.  I am a hopeless romantic, and more than anything I want the girl to get the girl in the end. What's unfortunate about this film is that I didn't care in the end if that happened.  I wish I could get a refund for this.. 
 These are short essays on 100 of Roger's favorite movies. Even though Roger has studied many of these films shot by shot there is no thorough deconstruction of these movies. Most are 3 page essays with synopsis and commentary on themes. But, serious film students can learn from this as well as the layman.  This IS a great book by a movie critic who I agree with less than half the time. Lately, I think Roger has seen one too many movies. He's not as discerning as he once was and he's far too forgiving of a lot of the mediocrity that's foisted on us by the Hollywood Money Machine. I disagree with his recent assessment of movies such as SPIDERMAN 2, KILL BILL VOL. 2, SIN CITY, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS, and THE CLEARING, which was the worst movie of 2004. But, if you think he's just a Pop Culture movie critic, think again. He's won a Pulitzer prize, and his commentary for the CITIZEN KANE DVD is a must hear for any serious student of filmmaking.   I DO agree with his inclusion of almost all of the classics listed here. Some of his favorites are also mine. On DVD, I own 42 of the 100 films he essays here. Some I call "movies," some are "films." His taste mirrors my own in many ways. Especially his love of black and white films. And his love for Oliver Stone's masterpiece, JFK. But, for different reasons than Roger states here. Roger has changed his opinion about this film after his initial review because he received an undeserved tongue lashing from Walter Cronkite, who apparently knows nothing about the facts of the Kennedy assassination, and was probably mad because his 1963 broadcast likeness announcing Kennedy's death was used in the film without his knowledge. Now Roger says he loves it for it's "mood." Shame on you, Roger, for revising your original statements concerning this great film. I love JFK for the sheer force of it's propaganda, for being more right than wrong(Stone did his homework on this film), and for Kostner's performance(I cry every time he gives his final court room summation. So did Kostner when his was reciting the words. It's Garrison's actual speech from the trial, which Roger fails to mention here). It's also a marvel of film Editing and changing film stocks; which IS touched on by Roger. It's easily the most important film of the 20th Century. Because of it's controversy, Congress passed the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, mandating that records be opened to researchers from the National Archives(what's was left of them, anyway. Oswald's files were completely destroyed). But, in recent years Roger has backpedaled on it's importance.   Great old movies that might go unnoticed by modern MOVIE GOERS are treated as essential viewing for FILM LOVERS(the distinction is mine, not Roger's). A lot of people have seen SEVEN SAMURAI, but how many people have seen Kurosawa's emotional masterpiece IKIRU? Hopefully many more now that Roger has written an essay on it. Other great inclusions are: THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS, Cocteau's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, DETOUR(a rotten low-budget B FILM NOIR), Buster Keaton's THE GENERAL, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT(I'm an Elvis man myself, so I would have thrown in JAILHOUSE ROCK too), LE SAMOURAI, Charles Laughton's only directorial outing, THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER with the great Robert Mitchum, Disney's PINOCCHIO, Astaire & Rogers SWING TIME, Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH, Wim Wender's marvelous art film WINGS OF DESIRE, Ozu's FLOATING WEEDS(personally I would have gone with his tearjerker TOKYO STORY). And the best inclusion is THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, with it's odd and bombastic dialogue. It's one the most elegant pieces of FILM NOIR about bottom feeding rats ever written. And Roger knows it. Bravo!!   My only hope is that Roger will reassess Peter Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY. This film is GONE WITH THE WIND for my generation. It's a masterpiece that I call the SISTINE CHAPEL OF CINEMA. To see this film and not be completely moved by it, is like going to Vatican City, seeing the chapel, and saying, "Eh, it was alright." It's belongs in one of his books.  I just ordered THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC from Criterion after reading his essay on it. I've never seen it and Roger has me intrigued.   This book of essays deserves a WHOPPING 5 STARs. But, the reason I'm giving this one STAR is because the PAPERBACK fell apart in my hands after getting half way through it. A reviewer below had the same problem. THE BINDING IS TERRIBLE.  DEFINITELY GO WITH THE HARDBOUND VERSION.  ENJOY. 
 I bought this safe less than six months ago, and here I am, searching for another safe box again.  At first, the key was stuck, and after many, many tries, I manage to loosen up the key and use it.  Now, I am using just security codes.  And whenever I enter the codes, it does not open or close on first, second attempts.  It opens after I keep trying.  Pretty much, it's not reliable.  It can not handle daily use, and over time wear and tear.  I have changed the batery twice.  And I only had it for less than six months 
 i did not care for this book whatso ever ...waste of my time waste of my money..it didnt tell me nothing..mr.bob spilled no secrets not that he knew any to start with i am sure..i threw the book away..zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 
 i was willing to pay the price of the book if it would bring success as it advertised and with the many positive reviews i felt i couldn't go wrong. The book did contain some useful information, but nothing which i hadnt previously read in a much cheaper book. i agree with a previous reviewer in saying that some of the reviews may actually not be genuine! Personally i would recommend the work of Eve Matthewson- great book 
 The order was delivered promptly the price was fair, but the item was defective it did not work at all. The return process also was easy and I did get a prompt return of my money 
 I don't know who would waste their money on such a horrilbe text book. I'm currently using this book right now for Geometry and I never experince such a bad textbook. This book is hard to understand and it's also usless to use this book if you are a "learn it yourself type of person." I rate this book an "F" and I wouldn't recommended this textbook to a genius, that's how horrible it is 
 NO STARS!  I recently have come to find that not only does this coffee maker have all of the defects others have stated, but due to the "leaking" & issues w/ the filter basket overflowing, you may also notice that the water never completely drains-staying at the 2 cup line-causing MOLD & MILLDEW to grow (DESPITE proper cleaning & maintenance).  This is the reason for the "bad tasting coffee" & also the reason for my current various medical conditions...  I am interested in raising awareness so that other consumers avoid the health issues I am being faced with.  PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE ANY MR. COFFEE/SUNBEAM PRODUCTS...  THIS IS THE EXACT MODEL I OWN, BUT NEARLY EVERY MODEL, HAS THE SAME DEFECTIVE CONSTRUCTION & consumer complaints...  Check the Better Business Bureau & Consumer Affairs...  You will be shocked at what you find about Mr. Coffee/Sunbeam.  They have almost gone bankrupt from Class Action Lawsuits, more than once.  If ANYONE has a similar situation with ANY Mr. Coffee brand coffee makers, please contact me ASAP...  My email address is angidougherty@yahoo.com  People are suffering because of this hazardous product & may not even know it...  Toxic Mold Poisoning is very serious & can be deadly.  Especially through drinking it in your morning coffee.  YUM 
 I would love to review this product, but Amazon first provided me with an incorrect delivery date, then said it was lost but they took the liberty of placing a replacement order for me "at no charge" meaning "no additional charge.  Service and shipping have really gone downhill 
 I just don't get the sixties guys sometimes. Maybe forty years ago pointing out the flaws in the American experience was novel, although coming twenty years after Henry Miller and others,  it was probably not that shocking to anyone that payed attention to the various literature. This is a smug book, with its smugness somewhat masked by Southern's cutesy tones and farcical situations that he sets up. Maybe it was groundbreaking then, but it comes off as a bit dated and ineffectual now 
 I have read nearly all of Philip Roth's works over the last four months, and this very early work is the only book of his that I didn't like at all. There are NO JEWS in the whole book, and Newark is a thousand miles away! Phil, don't be a shmegeggy, come back to the neighborhood! In "The Facts, a Novelist's Autobiography", Roth reveals that Lucy is modeled after his psychotic first wife, who is much more interestingly rendered in "My Life as a Man". For the best of Roth, try "American Pastoral", "Portnoy's Complaint", any of the Zuckerman series, "Operation Shylock", or "The Counterlife". Just a humble opinion from a Roth Fanatic 
 Whilst I highly enjoy the new World Of Darkness RPG, this book is of little use as far as knowledge goes. Instead of providing information about the game it contains ideas for stories to run.  I myself have no need for stories writen by someone else, when that is the best aspect of running a game as a Storyteller.  So far this is the only book in the series I would recomend avoiding. If you lack creativity or imagination however, and would like to run a game, this would actually help you out 
 i never recieved the product. the order was cancelled by the sende 
 This textbook takes microeconomics which can be explained in a technical, exact manner and makes it abstract and foreign.  This textbook's sentences run-on and lose their direction, confusing the reader...If a reader had a firm understanding of economics prior to this textbook, after reading it, it is certain that they will no longer have the understanding of economics, that they did previously.  It is a travestly when a textbook designed to teach the reader about a certain subject, actually makes them less knowledgeable of the subject.  I must also ask why it is being used to teach university students in different years and programs, when it should not be, for example in my university it is being taught in the following programs  IBBA - Year 1 BBA - Year 2 BAS - Year 3 MBA - Year  
 Bloody Mary is a very poor sequel to Whiskey Sour. It is the same book, basically. Once again, a powerful sociopath has a personal vendetta against Jack. I hope the author has something new to offer in the upcoming third book in the series...Unbelieveably, according to the reviews of Rusty Nail, the 3rd book, he recycled the story again. Forget it 
 I HAVE USED FROMMER'S GUIDES FOR YEARS. THIS ONE IS A POOR CHOICE FOR THE GENERAL TRAVELER OR A PERSON WHO HAS VISITED SAN FRANCISCO BEFORE. IT ATTEMPTS TO BE TOO MUCH OF A ROUGH GUIDE TYPE GUIDE BOOK. TOO MUCH SPACE IS SPENT ON "CUTE" RESTAURANTS or B & Bs. THE LIST OF VARIOUS TYPES OF RESTAURANTS IS TOO SLANTED AND NARROW. I FINALLY FOUND A COUPLE OF LISTINGS FOR INDIAN RESTAURANTS BUT NONE IN THE BROAD GENERAL LIST AS AN EXAMPLE. THE HOTEL LIST IS TOTALLY LACKING. WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO OTHERS FOR PURCHASE. ABSOLUTELY NOT!!

Watts was admittedly inspired by the work of social-psychologist at Harvard University, Stanley Milgram, in the late 1967 on experiment on the problem called "small world" problem: "anyone person in the world could be reached through a network of friends in only a few steps; in Watts language, "after the cocktail party banter in which two strangers discover that they have a mutual acquaintance and remind each other what "a small world" it is. Surprisingly, Milgram's results led to the phrase "six degrees of separation": the degree of network of friends between me and you will never be more than six! I know someone who knows someone who knows someone else who knows someone that knows someone who becomes my friend!  I feel a must to urge the readers to read the book in order to understand further what science of network can give us. Among the popular books of networks, reading Watts' Six Degrees is important since the book was made seriously by the author for unlimited readers. It is a time for physics gives something valuable on constructing new scientific sociological work to day.   Hokky Situngkir Bandung Fe Institut 
 Faith is a fine enough thing, but this is the sort of book in which faith is used as a trump card to gloss over even the most painful processes and events, cheapening and simplifying them -- a recurring theme in the author's work 
 In writing her book, "Thinking," Arendt claims that it was Eichmann's absence of thought that underlay his evil deeds; and that her conclusion drew her to write the book ("Thinking").    Her conclusion was wrong.  It was the absence of feeling: the lack of feeling experience; the lack of awareness of feeling; and the lack of expression of it -- in all combinations.        Despite Arendt's courageous reporting in "Eichmann in Jerusalem," she demonstrates her own absence of thought - in drawing faulty conclusions, a sin of which we are all guilty from time to time, and one that is far less grievous than Eichmann's and those like him 
 I thought the art had a certain charm, and used strictly as a picture book for children who can't yet read, I think it's quite nice.  (Too bad you can't make up your own story to go with it.)  The moment the child starts to read, though--better hide it quick, because...  Unfortunately, the book reads like a condensed Communist Manifesto for kids (as others have noted), or a Socialist agenda primer.  I don't know for sure that's what Marcus Pfister had as an aim, and I'm not going to speculate on his politics.  He has three kids and may raise them as he likes, and indulge in any such philosophical musings as float his boat.  Yes, I suppose sharing is nice.  Certainly sharing one's talents and abilities for the betterment of others is a great thing--but in America, we get paid for that (charity is voluntary, not coerced).  Furthermore, stripping yourself of what makes you unique and interesting (not necessarily BETTER, just unique and interesting), or giving away all your possessions, is a lousy way to make and keep friends, isn't it?  Is this book implying that somehow friendship can only be obtained by placating envy (a negative personal quality that should be dealt with by self-examination and intent to change, not pandering)?  Is it saying that being interesting and having unique qualities is bad?  Almost seems like it, at least to me.  Furthermore, there's an overtone of "only by belonging to a group can you have self-worth," which is as hoary a case of balderdash as ever I've seen.  Of course, people who agree with that egregious sentiment will disagree with me, but that won't make them right.  (The two stars, if you must know, are for the art. 
 I bought this for my 6 year old after Christmas as her cousin received one and loved it.  I ran all over town trying to find the PVD's (which are hard to find a good selection of).  I ended up purchasing some online.  By the time the PVD's arrived, the player was no longer working.  We have replaced the batteries several times.  On a rare occasion, it will turn on, but that is very rare.  We are very disappointed with this unit.  I should have listened to my husband and bought the DVD player!  
 It will give you some idea about how Wainwright is straining for material that one of this CD's songs is about 9-11. Now four years into the history books, Loudon seemingly has nothing better to say about the tragedy than he noticed white tiles in the New York subway.  There isn't a "Westchester County" to be found on this offering. "My Biggest Fan"--just to cite one example--seems pointlessly indulgent even from egotist Wainwright.  There's no "aha" in the song and Wainwright comes off as mean-spirited towards an inconsequential target that few will be able to relate to.  The CD a few years back that followed his mother's death exhibited poetry and beautiful melodies, such as "White Wine." But "Here Come the Choppers" is just a Shake-And-Bake of half-conceived songs you'll never listen two weeks after purchasing the CD.  Wainwright is a notoriously uneven artist, but "Here Comes the Choppers" is an under-inflated balloon at a party where you can't help but yawn 
 anyone who buys this probably is wearing a white sheet over there head--- f*** that piece of trash michael richards -- and by the way I am white 
 Busy with a project of my own I have finally found time to catch up on the WOT series. Unfortunately RJ has continued to add subplots with out closing out some of the existing ones. In short, WOT has become infested with too many major and minor characters running around doing their own thing.  One of the more aggrevating additions RJ has made is the insertion budding technology into WOT in the form of steam engines, gunpowder, etc. It basically detracts from the main storyline and everytime I run across it I skip ahead. Winter's Heart does not move the story ahead much. 
 I eagerly looked forward to reading this account only to be very dissappointed. I got the sense that this wasn't a book that was thoughtfully written and carefully (if at all) edited. Rather, it seemed to me to have been a series of dis-jointed recollections as told to someone, then strung together into a book.   Ever mindful that this was an opportunity to "set the record straight" regarding the author's role in the demise of Lumumba, I was interested to learn that the author considers himself to be the type of person"who couldn't hurt an insect". In light of that sentiment rather an odd business be in. 
 This book is a perfect example of people in ivory towers, and those who are afraid to admit they don't get it, jumping on a 5-star bandwagon. Faulkner titled this book perfectly, calling it The Sound And The Fury, while leaving out the rest of the phrase: signifying nothing. The first chapter is a noble, but failed, attempt at creativity. But almost no one, even the most well-read people, understands that the first chapter is written out of chronological order until they find out someplace else. The chapter's main point was as an excuse to get in Faulkner's description of what instigated the novel, a somewhat kinky description of looking up at the girl Caddy's muddy panties. A fatal flaw in the chapter, which never achieves a rhythm, is that Benjy, whose thoughts comprise the chapter, apparently has a photographic memory and thinks in completely lucid, complete sentences despite being an idiot. Caddy, the main character in a novel of stereotypes and pitiful prose, is actually a despicable trollop. She's characterized as Benjy's friend, but a careful reading shows that she only befriends him when it's convienent for her. Other chapters are even more sick than Benjy's castration, including the one with Caddy's brother lusting after her, or the hackneyed, cliché chapter with the old slave showing how much wiser she is than folk she serves. The Cliffs notes and other reviews perpetuate the idea that the book's theme is the downfall of the old plantation system. This is an invention; not found in the book. S&F, as Faulkner loudly hints in the title, is about nothing other than his infatuation with Caddy. It has no plot. And it is far from a great insight into the way people think. Only perverts think as these characters do. In the end, this novel is just page after page of sheer boredom. It's supposed to be a great book of human tragedy, but to feel tragedy you have to sympathize with the characters ... and all of the white characters in this novel are disgusting. All of its supposed great meaning, and the flip-flop in reviews from castigating to praising the experimental style, weren't dreamed up until 15 years after the first printing flopped, by literary professors who have to keep coming up with new ideas under the "publish or perish" law. It was only revisited because Faulkner did, eventually, write some good books. You want truly great writing? Try Steinbeck, Welty, Hemingway, Harper Lee, Dickens, Twain, Tolkien, Melville, Dostoyevsky, O. Henry, Wells, Verne, Maugham, Crane or even Rowling (Yes, Rowling. Her Potter books are complex, effortlessly intertwine several story lines and sublimely combine strong characterization, suspense and humor) 
 Oedipus was a weird book to reab, because the plot was all twisted. The characters in the book are nasty. Oedipus kills his father and has two kids with his mother.... 
 The author chose a very important topic, but he's attacking straw men throughout the entire thing. He complains about religious people who supposedly use isolated Bible quotes to endorse poverty's existence, and then he spends a half-chapter piling on the Bible quotes to say why we should act. I agree we should act and the Bible says we should act, but I could do with a little less condescension. No religious person uses the Bible to argue in favor of poverty. Who on earth does the author think he's arguing against?    He says there's a problem, and we all agree with that, but then he assumes that the existence of poverty somehow predetermines the particular solutions he recommends.  He fails to conclusively link the causes of poverty with those solutions.  Knowing how someone fell into a hole does not provide sufficient information about how to get them out of the hole.  Repeating the same assertions a dozen times is not the same as a reasoned argument.  The author needs to realize that people don't differ much about whether poverty is bad. They disagree on how to reduce it, and the author does not address these other opinions much.  Instead we get a lot of caricature of religious people and conservatives 
 This is a deplorable piece of work from a sad, talentless hack. With any luck, this will be last time Nick Hasted is ever asked to write about important figures in music, such as Eminem, whom I love. He simply lacks the skill or flair required to tell the story in a pacy, engaging and believable fashion 
 Boyd's revised edition of Virgil's Aeneid is the essential book to prepare for the AP Latin: Virgil exam or just become familiar with this favorite of all Classicists.  With all the lines on the AP syllabus and no more, Boyd's Aeneid effectively prepares students to be familiar with all the lines that may appear on the test.  Each page has a paragraph of Latin text, with numerous footnotes underneath, offering translation help through grammar and vocabulary hints.  A glossary in back serves as quick reference to unfamiliar words.  While Clyde Pharr's edition has similar detail in footnotes and vocabulary, the Pharr text contains ALL of books 1-9 only, meaning that students have to take home a heavier textbook and also purchase a separate text for books 10-12 of the Aeneid.  Thus, Boyd spares students from searching for the passages that will actually be covered: it contains only what is on the syllabus.  It is a great way to study Virgil's classic epic 
 The guy who wrote this claims a lot of things. No proof to back it up though.  He wrote it because he thought that the Vietnam conflict was going to escalate to WWIII but it didn't. 
 first of all, they dont even go up TO the thigh!  they attempt to sit right above the knee!!  second, THEY DO NOT STAY UP AT ALL WHATSOEVER!!! I was sooooo embarrassed - i went out with them on and every ten seconds I was pulling them back up.....  I am 5'3" and I weigh about 125....I'm average - these are a joke - price IS too good to be true - DO NOT BU 
 this book i felt was more practical in what i can do rather than why management skills and styles are needed which i felt was going t give me that answe 
 Coetzee is without a doubt a good writer and he has written many fine novels, unfortunatly In the Heart of the Country is not one of them. Not a author known for fast pacing who has made up for that with eloquence and  interesting caracters without being boring. In this book he fails on all  accounts. To enjoy this book you would have to be a absalut diehard fan  Coetzee 
 Overall, I wouldn't recommend the Insider's Guide to the Colleges to either parents or students.  I feel that Fiske, Princeton Review and Kaplan (even though the last edition is becoming dated) are better sources of information.    However, there are some good aspects to the Insider's Guide so I would at least recommend picking up the book at the library and skimming the beginning section on choosing a college.  Insider's does a good job of mentioning all the facets a student should consider and they do a very fair job of detailing the strengths and weaknesses of both small and large schools.  On the other hand, I have to agree with the reviewer who said that the entries make each school sound like either a "party school" or a "nerd school" as if colleges only came in two varieties.  I think it quickly becomes very hard to distinguish individual qualities of the schools because so much emphasis is placed on the balance of partying to studying to the exclusion of other information, particularly about good academic reasons to attend a school.  It's also apparent that Insider's is placing a little too much emphasis on sports when they discuss a school's croquet or handball program.  Yep, that makes the school different, but it should be obvious to Insider's that there are other aspects of the school they should have focused on instead.   Now my writing is not the best, but I suppose I expected better from Yale students.  One writer used the non-existent word "irregardless" (it's "regardless") while another couldn't be bothered to check if Stony Brook was one word or two.  The writers sometimes delivered badly executed last paragraphs with incongruous sentences, poor transitions and confusing conclusions.  You end up with something like "Students at X University say that the food is horrific, the dorms should be condemned and the school is less exciting than a cemetery.  It's a great place to spend four years."  Yes, I suppose it would be fair to give them a break since they're only undergraduates (I think), but I feel it's important to expose our high school kids to the superior writing found in other guides like Fiske or Princeton Review instead of something that's not very good.    This brings me to the Insider's Guide's assertion that the book is "funny and incredibly entertaining."  While this is subjective, I strongly disagree.  The Insider's Guide is fairly boring compared to the much wittier Princeton Review guide.  Personally, my favorite is Fiske, but I would say that if a parent is having trouble getting her teenager to start looking at colleges seriously, she'd pick up something besides Fiske, and I suspect it's often the Insider's Guide as it's written by "students for students."  However, not only is Princeton Review better written, the format of the Insider's Guide is user-surly with small print and cramped, unattractive pages.  I will say that the Insider's Guide does a better job of sticking to factual statistics than giving schools subjective ratings on a four-star scale, and some may prefer that.  As a matter of fact, the Insider's Guide does have a few statistics that Princeton Review neglects and two of them are important:  The freshman retention rate and the graduation rate.  Both statistics are fairly good indicators of how happy students are at their respective schools.  So if those stats are important to you, that might be one reason to at least browse through the Insider's Guide.    The Insider's Guide inexplicably leaves out some top-notch schools, particularly in Texas and Louisiana (such as Loyola) while including some rather absurd choices that have SAT means in the low 400's or in one case, 300's.  They also have a number of large state schools that I don't feel have any place in a guide to the "top schools."  The fact is that they attract a multitude of applicants which means more people will buy this book.   I wouldn't suggest removing the schools with very unimpressive statistics if there are sufficient reasons to keep them (in many cases, I couldn't find any), but with some  incomprehensible exclusions, I can't say I find the book authoritative or comprehensive.  Go with Fiske or, if your student isn't excited about researching colleges, go with Princeton Review.     
 Greatest Hits collections of rap artists are usually a pretty bad idea. Most good rappers pack a visceral punch on first impact, but this wears thin with repeated listenings. This is especially true of gangsta rap. With what allegedly should represent the best work of B-T-H on one disk, this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself. Arranged back to back, the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin. The raps blur together, and after two songs, the obscenity-laced machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value, sounding more like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision. Once the raps lose their ability to hold your attention, all that remains are the rhythm tracks, which are serviceable at best. Their biggest hit, "Tha Crossroads", appears here in a version that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form, further reducing the value of this collection. Worse, they include a warmed-over version of "F- Tha Police", an exercise in futility that only serves to dissipate the power of NWA's original. Spending money on this collection is like buying old newspaper articles. It might have had some value when it first hit the stands, but who wants yesterday's papers? 		C    Tom Rya 
 Do not get this book.  The message in this book, if any, is masked by unbelievably poor grammar.  The book, filled with page after page of run-on sentences and obscure jargon, was impossible to comprehend 
 This book is a big disapointment. The begining chapters have some useful information, but much of it can easily be found on the web. The 220 franchises they list have no supporting information on why they're the best. The information they provide seem like condensed versions of the franchisor's flyers 
 I've always held the philosophy you are what you're entertained by. So, those who like Ludacris are definitely telling on themselves about their views of life and women. And speaking of women...Ludacris never met one who wasn't a h-o.  Ludacris is the epitome of the sexual hypocrisy that plagues men: you demean and look down on women for being h-oes, yet you hope every woman is a h-o so you'll have no problems getting laid. But then, you're so disgusted with the fact the woman behaves too much like you, so you go and find a "nice girl" because you can respect her and marry her and procreate with her. But then you cheat on her with a "bad girl" because h-oes need h-oes; but then you can't respect the "bad girl" because she's a slut, so you go back to the "good girl." But she's not nasty enough for you, so then...around and around we go. Women are basically being punished for men not being able to make up their minds about what the heck they want from us.  He's OBSESSED with sex and h-oes. It makes you wonder if he has hang-ups about it. Maybe Ludapis saw his mother selling herself in a backalley for a dollar and it scarred his outlook on women forever. I guess if she had actually RAISED him and shown him how to respect women-- ALL women--then he probably could have grown up to be a respectable guy instead of the prurient dummy he is.   What's the music like? Well I'll give him 2 stars for mentioning TLC in What's Your Fantasy. That's it.  Addendum: 7/27-07 Some may wonder why I'm "wasting' my time giving Ludacris negative reviews. Well, first of all, if only people who liked the product were the only ones to review it, everything on Amazon would have 5 stars, which would be an inaccurate sign of its quality.   Secondly, I don't like Ludacris. I would give Ludacris more respect if I felt he gave my gender more respect; but he doesn't. My diatribe above shows what my problem with him is, and I feel that argument is valid. There's no way to critique Ludacris' music without critiquing his hypocrisy regarding women. Why should I like him when he seems to have nothing but contempt for us? I'm biased against him because he's biased against me. So he gets a bad rating out of s-p-i-t-e 
 When I received this book I was really eager to read it. The whole storyline appealed to me and I was convinced, based on the first few chapters, that I would enjoy it.  I'm not sure when I changed my mind.  Maybe it was after reading countless details about historical and political China when I just wanted to know more about the main characters.  Sometimes I felt as if the author couldn't decide if she wanted to write a history book or a love story.  While her descriptions of the surrounding enviroments within the book were very colorful and evocative, the presentation of historical events taking place was a bit on the boring side.  I found myself fighting the urge to just skip over those parts.  Also, the ending (which I won't give away) sort of left me feeling cheated. I suppose I could've overlooked all of those things except for one thing.  The fact is, the main character just isn't very interesting or likeable.  To me, that's a deal-breaker 
 This book is accurate as a blind folded archer spun 3 times in a game of pinata. There is no real useful info in this book, you'd get more tactics out of a Steven Seagal film. This book should be taken out of print before some dummy hurts themselves. If you're interested in learning the tricks of the trade buy a surplus field manual (FM), Watch Discovery Channel, or Join the Military or some Government agency. Billy Powell was a very misinformed hippie. The part that gave it all away was the part about the M-1 Garand. "Used in both World Wars and Korea" WW2 and Korea yes, WW1 no. I think its luck of some higher power that this dummy didn't hurt himself in the process. 
 This book is lacking for sensible sturcture. Seems to put a reader into a maze and leaves them wondering where there at. There are enough topics but their too full of proofs to really understand what the book is trying to explain. This book would even be diffucult for a graduate student that's using it for review. The author seems to be proving his mathematical talent instead of trying to explain the topics in a manor that's understandable to the average reader 
 The only truth he told was in the front of the original (1830) ed of the Book of Mormon. He lists himself (correctly) as the author and proprietor of the work. Later editions claim his as a translator -- just like he translated the Kinderhook plates.  This "most correct book" contains numerous spelling errors and grammatical errors. Elohim's spell checker must have been off line when Joe was writing this one 
 I've taught "conceptual" (fundamental) physics from this text at two universities and one community college.  I have never liked the text - and this later edition has not changed my mind.  (Don't let the catchy cover photo fool you.)  Fortunately I no longer have to use the text.  It is just too long and filled with too many topics for a one semester college level "conceptual physics" course.  I don't think most college instructors who use this text ever make it through half the topics.    This text isn't adequate for even a high school physical science course, and certainly not for a "college bound" physics course.  I can't imagine using this text to teach high school physics.  If it is routinely used to do so, that may partially explain why Americans lag so far behind the rest of the world in science at the pre-college level.  The text is really intended for (college level) non-science majors to give them some exposure to physical principals without a lot of "heavy duty" math.  Unfortunately with over thirty (30!) chapters it takes too long for them to get through much of it in a semester.          If you want to "teach yourself physics," there are better, cheaper and clearer texts and books for the novice available.  I wouldn't recommend spending the money for this text when you could buy a small library in paperback on physics for less.  If you have some algebra and trig and have taken some science before, don't bother with this text and it's outdated gimmicks and anecdotes.  (If you've had some calculus, don't even consider this text.) The teaching materials that "complement" the text are also very sub-par and amount to little more than advertisements for the author, and are just unusable in a modern class room.   
 This book was ok in the aspect that I did get a few ideas about some ways for my children to start forming a relationship with the gods.  I feel that some of there advice on how to handle children is unrealistic.  Makes me wonder if they had jobs.  because anyone with a job cant do most of the things they talk about.  Also it is to hard to do anything like they do when you have more than one child.  These people obviously only had one to deal with.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 I gave this book up after a hundred or so pages without the giraffe in question showing up. 
 Would have been a better book if the author had stuck to the subject of Freemasonry instead of spreading misinformation about the OTO.  The author does a disservice to the reader who might not know any better, as well to the many fine Masons who enjoy membership in both Freemasonry and the OTO.  Perhaps if he had spoken to one of these Brothers some of his misconceptions might have been corrected and I would encourage the Brother to consider interviewing a few Masons who are also OTO members for any subsequent editions or other books so that information is more factual and less sensationalized 
 I have never read a Danielle Steel novel, but my friend bought it when we were inter-railing through Europe last week so I picked it up out of sheer boredom.   The grammar is atrocious, and the repetitiveness highly irritating. How many times do Sasha and what's his name need to break up and get back together? How often does Sasha need to cry about this artsy guy?   This book was so annoying that I had to literally put it down and stop reading it.  I will never pick up another Danielle Steel book, and I am still appalled that the publishing world even let this one be published! 
 Andy Rooney's writings are usually well worth reading. The letters certainly were, and very enjoyable. However, I was more than shocked and offended by Mr.Rooney's attack of religion. This is one of his books I wished I had skipped 
 I bought this book soon after the death of my 11 year old daughter. I found the approach very uncomfortable and it left me feeling as though i was failing because i was not following the prescribed way of grieving. The examples given in the book led me to belive that if i did not follow the advice of the author i would be doomed to a life of sadness and despair. The most damaging aspect of the text was the insistance in "letting go", and idea i still find very difficult to accept. The freightening examples of people who had become overly interseted in the cause of a loved one's death only to fall victim to the sane illness would have been better placed in horror fiction. Stear clear, this book will help know one except the author 
 The author explains at the start of the book that he was obliged to write it as part of a contractual agreement to deliver seperat books on each of the fab four. He clearly has no empathy with McCartney and treats him as a run of the mill songwriter and performer with a knack for commerical success. The problem is that this renders any subsequent analysis half hearted and also leads him to write far more about McCartney collaboraters such as Denny Laine than of McCartney himself. So we never get under the skin of the artist nor come any closer to understanding the creative tension and impact of his music. I can only reccommend for the completist who wants to get a reference to secondary Macca sources. 
 As someone who studied meta-mathematics at Caltech and UCLA, I found this book disappointing-stylistically, mathematically and philosophically. To paraphrase the physicist Pauli, this isn't right; this isn't even wrong. This well-meaning man's editors should do a little bit of legwork before reprinting a man's inflated self-appraisal. I am so disappointed in this book that I am seriously considering returning it for a refund.   I guess I should blame myself. My first response to the editorial comment naming the author as the intellectual heir to Gdel and Turing was, "Gregory who?" Shelah, Solovay, Martin: these are names I know, but who is Gregory Chaitin? I should have gone with my gut. In retrospect, it is telling that all the jacket quotes are from freewheeling authors of popularizations, not from respected philosophers, logicians, or scientists.  The entire book is written in an embarrassingly gushing, adolescent style full of boldface and exclamation points. I know that the author was trying to write an enthusiastic, accessible book of philosophical and methodological advocacy, but this doesn't excuse shoddy editorial craftsmanship.   Don't take my word for it. Let the author speak for himself. From page 7, "Gdel's 1931 work on incompleteness, Turing's 1936 work on uncomputability, and my own work on the role of information, randomness and complexity have shown increasingly emphatically that the role that Hilbert envisioned for formalism in mathematics is best served by computer programming languages[.]"   Imagine if a working composer wrote, "Bach's preludes and fugues, Beethoven's symphonies, and my own string quartets have shown increasingly emphatically..." This man's reputation in his declared field is nowhere near his apparent stature in his own mind. The ideas discussed in this book are worthy of late-night musings over a nice brandy, or maybe a Scientific American article, but only after extensive revision. They are not ready for publication in a monograph.  From pages 148-149, "This book is full of amazing case studies of new, unexpected math ideas that reduced the complicated to the obvious. And I've come up with a few of these ideas myself. How does it feel to do that? [...] You have to be seized by a demon, and our society doesn't want too many people to be like that! [...] In fact, I only really feel alive when I'm working on a new idea, when I'm making love to a woman (which is also working on a new idea, the child we might conceive) or when I'm going up a mountain! It's intense, very intense. [...] I push everything else away. [...] I don't pay the bills. [...] And you can't force yourself to do it, any more than a man can force himself to make love to a woman he doesn't want. [...] People may think that something's wrong with me, but I'm okay, I'm more than okay."  And there you have it. I was hoping for a book to catch me up on some of the recent advances in meta-mathematics and how these ideas bear on science and philosophy. For a far better viewpoint on how information science influences modern physics, check out Charles Seife, Decoding the Universe. 
 I mean no disrespect for the FATHER OF POLYMER CHEMISTRY, but its really hard to follow this book especially the equations......they just come out of nowhere.. 
 Temperance Brennan is an American forensic anthropologist .The author is a anthropologist in real life and I feel she gave to much detail as to body parts & conditions ,& locations in the book , and in about the 3rd chapter to much time and space is wasted talking about "Gabby " including in detail where gabby lives and details that surround the outside of Gabbys place & How Gabby and Tempe were friends from GRad to man parts in life . Book was not for me I dropped it at the 3rd chapter . 
 LO QUE TE PUEDO DECIR ES PRIMERAMENTE AUN NO ME HA LLEGADO ESTE ARTICULO, PARA PODER APRECIAR A AMBOS ARTISTAS JUNTOS EN CUANTO ME LLEGUE PODRE EMITIR ALGUNA OPINION, POR EL MOMENTO NO PUEDO EN TANTO NO TENGA EN MIS MANOS ESTE ARTICULO 
 Yet another on the list of corny comedies, summed up aptly by its line, "I was there, she was horny, it's called timing."  But that doesn't make a review, so an attempt must be made.   We start with a script slimmer than Bill Clinton's book of good conduct. A curiously sumptuous lawyer, played by Liz Hurley, informs Mr. Doug (the 'Dawg' of the title I suppose though it's unclear) that he must apologize to all the women he has whammed bammed thank you ma'amed before he can avail of his late grandmother's plush inheritance.   In a heartbeat our lawyer and client have strapped themselves to white leather seats in a ragtop Merc convertible and set sail around the mounts of southern California (which we see in the same persnickety shot about ten times) to catch up with a choice coterie of has-been girlfriends.  Unchanged attire would suggest all this riding happens in one day but what's logic to do in these circumstances. We keep watching to discover how these "ex" women might have turned out. No two of them are alike, the ensemble of eccentricity is interesting. A few expected botches later things take a smooth turn and predictably Lawyer & Client Inc ends up bonding like spit and tobacco.  Just so things don't end up too simple though, a twist is chucked in as an afterthought but sadly it's a little too little too late. I'd catch it on cable when three laughs per hour were not unacceptable.  
 As someone who has been a Paulo Coelho fan, this book is a disappointment. If you do like Paulo's books, please avoid this particular one.   Once you read the book, you get the feeling that the story is quite pointless. Yeah, sure it illuminates the life of a prostitute and circumstances surrounding the same (with some restraint I might add) but fails to deliver any insight into life or its meaning.   Paulo's strength - his ability to take the 'helicopter' view into all things in life is tested and does not stand up. While he does make an effort to look for "sacred sex" and introduces S&M, it is quite apparent that he is not convinced himself.   In a sense, you are left with the sensation of seeing a very expensive car grind to a halt at a cheap motel where the protagonists step out for their eleven minutes.  Avoid this novel - it is a series of disconnected events which don't really mean much 
 I guess I'd better confess right away: I didn't finish this book. I only made it a third of the way before I was too disgusted to finish it. I'm sure there are many useful things I could learn if I could choke it all down, but it was very difficult.   I don't think it helped that I just finished The Case Against Wal-Mart by Al Norman.  I think it's great that Wal-Mart was able to bring goods to smaller towns that really didn't have access to a department store or discount retailer, but I can't get over the desruction of American businesses, American jobs and the terrible wages and benefits for American workers (not to mention all the foreign workers who produce Wal-Mart goods) that have become standard operating procedure. Lower costs at any cost is not a responsible way to run a business, and while I agree that Soderquist did a great job at making himself rich and the company successful, I think the damage is costly 
 This is one of the worst books I have ever seen - effectively a PhD thesis poorly converted into a over priced book that is full of technical, grammatical and typographical errors. For example, the following paragraph is from page 56 of the book:  "McDonalds began a trial program in New York City that offers an hour of free 'Intel-verified' WLAN access for a 60-mintue [sic] session for a nominal fee."  I have no idea how something like this could get past the editors, let alone the spell checker. Being a PhD candidate I can identify the technical errors, however someone who is not up to speed would easily mistake them as fact.  Most of the diagrams are very ordinary - certainly not of a quality that matches the price tag. About the only thing going for this book is the fact that it provides a broad summary of the area and has a large bibliography, which in turn provides references to more accurate and useful material.  If you need a book on this topic I'd suggest checking out Zhili Sun's "Satellite Networking : Principles and Protocols" 
 I have seen some bad ones in my day but this is the worst. I couldn't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life on it. They literally stole scenes from Runaway Train in this. Not the ideas, they stole the filmed scenes. The train kept going from one engine to the four in RT. The continuity was a joke. Had a semi truck go from tandem axle to single back to tandem. Seems like some of the actors must have had a house payment coming up 
 Sandford has done his best to be "fair" to the insufferable and untalented Paul McC.   And yet he bends over backwards (or maybe forwards) to say nice things about the even less talented Linda and even seems to have a soft spot for Heather Mills (Milks) McCartney, who has become a spokesman for IHOP recently.     When will somebody come along and really tell the truth about this bozo?   
 I thought the art had a certain charm, and used strictly as a picture book for children who can't yet read, I think it's quite nice.  (Too bad you can't make up your own story to go with it.)  The moment the child starts to read, though--better hide it quick, because...  Unfortunately, the book reads like a condensed Communist Manifesto for kids (as others have noted), or a Socialist agenda primer.  I don't know for sure that's what Marcus Pfister had as an aim, and I'm not going to speculate on his politics.  He has three kids and may raise them as he likes, and indulge in any such philosophical musings as float his boat.  Yes, I suppose sharing is nice.  Certainly sharing one's talents and abilities for the betterment of others is a great thing--but in America, we get paid for that (charity is voluntary, not coerced).  Furthermore, stripping yourself of what makes you unique and interesting (not necessarily BETTER, just unique and interesting), or giving away all your possessions, is a lousy way to make and keep friends, isn't it?  Is this book implying that somehow friendship can only be obtained by placating envy (a negative personal quality that should be dealt with by self-examination and intent to change, not pandering)?  Is it saying that being interesting and having unique qualities is bad?  Almost seems like it, at least to me.  Furthermore, there's an overtone of "only by belonging to a group can you have self-worth," which is as hoary a case of balderdash as ever I've seen.  Of course, people who agree with that egregious sentiment will disagree with me, but that won't make them right.  (The two stars, if you must know, are for the art. 
 I remember listening to this years ago, and I thought I would add this to my cd library, now I know why it has been years sense I've listened to it,, very sqeaky, dull, slow paced stuff, Bob Segar makes this stuff sound like tin foil.. 
 Based upon other positive reviews I had high hopes for this book being informative, but it bases its data more on speculation than on fact.  When this book was first written at the time of the "revolution" (in 1979), the author wrote that he had heard that Israeli soldiers were part of the Shah's defense forces in attacks against anti-Shah rioters.  But twenty years later by the time of this 2001 re-publication, the author had not been able to ascertain that Israeli units had indeed been part of the Shah's defense forces -- speculation on rumor, but no determinable fact, although the anti-Shah forces had twenty years to comb through Iranian documents.  As the author presents a thin-bone background to the theology of Shi'ism, a reader is left powerfully hungry in looking for some 'meatiness' to the author's explanations.  Although this book is based upon four lectures that the author gave shortly after the 1979 revolution, the author rambles about in trying to make some coherent story. The author explains that the Shiite are split between two schools of thought, the Usuli and the Akhbaris, as to whether or not modern Shiites can "engage in independent reasoning with respect to legal questions" in the absence of the Hidden Imam.  The author examines this issue as it underpins the development of Ayatollah Khomeini's rebellion against the Shah: Khomeini argued that Shiite imams needed to take an active role in fomenting Islamic rebellion against the pro-secular Shah, rather than remaining passive.  The author all too briefly notes one of the imams' complaints against the Shah: that he was taking mosque-controlled lands and selling it to private individuals and thereby curtailing their income from those properties.  The author does not hide his pro-Shiite faith.  In response to one question asked of the author in 1979 as to whether or not he agreed that: "If national boundaries were taken away....the differences between Sunni and Shi'i would disappear in one instant", the author replied back then: "Very definitely."  However, twenty years later, by 2001 the author apparently had had a good dressing down by his Shi'i superiors and had to add a corrective footnote: "the differences themselves are deep-rooted and ultimately irreducible" (pg. 81).  This is not a book to read to learn about Shi'ism.  It is more of a television "talking heads" presentation based from several public lectures; a lot of polemics, but short on fact regarding riot casualties.  It barely rates being worthwhile for reading in understanding how the anti-Shah movement developed.  It is barely worth reading for a background 'feel' as to why religious leaders (imams) should be the only ruling leaders of an Islamic government (mujtahid); the people may vote for only those candidates who have prior approval from the imams and who toe the Shi'i theology.  This isn't a textbook, it is more of a compilation of "off the cuff" extemporaneous remarks in a lecture hall. Okay for a novice just starting to explore this topic, but read it at the library before buying it.  
 Don't make the some mistake as me¡ I found the previews interesting and I'm a Cohen's fan, but this cd is too bad. Spend your money in other Cohen's stuffs 
 This book has very little to teach you and it's virtually unreadable. Make sure you read one or two pages before you buy in case you are like me and you can't stand his style 
 I don't normally write these reviews, but I feel a responsibility to other readers to warn them away from this book.  If you don't want to know any details about the book, you have the option of not reading this review, but, if you want to know what you're letting yourself in for, read on.  If you are a horse lover, I srongly advise against reading The Horse Whisperer.  If you want a romantic love story, you should also look elsewhere.  If you want insight into dealing with a trauma, so sorry, no luck here.  The book opens with a graphic description of a violent accident involving a girl and her horse, which results in death.  Though I found these scenes truly disturbing, I hoped the trip taken by the girl and her mother to find an expert who could help to heal the girl and her horse would prove redeeming somehow.  Instead, the experience was muddled and pointless.  The few instances involving the "whisperer" attempting to heal the horse from its trauma struck me as something that would further traumatize the poor animal.  Nothing he does ever seems to break through and cause the horse any improvement.  Additionally, the mother appears to have no purpose in the story except wandering aimlessly around the farm, occasionally cheating on her husband with this man, and becoming pregnant with his child.  The book's focus then turns almost completely to this ill-advised affair which doesn't really have any chemistry to it.  The man and the mother don't seem that attracted to each other, and evidently only end up together because the plot required it of them.  During all this, the girl's psychological problems resulting from the accident are basically ignored.  She pretty much drops out of sight until the very close of the book when she is taken by the horse whisperer to witness another graphically brutal occurrence, which ends in another horrific death.  Apparently, what we are to glean from this book is that, if you are a woman who can't have children with your husband, getting knocked up by another man will save your marriage.  If you are a young girl who happens to witness a violent death, nothing will cure you except witnessing another violent death.  If you're a horse, you can just figure things out for yourself.  The fact that everyone seems blissfully happy after all this absurdity, just feels as though the author got bored with what he was writing and figured he had to wrap it up with a Hollywood ending somehow so he could get it off to the publisher quickly.  In the end, I see no reason to waste your time with this book.  I wish I could get back the hours of my life I spent on it.      
 I do not know if it is defective, but we were disappointed to find that this item does not work with any of our equipment.  
 * Sloppy writing ("Beg the question" should not be used to mean "prompt the question", for one).  * Shallow, inept analysis.  * Suggests all self-help books are inherently worthless.  No treatment of the idea that one might actually benefit from some (any?) of the self-help literature.    * It is as if he hasn't actually read any of the books, just flipped through them to the bullet points.  * Wild overextension from self-help to a wide range of societal problems with no data at all to back it up.  * Overall, an unconsidered book on a topic which demands a more serious and careful treatment 
 This nonsensical bio is written entirely from a blind feminist perspective.  The research is suspect.  The prose amateurish.  The details gossipy and contrived. If Eleanor Roosevelt was truly a woman of thought and progressivism, then Cook has done her an unforgivable disservice. If you're looking to understand Roosevelt's honest-to-goodness place in history, you will not find it is this intellectually offensive work 
 I was extremely disappointed by the last Pickett novel and hoped this one would return to the quality of the first two.  The book opens with an intriguing mystery-the inexplicable mutilation of wild animals-followed by two horrific murders. Joe Pickett has found his moral compass again. The portraits of Joe and his family are superb. The first half of the book is a page turner.  Then, the resolution....  The villains were ridiculous, the solution of the murders was extraordinarily contrived.  High hopes for this outing--not fullfilled.  I'll pass on Pickett five.      
 Eww! I read this book because it was recommended in a well-known woman's magazine. Obviously, it was a paid review. Boring, unbelieveable, poor character development, I didn't care about the characters and the story was PREDICTABLE.  This is the only book by Norah Roberts I have ever read, and I have no reason to want to read others. If you like to read confession magazines and formulaic romance novels, perhaps you will like Montana Sky too, although it is a step down from the worst romance novel I ever read.  I read the entire book...I kept waiting for it to take off.  Don't buy this book, don't even waste your time borrowing it from the library. It really is that bad 
 The ABC's of Violin for the Absolute Beginner by Janice Tucker Rhoda needs an improvement in its presentation.  The book starts out with a picture of a violin with a bow and labels their parts.  Lesson 1 names the the spaces and lines of a staff.  That's fine up to this point.  Lesson 2 instructs you to pluck the strings without telling you how.  Should you pluck them with your thumb and pointing finger  pulling each string away from the violin or pluck them with your finger nails or simply rub them with one of your fingers, and with which hand?  It also shows a small diagram of labeled strings on their unrealistic looking bridge.  Then it immediately introduces a staff with labeled notes.  Just before the staff it gives the term Pizzicato without first defining it.  Lesson 3 appears similarly.  Lesson 4 Instructs you to play with your bow without showing you  close-up and portrait type photographs of how to hold the violin and bow.  The drawings of a person holding the violin and bow are inadequate in their detail.  Then it tells you at the  bottom of the page to Pizzicato the first time and Arco the 2nd time without first defining these terms again.  The page to the right of lesson 4 shows you a drawings of violin proper posture and a drawing of the left hand with numbered fingers 1-4 and a staff.  However, for an absolute beginner this does not show how the fingers are placed on the finger board over the string(s).  For example, should you place your finger nails directly over the strings, the side of your fingers, or the finger tips?  Lesson 5 through lesson 11 likewise leave out the actual picture views of how your fingers are placed, as well as do not define terms such as "Open A".  The diagram shown to represent finger placement does not give you exact positioning of your fingers.  It would be best to give the diagram and a picture for each instance to clearly show finger placement.  On page 46 the student is instructed to write the letters above each note as well as to write the finger positions below each note.  I feel that this exercise should of been given starting with lesson 3, and finally culminate with this all inclusive exercise as a review.  On page 47 we finally are shown the glossary which defines some terms but is incomplete and lacks more detail to be of real use to a beginner student.  In summary, if you are an absolute beginner and have never played another muscial instrument then this book is not for you!  If you are a violin instructor then this book is for you as your students will be dependent on you to fill-in the many holes left with this book.  If you wish to learn to play the violin by yourself and don't have the time or the money for an instructor then do not buy this book.  Lastly, if you are considering using a violin instructor, ask them for their recommendation for a book and then see for yourself if their recommendation suits your needs, if not then look for another instructor 
 It starts out being a not a bad reference and some of the examples are adequate, if not particularly insightful, or dealt with in any great depth.  The author belongs to the colorful detail school of fiction writing -- he tells you every chance he gets.  Fine.  But by the final third of the book, the author is into total self promotion, and it gets on ones nerves.  Instead of "How Fiction Works" being the title, perhaps it should have been "How Fiction has Worked Very, Very Well for Me."  The book appears to have been dashed out to meet a contract committment without any serious thought put into it.  Mr. Hall may well be the marvelous writer he claims to be, but as an editor he should aspire to improvement.  I bought this book on the basis of an Amazon programmed recommendation and the reviewer comments.  Sad to say, the rule about letting the buyer beware still applies 
 Complete waste of time!  I am done reading Robin Cook books for now..The story line for this book is so stupid I am amazed Mr. Cooks editors even allowed it to be printed..I'm not sure about the hospitals where Robin lives or works at, but in the area where I live, if just one patient died there would be an immediate investigation, but here we have several patients die from unknown causes and the characters just move along like it's no big deal..The Wilsons even allow their daughter to be admitted!!!  Give me a break!!  Like I said..don't waste your time on this one!!  
 Every once in a while I like to pick up a book that is outside the realm of usual reading, and look for a surprise, or spark to keep the fires of imagination from dying out - it is with this mindset I picked up "Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now."  And what did I find as a result of my maverick literary exploration?  Ehh...  Ms. Angelou may not take anything for her journey, but based on the cover price she will take $17.00 to tell you a bit about it, and even this may not even seem like that bad a deal were it not for the fact that either her journey was bland, her insights wanting or her conclusions misguided - whatever the cause, this book is dreadful.  If you are looking for the usual meaningless new age spiritual gobble-gook; i.e., about boundaries, respect, finding ones direction, learning what it means to be a women, etc. then this journey is for you - but if you see this nonsense as the nonsense it is, you will be best served my buckling up your shoes and journeying elsewhere 
 It's hard to sympathize with a woman who does not name her child until the baby is two weeks old (page 33), and crosses the border into child neglect by staying in a home where there is no heat or hot water in winter, and her baby's nose is "permanently streaming" (page 258).  She also lies to her boyfriend over and over, for no really good reason.  This book, for me, was 328 pages of relentless negativity.  I understand that new motherhood is extremely difficult, but to hear over and over the following:  - being with a baby is really hard (insert 10,000 examples) - we can't count on support from any grandparents because the family on both sides sucks - My relationship with my boyfriend is awful. - Lying and doing things over my boyfriend's objections is acceptable.  etc.  I couldn't stand the negativity.  Nina needed to be on Prozac or some other type medicine, and preferably in therapy.  A woman who stays in a rundown house in winter, when she has plenty of money and other places to stay, where even total strangers say to her "you're staying there with a baby?" is not someone I find sympathetic.  There is, as usual with chick-lit, a happy ending, though this one is qualified, and as in many chick-lit books I've read, it's not deserved, IMO.  There's no really good reason to believe Nina's life is looking up.  I like serious books as much as anyone else, but I want the characters to learn and grow so I don't feel I spent my time with someone who has a miserable life and just can't stop complaining about it, for hours.  Someone who never seems to take effective action.    I was relieved to close the book 
 Yeah, this thing is a peice of junk.  Its made out of extremely cheap card board.  Ignore the lies in the product description that say it's sturdy, water resistant, and leather like.  You also have to asemble it yourself and guess what?  It doesn't fit togehter right because the dimesnions of the cheap card board don't line up to where its supposed to snap together.    I'd rather suggest lighting a 10 dollar bill on fire.  At least you will be more entertained by watching the bill burn then you will be by trying to put this thing together and then throwing it in the trash can afterwards.    Hopefully, one day companies will give us decent DVD storage.  However, don't give your money to this company trying to rape the consumer with their extremely over-priced junk 
 I actually found the early part of the book dealing with the nuclear weapon okay -- not great like Cussler's books. Just okay. But there appeared to be a major change in style, going from a poor Cussler writing style to completely boring and pathetic. But I also had some sympathy for the American tycoon whose son had been killed by terrorists -- and he was the "bad guy" -- so I lost interest in finishing the book.  
 Nicely drawn characters; good writing; different and compelling story. Why don't I like it, then? Because of what the author did with these things. It ends in disaster and proves nothing. Afterwards, I find that this novel lingers in the mind like a bad taste in the mouth. I wish to God I'd never read it 
 This was the first Madeline Hunter book that I have bought and read. From the reviews on here, I expected to find a highly engrossing historical romance story, but instead, this book just drags on, and gets tedious and boring. The storyline is lacking. And the characters are not likable. I couldn't even finish this book. Not a keeper. 
 The Amazon description says Vol. 1-3, boxed set, hardcover.  That is all true.  What they don't tell you is that there are actually six volumes.  The box in which it comes is clearly marked, "Volumes 1-3 (of six)."  That would have been a much better description for Amazon to have used.  If you have volumes 4-6 and you are looking to complete the set, this book is for you.  If you are looking for the complete set, look elsewhere 
 Bad.  No flow to the writing, jarring anecdotal excerpts.  No developed plot or characters.  Do not read this book, read Molon Labe instead 
 A missed opportunity by Bruce Springsteen to produce Live Box-Set Two. Unlike "Live 1975 to 1985", he could of balanced the ledger from his first live project with a much better selection from the final ten shows at Madison Square Garden 2000. At this stage in his career it would not be important to master a selection of live takes from different dates and venues. Instead, a vast repertoire of his music was performed at this one venue, according to the set lists of these ten shows. If Bruce saw this and implemented it, this could have set the record straight with his fans and the bootleggers. A fan's dream I suppose. Otherwise a poor live CD capitalizing on the margin of time it took to release the much better DVD product. It is obvious that some of the most important live songs were included as an afterthought.  I have no problem with Bruce's politics but I am disappointed with the quality of his recent releases on CD. In the end, this is what matters most to me as a fan of the Boss.       
 This is the third Steiner book I have tried to read and I had the same experience as the first two books (Egyptian Myths and Mysteries and The Fourth Dimension). I have come to the conclusion that the information published from Stieners lectures has too much wandering around and not getting to the point to be very useful.  Steiner was definately ahead of his time.  He possessed great esoteric and astral vision.  But, his problem seems to be that his audiences were very dense and his presentation style is just too sparse for the modern reader.    When he is able to convey information it is based on ideas that he has perceived and is not adequately able to explain.  For instance, in this book he goes into the etheric energies which come into a cow through it's horns which help it digest its food with supporting energy release through the hooves.  Thus for his biodynamic preparations a cows horn needs to be used to let the core mixture sit within the horn underground for six months.  Then you can only use a horn 4-6 times before the energy is used up.    So you are left wondering first, where are you going to get a horn (not from a slaughter house he says)?  What exactly about the horn gives it the magic?  If it is the shape of the horn then why would it get used up?  And he says if you have an airy barn you can store the horn in there because its better.  Without some additional explanation, which he never really makes clear, none of this makes any sense.  I think that most of the people I know of in metaphysical circles who can think will no longer accept information from anyone without it having some basis either in a related science or something directly experiential or both.  We are moving away from accepting things based alone on faith.  Even the sacred writings tell us we have to test what we hear.  With most of Steiners writings, or I should say the books transcribed from his lectures, there is no way for you to trace Steiners path and come to the same observations yourself.  Clearly in metaphysical traditions such as shamanism self experience, or gnosis, is essential.  Without this ability to really get into Steiners words what he says remains woo-woo 
 Having worked on 42nd Street for the past few years, this book intrigued me. But -- I have never read a bigger work of fiction!  He is unable to get simple items such as people's titles correct, their bios, and in some cases the company they work for - - let alone know the accurate history of the block.  This book is written like a tabloid and should be treated as such 
 Wonderful information presented very nicely.  However, if searching for a book with photos/drawings of birds to aid young potential birdwatchers a buyer may want to make another choice.  The illustrations are much too muted/soft for noting distinctions/characteristics which would be helpful for child and adult alike. 
 This book is divided into two sections. The first describes several woodworking techniques that are useful in making this furniture.  This material is adequate and infomative. However, if you are planning to make G&G furniture, you should also buy Darrell Peart's book regarding techniques for Greene and Greene furntiure. Mr. Peart's discussion is more extensive.  The second section is the measured drawings.  I have mixed feelings about this section. Mr. Lang tells us that he really wants the reader to think hard about the furniture before beginning construction. Therefore, he provides the minimum necessary infomation.  I disagree.  I am purchasing this book because I want my life to be easy.  I've built many pieces of furniture from drawings and it would be so very nice to have dimensions that are repeated instead of flipping pages.  Mr. Lang does this because he learned mechanical drafting, where each dimension is provided only once.  In mechanical drafting this is important because of tolerance stacking.  But tolerance stacking is not an issue with furniture.  He writes that he can make mistakes in his drawings and he wants us to verify his measurements.  Wonderful (voice dripping with sarcasm).  So, I am left flipping pages again.  Now, for specific criticisms.  The drawings for the Gamble Chiffonier are woefully inadequate if the reader wants to reproduce this.  First, there are no dimensions provided for the mirror assembly on top.  The reader is left to determine the dimensions from the scale printed on the bottom of the page.  I find this utterly unacceptable. These are supposed to be measured drawings--why keep the measurements a secret? The drawings in the book are too small to get accurate dimensions. There are no details provided that show how the mirror is attched into the frame.   Also, the drawer details are lacking. The drawer sides are topped with another piece of wood.  What species is this?  Also, there is a drop down along the edge.  How deep is this drop?  Does it vary according to the size of the drawer? It shows that these edges are attached with round things. Are these ebony plugs? Mother of pearl?  Also, Mr. Lang shows two types of handles on the drawers (the bottom handles are different than the top handles on page 51). This is likely a typo but I can't be certain.   The drawing 'profile of the rails and stiles on front' is so small that it is useless.  Also, why can't he provide dimensions for this?  Why does he keep these a secret?  Let me criticize another drawing, the Gamble Entry Table. The profile view of the legs is very important. But the author leaves so much unsaid.  For example, the width of the upper portion of the leg is 1-3/4" but the bottom is left unsaid.  What is the radius of the curves?  Unsaid. Where should the radius be cut?  Also, the reader is left to 'eyeball' the location of the cloud lifts on the upper rail. Sigh.  The Gamble Bed.  The author details the original twin size and adds drawings for a queen size (very nice). But I was left wondering how the head and foot boards are attached to the rails. Also, there is absolutely nothing shown to support the mattress.  Now a few general comments:  The author should show pictures of the original piece.  Only about half are shown with photos. The inclusion of the kitchen cabinets from the Gamble House is great.  The lack of the famous sideboard from the Thorsen house is a glaring ommission. And finally, the author shows all of the mortise and tenon joints as housed mortise and tenon joints.  This is great if you are looking for authenticity.  But the lack of so many other details required for a modicum of authenticty leaves this reviewer wondering why all of fuss here and absolutely nothing in other places.  After all that, is this book worth buying?  Yes, absolutely. It will help you create furniture in the Greene and Geene style but be prepared to make a lot of your own judgments.  If you want to reproduce a piece, you'll need to head to Pasadena and measure it yourself.  (By the way, in the recipe for the stain on page 38, the author lists 1/8 part sylvan green.  Because yellow and blue make green, you can buy a slightly different shade of yellow and skip the purchase of the green.  Any art student in an art store should be able to help.)  In response to Mr. Greer.  If you can find printed dimensions for the mirror on the chiffonier, more power to you.  But they ain't there in my edition.  If you take a close look you will find other places wwhere dimensions are lacking.  In response to Mr. Gabriel:  You state exactly why I am disappointed in this book--it requires a lot of "inference" and "derivation". Sure, I and most other woodworkers could build furniture that looks great from these shop drawings.  But too many derivations are required in order for these drawing to be great. Each derivation is a place for a clerical error to arise.  Woodworking takes too much time as it is. The drawings could be so much more helpful and they should have been.   And you are right--I am a sad, lonely pathetic man.  Even my dog won't play with me because I smell so bad.  My cat ran away years ago.  Hell, they won't even feed me at the homeless shelter becuse they say I am communicable (whatever that means).  I haven't had a decent conversation with a woman in years, let alone a date.  But hey, I am a master of video games.  Have you tried that new Wii yet? 
 I first saw the original movie (Les Visiteurs) in my French class, so when the American version came out I was very excited to see what would happen.  I wasn't disappointed, it was just as good as the original.  And the soundtrack during the movie is very good, but by itself, without a screen in front of me, it leaves something to be desired.  There are only a few tracks that are good, and they are quite short.  The music is good, but only in the context of the movie, so buy the movie and enjoy the music along with the comedy 
 I thought I was getting a good deal and a good product at a cheap price, but instead I got what a paid for and nothing more.  Cheap product at a cheap price.  Only used a few times, literally 2-3 times, then one time when my girlfriend put the glass down on the table it broke and wine went everywhere.  Luckily we acted quickly or else a bunch of carpet would have been ruined.  They feel really cheap too.  If you only want to use them a few times, get them, I know we will never get these again 
 What a disappointment.  I was looking forward to Anne Perry's new series, hoping for another set of lively characters and satisfying stories, driven by good writing and informed by history and period details.  But the most charitable thing I can find to say about this book is that perhaps it will have been worth slogging through if it sets up better plotting and characterization in the rest of the books in the series.  It certainly doesn't stand alone as a novel:  despite its 300+ page length, it's populated with paper-thin characters, some of whom appear only once and to no purpose, carry on interminable and uninteresting conversations (or internal monologues) that fail to advance the extremely flimsy plot, which HAS NO PAYOFF.  This book felt like Perry has become so enamored of her own prose style (which is, as ever, exemplary) that she's forgotten to give us people and a mystery (or at least a story) to care about. 
 Written with a liberally conservative bias, aggrandizing the man who was president rather than providing any useful or substantive information about events that transpired during his tenure of office 
 Mr. Miller of Canada has said it well and thoroughly.  Apparently, according to Granger, he never met a beautiful woman that he did not fall in love.  On the other hand, the three men in his life appear to have been accidents, from the naval officer in Hawaii who seduced him after Granger noted he had already had sex twice with a prostitute.  he encountered Arthur Laurents and only ended up living with him for the lack of other accommodations.  And the man we assume he has been with for how many years (?) was like an afterthought and if the reader is not careful you might miss him entirely although he is listed as a co-author.  At least Granger was a star in his own eyes. 
 A typical war story. While readable, it doesn't stack up to Flags of Our Fathers and Indestructible, Jack Lucas, Medal of Honor 
 I felt this book did not give enough information about the subjects they were to have special sections for.  It gave just enough information on each subject to get many beginers in trouble.  I bought the book for the special section on shearing.  There was one paragraph and a referance page to see a picture the was not even on that page. This book was deffinatly a disapointment 
 I read all 12 of these things. Armageddon has it's moments but as with most of this series is sorely lacking. Nicolae and Leon are pretty lame as the incarnation of evil.. Nicolae acts more like a spoiled 11 yr old with the world's arsenal then the antichrist.  And Leon (was a buffoon and lacky) rather then "the False Prophet")   People either love or hate this series.. I for one do buy into the Dogma the series teaches. It is much different then the theology and spiritual beliefs I hold dear. 
 Years ago, a group of children playing accidently kill one of their friends, and decide to keep a secret. Years later when they're all in high school, the girls twin brother exacts bloody revenge against them. Your typical 80s horror film, not very notable other than Leslie Nielsen, and Jamie Lee Curtis. This is one prom, better left unattended 
 First off, the person who wrote about her ingenious husband who invented the trick of squeezing the air out before screwing the top on?  Yeah, I'd call him creative, but not the one who 'invented' that trick.  I had to giggle to myself and then post this publicly... myself and my whole group of friends used that trick.  Secondly, the liners are too expensive, and third, how in the world do you mix formula in these things?  They worked great for breastmilk, but the hassle of having to mix formula in a seperate container and then pour it into the liners was just too much for me at 3 am with a screaming kid.  Even waiting to warm it up under hot running water took too long.  Give me the regular bottles any day.   PS- bisphenol-A... what about high fructose corn syrup, cargeenan (which is the sludge that comes from soybean processing and is put in nearly every food on the market as a preservative) and even - gasp- the probability that your kid might someday eat a bug that has eaten off a chemically-treated cornfield!  I'm all for protecting your kids but you can't save them from everything and there are much more harmful substances out there 
 Book contains many useful lists / charts / comparisons to define giftedness.  Many helpful hints about raising a gifted child.  Main criticism is that the book is more about raising children in general -- and  may push those with "normal" kids into thinking they have gifted  ones and down that track -- when they should not. Gifted kids are the  exception, not the norm as this book makes it seem 
 Not worth buying.  Pillow flattens out as soon as your head hits the pillow and it is noisy.  
 I've been in the software industry for quite awhile, and I've watched as the personal computer industry evolved from one where there were dozens of machines being sold to consumers down to the two primary platforms of windows and macintosh.  While there is no doubt that the macintosh is the minority platform, there is also no doubt that its continued survival has engendered an unexplained amount of hate from those who are not fans of the machine.   This book, in summary, is the longwinded rant of one such user. As someone who knows first hand a number of the situations covered in the book, and who has a generally solid understanding for situations not covered in the book, I believe the author of this book sat down and wrote it out by himself without any fact checking, without any real interviews (or he ignored or misunderstood the people he interviewed).  There are so many factual errrors in this book, its not funny- -from little things like the years events happened or the locations of companies or the person who held a particular role at a particular time, to grossly innacurate assumptions about things the author could not possibly know-- such as the minutes of boardroom discussions.   This is a smear job, thru and thru, and like most smear jobs its repetitive, self-contradictory, and downright dishonest.  I think the only reason the author has not been sued is that doing so would give this book far more attention than it deserves.  Windows fans like to kick apple and the mac, even when they are down.  Windows seems to engender some sociopathic sadism in people.   IF you want to learn more about apple, find another book... this book is just a windows fan bashing steve jobs for having taste 
 Overall, I was entirely disappointed with this camaera.  The packaging and description were deceiving.  There was no view finding screen, only a teeny, tiny window as in a regular camera.  This was a gift for a child who would have had just as much fun with a throw away camera.  I bought it because I wanted to give her a digital that had a large view finding screen.  The construction would not hold up to a single drop on the ground.  I would not recommend this to ANYONE 
 The material was very soft and the pockets certainly big enough for my double pillow-top mattress, but after the first washing (without chlorine bleach)and machine dry, it is starting to pill already.  That's disappointing. It still fits fine on the bed 
 Halfway into the story, my kids asked if we could read something else. I suspect this may be a book that appeals more to adults than to children. The art work is beautiful and the plot worthwhile, but the narrative voice is so distant and emotionless--I expect that is probably what turned my kids off. The girl, the tribe, and the animals don't have names. The piece reads like a prologue rather than a story 
 Actually I have not read this book and probably won't anytime soon.  I understand there is more than one side to everything but am totally offened at the response to Dr. Barach from ISSD.  The organization helped me tremdously when I first found out I had MPD/DID.  I could not find Dr. Barach's response anywhere on here but I would think that in defending the organization the Dr. is also defending those of us who have a legitimate diagnosis of MPD/DID 
 This was my first Amitav Ghosh book after years of hearing people admire him. But I was disappointed. The book starts off interestingly enough, but soon the plot takes over and the characters are reduced to mere devices for the author to make grand political statements about colonialism and its effects. In the process there are simply too many coincidences, too many contrived situations. There is no progression of characters, of a story unfolding. What we get, instead, is a barrage of theses about the postcolonial world.   There are moments of beauty and poignancy in the book, but they are simply too few to hold the reader's attention. Once you get past the professorial lecturing, there's very little by way of a story.   I have since read some of his other books, and I'm happy to say that I liked them all much better than this one 
 As advertised on the cover of this book, anachronistic me-generation guru Peck and his wife Lily set off on a tour of Britain's legendary stone circles, right? Wrong. Peck and Lily do visit some circle sites but this book is about 1% stone circles and 99% Peck going on and on and on and on and on and on about himself, his life, his beliefs, his personal health, and why faithful Lily forgave him for all the pain his freewheeling, skirtchasing lifestyle as one of the "it" crowd of the '60's and '70's self-discovery movement caused her. This is not about Britain's heritage sites, or even about self-help, it's about Peck patting Peck on the back for being such a smart fella. A bad book without any redeeming qualities. A waste of money and time. Oh, and Dr. Peck, Scotland is not, as you claim, "larger than all the rest of the United Kingdom combined." Jeesh 
 You can read some of the other reviews to get an idea of some of the specific errors...  The book is loaded with them from wrong moves to other typos...  How can this book help anyone if half the battle is trying to figure out whats going on...  He has quotes from people in years that they already were dead...  Games with wrong year and people listed...  Sad that they still publish books from this author...  I do not understand why they let books out with so many errors...  When I buy a chess book I expect it to have almost no errors...  This book has more errors than actual things that help players...  If you give this to someone and tell them to find all the errors...  They woudl probably have grandkids and still not find them all...  I dunno what he means by Golden Nuggets...  I think more work went into thinking of name of book than content...  Books like this give chess books a bad name to say very least...  If you want a book on chess strategy try Watson's Advances since Nimzo...  Even The Mammoth Book of Chess will help you more than this item...  Perhaps even consider Silman's Strategy Grandmaster Techniques from A to Z book.  Hopefully one of those books might help you in your game and give you value for your dollar.. 
 Our entire book club disliked this book. We had a hard time feeling a connection to the characters. Howard, the largest presence in this story, feels like a blank at the core. Upon putting this book down, his motivations and what might be in his heart were still a mystery to me. Characters such as Jerome, Victoria, and Carl were intriguingly introduced, but then inconsistently treated for the rest of the text. Especially Carl - he just disappears - no resolution to his story at all. As am homage to Howard's End, some of the parallels were not strongly enough underscored to flesh out this book for me. For example, the heart-to-heart connection between Kiki Belsey and Carlene Kipps does not jump off the page at you the way the connection between Margaret Schlegel and Mrs. Wilcox did.   I thought Zora was one of the most interesting characters, and I like how Smith contrasted her obviously high intelligence and intellectual arrogance with her social awkwardness and sexual insecurity. But Smith makes her smug a bit too often, and so feeling a connection with Zora is difficult as well - most of the time I just wanted to smack her. And I have to agree with the others that Smith needs to brush up on her American characterizations. There was next to no authenticity in that regard. Especially the Southern dialogue - laughable!  It also feels like Smith had a hard time figuring out how to end this book...I understand that end is supposed to be a beginning of sorts...but the fact that there were so many plot threads left dangling, unresolved, by the last page just gave me a feeling of incomplete-ness.   Aaaargh...must go and re-read Howard's End to dispell the queasy feeling left by On Beauty 
 I rented this movie tonight, having vaguely remembered the trailer from 2003.  The synopsis on the box was intriguing enough, although I realized the potential for a hackneyed portrayal of an all-too-common family comedy theme.  I was hoping for a cleverly-written dark dramedy along the lines of a Charlie Kaufman or Wes Anderson film.  What I experienced was a trite presentation of your textbook dysfunctional family.    The film had its moments, but those moments were far too rare.  There was little in the way of character development; in fact, the character who experienced the most development was the dead one.  As screwed up as this family is, I felt no sympathy for any of the characters, and I couldn't bring myself to care about their lives even a little bit.  Even the big revelation at the burial service, perhaps the most interesting moment in the film, was somewhat of a ho-hum moment.    I really had high hopes for this one, but in the end it just fell flat for me 
 Only clips not the entire show.  Like watching an overvie 
 The book Time's Eye by Author C. Clark and Stephen Baxter has some interesting ideas, but poor execution of them.  The book is about time getting mixed up, where parts of the Earth from different timer periods get patched together.  This creates a world where people and objects that historically never existed at the same time together, could exist and interact.  Among those mixed up in the new world, are prehistoric man-apes, an ancient British army, Alexander the Great with the Macedonians, Genghis Khan with the Mongols, soldiers monitoring the Middle East, and astronauts from the future.  Some of the groups join together to survive and look for a way home.  	The book is written horribly.  The authors often describe things in painfully excessive detail, even when it has little effect on the story, such as the effect of the weather on the planet's crust, or the unusual geometry of a peculiar sphere.  Most of the characters are rather simple and take the obvious choice in all situations, making it easy to predict what will happen.  Most of the book works up to one main event, the encounter of Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan, which miserably fails its expectations.  The ending is lame and reminds me of The Wizard of Oz's "You could have gone home the whole time," ending.  The way it was written ruins the ideas behind it.  	I would not recommend this book.  The idea of putting different important figures from history together could be interesting, but the way it was written destroys it.  I think that it had a lot of potential, but failed to make use of it.  Overall the book is dull, and most questions like how this happened, are left unanswered, leaving massive holes in the story.  Find a different book to read 
 Maybe if these were high end rechargable NiMH this would be a reasonable price. But for Alkaline? This is even more ridiculus than the cables they sell. You can find AAA battieries on Amazon for a third of this price 
 Look, I'm generally not too keen on writing up internet reviews on big ol' sellin' sites like this one. BUT, listen, all of you:  Don't get this book.  It was, in a word, GOD AWFUL. Wait, that was two.   50% of it are useless lectures of non-existent subjects and pecuilar scenarios given that all of it is predictions of what happens 60 years in the future -- which you're living right now. Some ideas are a little interesting, but fall flat because of poor dialogue and needless exaggerations.   25% of the book is a love story. Well, it tries to be, until it just goes zany at the end, with one of the most screwed up twists at the end.  And, the other 25%? Just other stuff saying how this is Heinlein's long lost first novel and how you should value this.  Haha. No.  Really, if you've never read Heinlein, DON'T START HERE. Only read this if it's free, you have a huge craze with Heinlein, you've LOVED every one of his books, AND you don't mind being given lectures much more boring, garaunteed, than your 12th grade Calculus teacher.  It's evil, and it should die. Or, it should have never been published. Something like that.  Ugh 
 The most disappointing thing about The News from Paraguay is the beginning, and not precisely because is a bad one, but because in the first chapters of Lily Tuck National Prize awarded novel,  there's a hint that  could have been better than it turn out to be. So I confess that  for a few pages (those that engage a reader with a book) I found  charming the decimononic  story of Ella Lynch, a beautiful widow living in Paris well beyond her means. That even when  Ella decided to follow hairy Franco -a paraguayan stud- not because his looks, not even for this foolish thing called love, but because  he smelled like luxury and power in a faraway land; I still found it a joyable read,  but right when she arrived to her privileged life of  "querida"  of the most powerful man in Paraguay and began to have one baby after another in tumultuous times,  The News from Paraguay became boring and I began to skip entire paragraphes until I got to a previsible end. Based on true facts, the life of a Paraguayan dictator and his irish  mistress; Tuck, who confessed that she never went and wasn't interested in ever going to Paraguay (i think she finally did) can't even get the spanish names right: Mauel, instead of Manuel, Rosaria, instead of Rosario; Iez, instead o Ins. What's the deal with the ? Maybe I lost something in my not so good english, but I still can't get why,  a so so novel like The news from Paraguay, can win a National Prize 
 For the first time in reviewing films, I found myself immediately uninterested in this story.  I don't know if it was the way that it was filmed or the story behind the characters, but it felt bland, overused, and completely unoriginal.  Within the first thirty minutes, I found myself rather apathetic with all the characters and the story.  I felt as if I had seen this structure before, and Tart was providing nothing new to surprise me.  After thinking that it may just be my mood, I stopped the film and chose to start it fresh in the morning, but the same feeling persisted.  I just didn't care.  That is not a good sign.  The characters were bland.  When I say bland, I literally mean that by watching them develop, you will never have any flavor hit your palate.  The story seemed recycled, nearly to the point of plagiarism.  Now, I am not saying that Christina Wayne stole this story, but she added nothing fresh to the perspective.  The casting was horrid, the underlying symbolism and themes were so far lost that no critic could find them (nor the characters), and the stories were vague and sloppy.  You knew nothing about anyone or anything, and instead of pushing more emphasis on the characters, we instead found ourselves with drugs, minor sex, and money pushed into our faces.  These are themes we have seen in every film since the dawn of film time, yet somehow could not be creatively captured by Wayne.  What immediately pulled me away from this story?  It was mainly the characters.  I have seen most of Brad Renfro's work, and honestly he needs to redefine himself.  Director Larry Clark has defined him, and oddly he cannot get out of that stereotypical character.  Within the first twenty minutes of Renfro's screen time I was bored.  I knew exactly what he was trying to portray and why.  It was spectacular nor impressive, just repetitive.  He needed to bring some excitement or suspense to his role, instead of just blandly playing this random socialite.  Without a strong character, the final climax of this film comes instead as a letdown.  Renfro did not showcase the best of his abilities in this film.  While I am on the subject ... nobody showcased the best of their abilities.  What is going on with Dominique Swain, outside of Lolita, I don't believe she has really emerged as an actress, and following-up with roles such as Cat Storm doesn't help. Bijou Phillips was the only actress that I witnessed actually try to bring something remarkable to the screen, sadly due to everyone else's horrid acting, she was lost.  Rambling here and there, and honestly nearly forgotten about during the second act.  Melanie Griffith was a pointless cast and most of this film's budget probably went to her TWO scenes that she was in.  Maybe the rest of it went to the random guy from The Kids in the Hall, who desperately needs to place himself far away from this project.  My biggest problem, outside of the acting, was the pacing of this film.  Nothing, and this is hard for me to say, but nothing gelled together.  There were so many sub-stories happening throughout the course of the film that no actual substance was formed.  The robberies, the teenage "angst and woe", the wealthy socialites learning how horrible real life is, the random Kids in the Hall guy, and even the ending just felt rushed and horribly edited together.  With this shoddy craftsmanship the whole story never really formed any true shape.  Family structures were never defined, characters were never given any emotion, and all we are left with are bits and pieces of honest leftovers.  Wayne did not complete the task at hand.    While I hate to put the entire burden on the director, with this film I am left with little choice.  With a horrid title that just screamed the complete opposite of what this film was about, with amateurish directional ability the cast pretty much was able to give every emotion in every scenes, leaving us with disgusting acting and poor developments, and with vague storytelling it is hard to place any "good" behind Tart.  This was a film I had heard nothing about, and after viewing it I can see why.  All Wayne has done with this film is random take excerpts from other films that have done a better job of defining all the elements above and cut all together to make the film Tart.  It is hard for me to say this, but Wayne ruined this film.  While I don't believe there was much to fully take from the story, any remaining elements of excitement were drained as Wayne took the helm.  While most of the time you can credit some of the story, perhaps strong acting, or even the music, in Tart you can credit nothing.  From the opening sequence until the end, I felt like I was swimming through very lumpy oatmeal.  No consistency, no strength.  Overall, this film is a waste of your time.  If you are searching for some deep symbolic elements or possibly some banter on our society, you will not find it in this film.  While I know that was what Wayne was attempting to show, the final product seems like it was edited on an Etch-a-Sketch.  It was an embarrassing film to sit through, and encourage nobody to pick it up.  Wayne threw to the wind all the teachings of her Columbia University education and destroyed two hours of my life.  Avoid at all costs!  Grade: * out of **** 
 Rairly have I read a book that I hate.  This is it!  Not only is it not funny but it is insulting to anyone who would sit in his dining room.  Tony's fan base just lost one 
 This collection has a serious handicap in the omission of "Flower Drum Song." This gem is not available at all on DVD. What a loss to all 
 I read Exile all in the space of a 24-hour train ride from NYC to Chicago (via DC) on New Year's Day, and was left thoroughly unsatisfied and bored by it.  While Mark's wanderings from the East Village to Portland were sort  of familiar to me, and his less-than-heroic sexual escapades seemed  honestly told, there is little sense of perspective or meaning in the  novel.  The novel documents the minutia of the day-to-day life of a writer  of bad poetry, his sexual indiscretions and the people who he purposely and  inadvertantly hurts along his path.  It was like reading journal entries  which document a particularly uninteresting period of someone's life.   Really annoying, also, was the tacked-on now-he'll-see-the-light ending,  which took all of ten or fifteen pages and brought absolutely no closure to  the plot.  A lot of books like this have popped up recently; novels that  don't seem to have much to say or much of a plot, but which kind of string  you along with the promise that there could be something underneath all the  meandering jive; finally when you finish, you feel stupid for having wasted  all that time on characters you don't care about and a plot that has taken  you nowhere 
 "Thou Shalt Not" is the kind of show that the cast and creative team could dine out on for years. That is, if they want to admit or even remember that they were involved in it. The show got terrible reviews when it opened on Broadway in October 2001, and barely cleared three months at the Plymouth Theater. It is pretty much a miracle that an entire cast album was recorded.  I saw this show late into its run, and must agree with almost all of the criticism that has been said towards this show. The book is so bad that it is practically non-existant; the music-though it can be rather splendid at times, definitely borders on clunkiness; and the lyrics are frequently ackward. The score, however, did earn a Tony nomination, and at times it is possible to see why.  With the exception of the wonderful Norbert Leo Butz and the ever-terrific Debra Monk, the performances are rather pedestrian. Craig Bierko doesn't have the right intensity for Laurent LeClaire, and Kate Levering is totally devoid of the appropriate sensuality required for Therese Raquin. Rumors has it that the two were lovers during the production, but there is less than zero chemistry between them.  This definitely falls in the "for cast album collectors only" category. If you have a large collection of musical theater CDs, this is the kind of item that can nicely round out a collection. However, if you are knew to musical theater, skip to Sondheim, Kander and Ebb and R&H, before visiting this legendary folly 
 This book was sooooooo boring.  I kept reading it only in the misguided hope that it would get more interesting.  It has an unlikeable and annoying main character.  The writing style is overly simple, and literally NOTHING happens.  The reason that she and her mother "fall out" is never explained.  Don't waste your time.  
 I didn't think this movie was even worth commenting on, but after reading all the people that have been praising it, I just couldn't let it slide. First, the basics. I am nineteen (so you know where I'm coming from). Actually, I don't expect any good or bad votes on this comment because I don't think anyone knows this movie exist... not a bad thing. I'm pretty sure it went straight to DVD and sold for a couple bucks (not a good sign). My brother brought this movie over while we were chillin with some friends. We have always had good movie experiences with Ryan Reynolds so we thought we would give it a shot. That was a mistake. Well, Reynolds had some funny moments that actually saved the movie from getting a one star ("I love bowling"). But my brother was able to predict the entire movie (in detail) within the first 10 minutes. I have never seen that done before!  Honestly I don't see what genre this movie fits in with. It's cheesy enough to be played on the Disney channel, but there are some bad words tossed in that make it JUST too inappropriate for little kids. And anyone who is older than 15 probably wouldn't be caught dead watching it. We sat through the entire movie just to see how bad it could get, and we were not disappointed. I guess it's a comedy because the acting was funnier than the jokes. Man, that was harsh 
 There are much better books out there covering these subjects. The biographies of Bacon and John Dee, for instance, are done much better in The First Scientist and The Queen's Conjurer. The authors clearly don't understand Bacon's science (totally misrepresenting his idea of species) and similarly know little about cryptography. Towards the end, in the surprisingly thin section on the Voynich manuscript, they comment that "no matter how brilliant the mind that fashioned a code, an equally brilliant mind might break it". This just isn't true - a one time pad may be a pain to use, but it is totally impossible to break, period. A real disappointment 
 If you're really a nice girl, then this book is not for you.  I found it distasteful.  Sexual Immorality will not enhance your sex life.  It may for the short term, but it always creates long-term problems.  I wish I had done a little more research before I bought it.  I would rather read a book that does not promote masturbation or say that sex outside of marriage is ok.  It's not.  If you are a nice girl looking for sex the way God intended, then I recommend the books "Intended for Pleasure" and "Sex Begins in the Kitchen."  These books will not only guide you on a path to increase your libido, but they will strengthen your marital relationship as well.  "The Nice Girls Guide to Sensational Sex" will only help you become naughty 
 Some of these chapters are out of date and not useful for the radiologist in general practice. I especially disprove of the Charboneau chapters. Rumack and Wilson are excellent 
 Randolph (Rand) Duchay and Troy Turner, both age thirteen, kidnap and kill a two-year-old girl after trying to get her to puff on a cigarette and drink some beer. Big surprise--she gagged, cried and fussed. Psychologist Alex Delaware was asked by the judge to evaluate each kid and submit his opinion to the judge as to whether they should be tried as juveniles or adults. They're tried and sent off to separate youth detention centers. Troy is dead six weeks later. Rand gets out at age 20 and is dead three days later. However, hours before his death, he called Delaware, asking to meet with him. Alex and his police friend, homicide detective Milo Sturgis, begin investigating Rand's murder. The investigation leads them to all sorts of crazy people, relationships and situations.   I've enjoyed Mr. K's past books; but lately he seems to be avoiding the suspense factor in his stories. This book leaves a few loose ends and Alex's love life up in the air. 
 De Soto fundamentally argues that the reason poor countries are poor is because they have bad property rights: it's incredibly difficult for poor people (specifically, recent urban migrants) to get legal title to their land. As a result, the poor make "extralegal" arrangements, squatting on and using land that neighbors (but not the government) recognize as theirs. But because they don't own the land, they can't get a mortgage on their house to start a business, electricity and water companies are less likely to reliably provide services, the government has difficulty taxing them because they don't have a legal address, and so on. And so on.  It's a very important point but de Soto oversells, arguing with exaggerated (and oft-repeated) ideological claims but weak empirical evidence that solving this problem will actually enrich the poor.   He occasionally shares insights from his interesting field work. For example, he has helped businesses in Peru to navigate the overwhelming bureaucracy and become legal, and he has found that most businesses would rather be legal and pay taxes than be illegal and pay bribes: a useful bit of empirical information, but those gems appear all too occasionally.  Before reading this entire book, I recommend going to the website of de Soto's foundation (the Institute for Liberty and Democracy at www.ild.org.pe) and reading the main point there (in one tenth the words) 
 The only way anyone would give this book more than 1 star is if they are a close friend of Snepp. The rest of the world wouldn't read it. How can a book be about so important a topic, get banned, taken to the Supreme Court, and remain so forgotten? Because the book sucks, it is pedantic, overwritten, and all about what a superspy Frank is. Most controversial books sell, even if they are crappy. This book is so crappy that it doesn't even sell, and thus it will remain a footnote to history 
 This review will probably not be received with equanimity by most americans... The movie by frontline focuses heavily on the fact that China is putting in a LOT more goods thru walmart into USA at a MUCH cheaper price than can be manufactured by american companies, and that thousands of jobs are being lost etc.. All admirable points and no doubt true.  Before  we ask if "Walmart is good for/to America" in isolation, in the much vaunted/desired "GLOBAL" economy that has been vigorously pushed by the so called economically developed nations over the last century, shouldnt we ask "Has AMerica been good for/to the world 's economy" as a whole , in a Global/trans national view? considering yourself as a "global" citizen rather than just an American.  Now all of a sudden, when the technological superiority has been evened out in consumer products, but the relative wealth level is still enormousl y lopsided, it is UNFAIR for those countries to sell cheaper?  By that argument it would have been unfair to even colonize america from the point of view of the native Indians, or unfair to sell arms for INCREDIBLE amounts of raw materials/labour in extremely uneven exchanges over the past 60 years with all the 3rd world nations. Global economics ALSO has its cycle of evolutons, and I for one, am glad that extremely poor people for whom this is  is pretty much a survival issue are able to raise their living standard a little, as opposed to America, where the problem of the "poor" is..obesity. The real culprit here is the "Corporation culture" that the "developed" countries have created, with th result that the top 1% of the population in the USA control 90% of the wealth. this would have been a better DVD if it had not played upon the fears of a public in inflaming the "chinese are taking our jobs" model and focused on corporate greed, of which walmart is only a single example in the USA. I found the DVD amusing  
 Of the 7 or so Grisham novels Ive read this one is my least favorite.  It's not a bad story at all but it's just way too long, about 150 pages longer than it needed to be.   It also just lacked credibility in many spots. Grisham is normally quite good at presenting characters and situations that are at least plausible, if not really interesting. Most of his books give the layman some insight into the workings of the law that Ive always thought were fascinating. This book, however, plods along and doesnt bring anything new to his body of work.  The other thing that really got me was the dialogue he wrote for Mark Sway, the 11year old protagonist. He sounds more like a street-wise 30year old, using words like "wonderful" and phrases that have been out of use since the 70's. I think Grisham forgot he was writing the words for a young boy and not one of his more typically older characters.  This isnt a bad book if you just want to escape for a few hours a day but most of his other ones are far more enjoyable 
 I got the expensive one rather than the $14.99 Aroma cooker, thinking it will be better quality. Wrong.  I only used it twice, not only the rice get burn, after i clean in and out of the cooker, it still look dirty. The quality of the material was really bad. I think the Store where i got this products knows the problem that they take my return even it past 15 days requirement.  Do not waste your good earned money on this one.   
 This is a very strange book: it isn't a book of philosophy and it isn't a book for practice on Personal Time Management.  If you are a CEO or a Vice president you could find something useful (but we hope you've a philosophycal background far more interesting than this book suggests..) but if you're a down on the earth worker .... forget it! When your chief demands the impossible ... explain her/him that  you're a value oriented people and .... find yourself ... fired in 2 seconds!!!  
 Suzanne Somers is partial scam artist. She claims that if you follow the advice in her books, prepare her recipes, use her skin products, etc. you can look as good as she does for her age. She never mentions all the cosmetic surgery and lipo suction she has had done. I know a number of Plastic Surgeons and Dermatologists, and they all claim that there is no way that her face and body can look as good as it does for her age without Cosmetic Surgery on her face and body and touch-ups along the way. However, her books with their beautiful pictures of her and her recipes are lovely to look at but she is giving women who are in their 50's and beyond false hope. She should really write a book about all the work she has had done, what it was like, the cost (which the average woman cannot afford), etc 
 so bad that i will just say this,read the book night shift and find out what this movie should of and could of been!!! skip this mess! 
 I had high hopes for this.  After spending $24.95 to buy it, and watching the first disc, I don't even feel inspired to watch the other discs.  I am an alcoholic myself, and have been sober (thanks to AA) for 11 plus years.  I work in the medical field, and am exposed to addicts of every stripe on a daily basis.  I found the ballyhoo surrounding the release of this confusing.  Perhaps it just shows the hunger of the American people to learn SOMETHING, ANYTHING about the subject of addiction.  It IS a complex subject, and I didn't find any answers here.    I'm not sure exactly what the purpose of the show was.  If it was strictly to educate, I found it to be an extremely non-cohesive hodgepodge of information that DID'T include some of the most important ideas about addiction.  It was like a puzzle that all lay strewn about on the table so that you couldn't figure out what picture it was supposed to be - and with some of the pieces missing, to boot!  If it was to inspire addicts or their families to get treatment for their addiction, I didn't feel in the least bit inspired.  I did not leave the show with an uplifting feeling, or even a scared-and-need-to-do-something-about-it feeling.  I left the show vaguely confused, not much liking or caring about either the addict subjects or any of the researchers.  There were exceptions, of course.  I enjoyed the Night in the ED segment, and I found the Steamfitters to be very "real" and human.  Addiction IS a terrible disease, and it deserves better treatment than this.     Probably the main thing that I did NOT like was that the whole show seemed slanted towards "magic bullet" thinking, which does a disservice to the addict.  That is, over and over are mentioned "exciting new medicines" and "getting the right medicines and the right treatment to help the addict", which I find dangerous and misleading.  That is, it leads one to feel that the solution to addiction is just getting hold of one of the new "miracle" drugs touted.  Perhaps the show was funded by the pharmaceutical industry.  "Miracle drugs" which will solve an addicts problem nearly effortlessly and painlessly have continually popped up over the years (antabuse and SSRI antidepressants come to mind), and none have a very impressive track record.  In fairness to the show, they do mention some of this, but it seems buried in the more frequently talked about glamour of the next "miracle drug".  I was particularly amazed that amongst all of the brain scans, scientific speculation, and such, that there was NO mention whatsoever of any 12 step program, or any proven treatment center such as Hazeldon or the Betty Ford clinic.  Because the reality is, while these scientists are busy engineering the next ever more detailed brain scan machine, there are real humans out there in the world who are SUCCESSFULLY HELPING THEIR FELLOW HUMANS TO GET CLEAN AND SOBER.  What a concept!  And without miracle drugs even!  Getting clean and sober is not easy, and it does a disservice to addicts everywhere to a) give voice to the magical idea that some miracle cure is going to solve everything, and b) not to mention real life programs available now (often free) that have proven track records, and offer REAL hope.    If you like science, be aware that Alcoholics Anonymous has been shown SCIENTIFICALLY in study after study to have THE SINGLE BEST TRACK RECORD AT KEEPING ALCOHOLICS SOBER.  Is it for everyone?  No, but if you want to get (and more importantly STAY) sober, the odds are better with AA as a follow-up (after initial treatment) than with anything else that you can name.  "It works if you work it" as they say in AA.  I have no direct experience with other 12 step programs, and so can't comment, but I know that they operate very similarly.  WHY on a show about addiction would they not mention any 12 step program?  I sat with my jaw hanging down as I watched the entire show, and AA was only mentioned twice:  once by a woman early in the show who had been sober for 17 years or something "through AA", (that in itself is an amazing accomplishment, and should say all you need to know about AA), and later in the show on the Steamfitters  who formed their own support group basically because they felt that going to AA would be somehow 'wimpy' for manly men like them.  I don't where they got that impression, because I've never heard of AA being called 'wimpy' (or whatever term they used).  AA's full of bikers, construction workers, etc., right alongside the doctors and lawyers.  That's the beauty of it: it recognizes that addiction knows no boundaries, and shows what we addicts have IN COMMON.  The irony of the steamfitters is that the little group they formed is ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE AN AA GROUP AND MEETING!  I was laughing - there was almost no difference.  So if you want to know what an AA meeting is like, watch the steamfitters.  The sense of caring about their fellow man who is an addict like them came from the deepest depths of human caring and no-nonsense facing the facts.  And the power of "it takes one to know one" that lets them get their fellows to let down their barriers and listen is exactly why AA is so effective.  Who wants to listen to a scientist?  If you're an addict or an alcoholic, you want to listen to another addict or alcoholic.  They've walked a mile in your shoes.  So to me the show was a moderately boring stream of blah, blah, blah with little real inspirational meat or insight.  If you want some real scientific insight into how this "brain disease" works (at least the alcoholic version), try the book "Beyond the Influence", available from Amazon.  Good meat there.  If you want to see some good talk from people who have (to me) better insight into the whole addiction thing, search online for the Larry King Live addiction show which featured Jamie Lee Curtis and Betty Ford's daughter from the Betty Ford clinic.  Transcripts are available online.  It was an incredible show.  Coincidentally, one of the "researchers" who appears on the HBO special was also on the Larry King show, and it was slightly embarrassing to watch his miracle drug theoretical approach to the subject next to those who are actually down in the trenches with addicts on a human level.  You will see what I'm talking about.    
 I remember my brother reviewing R. Kelly's latest album TP.3 Reloaded and giving it a one-and-a-half-star rating, and I asked him, "R. Kelly's album is really that bad?" He said yes, but I still listened to the album for myself and, well, he was right.  Not only is this album too long (75 minutes), but you can tell that there is only one thing on Kelly's mind: sex. This album gets so sexual that even the guys in Silk would say, "Okay, we get the point, man!" But the bad thing isn't merely the sexuality of the songs; it's how stupid the songs are. This is obvious when Kells shoots for sexual metaphors like "Sex Weed" and what is probably the worst song of his career, "Remote Control". Here, I guess since Ron Isley wasn't available, Rrah does his best Mr. Biggs impression himself, and he kicks the entire song in falsetto, making the song painful on the ears. In fact, that song is so bad that I had to stop in the middle of it.  Things aren't any better when Kells makes songs for the club, because they all sound like reheated "Fiesta" remixes. Not only that, but he's RAPPING again on "Girls Go Crazy" (featuring Baby). "Burn It Up" kind of sounds like Akon's "Bananza" (which is a bad song in itself), and "Hit It Til the Mornin'" is a bad song made worse by a guest spot by Do Or Die, of all people.  Other travesties include "In the Kitchen" and "Put My T-Shirt On". And I can't even say that the five-part epic "Trapped In the Closet" saves the album because I never even liked Chapter 1; plus the chapters get stupider as they go on. The only song out of this whole disc that I can even stand is "Touchin'". Although I have no idea how Nivea got on this album, she and R. have good chemistry on the song.  There's another song, the confessional "Kickin' It With Your Girlfriend", where the first verse begins with: "Go on and slap me again." And that's exactly what I want to do to Kells for even letting this album see the light of day. If you were unfortunate enough to buy this, just bury it somewhere and forget it ever happened.  Anthony Rupert  P.S. In response to another reviewer, Pretty Ricky is a group, not one person 
 This review has to start with a couple of admissions.  First, I happen to think Cyndi Lauper (especially in her later albums) is an underrated songwriter and performer.  Most people think of her as a pop-culture icon of the 80's and unfortunately dismiss what she's done since then.  Some of her later ballads are sung with great emotion and are among the best-written songs I've ever heard.  On the other hand, I really HATE remixes, especially when they're done solely to try to make "danceable" a song that was never intended to be dance music.  So I approached this album with a mix of excitement and fear... excitement that the "rarities" would be more of Cyndi's great songwriting and fear that the remixes would suck, as remixes tend to do.  The two rarities on the album are the songs "The World is Stone" and "You Have to Learn to Live Alone".  There are also extended versions of "Mother" and "What's Going On".  "The World is Stone" talks about how people are turning to stone, "cold to the touch and hard on the soul".  The instrumentals are acceptable but nothing special.  Cyndi's vocals convey the emotional message she's sending exceptionally well, and it's a well-written message about there being "no warmth anymore" and "no love anymore".  While it may be a "rarity" it is definitely one of her better and more powerful songs.  "You Have to Learn to Live Alone" has a kind of blues or jazz sound to it.  You could imagine it being sung in a smoky nightclub in Casablanca.  Cyndi pulls off the kind of vocals you expect with the music, delivering a powerful and emotional performance in the context of what's a fairly subdued, soft song.  The instrumentals on this song are much better than those for "The World is Stone".  The rest of the album consists of remixes, and as I said above, I generally hate remixes.  These are really no exception.  If I had to describe the remixes on this album in a single sentence, that sentence would be: "How to turn some decent Cyndi Lauper music into something unrecognizable and crappy."  If you're into the techno-sounding disco stuff, you might enjoy these, I don't know.  Personally, they ruin some decent songs to me.  The only good thing I can find to say about them is that at least they didn't mess with some of her better songs and stuck with the more mainstream stuff like "Hey Now (Girls Just Wanna Have Fun)"...    If the entire album was like "The World is Stone" and "You Have to Learn to Live Alone" I would probably give it something in the 8-10 (out of 10) range.  Those two songs are quite good and easily among her best work.  But the 6 remixes on the album pretty much ruin it for me, and I can't in good conscience give the entire album anything better than about a 4.  If it was an album of just the remixes, it would get maybe a 2, and would only rank that high because Cyndi's voice appears in them 
 The executives at Warner Brothers wanted a new take on the Batman franchise. You want a new take, you hire a new director. Here comes Joel Schumacher into the boardroom.  Executives- "Hi Joel, we'd like you to direct this movie. We thought Batman Returns was too dark, do you think you can lighten up Batman for us? Add some color? That's what we're looking for."  Schumacher- "Color? I love color! Do you guys like pretty neon colors?"  Executives- "We sure do!"  Schumacher- "Great, because pretty neon colors are my favorite thing in the world! Batman movies should be nothing but pretty neon colors!"  Executives- "We agree with your vision Joel. You're hired!"  Schumacher- "Yipee! I'm an artist!"  The rest is history. Batman Forever is a big, bloated mess of a summer popcorn movie but it gets the job done for the most part. That's if your idea of the job done is sucking out your brain cells endlessly for more than 2 hours. Was the subplot with the Riddler's brain drain machine a self-criticism by Schumacher of this infantile movie?  The problem with the Batman movies, ( until finally Batman Begins broke the rules ), is that the directors never wanted to take Batman seriously as a mythic character. They wanted to keep him shoe-horned as a comic book superhero with explosions and junk. That and they had too many villians, not enough Batman! Val Kilmer wanted to take a more serious approach to the character but his director was working towards a totally different goal and they did not see eye to eye. Nicole Kidman is good in the movie too, although she plays the alluring femme with far too much self-conscious air. Tommy Lee Jones is absolutely awful as Two-Face, just like his make-up. If you like Jim Carrey, you'll love his manianical over the top Riddler performance, he steals every scene he's in, the prima donna!  Too much color, too much noise, too much crud, too much of everything. Not enough of Danny Elfman's classic score. Actually Elfman's music is completely erased in favor of Elliot Goldenthal's not very interesting orchestral bloating. You can't blame them, they wanted a new Batman, they wanted a new sound. Batman Forever is a loud summer vehicle and easily forgettable were it not for all the noise but hey, at least this movie is not a shameful disgrace like Schumacher's follow up Batman & Robin, one of the worst debacles of the decade 
 I was very disappointed in this selection.  Maybe a MALE football fanatic would find something appealing, but I was VERY bored!  Take me back to court, to the lawyer's office, to the judge's chambers,...just about anywhere but these bleachers!! 
 Dividing classes reaises many questions regarding how the middle class views school advantage.  Through interviews and personal experiences, the author describes her positive and negative experiences with the educational system.  We found this book gives rise to many controversial issues some with which we agree as well as some issues we disagree with.  While the author does give concrete examples, we believe SES is not the only predictor for educational success 
 I never received this item -- nor could I get a response from the company when I asked about it. My opinion -- RIP OFF 
 I found this book to be useful for students who are trying to get started with IC design but less useful to the practicing engineer. The Circuits discussed in the book are old and some are not practical to implement in today's IC processes. The Book also fairly touches on simulation using SPICE level 3 models which is very outdated, most IC Designs use BSIM3 as an industry standard. I should also mention the book's strongest section is the one that covers OPAMP compensation, this particular subject is well treated in this book 
 Paranormal romances are not usually my thing, but I was out of town and desperate for something to read so I picked it up in the hotel gift shop.  Well, I made a very poor choice.  For the three days I was holed up in the hotel room I tried to read this crappy book and when I checked out I left it in the trash can.  The plot was silly and unrealistic -- even for this genre.  The characters were one dimensional caricature in no way believeable -- even for this genre.  This was a complete waste of money 
 The entire concept of writing fiction of ANY kind is to use your imagination mixed with the things that you know.  A book to TELL you how to write fantasy does not make a bit of sense!  If you are building a world, use common sense and round it out, smooth the edges, be as 'realistic' as you can for a Fantasy story.  The problem with Fantasy these days is that all Elves are the same; all Dwarves are the same, all Goblins are the same...every book written is basically a carbon copy of the last one.  These races DO NOT EXIST in our world, therefore you cannot say they MUST be one way or another.  Get back to IMAGINATION - just use the sense you were given.  TRUE old fashioned imagination has created the BEST books ever read 
 Before I begin, I would like to make clear that I really Like Taking Back Sunday. Their first cd is absolutely fantastic. One of my all time favorites. But this cd... I can barely even tolerate it, at best. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because I like the first two tracks. To me, the loss of John Nolan severely hurt TBS.   This cd is full of honest to goodnes pop-punk. To be honest, I actually like Louder Now more than this record. Songs such as "A decade under the influence" really dont cut it when compared to classics like "Timberwolves at New Jersey" and "No 'I' in team." And maybe it's just me, but I think that "Number Five with a Bullet" basically is just a retread of "You are so Last Summer." But that is just me.  -peac 
 Very dissapointed in this outfit, looks really nice in pictures but is very cheaply made frayed the first time put on.  
 The author of this book should have never received his degree. The book is very confusing and vaguely describes any mathematical process in arriving to its conclusions. An example of this is in chapter two where the author attempts to describe call blocking but ignores any input traffic to the system. The author obtains values from thin air and does not describe how the process used in obtaining the answers. This type of confusing gibberish is seen through out the book. I strongly recommend that you do not buy this book 
 Just another of the many books on the market that were written by going to a bookstore and reading everyone else's books for inspiration, then making up the rest of it. Talk about a meme gone wrong. Did this person study with anyone competent? Unlikely. It's so full of bogus information and malarkey. Don't waste your money 
 I have many meditation tapes I love, but this isn't one.  I love all of his books, so I thought it would be great... but I expected more relaxation and visualization techniques, more hypnosis kind of work in healing.  This did nothing for me.  
 I've never written a review before, but I feel compelled to this time.  It was just that bad.  I didn't have to finish it, I kept waiting for it to get better, when it did not I resigned myself to finishing it.  It wasn't that hard being a lightweight beach novel.  It was a rainy saturday so I figured why not - it was only mildly better than finishing the laundry.  I almost feel dumber for having read this.  Is this really what women RELATE to?  If so, that is so sad?  I found every character in this book just sad.  Mind you, I don't find the characters or the tale unbelievable, the tone that I should somehow empathize and root for true love.  C'mon!  Even for a book that isn't supposed to be intellectually challenging, it was nothing but a letdown.  F 
 I got this as both a book and an audio file.  I had waited to read it and was surprised by both the enthusiasm of the content and its author, but also by how he snuck in some odd biblically unsound thoughts (e.g., I gasped when he suggested Christ went to Hell...what Bible passage evidences this?).  I agree with how he suggests the enemy is out to deceive us and keep us asleep...but wonder if I go further how much more Eldredge will slip in of his own peculiar biblical misintrepretations.  Where were his editors when this was being written?  Why take sensible good sections and mar them with oddities?  I havent read all the reviews here but as one of those "conservatives" frequently mentioned in them I have to admit I may not even finish this book for fear of what else Eldredge has slipped up on.  I did appreciate his story about Daniel and the "delayed" angel...but am left wondering if I need go deeper into researching that as possible misintepretation too.  What a shame this book is turning into such a questionable venture for me.  We are at war as the author suggests and we must guard the source material well..the Bible well.  So far...I may join others and ditch this valiant attempt to energize Christians and return to the Word itself.  I wonder if I can get a refund 
 Minding the Spirit is a collection of previously published articles that have been grouped by topic for the study of spirituality in the Christian tradition. This book is a bit of a disappointment. In general, the book is a polemic for the field of spirituality as an academic discipline especially at the graduate level. Key concerns are the definition of spirituality and the object and method of study. A few authors note Paul's use of spirit (pneuma) or spiritualities (pneumatikos) but most authors identify Christian spirituality with Christian experience.  The reader will quickly notice how little Scripture is used in this book. The few biblical passages cited are mostly illustrations from previous theologians (e.g. Origen, Augustine). The Scriptures are seen as the basis of Christian spirituality but most authors in this collection are quite vague about connecting spirituality and the Scriptures and some struggle with the role of the Scriptures. For example, Liebert views the psalms as a special case in the canon but the canon is a special case in Christian literature so any encountered text can become a living text, 94.   The struggle to merge historical concepts (traditions) and post-modern thinking is evident throughout the book. One example would be J. Matthew Ashley's statement challenging theologians to, "develop the conceptual tools to manifest the truth - or perhaps better to make the truth," 160.  This book will be of interest to those who are seeking to grasp the agenda of the post-modern university for spirituality as a discipline.  It will not be of much help for any interested in a biblical or personal understanding of Christian spirituality or even those seeking a history of the topic. Yet, students of a theological mind would all profit from the chapter (article) by Elizabeth A. Dreyer on the Holy Spirit in Augustine. Though presented as being to a wide audience the book is decidedly Catholic in perspective with Karl Rahner being the modern theologian referenced by most authors. All in all it is a disappointing work on such a great topic! 
 This was a HORRIBLE, annoying, obnoxious movie.  I will give Mandy Moore props for being a good actress but, Dianne Keaton's character got on my last nerve.  I kept thinking oh MY God can she be any less appealing.  If that were my mother I would throw my shoe at her.  I have never disliked a 'chic flick' until yesterday.  I went in thinking this would kind of be like Monster In Law but, I actually liked that movie.  I am just grateful that I only paid 4 bucks to see it during a matinee but, sorry that I lost 2 hours of my life.  
 In the past, I have purchased several of the Gazetteer maps. One of the chief reasons I purchase a Topo type map is because I am a Rockhound. A large portion of good minerals and rock formations are generally located at or near mines. The Gazetteer has always been a quick and easy reference for roads and trails to these areas. Not so with the New Mexico version. I have found no mines or quarries anywhere within this map. I feel cheated for if I had looked at it prior to purchase, I would not have bought it 
 The book opens with horror stories about cows and how they are given[chemicals] to fatten them up and keep them healthly.  Then it moves on the chickens and the horrible conditions they are raised in. The third story is about a vegetarian and how much better his diet is.  I already knew that cows and chickens were not the best and were given [chemicals] I don't want in my body, I didn't need the graphic descriptions.  Much of the information was wonderful, the explanation about protein and simple vs. complete protein was very interesting.   I am an avid reader, but I found this hard to follow, and didn't retain the information.  Having to trudge through the chapters made each new page harder to face.  I couldn't force myself to continue to read.  A book isn't a good resource when you can't recall this inforation or dread having to slog through half of the book to find the one paragraph you need 
 I enjoyed the first 3 books of the Women's Murder Club. Didn't like too much the 4th (of July), but the 5th is just BAD ! What's the plot ? There is no plot ! 2 serial-killer stories try to share the pages of this not-such-a-page-turner, the 1st mystery (Car Girls) get solved mid-way throught the book and I bet plenty of readers won't remember it by the end of this painfull read... By trying to develop 2 stories, Patterson gets our interest for none. The most sad thing of all is that I used to like to Women's Murder Club members, but now they all seem so unreal, remote from anything actually likeable. And it's been the case since one of them died and another one joined the club, in the most stupid, artificial way really. Not much to save this book, it's even badly written. Don't know if Patterson thinks about writting a 6th, but don't count on me next time  
 An earnest enough effort but terribly dull. Fry wishes us to revisit schooldays and jot our way through Chaucer, Milton, Shakespeare, i.e. learn the basics, pay our dues. And while it may be true that much poetry, eg Bukowski, is mere chopped-up prose, notes and shopping lists, Fry is unwilling or unable to grapple with grandmaster Pound. There should be more on modernist poetry: TSE and Pound. The Waste Land receives scant coverage. Fry is a fuddy-duddy, amusing from a distance and a bore at close quarters. I wish he would let his hair down and give us some edge and spike. 
 I bought the movie on accout Rose was on the cover. I got home and watched and in the end I was disappointed and in tears. This movie is not for people under eighteen cause of some of the stuff she doe 
 I'm a sports photographer and shoot a lot of soccer and baseball games.  Of these two sports, I totally disagree with this book's approach.  I tried to return this book to Amazon but can't 
 If I could have given this book a "0", I would.  I have spent a considerable amount of time in Iran, as an American woman and as a mother accompanied by my children. I have never experienced anything but warmth, hospitality, and respect from any Iranians I encountered while living there.  Although, I was not married to an Iranian man, bad, abusive marriages happen anywhere. Why is a bad marriage in Iran--if this was indeed the case--considered so "newsworthy?" It is troubling that one woman's overly-dramatized, traumatic account is seen in the US as the prototype for all of Iranian culture.  For example, I have eaten in the homes of many Iranians, of all social classes, in cities and in villages, and never once did I encounter bugs in the food.  Doesn't anyone find it suspicious that the ghost writer, William Hoffer, also was the author of "Midnight Express"--a book about an American in a Turkish prison?  What is his agenda? What is Ms. Mahmoody's agenda? Why is this book so popular in the US?  Could it be that we want to read/see things that confirm our stereotypes of the Middle East and Islamic cultures as "evil."  The reader should try to disengage him/herself from Mahmoudy's traumatic story and try to read between the lines.  Think critically, for crying out loud, about how books such as these demonize another culture, so that we can have the opportunity to see another people as less than human, and thereby feel no remorse when they're under attack. This is one of the worst--and most damaging--pieces of propaganda I've ever seen. Shame on Sally Field for taking part in the film!  Even the cover is misleading: Iranian women do not cover their faces with their veils like this.  This is a custom found more in Saudi Arabia 
 If you do buy this book save the receipt so that you can send it back if you are disappointed like I was. No respectable publisher would ever publish this book 
 I liked most of Jo Beverly's books.  In fact, she is one of my favorite romance writers.  That's why it's hard to believe she could write something so boring and contrived.  The premise -- saving an opium addict--- is good.  One could expect a lot of turmoil between the lovers.  But no -- it's all pretty smooth. The passion is tepid and not much else happens.  A series of "Rogues" from previous books is paraded before the reader without really adding to the story.  And the conversations are so boring that I simply had to skip them.  I guess this may be enjoyable to new romance readers who do not know better or hard core Beverly fans 
 If it's true that everything is good for something, even if it is a bad example, this book might by used accordingly, otherwise, don't waste your time.  Each chapter of this book is written by a different professional writer, each with a story to tell about her particular life, relationships, etc.  I found it to be a disturbing and even appalling read on many levels.  For one, these women are not "typical" in that they do not represent the rank and file of American women, wives and mothers, at least not the ones that I know!  They are professional writers who are urban, educated, liberal, and comparitively affluent.  These women live and work primarily in academia.  The book is a compilation of chapters in which these writers rant, whine, confess and obsess about their relationships, careers, etc. It misses the point of getting views from women of all walks of life and social status.    I found this book offensive in that because they have, as writers, the platform to flaunt their deviance and dysfunction (sexually, morally, politically, etc. ), they play it off as normal and representative of the rest of us.  Perhaps in their literary or academic worlds, they are the norm, but for the vast majority of us wives and moms out here in the real world, I don't think so!  I got the impression that many of these women thought it was somehow a display of their writing prowess if they divulged more dark, freaky, wacko secrets and shocking confessions than their sister in the previous chapter, be it on their affair with another woman, a married man, or their open marriage.      The Hannah Pine piece is particularly disturbing and I can see why she uses a pseudonym; had her real name been used there would be no reason why this pitiful woman would not be carted off to the mental health ward.  She writes of the affairs she and her husband have had with other people and her obviously unsuccessful, yet frighteningly denied, attempt to justify the affairs as anything negative or unhealthy, even priding herself on chosing to not be angry over her husbands habit of sleeping with other women.   Afterall, that could put a damper on his lust and we wouldn't want to restrict him in such an negative and oppressive manner...  PUH-LEEZE!!!!!    
 I used the original CD Stomper for many, many years and never had one problem. I bought the new version and it's such a huge downgrade. Why do I have to calibrate my printer when I didn't before? Even after you calibrate your printer, the text still is never perfectly on the label, I've wasted so much ink and labels trying to get this stupid thing centered and it never prints perfectly. Oh & the side tabs never rip off cleanly, my cds have to look atleast half-way professional when I send them out to clients, and it doesn't look too good with tear marks on the each side of the label...this product is JUNK.  Thanks for ruining a great product guys 
 If I had not read numerous books on this subject - one of the best is the `Limits to Growth' series by MIT - I would be very skeptical of Heinberg's assertions because of his obvious bias against Western Civilization.  However, after reading over a dozen books on essentially the same subject, I believe most of his assertions about the future are correct; namely that due primarily to population pressures and the necessities of civilization, the entire world is headed for an inevitable collapse.   I believe the author ruins what could have been a great book with comments such as "The Earth cannot afford rich people ..." (page 178)" and "A small minority ... [who] think critically - will gradually come to the conclusion that the entire system of industrial civilization is inherently unsustainable" (page 183).  I believe it's obvious to any serious student of history that civilization, if not requires, at least inevitably produces, wealth, i.e. "rich people", and given certain restrictions this is a good thing. And his assertion that "industrial civilization is inherently unsustainable" is patently absurd. It does seem that the current flavor of western industrial civilization, with its blind pursuit of growth at any/all costs, is headed for collapse, yet I can imagine dozens of flavors of industrial civilization which are sustainable.  On the other hand, I very much appreciated his analysis of why the real culprit, over population, is not, and will not, be discussed in any way that matters.  So if a reader can get past Heinberg's political ideology, this is a great book.  P.S. The author provides many valuable references to books and web sites. 
 I'm a huge fan of Ted Dekkar, but lately I've noticed that his books have been lacking. Showdown was a wonderful read, and I was completely engrossed in it, thinking I would feel the same about SAINT I bought it. I think the most dissapointing about this book was that it was actually a sequel to Showdown, yet you don't know it till halfway through. I found this completely rediculous, and even though the story was somewhat interesting at times, it never really seemed to go anywhere...and never really ended either. There is never any true complete ending, and it leaves you feeling like you read a whole bunch of words instead of an actual story 
 Lego is our favorite toymaker, but they really cut corners on this one.  The structure looks great and has lots of features, but be careful not to blow on it, or it's coming down!  Much too fragile to play with.  Evidently they wanted to keep the piece-count down in order to reduce the price point.  My son raided his other Lego sets in order to put in supporting pieces, and we stuck the whole thing on a green base plate; still, it's very fragile 
    This is a book written only for Red Sox fans.  I'm not a fan of the club, but my roommate is, and he bought the book.  So I gave it a shot, and read through it.  The result is what happens when a fan poses as a writer, and is allowed to write a book.    It is unbelievable to me that people can pass off as "history" the telling of a tale.  Calling one team "divine" and the other "evil" is a joke.  The fact is that baseball is a sport, and that neither team is good or evil.  They just play baseball!    If you want to read a GOOD book with a FAIR depiction of the rivalry (through the eyes of neither a Yankees or Red Sox fan), read the book by Mike Vacarro of the NY Post, Emperors and Idiots.  Vacarro is a Mets fan who admires both teams, and wrote a book that gives an ACTUAL history of the rivalry, and looks at it from an outside prespective.    This "Blood Feud" is worthless drivel and shouldn't be read by  a single person who lives outside New England, and who isn't a die hard Red Sox fans.  (Red Sox fans who want a more accurate depiction might also prefer Vacarro's book...that is, if they want the facts 
 I am currently in an ethics class and this book was required for the course. This is by far the most repetitive and useless book you will ever use in your entire life. NO JOKE. It offers no insight into things that you dont already know. It simply takes what you already know, puts it into fancier words, and spits it right back at you. If this book is not a requirement for a class then dont waste your money. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to go throw this peice of crap in a volcano and forget I was ever plagued by its stupidity and uselessness 
 Yes, another spell book.  Gee... thanks.  There are several Romani 'spell books' avaliable now.  There is a little bit here about the philosophy behind the magic; but actually (if I'm recalling correctly) this author seems more tainted by Western Esoterica than other authors I've heard tell about.  The spells are folk-loreish in their nature, which is all fine and good, I don't expect any different.  What I do expect, and hope for, is an explaination of how things work.  What is the driving force behind this energy.  Why is the sun coming up.  What am I doing.  How is it different from what I've been doing?  Give me something anything to hang onto here.  Don't just tell me to play nice in the dirt.  Yes I know I'm being a tad harsh here.  But it is fustrating to try to reach into any real 'earth magick' trad (by which I mean non-Wiccan) since there is little ritual to hang onto, and the explainations are few and far inbetween.  The author doesn't even seem to try 
 I know this play is suppose to be a classic and a master of it's genre. But if this is the best this genre can produce, this genre must be worse than "Plan 9 From Outer Space". The play is trite and cliched. It's whole meaning is that everything is meaningless. Is it just me or is that a bit ironic? Unless you have to read this play for school, don't read it. If I had gone to see this play in a theatre I would have walked out after 5 minuntes. Why can't people write good and decent plays like Shakespeare or Sophoclese. (I know I spelled them wrong, Sorry.) This new genre of pointless dialogue is, well, pointless. I wonder if all of these playwrites are writing these plays and laughing at the fools that think they are good. Beckett is probably laughing in his grave because he is still fooling people. If you like non-sense, and you like to look like you are philisophical, go ahead and read it, but don't say you weren't warned 
 Someone reported all my 3 negative reviews of Daniel Silva books and got them removed! Hmm, I wonder who that could be.    I am rather annoyed at this because I spent quite a lot of time detailing why I didn't like this book, reasonably, I thought.  Apparently, someone had decided that they did not follow the review guidelines. Well, I used no profanities. OK, there were some spoilers, but not more than I usually read in other reviews. Not single worded, no phone numbers, no solicitations, etc. Maybe whoever it was just didn't like my negative review. The last time I checked, the 1st amendment still applies in this country.  OK, so let me try to post another review of why I didn't like this book without violating any review guidelines, and I'm not going to spend 30 mins on it like last time.   I thought the book was very poorly written and very boring. It was very tedious to finish but I made it to the end. I've read a couple of other Daniel Silva books, but neither one of them could change my mind that he is an author that I don't like. I will not be buying any more of his books 
 ...Having also been an American woman, living on my own, in rural Ireland, at the same time as Rosemary Mahoney was taking her leave of that country, I can not stress enough that this woman did not spend enough time there or spend her time in any way that would bring about real understanding or learning of what Irish society and community is like. Not only does she portray every single person save for two maybe, in an ugly light, but she obviously did not pick up on the "Irish sense of humor". Very often, the Irish way of having a giggle means "humoring" someone else, especially someone else who is naive to this sort of fun.And who better for the folks in Corofin to humor than a woman who spends each day holed up in a castle or sitting in a smalltown pub of regulars where she is a total outsider. Corofin is not far from Ennis, and there, Rosemary could've enjoyed a livelier pub scene where people of her same sex and age group would gather on a regular basis...I thought the book was hilarious because I could see these Corofin folks just humoring the [stuffing] out of Rosemary. She took all of them seriously and at face value...This is one of the funniest things about being American. Our culture is so widespread that often the Irish get a laugh out of playing into what they think is our idea of them, and the folks in Corofin sure enough got a giggle out of Rosemary I'd say. Its a pity that she never immersed herself into their world...instead, she just hung around hoping to catch glimpses of skeletons in closets and kept to her... self. She was well known in Kerry, and I was twice mistaken for her with, "Oh my gosh, you're not that Amerry-can girl who wrote down all those things about the folks she lived near...are ye?" I had no idea who they were talking about atthe time. Well now I know, and its a pity so many folks here in the US eat this book up as a example of society in Ireland.   Interacting as an aquaintance, Rosemary managed to pick up surface bits and pieces of some folks' lives during their leisure hours drinking.  I feel this hardly gives her leverage as a reliable authority on Irish society...or even Corofin's community.  Even in the very dialogues Rosemary quoted from her conversations I was mortified for Rosemary that she did not pick up on the fact that she was being played and humored just as much as the Dublin girls in her book played and humored  Sister Keaton.The book, to me, only displays how very ignorant most of us Americans are of other cultures and their ways of communicating, and how content we are in our smugness of thinking we know it all in just a quick glance. A good read only if your Irish, or have lived in Ireland with Irish people for some length of time, cuz then you can laugh...Oh, and to everyone who still thinks this book an accurate portrayal.. 
 I finally had to give up on this book after suffering through the first 100 pages.  The book is a collection of articles supposedly linking certain tenets of Christianity to the perennial philosophy.  Having read the perennial philosophy and having studied the eastern religions for several years, my expectations were high.  I read the first few articles and just could not see their connections to the perennial philosophy.  I also found the articles themselves to be of extremely limited usefulness on their own merits.  If you are trying to find a glimmer of hope in the Christian world view, as I was, by seeking a connection to the perennial philosophy, particularly as it relates to the eastern practices, look elsewhere.  
 This second part of Xenosaga compares very badly to the stellar first part, regardless of what anyone says.  I no longer wanted to play this game after only 30 minutes.  The game begins with lots of boring instructions for a very non-intuitive battle system.  Annoying amount of experience points is needed to defeat nearly every main enemy, including the very first one.  Battle result and saving screens are a painful chore.  Battle camera is inadequate and characters look and act like small puppets.  The game has very few items, weapons, or armor to deal with even ordinary enemies, which are stronger than expected.  The skill combination that will be successful on a main enemy is not available until engaged by that enemy.  Battles with main enemies are long, which isn't such a problem.  However, they often conveniently power up at the end of the battle, just to frustratingly finish off a battle-weakened party.  Voice acting is very uninspired and sometimes even annoying.  I don't remember any music from this game, so plain it is.  Some character changes are likely to upset at least half of everyone who liked the first Xenosaga.  Very noticeable is the use of swearing, which is the main reason I don't enjoy or watch Hollywood movies during my rest and relaxation anymore.  New, meaningless characters have been introduced into the story, and the focus shifted far away from the main characters.  The cover character hardly says or does anything this time.  There is one short scene between the main characters during a critical moment, but if you blink you will miss it.  This game is far more frustrating than challenging, which is not a good game trait.  I don't recommend even playing this game before reading the above, to fully prepare for the disappointment that awaits.  If you're looking forward to anything that made the first Xenosaga great, you will be extremely disappointed.  The second Xenosaga is better completely avoided. 
 The publisher deserves credit for putting together an attractive little book.  The short quotes sprinkled through out are pithy and to the point, while the decorative illustrations are pretty.  Those illustrations, however are the flowery type you find in Asian poetry books and have little to do with Wabi Sabi.  Gold's exposition on the subject is simplistic to the point of being juvenile. Wabi Sabi is a complex topic and requires more depth.  While new to the subject, I have already found two better books.  Lennox Tierney includes photographs of items which actually illustrate the principles of Wabi Sabi in Wabi Sabi A New Look at Japanese Design. Wabi  Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers by Leonard Koren Porvides a better foundation for understanding than Gold's book 
 this book was crazy and disturbing.  when frightful has to leave, alice and sam go out and find a goshawk because they can't have a falcon.  it was really horrible because the parents of the goshawks were all mad and stuff.  i hate how frightful is trained to do all that stuff and how she wants to obey sam and stuff.  frightful's mountain was a really bad book.  don't read it if you are really in to the animals staying in their natural habitat thing.  
 Have not yet seen the movie! This was one of the films I ordered for my very first HD order. Also included in the order were King Kong, Mission Impossible 1~3, The Good Shephard & Children of Men. Of these, only KK and MI 1~3 played on my new Xbox360 HD DVD player. The other three discs could not play! I started looking into this on the net and found that this was some sort of interface problems with the Xbox 360, although I only found this problem relating to The Good Shephard and Children of Men specifically and no instances of this problem occuring with A Scanner Darkly during my search on the net, it could be that I was just unlucky and got a defective copy of this HD DVD. I have read that there will be update release from MS to correct this problem through Xbox Live, but I'm not sure this will fix the problem.  If you've got the Xbox 360 HD DVD player, be warned this may not work on your player.  Anyone else having this problem, I would certainly like to know 
 This is a beautiful but creepy book: a lost sheep all alone, terrified by UFOs no less into fleeing into a strange, deserted home, is not my ideal bedtime reading for a sensitive child. The strong colors are beautiful and a nice change from baby-pastel, but they are also ominous and deterring. His utter solitude, in exploring the house (creepy corridor with blood-colored doors), eating, and finally sleeping, is horrifying to a child with imagination, whose most overriding terror is abandonment. I give it points for beauty and originality, none for sensitivity to the needs of its target audience, and cannot recommend it 
 Too specific to charity.  Not generalized enough to perform in a "normal" situation.  Was disappointed with the read.  
 I'm a junior mechanical engineering student at a university. This is the text used for my kinematics and dynamics of machinery class. This book is very poorly written, and it's not user friendly. It is hard to follow the examples in this book. If someone already has knowledge on mechanism design, then this book may be used as a good reference. But for those just learning, this book is horrible 
 I had hoped this book could be my benchmark for herbal information.  What I found was a book that was hard to use with little useful information.  ...  Otherwise, Facts and Comparisions' Review of Natural Products is a better choice 
 now im not a little Bow Wow hater, dont get me wrong i've actually baught all his albums, and at times i've defended him. but other than like you, let me hold you, and freshazimiz, this cd is pretty wack. His worse release yet. If you've heard his other albums but haven't heard this one, trust me, you dont wanna hear it. Not Bow wow's best work, but keep tryin lil bow weezy, keep trying to hold it down in the rap game. Also his respect level with me dropped since what he said about Will Smith, a dude of bow wow's calibur has no right to say what he said about an acting and hip hop legen 
 Let me start by stating that im a 24 year old university educated individual.  This book was thrusted into my face and forced into my brain when i was in forth grade.  It was by far the most driest and boring book i've ever read at that point in my life...and continue to be so until college.  Now, i dont remember anything at all about this book other than the fact it was about some boy writing letters to some man; but the fact that i dont remember anything gives you an idea at how little i stimulted.  Till this day, im reluctant to even bother to re-read this book and give it another chance.  I've been scarred for life.  I have no doubt that this books contains a lot of substance and insightful tales, but the thought of reading some poor pathetic boy's letters causes me to shriver.  If i would have to chose any book of my childhood that discouraged me from reading more, it would have to be this.  PLease spare your child/student from the tortures of this book.  Maybe once they've grown mentally and have the capacity and patience to understand it, it would be a great book.  But at such a young age, its a horrible read.  I noticed that this book recieved some high marks from young readers; for some reason i feel that those ratings may be incorrect and the young children's opinions may have been "clouded".  Do you teacher's know no shame?  
 In his magnum opus, 1984, George Orwell famously wrote,  "Who controls the past, controls the future and who controls the present controls the past". This is a lesson that Jared Diamond has obviously learned well.  In his latest book "Collapse" Jared Diamond" continues to push the Europhobic liberal agenda. Hiding behind the facade of environmentalism Diamond crafts a sub-text that calls for Europeans to embrace the values of failed third-world cultures and abandon the pursuit of technological advancement that has created global European cultural hegemony. Unfortunately for Diamond, genuine scientific research is revealing much of his work to be based on nothing more than wishful thinking and an overactive imagination.  Diamond makes the assertion that Easter Island experienced a cultural collapse due to depletion of natural resources and overpopulation. This may conflate well with the tenets of liberalism but unfortunately for Mr Diamond, it does not conflate well with the factual findings of the latest archaeological investigations. Radiocarbon dating of soil samples, by Carl Lipo and Terry Hunt, indicate that Easter Island was not inhabited until two to eight hundred years after the occupation time that Diamond's theory would require. Quite simply, the new evidence uncovered by Lipo and Hunt indicates that the period of human habitation of Easter Island was far too short for Diamond's putative collapse to have been the result of overpopulation. To quote Carl Lipo,   "It fits our 21st century view of us as ecological monsters. There's no doubt that we do terrible things ecologically, but we're passing that on to the past, which may not have been actually the case, to stick our plight on to them is unfair"  It is difficult to over-emphasise just how badly compromised Diamond is by this evidence. The Easter Island chapter is a major plank in his argument, the fact that Diamond is rank ignorant of the latest archeological research reveals him to be an amateur polemicist rather than a scientific authority figure.  Those who may think that Diamond's Easter Island fantasy is simply an abberation might want to introduce some hard science into their analysis of Diamond's version of the history of Greenland. The extinction of Greenland's Viking colony is used by Diamond to enforce the ideology of modern liberalism. Diamond claims that the Vikings perished because a racist contempt for the Inuit prevented them from assimilating ideas that would have prevented their slow starvation. A cultural superiority complex caused the Viking colonists to cling to an unviable agricultural lifestyle and, in Diamonds words, "The Greenland colonists starved to death surrounded by oceans teeming with fish". This is an analysis that neatly dovetails with modern pro-immigrant, liberal cultural relativism and the dogma of multiculturalism. The major flaw in Diamond's argument is that the latest historical research shows that by the time of the colony's extinction the Greenland Vikings had, in point of fact, switched from a diet that was 80% farm food to a diet that was 80% marine food.  In otherwords, the Viking colonists proved to be perfectly capable of adapting to environmental change without having to learn lessons from stone age primitives. To present the Vikings as beloning to a soley agrarian culture in the first place would be the cause for much derisive laughter among genuine historians. The Vikings are well known (unless you are Diamond) to have exploited a rich variety of marine life as a food resource.   The alternative explanation for the Vikings demise is that the mini-ice age that caused the Vikings to switch diets also witnessed a mass immigration of Alaskan Inuit who competed with the Vikings for food and finally massacred them in an unrecorded genocide. We know about the mini ice-age from the evidence of core samples and tree rings. We know about the Innuit peregrinations through archeology and folk record. In the face of genuine science and history I'm afraid Mr Diamond is left up a certain creek without means of conveyance. Historians tend not to write about evolutionary biology, perhaps evolutionary biologists might in future restrain their urge to embarrass themselves by writing about history?  
 I needed to know more about Sarbanes-Oxley for work and ordered this book.  While I was waiting for it to arrive, I went onto the Internet and downloaded some information, including the text of the legislation itself.  I read through the legislation.  I'm not an attorney, and I wasn't motivated to cross reference the other laws/acts mentioned.  In other words I just read the legislation as is, with no legal background.  When this book arrived, I expected it would provide information and/or interpretations that I was not able to get directly from reading the legislation and other free materials.    In truth, I found there was very little, if anything that I hadn't gathered directly from my other sources.  If you are trying to learn what Sarbanes-Oxley is about and choose not to use the available information, this book does describe the basics.    I would not recommend it, because it does not significant add to, or simplify the information readily available for free 
 Admittedly I am reviewing this movie in comparison to the infinitely better book, which may not be fair.  There's no way to improve upon any of Pat Conroy's books in movie form, but it is possible to at least measure up.  In this regard, this movie failed miserably. After reading Mr. Conroy's masterpiece, I was overjoyed to see the movie at my local Blockbuster.  I excitedly took it home to show my wife in hopes that she would understand the brilliance that is Pat Conroy.  After watching it, I sat speechless while she asked "what's the big deal?"  I had no answer, as I too felt that the movie was a few hours of my life that were sincerely wasted. In taking a book of this quality and thoroughly "hollywoodizing" it, the movie makers have done a severe disservice.  The good looking leading man, the happy ending, etc.  The book was one that I'll remember until the day I die.  This movie is nothing more than an excuse to eat popcorn and relax for a few hours.  You've got much better things to do with your time than to waste it on this drivel 
 This book is an interesting combination of fairly good writing and fairly poor science. The information on which the author draws is taken out of its context, so while his conclusions have an internal logic, that logic is far-fetched and has almost no bearing on the rest of the world. But the author's writing is good enough to keep this from being self-evident. I found the book an easy but worthless read 
 First and foremost, be aware if there are any reviews referring to "textbook", they are not for this "Cram 101 Textbook Outlines" which is supposed to be a textbook companion.  "Cram 101 Textbook Outlines" is useless!!! This is nothing but a bunch of glossary. And a half of the book is blank for writing notes. What a rip-off!!! There's no outlines at all. No chapter summaries, no  explanation of concepts. Totally useless.  I have used "Collins College Outlines" series (I rate them 3 stars) and "Barron's Business Reviews" series (I rate them 5 stars).  Never buy any of "Cram 101 Textbook Outlines" series.    Technical notes: "Cram 101 Textbook Outlines" is POD (Print on demand). No wonder quality of printing is inferior (Looks like a xerox copy). And priced too high for this quality. For those who are not familiar with publishing industry--POD is used for ultra small quantity less than 100 copies. This is a telltale sign that book is not expected to sell minimum quantity (usually 3,000 copies) that commercial publisher is willing to  commit to publish. Simply put, POD means inferrior and  overpriced books. A work of amateur 
 Wanted to like it, really liked the intro and concept and the idea of the characters, all starts out endearing and quarky, but story falls apart, becomes forced. Weak and silly ending. Sorry.. 
 Nansook Hong paints a painful picture of her marriage to HyoJin Moon, but she does not own up to the full truth of her parents' machinations to get her married into the Moon family. Eyewitnesses tell of Nansook visiting the Moon household and knowing full well of HyoJin's excesses in advance of her marriage. The Hongs wanted desperately for their family to be entwined with the Moon family, and after arranging for one child to be wed to the first Moon daughter, they pushed Nansook to marry a Moon son. Though I don't know all the motives, the point is that there was an agenda behind her marriage and probably this book that Ms. Hong has not been honest about. It is only too easy to paint an unflattering portrait of Rev Moon and his wife but at least some of this is suspect, given her own deceit 
 This book is only an overview of topics, none of the topics are discussed in detail, so if you just depend on this one book to pass the exam, it is not going to work. The sample problems and other topics make assumptions  without reference to where they came from. As long as you have other texts  or good notes from your courses, this book is O 
 I waited for this book to come out in paperback and pre-ordered.  I am a fan of WHITE TEETH, and, although AUTOGRAPH MAN was boring, I had high hopes for ON BEAUTY.  Sadly, this writer should stick to what she knows -- a visiting professorship doesn't make her an authority on campus life in U.S., New England, or what American kids say and do. The assumptions and voices given to her characters are distracting in their outsiderish author's depiction, and I found this to really get in the way of her stoytelling--especially her stabs at Boston and southern accents.  Her British characters (especially Howard and V) are well drawn and speak naturally--reminiscent of WHITE TEETH.  They are believable.  Her Americans are laughably off-base and seem like charicatures of how an arrogant Brit might imagine them, especially Levi and Carl.  The character Zora (modeled on the precocious author herself?) is not likeable at all.  The story of Jerome and his pursuit of religion is choppy and not well developed. He slides in and out of the story. The  Furthermore, her story line about campus politics is lackluster.  Another reviewer references Kingsley Amis's LUCKY JIM.  I recommend Richard Russo's excellent STRAIGHT MAN for anyone interested in the liberal arts dept / tenure / backstabbing /cheating plots 
 Basically this book was the author's dissertation. And that's about it. The writing isn't that good, and the "study" as a whole is very limited. In particular she ignores the previous punk generation, and doesn't address the changes in the scene over 20 years. This ignores the fact that as punk became more common, the common problems of the general culture seeped back in  - especially sexism. It could be used as a starting point for young people to enter the discussion, but certainly can't be seen as any kind of definitive text because there are too many holes. I was disappointed because I was so looking forward to someone finally opening up this topic, and had expected something better 
 "Le Morte d'Arthur" or "The Death of Arthur" is an exceptionaly long and boring book no one should ever have to read 
 Off-hand, I can't think of a worse movie. (And I think Nicolas Cage has done some truly awesome work in other films--hey, he's making a buck, here.) That's all. 1/32 star, if possible 
 This book was utterly a waste of time to read.  My artistic nature and love for good literature was completely offended by the sacrilege of this exceptionally ridiculous plot.  Granted, the idea is to convey the trapped woman vs. the time of the late 19th century and the ineffectual struggle countered by many women.  But the plot serves to indicate nothing more than a crazed woman who abbandons her family, life, and morals (all of which were under no concern or abuse) and utterly leaves all those around her in a daze regarding her ridiculous behavior.  I clapped when the fool drowned at the end of the book.  
 Uhhh, puh-lease. Okay, maybe a little kid who was like, 3 would like it, but older kids will find themselves snoring away. I had to read this book for school. It is about two unintelligent little kids who get a dog. They lose the dog. They are sad. They can't figure out who took the dog. The dog comes back. Whoop-dee-doo. End. Ya see? I could have written this book better. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK!! EVER!! 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 My first impression of this heating pad was, "GREAT!"  It is large enough to wrap around a sore shoulder and well down the back, it has nice controls and four heat settings, and turns off after an hour or so (for safety).  Unfortunately, it was only 3 weeks before it stopped working.  I exchanged it for another unit (thought maybe it was a fluke).  The replacement lasted about two months of almost daily use, then died.  It appears that the controller simply burns out. I would not recommend this heating pad 
 I am an avid reader and could not make it through this book. His other books were so good. I could not have predicted what a disapointment this book would turn out to be. In applying some of the recommended techniques, my 11 year old daughter, Emily, thought I lost my mind. Thank goodness things are back to normal. We are both much healthier having now dispensed with the advice 
 When I was a kid, I loved this movie and the TV series.  I was a devoted fan, and built model rockets of the Viper fighter, and dreamed of one day being a starfighter pilot.  So you can imagine that I was very excited about getting this DVD.  Unfortunately, now that I am an adult it simply isn't possible to enjoy it any more.  The storyline is full of holes and every cliche you can think of.  The special effects are cheap.  It's just no fun anymore 
 Sometimes, reviewers on Amazon give the reading public a great disservice ... and this is one of those times. I don't know what Preston & Child's game is, but their writing seems aimed at the junior-high crowd. Nothing wrong with that, but it would have been nice if there had been a disclaimer on the cover: "Warning - lame plot, bad writing, juvinile characters ... scratch that - no character development whatsoever 
 Standout Tracks: 25 TO LIFE, WESTSIDE, F--K WHERE YOU FROM, DO YA THING, IM A KING, LIKE A MOVIE, MESS IT UP and #1 CREW. Filler: Walk this way(Worst girlie record ever made!), Lookin shife(WTF is shife?), Still I love her(Even with T.I this record still sucks), Coming down(this song is DEAD R.I.P.), Touch Something(nice beat weak record)Murder Game (T.I killed it though)and Set it Off(weak first single). Bottom Line: we already know that T.I is a great lyricist but even he cant hold up a GROUP album such as this. Mac Boney once in a blue moon will bust a decent rhyme but Young Dro and the rest of them forget about it! Surprisingly though they have two song without T.I that is good(25 to life and #1 crew) but they also have songs with T.I that suck(touch something, Still I love her , Set it out and Murder Game). T.I had the only good verse in Murder game causing it to be labled as filler. Even if you are a T.I fan I strongly recommend you to think before you buy this one 
 After about 10 weeks of intensive dance lessons or a season of cheer practice your child should be easily able to perform the first five minutes of the "warm up".  Otherwise, they will be very frustrated. It is very fast, very complicated.  Well Choregraphed but even the "break it down" segment moves at double speed.   
 The book is TEDIOUS. A few mediocre yarns and lots of detail about Irish horseracing last year and before. Lots of old, once-charming Irish cliches repeated and repeated. Too many names, too much trivial detail about weather, horses and people you don't need to know. I'm a horse owner and interested in racing. I was bored after 50 pages, but battled on for awhile. Maybe the ending is a corker, but I doubt it. Never got that far.  This would make a good 1,500-word magazine piece. Barich is a good writer, but this book is destined for the remainder table - and soon. It is a chore to read it. I think two stars is generous.   
 I have never read one of Johansen's books and after reading this one, I'm not likely to read another.  I usually enjoy reading pretty much any type of mystery and am not a literary critic by any means, but I just couldn't get into the story here because of the flowery and cliche-filled writing.  Exclamations such as "dear heaven" and "lord" were repeated over and over again by all characters throughout the book, which doesn't seem to fit with the rest of their conversational tone (it would suit my southern grandma, however).  As another reviewer said, the big mystery of why Daisy wouldn't leave Geneva wasn't particularly mysterious - if she really wanted Jason to leave she could have just told him.  Character development was lacking and I just didn't care that much about them.  I would have liked to hear more about Cynthia and her antics.  I did finish the book because I was curious to know what happened, but I couldn't wait for it to be over.  Sorry, but this was not my cup of tea 
 Gary Sicks' bizarro theory that George Bush flew to Paris in an SR-71 to meet with the Iranians to convince them to keep the hostages until after the election in 1990 is just plain crazy.  Congress investigated this and found no basis for Sicks account.  This is better fiction though than most spy stories but no one should take this silliness seriously 
 This book is too punny.  I think that if this book read more like the "Zombie Survival Guide", it would be much, much better. 
 I have to admit that my wife read this book first and said it was slow.  She didn't say how slow though.  But rather than take her word for it (why should I?  After all, she's my wife) I bothered to pick it up and read it.  How I wish I had listened to her and left it in the box of stuff for the rummage sale.  I cannot stand Baldacci's juvenile charactor dialog, but finish it I did though most of it I could have read through closed eyes and not missed anything.  I'll stick with my Nelson DeMille from here on if I want literary junk food 
 It seems that people either love it or hate it and  I belong to the latter category.  How did this become a classic???  Having forced myself to read to the end I'm not going to waste anymore time - just read the other 1-star reviews - poor kids forced by their teachers to read this over-rated garbage 
      Ruben Dario was the first great Spanish symbolist poet and perhaps the greatest of all Latin American poets.  It's good to see a substantial selection of his poetry in Spanish in accessible form.  The English translations, however, are inept almost beyond belief.  What the reader with some Spanish needs is a careful and competent trot, as in the wonderful "Penguin Book of Spanish Verse," where the translator gets every nuance.  What the reader gets is verse translations in which every consideration of meaning is subordinated to the need for rhyme.  Moreover, the translators, in the interest of a spurious readability, make no attempt to suggest the orotund classicizing side of Dario's diction. I have the impression that many such poems, among Dario's best, have been suppressed as too difficult and/or unfashionable.  Finally, the translators apparently wouldn't recognize a literary allusion or quotation in the original if it fell on them.    The Stavans introduction is just contemptible, as both biography and literary criticism.  Stavans' prose style, as always, is just awful.  Mr. Stavans, there is no such English word as "illusive"!  I've never written an Amazon review before, but then I've rarely approached a book with such high hopes and been so disappointed 
 On the plus side, the star charts are the most clear and readable of any 6th magnitude atlas. Unfortunately, the atlas contains a couple of flaws which impede its usefulness in the field.  It goes to magnitude 6.5 and shows 9500 stars, which limits its usefulness. Even a lowly 6x30mm finder goes considerably deeper than that.  When you look for an object just off the edge of one of your charts, the edge of the chart tells you nothing about where to go next. You have to fumble back to the index page to find out which chart to go to, which is time consuming and aggravating.  Terrestrial atlases place guides at the edges of their maps: "continues on 14." This is all the more important for astronomical observation, where the user is in the dark with nothing but a red flashlight and possibly holding an eyepiece or filter. To make the atlas practicable for field use, users must write the adjacent chart information on the charts themselves. A row of tabs with the numbers of the charts would make the charts even more usable.  It is sad when designers of star atlases do not take into account the needs of their users.  A better combination 6th magnitude atlas and observer's guide is Levy's Skywatching. But I would recommend skipping 6th magnitude altogether. Get the Sky and Telescope Pocket Star Atlas instead. It is better designed, goes far deeper--to magnitude 7.6 with 31,000 stars, and costs less. Supplement it with an observer's guide like Skywatching or Celestial Sampler 
 This review concerns the unabridged audiobook of The Last Camel Died at Noon read by Susan O'Malley. I have read that book before and I am a fan of the Amelia Peadody-series which I have read completely. The books vary in quality but they are always enjoyable. The present title is one of the most unique stories - best explained as being a satirical citation of Henry Rider Haggards SHE. I also like audiobooks and last year I first heard a Peabody-novel narrated by Barbara Rosenblat. It was quite a treat. I wasn't able to get "The last Camel.." read by her then, but was content to order this unabridged version read by Susan O'Malley. However, it was the worst audiobook I ever listened to. ...I therefore recommend that if one ever want's to listen to an Elizabeth Peters audiobook than only if Barbara Rosenblat is the narrator. Anything else would be  selfdeceit. Rosenblat even turns the weaker episodes into celebrations (all by Recordedbooks) 
 Jack R. Meredith and Samuel J. Mantel, Jr. have written an academic reference book about project management that is at times dry, theoretical, and boring to read. However, their book is at other times a good, interesting reflection tool for an experienced project manager. A green project manager will often have difficulty to relate the content of the book to his/her new practice. Based on my own experience, there is ultimately no better learning school than getting his/her hands "dirty" in the field under the supervision of an experienced project manager to learn the ropes of the job 
 But every other song is ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. Like That is great though...too bad they had to sell out so badly, they were going places 
 I'm going to assume the book "I Captured the Castle" is better than the movie.  The cinematography is excellent, and the acting is decent all around except for the lead character played by Romola Garai. In her most dramatic scene, a confrontation with her father, she played out her emotions in an over-slow, melodramatic manner like a bad, bad stage play.  I'll give her a break because this is one of her first films, but thank goodness Bill Nighy carried the rest of the scene. The funny thing is when you listen to Romola during her interview in the special features, you think "Why couldn't we get this part of you in the film"?  She's an intelligent and witty woman, but her performance as the lead character was just underwhelming. That's a horrible shame.  The lead always sets the tone for the film. This would explain why the movie seemed to drag.      I found this film to be a bore despite the wonderful talent.    
 I really like the Crane humidifiers for children, my youngest daughter has been using the penguin at night for quite some time.  It occasionally glugs but the most part is very quiet.  So I was confident that the apple shape my elder daughter chose would be just as good.  I was surprised when it arrived as the water cannister was much flatter and smaller than I had expected and the design of the base which controled the water flow was different.  Still we started to use it and quickly discovered that it didn't detect the water level accurately and frequently turned itself off.  This may be a fault with the one I received and so I have sent it back, or it may be a design flaw with this shape.  I have just received the soccer ball and the base on this looks more like the penguin and the water cannister is more like a sphere.  So although I haven't had chance to use it I am more hopeful of success. It is important to empty these humidifiers regularly and clean them, I forgot for a few days and was horrified at the build up of slimy stuff and the smell of mould in such a short time 
 I have been using my medela pump for the past 5 months( first couple of months intermittently and the last 2 1/2 months daily). Suddenly it broke down without any warning signs on a weekend. My dealer was not open to replace it and this has caused a considerable loss of milk supply in me. Thankfully the dealer was a local dealer and very good. He replaced "just the pump" in the pack with a new one.  Per Medela's instructions, they actually want to send the broken pump over to them and they will take care of it, if it was under a yr old. It would have been very late for me if I were to ship it and they have to ship it back.  Another thing that is happening is my back pack's handles have started wearing down. And I hardly carry them around. I am giving it a 1 star because of the poor quality check that must have been carried out for such an expensive pump. I would think twice before buying this 
 It's rather hard to review the product. I ordered from Kid Concoctions over a month ago and still haven't received my order and they won't reply to my emails 
 Though this book was written much better than Foundation's Fear, I wasn't very impressed. You know how movie studios always do re-makes of old movies? Well this here is a re-write, basically of the first chapter of Asimov's classic original Foundation book. What a waste of paper. If you already read the original, then you already know what will happen at the end 
 This movie is an insult to merely bad comedies. Gee, another movie with a fast-talking, potty-mouthed, black guy (hello Eddie Murphy) who, because it's perfectly fine in ultra-lib, pc Hollyweird, calls Charlie Sheen (and everyone else who is not Black) a host of nasty, racially-oriented names. The movie is a mess. Let's see. The protagonist (Tucker) plays a con men who after being falsely suspected of being a cop-killer, is chased around  by cops and the bad guys. The McGuffin is a sack of diamonds. Sheen is supposed to be a co-star, but like most of his other movies, he sleepwalks through it. Clearly this movie is meant to be a vehicle for Tucker. The sceenwriters were obviously making it up as they went along. First "screenwriter":" Hey Bob, what will we have Tucker do next? Hey I know, let's have a car chase and have him call some people some names" Second "screenwriter" "Hey, great idea Fred, I sure don't have any ideas".  Apparently there are many people who think this guy is funny even though the movie is a rip-off of Murphy the Trickster flicks. Basically the plot is Tucker runs around dodging bullets and calling everyone a name. If that's your idea of humor, I pity you.  
 One review says this book is "Part critical history, part personal memoir, part celebration, and part meditation." This is accurate - though some parts are larger than others. The critical history is very interesting - but the personal memoir, which dominates the book, is not. Gitlin has a lot of interesting and incisive things to say, but he dwells far too much on boring minutiae like who Tom Hayden's girlfriend was in different months 
 Nora Roberts's books are my escape, and usually a blissful one.  I love the magic, character development, strong women overcoming obstacles, and romance found in her novels.  Morrigan's Cross disappointed me.  Vampires are a little over the edge for me, but what made me close the book was the 10-year-old vampire with the protaganist.  I spend my days with children who have been abused in every way imaginable, and reading this put me in a bad mood.  King was a comic relief, but he got killed.  That was when I did something I've never done with a N.R. book - closed it, put it in the closet, and later sold it.  I'm not reading any of the others in the trilogy.  Instead, I took out the Three Sisters' trilogy and enjoyed myself.   
 I enjoyed this once, as a student, then I grew up. Some books, the magic lasts forever. This doesn't 
 This CD is the worst "comedy" CD I have ever heard.  Yet the reviews on here mostly claim it was hilarious????  Ok, I've come to the conclusion, the only people writing positive reviews on Amazon MUST be the people trying to sell the junk.  I've seen this guy on some tv shows, and on comedy central, and he's a somewhat funny guy, but it is painful to listen to this CD.  You can feel the awkwardness of the crowd, not knowing if or when to laugh.  And it continues throughout the entire CD.  There don't seem to be any jokes on the CD at all.  It is all disconnected negative rants from a bitter angry human being.  Don't believe me?  Then go ahead and waste your money on this horrible piece of junk, and see for yourself.  Like my review title says, Do NOT read the positive reviews.  Just read the negative ones, and decide how credible they seem.  Then make your decision to buy or not buy 
 This book is actually worse than Lahaye's deeply disturbing and nonsensical "Rapture" series because it masquerades under the guise of "scholarship."  Of course the book it claims to be analyzing can only be proven true by refrencing passages in that book that claim that its true.  So, borrowing a tactic from our all knowing Heavenly Furher Jesus:  THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT IS TRUE: Christians are full of **** and shouldn't be allowed to publish books.  You read it so it must be true 
 While some movies require that you throw out your disbelief, I had a very hard time doing so with this movie.  This movie was just plain stupid.  They should have kept this film story in the states.  Once everything moves over to Tokyo, the film plummets into inauthenticity the likes of which I haven't seen in a long time.  I would have respected the film 1,000 times more had it ended when the main character goes to Japan.  So let's get this straight, Japanese high school students act like American high school students?  Lucas Black's character is simply told to go to a Japanese high school where he will simply pick up the language and make do?  Everybody speaks English ? His father lives in a tiny apartment yet has a garage that's about double the size of his apartment?  I would have much preferred subtitles and a story that felt, looked and sounded more Japanese.  Japanese students are among some of the most polite students you will ever meet.  The Japanese culture is steeped and immersed in being respectful, polite and dutiful.  Real Japanese high school students would be embarassed by the way their culture was represented here.  Actually they probably wouldn't be embarassed, they would laugh at the film's poor attempt in showing true or even remotely true Japanese culture.  Japanese culture is not steeped in American hiphop and egocentric behavior and it's a pity so many Americans will see this film and actually think that Japanese students are just like American students.  There would be nothing further from the truth.  Japanese students do not act, look or sound like what was filmed here.  Not by a long shot.  Given my dislike of how the Japanese culture was handled in this film, it left me finding the plot irrelevant.  The plot was OK but it would have been much better if they had either stuck to a more authentic representation of Japanese culture or kept the story in the states.    
 This is my first electric shaver. I have pretty rough skin and i get a lot of ingrown hairs. I'm a dark hispanic male and the shaver isn't doing much for me. It isn't as clean of a shave as a regular blade. It does leave your skin smooth but it doesn't cut very deep as to remove all the hair. It has a great desisn and very easy to work with and to travel with but the cut is just not the greatest 
 It seems to be an exciting look behind the scenes of a typical big city courthouse. And it is, the reader will be given an interesting and sometimes spellbinding look into the lockups, the backrooms and chambers where justice is being sought, sometimes found, sometimes not. Having spent many years in New York City courtrooms I can agree with the  descriptions in this book.   However, every page is dripping with bias. You will find every liberal prejudice that ever was invented: The deputies are pretty much heartless sadistic roboters, the prosecutors overzealous apparachicks who waste taxpayers' money -and always are white, which is pretty unbelievable-, corruption among the judges is rampant -which is even more unbelievable-, and the defendants always are poor, disadvantaged minorities, who in the author's view are only victims of society and should not be held responsible for their crimes. Luckily the author found a judge, who pretty much shares this attitude.  The author only changes his view where the defendants are white. Here the judge cannot throw the book hard enough at them.   Once the reader has been numbed enough to just ignore this mantra, the book is mildly interesting. Sadly, as in most liberal descriptions of our justice system, you read a lot about the defendants, the judges, the lawyers, but almost nothing about the victims of the defendants' crimes.   Sadly, after a few pages you have already had all the information you will get. The rest of the book will only repeat the author's ideology. That makes reading this book pretty much a waste of time.  
 This album was released in 1999. And now, seven years later, this album does not even matter. Britney Spears is remembered not for her musical talent but for her inability to parent a child. Great music lasts dozens of years for its complexity, innovation, creativity, and ability to transcend cultures and generations. Great music stirs something inside the listener, and matters to the person who created it. Britney Spears and the ridiculous product that her record companies have created is none of these things. It saddens me to see the number of copies an album such as this sells originally. And yet, the great albums of all times sell thousands of copies years - decades, even - after their release. Music like this, Britney Spears and her peers, disappears into the folds of time. It does not matter. 
 Glad to see I'm not the only one who can't stand this book.  There is nothing to redeem the inferior writing, fractured plot, inconsitancies (a dragon changed color!  OMG, hire an editor, for crimminy's sake!), and completely undeveloped characters.  Weyerleaders act like petulant children, showing the worst characterists of previous "real" McCaffery characters.  The main character is alternately distrusted, then suddenly trusted, then shot at, then trusted again, for little apparent reason.  And firestone plain old does not kill dragons--ask a real writer, Todd.  You stink 
 The second CD was scratched and hence I cannot play it. I would appreciate it if you would send me another one and also include the information needed to return the damaged one sent to me.  Thanks.  Jeann 
 My going-off-to-college student is all the title implies. I wish, I wish, I wish the recipes lived up to the other reviews. This assumes you have more of a stocked kitchen to work with and will be interested in starting from scratch. There are actually words like "homemade mild tomato salsa" and "toasted pine nuts". There's alot of explanation...more words than recipes, I think. This is very readable, very cute, and looks like pretty good food, but not for the hungry, harried college student in a dorm who isn't going to roast peppers or go get fennel, celeriac or even fresh broccoli 
 I have a number of Scritti Politti albums, including the incomparable Cupid and Psyche '85.  This isn't a close comparison.  Much too slow, lugubrious, contemplative.  Puts me to sleep.  Suffers from an overly simple production and uninteresting unlayered backgrounds on what sounds like one tired synth.  This isn't horrible, but given the genius of the other albums, this one suffers.  I wish I hadn't purchased this album.  
 this is a bad book. there is no other way around it. i love robin hobb, she is nothing less than an engaging and skilled writer. i wonder where she left her abilities when she wrote this boring, verbose, lifeless, junk heap. i must say, for a great read pick up her 'golden fool' series. here, however, she followed up 'soldier's son', which was a good book if not a bit verbose (i truly blame the editor -- the problem could have been fixed), w/a book that would have been an unfulfilling short story. it's 700 pages and could have been written in 125. on top of that, i got the feeling mrs. hobb had absolutely no inner critic to guide her pen. there is a note in the book to someone or other saying something to the effect that they 'got through a tough year.' well, have some compassion and don't subject me to it. pained writing is something that has fueled countless wonderfull books -- but this one is tepid, meandering and melodramatically wistfull. that's the bitterly funny part...but i suppose it's good that at least one writer is better off sober and happy. now please, robin, return to that state. i miss you 
 Some of the works of art are lovely, but 2 are too violent for a child to study. In one, a man is being beheaded and another shows a nightmarish scene with a man on fire. Is this the best the author could find? Sure to turn some children away from art 
 I bought this almost exactly 2 years ago, and I turned it on the other day and went to take a picture indoors that required a flash, and the flash would not work. It was set to automatic flash.  Using the auto setting, I thought there used to be 3 flash settings (auto, forced flash and no flash), but now there were only 2.  I took it outside on a sunny day and used the auto flash, and the flash went off outside!  Something is messed up and it has the light and dark confused.   Thinking I hit something and changed a setting, I reset it to the factory defaults and it still doesn't work.  It will probably be too expensive to get it fixed, and it's weird but I just upgraded to a Nikon D50.  I must have known this camera was about to die.  Even when it worked, half the time pictures came out blurry. I either got fantastic crystal clear shots or blurry ones as if the auto focus missed.  Maybe the camera was defective the entire time I had it. No more Canons for me 
 I was disappointed in the movie as it did not go into depth in regards to the insights, the book was absolutley fantastic due to this fact, but I feel the movie did not capture this which disappointment me. On the other side it was a move forward to awakening the people in regards to a more spiritual awakening. 
 Arabs and Muslims do NOT hate America.  They are angry, indeed indignant, about U.S. policies in their region, and the ways the U.S. uses its power to dominate, invade, impose sanctions, support corrupt regimes, exploit oil resources.  These are, however, POLITICAL issues.  If they actually hated America, the situation would be hopeless.  But they love American values, freedom, democracy (look at polls in Arab countries) and most would like to immigrate and raise their children here.  This means that their own children will be Americans.  In the Middle East, Arabs/Muslims are very welcoming and helpful to American residents, who are not held accountable for the actions of their government (if this is a surprise, ask anyone who has lived in the Arab World).  This is contrary to the media image held by people who have not been there (violence, hatred).  Extremists, who hate the entire West, are perhaps one percent. Many people sympathize with resentments against America's political policies, but they do not agree with violence (many Americans sympathize with anti-abortion groups but do not condone blowing up clinics, and in the name of Christianity to boot).  Actual Islamic extremists are much like our White Aryans or neo-Nazis who oppose all who are not like them.  Here's a simple way to investigate this: ASK Arabs and Muslims in your community (they live in every community and blend in just fine) if they hate America.  Or if they are angry at America, ask why.  Commentators are always confident that they can explain how a group of people think (hatred of our religion, wealth, freedom, hatred going back centuries) or perhaps they need more information about us, or they're just crazy/evil/inscrutable.  Disputes between Islam and the West during the Crusader era, or the Islamic conquest era, etc., have no relevance in modern people's thinking (do the Crusades shape our thinking today?).  I am an American who knows Arabic and hears, and/or overhears discussions going on around me.  I travel widely in the Arab World.  I am just reporting on what I have heard first-hand.  Until our government realizes that the problem is political, we cannot begin to address responses to "anti-Americanism. 
 By chance before picking this up I had just finished The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers, and was struck by the similarities and differences. It's a great "compare and contrast" pair, as an exercise for high-schoolers.  Both are written as first-person accounts by teen-aged girls and are roughly contemporary. Heart published in 1940, and Castle in 1948, both about life in the 30s.   Both families are poor. In Castle though, there is never any question that the girls might go off and get jobs. This is supposedly because they "don't know how to do anything". So instead they sell off their belongings and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter. How charming! They are "eccentric", which seems enough in the author's eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting themselves. Only Stephen the handsome young son of the late housekeeper, enamored of Cassandra, does work and gives the family his entire salary. But he is of the class that is expected to toil after all. Even he is rewarded in the end--able to avoid labor with an easy job similar to that of step-mum Topaz--striking poses.  Unlike the looming and grinding poverty of Heart then, the poverty in the Castle never amounts to more than a lark--educated folks playing at being poor until they're rescued by romantic circumstance. Not so in America where Mick Kelly, who didn't know how to do anything either, went off to work at Woolworth's, and to a life of little hope.  In Castle the solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina, the inheritance. Two dashing young wealthy Americans one of whom has inherited the castle, show up just in time, with their chatty modern mum. They throw money around and talk too much, in the cliched extravagant American style. Most of the remainder of the novel consists of Cassandra and her sister Rose swooning over one brother or the other, with an eventual romantic result that assures all the characters of economic well being.   It's all so very charming, bourgeois, and harmless. If your life is hard don't worry--a man will show up to rescue you!  The reviews for this novel in Amazon are overwhelmingly positive. Smith was obviously talented. Her writing is elegant and a pleasure to read. I wish she had given Cassandra a little more ambition. 
 Very simplistically written. Interesting topic and examples but the first part is way too elementary and self serving of the author.  Some new information but not riveting 
 The book version of "Origins", which I think Scientific American or maybe The Economist rightfully recommended as THE essential general science book for 2005 is the next step from David Bodanis's equally splendid e=MC2.  And because it's one step up, it's just a tad harder, especially if you're also an economist/accountant/car dealer who'd really like to understand quantum mechanics (and maybe basic string theory and how it's possible to cope with dimensions beyond the currently now unfashionable four) but skipped science at school and uni.  For this particular (nano scale) niche market, the DVD was a big disappointment because it didn't even hint at the exitance or relevance of the reeeealy interesting bits like anti-matter, dark energy & matter and the current inability of anyone to reconcile Alberts General Theory with the sub atomic or even why it matters.  However, all's not lost as the really smart 10 year old (not mine) who watched section 2; part 1 with me was totally enthralled as I imagine any one of any age who hadn't thought about or encountered astrophysics before would be.  So the questions are;  was it OK or better?  YES do I want my money back?  NO will I watch it again?  YES would I lend to anyone?  only with a cash deposit upfront would I recommend it?  ABSOLUTELY will it drive the creationists into an early demise?  ABSOLUTELY!  'nuf said.   
 This is a case where the book is wonderful and the movie is just pathetic.  I hadn't read the book before seeing the movie.  The film stunk.  A few years later, I read the book and was enchanted.  I did not make the connection that this was the same story until I saw the film again on late night tv.  I was all excited to see one of my favorite books on the screen.  Then, I realized what movie it was.  I tried to sit through it.  I just couldn't.  The monster should have eaten the film 
 While I think Ms. Burke has real talent, this book left me cold.  Despite all the other very positive reviews, I found the ongoing "back-stories" confusing and hard to follow.  Our "heroine", Irene Kelly, doesn't even appear until page 149!  And there are just too many characters, and too many family relationships to keep straight.  Not to mention too many references to other plot-lines not being explained in this book.  Perhaps this book should have been separated into two, or even three, stand-alone books.  I think "Bloodlines" would  have benefited enormously from more capable editing 
 I expected a scientific delivery of Valerie's research into bioelectrical/bioelectromagnetic phenomena and was disappointed at the preppie level of information.  For example, the graphs depict Lissajous  interpretations of some of her data and name them 'chaos mathematical  formula'.  Please, Valerie, you are in waayy over your head. She does  better at the abstract nonsensical which can neither be proven or denied.   Basically, as a scientific work, it is junk 
 "A Medieval Feast" is a children's book on a feast held during the Middle Ages.  Since I was looking for a book on Medieval Cookery, and this title came up, I purchased it.  I shouldn't have.  It's a picture book  for young children, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with Medieval  recipes or cookery.  If It wouldn't cost me the price of the book in  shipping, I'd send it back.  However, for children who would like a story  with a Medieval flare, this book is perfect for them, with lovely  illustrations by ALIKI 
 While the 18 recipes in this cookbook (yes, you read correctly, 18) do represent traditional Greek cooking well, most of the recipes would be difficult for a young cook to make without adult supervision and assistance.  Traditional favorites such as baklava, spanikopita and stuffed grape leaves are included among the recipes.  The beginning of the book has cultural information about Greece and safe cooking tips.  This book would be helpful for a school project about Greece, but it is disappointingly short 
 I would have to say that I am quite disappointed in what this book has to offer. I had hoped to see more tutorials on how to "perfect" a 3D female form, or human form in general, using applications like: Lightwave, Max, Maya and Softimage etc. with a heavy focus on anatomy. Instead, the bulk on this book is filled with Photoshop detailing techniques used to create a single STILL!!! image/scene and a gallery with many images that were obviously done in Poser and not very original. There are, in my opinion, better 3D anatomy tutorials around the web than in this book if you are interested in perfecting the art of building a realistic human figure. Thank god it wasn't expensive 
 This book went right off tangent, after the brilliant writing that started the series.  The side-story is pretty bland, doesn't provide insight so much as it rewrites the backstory, and the overall plot isn't expanded, it sounds like he mostly ran out of ideas and started to drag his other books into the story. 
 Robert Wiene's "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is a celebrated work of German Expressionism.  While there are several interesting facets to it, this grand experiment in filmmaking cannot be regarded as a complete success.  Francis (Friedrich Feher) relays a strange story.  A man named Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) once came to his town seeking a permit to display an exhibit at a carnival.  The exhibit was a wooden cabinet that housed a somnambulist named Cesare (Conrad Veidt).  Strange happenings then ensued after Cesare predicted the death of one of Francis's friends.  Concerned for the safety of his beloved Jane (Lil Dagover), Francis took it upon himself to determine whether Caligari was the person responsible for the disturbing series of events.  In a strange way, one can look upon "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" as a bizarre version of "The Wizard of Oz" (1939).  The framing sequences are similar and the surreal appearance of the town effectively creates an unfamiliar world that has its own unique and distinct visual identity.  Yet, despite the ample creativity on display and the intriguing ideas the film explores in regards to memory and interpretation, "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is stiff and dreary.  The characters are not engaging and the story is just a generic murder mystery with a monster thrown in.  Give "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" points for trying to do something different and for influencing the look and feel of horror films that followed, but feel free to skip it if you are not a fan of the peculiar.   
 My kids think this is a better toy than our dog.  Wasn't worth the money I paid for it.  Comes apart too easy 
 I hate to write negative comments but I was truly disappointed in this book.  Granted, I know a few things about scanning but this book didn't provide any further inside than what is commonly known about scanning.    What about film formats, considerations for resolution calculation, where to make the adjustments (scanner or photo editor) in order to get the best quality?  What about when to use higher than 8 bit scans for reflective or transparencies, how to handle and clean film the best, scanner color management, etc.?  There are so many other scanning questions that I have that were not touched in any way.  I would have called this book "Basic digital Imaging from film history through digital image output"  I have to say that I really liked the background information on traditional film but was very disappointed that there was so little about digital scanning and so much about photo editing, 3rd party vendors, image publishing, and other non-scanning topics.  There are better books out there if you just look for a good all-round book about digital photography 
 As many other reviewers have previously stated, P & T are as full of B.S as they do assail it. Its hard to criticize them, because sometimes they're spot on correct, and many of their arguments hold water. Too often, it simply comes down to Penn making fun of people and using forced amounts of profanity to prove that they're wrong. Occasionally, they will use Mythbuster-like tactics, but rarely. For someone who hates Michael Moore, Penn Jilette seemes to adopt many of his methods and "I'm right, they're wrong" ideology.  One episode devoted to Cryptozoology was more of an attack on zoology in general. As a zoology student, I took offense to this. Jilette referred to new species of animals as "stupid" and was basically implying that zoological research is worthless and boring. As a guy who is an avowed athiest and skeptic who trumps science over religion and superstition, Penn only served to remind me, also an athiest and skeptic, how annoying and passionless overly pessimistic and skeptic people are to be around after a while 
 As a white man, this book offended me several times during the first five minutes of reading it.  If an author wrote in the same way about black people the book would not even be published! I am tired of the double standard! Thank god I didn't pay for this book and only checked it out at the library 
 The image in this product is misleading. It looks like this product contains more than 1 piece, but when I opened it I got only one piece which is very small size and also the quality is inferior 
      I hated this book even when I was a kid. Lucy Maud Montgomery didn't know how to "create" a happy marriage between Anne and Gilbert because her own marriage was so disasterous. In real life, Lucy Maud's only friends were women and her negative attitude towards her husband is reflected in this book. Gilbert should have been outgoing, interesting, debonaire and REAL. Instead, he's a flat cardboard character who hides in the background. Although Anne is only in her late 30's, she's a prim and repressed matron who feels life has passed her by as she watches her children grow. And the kids are annoying! Saintly Walter is being primed as the sacrificial lamb and martyr--a destiny he fulfills in "Rilla of Ingleside." There's something weirdly disturbing and unreal about them...and their parents. Believe it or not--the most fascinating character is "Christine," the sultry widow who flirts with Gilbert and tries to "steal" him away from Anne--sort of! Christine is a little naughty and not very nice (by early 1900's standards) and she spices up this otherwise dull book.  
 I like the music, but the sound quality is terrible.  I bought this CD because it was released in 2003, but there is ZERO improvement in sound quality from previous older tracks 
 I admit to being curious about Rihanna's music because like a previous poster from Brooklyn stated " I was not trying to become a Rihanna fan!!".  I was really pleasantly surprised by the quality of this disc and although Rihanna is no vocal powerhouse, the songs on the disc were produced in such a way as to mask this fact and create more than a few enjoyable songs.  I really loved her lead single, PON DE REPLAY and since I don't listen to the radio, it never grew old to me because I heard it so infrequently. It's almost an instantly classic dance track with its hypnotic beats & fun lyrics.  The other standout tracks to me are:  HERE I GO AGAIN - like the island beats of the music and again, her vocals are utilized well on the track  WILLING TO WAIT - more of a straight r&b track with great beats that again, work well with her vocals  LET ME - has an interesting "go-go" beat mixed with a middle eastern sound  RUSH - again, a great dance track  It's unfortunate that her vocal skills are so slight because there are 2 ballads that although featuring very pretty music production, ultimately fail as singles because she is such a weak vocalist: THE LAST TIME - Rihanna attempts vocal runs that are way out of her league and NOW I KNOW - although she has moments where her voice sounds pretty, this song would've been a big hit for a stronger singer.  Honestly, I'd recommend this disc to others who are curious about Rihanna's music and to those who like Ashanti - ultimately they are cut from the same cloth as "artists".  They are able to produce enjoyable singles (through the magic of ProTools) but don't do much in the way of live vocal performances 
 We bought this game knowing Shrek movies are a bit raunchy, but thinking the game would be ok for a 6 year old to play.After watching my son play this game for a few minutes... I saw that he had to stun chickens and put them in a pot of boiling water while they were still alive. Then after that, he punched large turtles and threw them on tables where there backs were cracked open and died.  I can't believe a game that is rated E for Everyone would have little kids (or whoever played it) have to be so mean to animals.  What's next, ripping the head off a rabbit? I consider myself one of the coolest moms around, but this totally crossed the line 
 Love the movie, but the quality of the DVD put out by Alpha Video was so bad it was very difficult to watch. The sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up. If you don't want to be disappointed and feel like you've been ripped off, wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one 
 The information that is in this book is good but it is way overpriced.  I could get the same amount of information in anthor book for 30 dollars cheaper 
 This book reads like a very lazy translation from Chinese by someone who has not grasped the subtleties of the English language.  Insufficient and unclear details of the various exercises. Disappointing 
 This book was extremely disappointing.  A great volume of the book was filled with details about individuals who have an interest in cryptozoology.  Perhaps three names belonged in the book, if even that.  Some of these people do not belong in a cryptozoology book any more than I do.  Take away the sections on people pursuing bigfoot and other oddities and you are left with a scant book.  I have enjoyed the author's books in the past, but this book fell short 
 This novel is far to long and tedious.  The Sci-Fi twists were interesting, but they were so submerged in a mass of words and unnecessary subplots that it was difficult to maintain interest.  It's really a pity that the author didn't cut it down to a more readable size and focus on the main themes.  If it had been a bit more "crisp" and focused, it probably would be one of the best Science Fiction stories of recent years 
 She never has an appropriate ending. Can she go back to school and learn the "ABC's" of how to end a novel?  This was just lame.  You couldnt really get into the characters and I felt nothing for them.   Becasue of this book I will not read her novels again 
 My grandmother and my mother have read Danielle Steele for years, but I must admit I'd never picked one up. I was always more for historical romances. But I wanted something different, had heard good things about her, so while at the library, decided to give her a try. I have to say I'm extremely disappointed. Granted, I'm a fellow writer (a very picky reader by nature), and an unpublished one to boot, but the writing could've been better in my opinion. The first five pages are all backstory of Paris's marriage (no action, no excitement, told very "history lesson-ish") and what could have been an extremely powerful scene between Paris and her husband (the inciting incident in the first chapter) left me wondering, "So what?". Twenty five pages in, I could care less about these people. I honestly expected more from a bestselling author. 
 Grabhorn starts with the assumption that our feelings can change the course of events around us. While there is some truth to this assumption, Grabhorn claims that our feelings could even change seemingly "random" events (like getting rear-ended on the highway). One logical question is that if two people "ask the universe" (to use Grabhorn's terminology) for opposing events, who would succeed? The question belies the assumption that there exists a plurality of distinct and individual freewill. This assumption is conveniently discarded throughout the book. Claims that whatever one asks for will come to pass litter the entire narrative.  Grabhorn states that we need to "vibrate" at the high frequencies (i.e., those that make us "feel good") attracting the same kind of frequencies to us. Her analogy is that we are magnets attracting the same kind of frequency back to our lives. The Law of the Universe that she proclaims is: "Like attracts like."  One issue with Grabhorn's analogy is that we tend to appreciate a blend of different frequencies. Musical instruments all resonate at different frequencies. It is the combination of different frequencies that appeals to us. Music (spiritual or otherwise) incorporates a variety of frequencies and tempos to arouse our souls. Another is whenever in nature there are forces of attraction and repulsion, it is opposites that attract. In magnetism, we learn that opposite poles attract. It is sometimes posited that we are naturally attracted not only to the opposite sex but also to those with accents that are different from our own.  Fundamentally, the assumptions Grabhorn makes are more outlandish than what most readers are comfortable making. The process of "feeling good" does have medically and psychologically proven benefits, but is living "as if" something were true is an entirely different issue. Grabhorn's techniques of make-belief would be too Machiavellian for our post-modern outlook.  The book could have greatly benefited from the services of an editor. The text could have been more concise and the narration could have been more crisp and lucid. A good first draft, but more work is needed.  Armchair Interviews says: Hampton Roads publishes books for the evolvinghHuman spirit on metaphysical subjects including visionary fiction, complementary and alternative medicine, self-help, science, and spiritual. This seems to be a book you will either LOVE or HATE--depending on your point of view 
 I ordered the 7th edition as this page shows and incorrectly received the 5th edition. Problem was not corrected. 
 True, I do have to read part 7 still, but part 5 & 6 were very poorly done in my opinion.  First of all, it's obvious that the reason for the failure in 5 and 6 is that the gunslingers have lost their edge.  They have become parodies of themselves.  In another review I saw the phrase, "overly mannered," which I feel hits home.  The redundant vernacular: palaver, deal in lead, come commala this, come commala that, come commala with a wiffle ball bat, so... King is fastidious with his overdone jargon that sounds sickenly hackneyed.  Since when did gunslingers become such wimps?  Since part 5 & 6.  That's when.  The repetitive symbolism gets overdone until anything having to do with a 19, dinn, or Ka, is just charred nuggets.  The symbolism has lost its zest by being referred to annoyingly countless times.  As another reader stated, I can't wait to finish the Tower Series, so I can feel some closure on a story that went sour.             
 The is by far the weakest Grisham novel I've ever read.  The first two hundred pages creep along at a glacial pace as the protagonist (Joel Backman; more about him later) wanders Italy for nearly 200 pages, learning to speak the language and spending way too much time sipping espresso in quaint trattorias with Italian carictatures that would make Chico Marx cringe.  When Grisham finally rachets up the action and suspense, it's all for naught, as the story eventually limps and staggers to a completely listless and anticlimactic ending.  As for Joel Backman, I can't think of a more unlikeable and unsympathetic protagonist in recent memory.  A disgraced lawyer, lobbyist and traitor that plowed through life in a meaningless quest for wealth and power, all the while causing numerous deaths, and alienating numerous wives and children is supposed to be someone we care about?  Does this character redeem himself in any meaningful fashion?  You read the book and decide.. 
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 If you like hard science fiction, I would recommend trying Permutation City and Diaspora by Greg Egan instead. Another book more similar to Eon but far more readable is "Rendezvous with Rama" by Arthur C. Clarke (not the sequels). Greg Bear wasn't able to convey the sense of wonder of the situation he describes, in fact, sometimes I have found very hard to understand his descriptions, as others reviewers say (not because of their technicallity, but simply because they are sometimes very convoluted). Also, part of the plot seems outdated, be aware that this book was published in 1985 (USSR, Cold War...). I haven't been able to read past a third of the book, so this review may be a bit biased ; 
 So, being a fan of all forms of literature, more specifically challenging[faulkner], pretentious[d.h. lawrence] and original[kafka] works, I was surprised at how long it took me to get around to reading what's considered Pynchon's most imporant work.  Important 40 years ago, perhaps, but the test of time has totally obliterated the supposed wit in this one.  Oh man, the radio station is KCUF, boy, that's incredibly clever, I bet it's, like, something spelled backwards.  I fully understand what Pynchon was trying to accomplish with this work, to skewer extreme right wing nut jobs, among other things, all while giving us a story with no particular plot, no moral, no message.  I can understand it, but it doesn't mean it's worth my time, I didn't even finish it.  I read about half and then just dropped it to the floor.  I've read in numerous reviews of Haruki Murakami's work that he's a latter day, Japanese, Pynchon.  I don't agree, Murakami's ability to create a surreal dream-like atmosphere is amazing, Pynchon is a hack 
 I'm an MBA student in a top5 business school in the US, and we use this as our textbook for the basic stats course. I've only read the first 5 chapters so far, and I've found this book to be one of the worst textbooks I've seen since college. Some very simple concepts are explained in very confused (and confusing) language, the text is very arid and skips over most of the conceptual subtleties or fallacies that the unsuspecting user of statistical data may easily fall victim to. I strongly suggest leafing through it before deciding whether to buy it (you can start with chapter 2, which is pretty typical of the tone of the book and, being the 1st "substantial" chapter of the book, doesn't assume knowledge of concepts defined in previous chapters). 
 Gosh, I'd hate to be a student in a Wong classroom. Wong's book is an endeavor in positivistic manipulation, a recipe guide aimed at reproducing good little consumers who never question the authority figures in the Foucauldian nightmare world Wong and his fellow behaviorists have conjured. What Wong does not seem to realize is the children he obviously sees as objects in need of control and manipulation are going to be adults with little capacity for critical thought and decision making after 13 years of suffocation in any school under the thrall of the Wong way. Add the fact that the "practical" tips in the book are completely useless in 99 percent of the public school classrooms, and the Wong book is not only a waste of money, but a real danger to students subject to teachers sucked in by Wong's platitudes 
 In theory this sounds awesome, but in reality is comes really close to being useless.   1) The "spa" is nothing more than a light flow of water which isn't even enough to create bubbles, it comes out of the corner of the pump unit so hardly any of the stream will reach your baby  2) The shower head has a button that is nearly impossible to keep pressed in for longer than 10 seconds, the flow of water is very weak so is not powerful enough to rinse out hair. A cup does a better job than this.  3) The tub itself is pretty decent, the plateau used to lay your baby on seems nice and comfy and the temperature indicator is a nice bonus.  All in all I wish we had saved our money and just gone with a normal tub, I advise anyone else to do the same 
 All the poems are smooth and clever and slightly (or more than slightly) ironic.  They sometimes make me smile, but they seldom make me feel much.    I was recently at a poetry reading Collins gave, where he was greatly applauded.  He mentioned that sentimentality is a cardinal sin in poetry.  That's true.  But I couldn't emotionally connect to the self-consciously witty voices speaking out of his poems, and by the end of this collection I didn't really want to.  When I first read Collins, I was hoping to find the accessible poet illuminating the everyday world I was promised.  Instead, I found an extremely polished poet whose engaging tone almost makes up for his persistent lack of emotional depth.  Sentimentality may be a poetic sin, but sincerity isn't.    Even funny poems should display a little emotional risk.  But Collins never seems to risk anything.  And because he takes small risks, we get small rewards.    Go ahead and get this book.  Read it.  Smile a bit.  Appreciate the cleverness and talent Collins displays.  These poems are likeable, and I wouldn't be surprised if you liked them.  But if you are looking for poetry that will feed you, go somewhere else 
 Sir Cyril Burt achieved unparalleled results in researching the effects of environment and heredity on identical twins.  Only after his death did it become clear that the alleged research had never happened, that Burt lied to further what he perceived to be a greater truth. Sadly, the possibility must be considered that Milton Erickson did likewise.  Not only do the results he claimed to have achieved involve impossible to believe coincidences and phenomena far beyond anything ever achieved by anyone else.  They also include results that even unshakable believers in hypnotism's real existence concede are unreplicable and should be impossible.  If Erickson really accomplished what he claimed in various medical journals, then he was a miracleworker beyond compare.  Somehow I doubt that. 
 Like many others, I began reading this book with a view toward learning more about the Mormon history and their religious claims. As a psychologist, I tend to examine works I read somewhat different than the average reader.  I find it interesting, especially when reading reviews of this type of work, how varied the reviewer's comments are.  I'm sure mine may not be totally objective either but I'll give it a try.  I first try to understand the author's interest in the subject.  By doing this, it becomes easier to identify objectivity or the lack there of.  Next, I generally examine the context of the resource material from which the author presents the information.  Was it disclosed in context or was it presented in such a way that may distort the meaning from when the resource was originally published.  Finally, I read with an eye toward rationality.  By this I mean that when I read something that is presented toward making a point, I look at the original reference material as a source document and apply the first two principles.  The idea is to see if the contemporary author is consistent in disclosure and intent to the source documents.   Unfortunately, as is the case with many "religious historical works" ONUG is a thinly veiled attempt to discredit rather than to inform.  There is some good lesser-known reference material in this book.  From that perspective it was somewhat interesting but the out of context presentation of information and the obvious effort to cast dispersion is wearing on the reader looking for an objective presentation.    If you are looking for material to throw at the Mormons, you may find some here, if you are looking for an honest, objective presentation of historical information look elsewhere.  This is not an effort, as it claims, to help one understand the real history of the church.  There are many other reviews with some great objective authors and works recommendations so I will not reduplicate the list here. Just note please, this is not one of them.    I gave ONUG two stars rather than one only because of some of the reference material.  It is reasonably good.  Unfortunately, it is presented with a negative purpose rather than from a perspective of historical and contextual accuracy.  This one took a lot of reading source material to really come to an understanding of the true context of the historical material being presented.  Not what one wants to do when reading a  "historical portrayal".  It is easy to create an impression. Likewise, it is equally easy to accept an impression.  When we are willing, we often find what we are looking for when we read a book.  If we are in agreement with an authors ideas, weather we are knowledgeable or not, we tend to lend support and credibility to the author.  It does not make the work any more accurate.  The converse is also true.  In this case, those who will cast dispersions on the Mormon faith will fuel there desire, unfortunately, those who wish to learn from and understand a historical and objective presentation will be at best left wanting, and at worst be misguided by this poorly veiled attempt to cast a negative cloud over a most interesting and important part of American history.  
 The title of this book should have been "Derrick Parker is the Bomb" by Derrick Parker.  He seems a lot more interested in hyping himself then really giving any insight to the murders of Pac, Biggie and Jay.  He said he solved Jay's case.  Well, if he solved it, why is no one in jail?  There were some pretty good moments, especially his stories from Miami.  I would say that 50% of the book was Parker hyping Parker, 20% was interesting information and 30% was the just some things we've all read or heard before.  I hope that the fools that put down Pac, Biggie and Jay get their due, but this book does not do a lot to help the cause. 
 As an engineering student, I found this book very theoretical, which makes it more difficult to read than an actual PDE textbook. Also, unlike other Schaum's series, this book does not have many worked-out examples and does not have solutions for all the problems. It is poorly organized 
 Not bad overall, but I mean, C'mon... who couldn't see that ending coming. And who hasn't heard of Jona before, and you think he wouldn't have stolen a story so well known as the Arc 
 my friends and i just chose this for our monthly fashion-oriented book club (we've previously enjoyed easily appropriate selections like "the devil wears prada", etc.) and were unanimously disapointed (they all are about to write their own reviews here, though).  maybe this could be good for someone who isn't already a Kate fan, or has never heard such things about models doing drugs or being too skinny - like people who live in a bio-sphere or something.  i guess i just expected more indepth info - like, how about a FREAKIN' INTERVIEW WITH KATE HERSELF! - from an author who ran "the web's most popular Kate Moss site" for like 5 years.  some "fan" 
 As per usual, any woman who entertains an independent thought---one not handed down to her by the male establishment---is immediately suspect. It's not women who are making the world worse---it's the idiots currently in charge of the government, starting with the president and vice-president and continuing through Rove and DeLay and a herd of congressmen. I'm sorry that the conservatives think women should stay home and raise families and not poke their heads out of the kitchen or nursery. I'm sorry they believe gutsy women are the cause of all the ills in the universe. I feel sorry for them that they'll never experience the satisfaction that comes from being their own person, beholden to no one, because they have a paying job and a degree of independence. When the world comes to value "women's work" and makes raising kids, cleaning house and fixing meals a well-paid endeavor, I might think that women would be better off in the home. Until then, I'm not buying it. Viva to those Women Who Make The World Worse! To those who would turn back the hands of time to the 1800s when women were chattel, Raspberries by the score.   People like Kate O'Beirne scare me no end 
 it's a super idea, but i cannot say it works well. getting a free station is a real challenge, even in the underdeveloped Italy. and if you get one, but you are driving, within 5 minutes (or 5 miles) you lose the signal... however the sound is perfect when you enter into a tunnel. is not good for cars, but works at home, connecting it to the radio. it needs to be improved 
 I like Sarah Vowell. I've enjoyed her pieces on 'This American Life', read her other books, and even saw her at a live reading when she came to town. I didn't like this book though, and here, I guess, is where book ratings can become pretty arbitrary. It wasn't some glaring deficiency of prose style or structure that tipped me over the edge. It's just that, ultimately, she's whiny (her own criticism of Alanis Morissette coming dangerously close to home). This is a book where nothing is safe. And if you're an individual that thinks that you have been deeply wronged by the world, most likely because it doesn't kowtow to your every quirky interest, leading you to cope by saying 'everything sucks' and elevating Nirvana and Hole to demigod status, then this book is for you!    It wasn't long into the book before I realized I'd be enduring it, rather than enjoying it. So why did I continue? Perhaps the same reason that people slow down when passing the scene of an accident: macabre fascination. Anytime something was on the radio that didn't resemble guitars screeching the self-obsessed angst of middle-class white urbanites, she is ready and waiting to attack it. 'Morning Edition' or 'All Things Considered': snooty and self-aware, *boring*. Marian McPartland's 'Piano Jazz': boring, 'plink, plink, chord; plink, plink, chord'. Garrison Keillor of 'A Prarie Home Companion': 'hate every breath he draws'. And those are the relative safe-havens among the liberal, faux-intellectual crowd she inhabits. Imagine her temperate and reasonable reactions to conservative talk radio!    Granted, she was 25 when she wrote this, and probably angry because she had been teased in high school. It's apparent that time (and subsequent wealth, no doubt) have mellowed her. Perhaps she has recognized that Cobain really didn't have any answers, and life is turning out better with some perspective gained, and she's no longer as transfixed or amused by the regular chaos in Courtney Love's mess of a life. Whatever it is, you're much better off reading 'The Partly Cloudy Patriot' than this 
 I am a Patterson fan, and was looking forward to reading this book. However, this was the grossest book I've ever set eyes on. I found myself skipping whole sections because of the revolting battle images described by the author(s). I'm not a wimp, I see a lot of really gross stuff at work (I'm a nurse), but this was just so over the top that I couldn't finish it. Might be a good tool for those on a diet tho.. 
 Do a search on the true story.  Find out what really happened and how her "therapist" actually created and named the personalities.  Also, you will discover that this author KNEW the TRUTH about this case and simply hid it away in an effort to sell more books 
 Once thought of as a women's health magazine, Cosmo has taken a twisted turn into pointless redundancy. At one point, Cosmo seemed to be a must-have, along with water and oxygen.  More and more lately, it seems that the magazine is posing the question "how can we survive on ONLY water and oxygen, and still be sexy while we do?" Ocassionally, a featured article faces the issues of things ranging from eating disorders to politics, but few and far between.  They don't seem to realize that on the other side of the page for the eating disorder article, is a woman who wears a size 0 and is still unsatisfied with herself, thinking that she must conform to some "heroin-chic" fad.  Fun Fearless Female - articles about real women who make a real difference - is great. It shines the spotlight on someone who not only is beautiful and successful, but has enough education and talent to succeed in the world, without needing a man. If the magazine featured more of these things, maybe it would be worth my subscription fee.  But tell me when the last time is that you saw a cover NOT featuring the phrases "mind-blowing sex", "how to satisfy (insert breathing life form here)", or "barely-there", which seems to refer to not just underwear anymore, but EVERYTHING.  This isn't a magazine about women's health anymore. It's all about how to keep your man happy, while still conforming to social standards in fashion, weight, and financial standings. I'm sorry, but the "girl on a budget" can't afford a $430 skirt, or uncomfortable shoes with the uncomfortable price of $300+.  Cater more to the real woman; not the one who only cares about her relationship status, pant size, and bank account 
 I think someone forgot to tell Molotov that Rap-Metal/Rock-Rap was Dead. Had potential, but the simple riffage and annoying rapping killed it for me 
 Starts off with a good murder scene and then drifts off into erudite intellectual fluff and nonsense which causes the murder mystery plot to disappear like dew in Dante's inferno. Very disappointing 
 This watch works fine most of the time but if it gets even slightly moist, despite its label of "WATER RESIST," it stops working.  The screen blanks for up to a week before it begins to work again (and naturally I have to reset the time) 
 There is so much wrong with this movie that I don't know where to begin, so let's start with the obvious; why is Keanu Reeves in this movie? Who thinks this robot can deliver any credibility in any movie? Winona Ryder is equally horrid and her role is that much more vital. Her gasping doe-eyed schtick is woefully inadequate to convey the power and allure of the woman Vlad pledges unending blood lust in search of. Furthermore, were there no Brits that could play these two roles or were British accents really necessary at all? If so, why in the name of Bumblebee Man did they have to use these wankers who can't keep one going consistently? Gary Oldman - an actor whose work I usually enjoy - is sadly over the top in a role that cries out for subtlety, especially when you consider how much of a cliche this character has become. His garbled accent and the hokey theatrics make me want to giggle more than stay engaged. In fact, my sixteen year old daughter and I cracked up so many times throughout this that you'd have thought we were watching a comedy...and that's not a compliment. There is just so much to laugh at and mock... On the plus side, I thought Coppola's back story of the romance and all was interesting, but in the end, who cares? It is nearly impossible to immerse yourself in the story because Reeves, Ryder, Oldham, and Hopkins are so wretched that you end up wishing it was a comedy - it works better on that level. If you want a good untraditional vampire movie, go rent The Hunger instead. 
 The author advances that cities either thrive or die based on three variables: 1) their sacredness; 2) their safety; and 3) commerce.  Sacredness seems like a very questionable driver of a city's success.  Is Jerusalem or Mecca ever likely to be a more successful city than Dallas or Seattle?  Unlikely.  Also, safety does not seem like a differentiating variable but more like a necessity for a city.  It is like saying you need to speak English to be a successful student at Harvard.  You need a lot more than that.  So, does a city need a lot more than to be safe to become a successful city.  Finally, the third variable, commerce, is self-evident and appears the only valid one out of the three mentioned variables.    The present and future of a city most probably depend on a number of variables not well detailed by the author including:   1) Fiscal condition, or does a city has a healthy and growing tax revenue base that can suffice to cover its related cost of delivering public services and running city government?   2) Quality of municipal services including transportation, and most importantly education.  For a city to thrive, it needs to deliver very strong secondary and post secondary educational services.  3) An innovative business and cultural environment.  Is the city a nest of creativity resulting in a high rate of innovation within commerce, but also the arts, and other domain?  Does the city develop other related competitive edges associated with specialized network of professionals?  New York benefits a great deal from the huge human capital concentrated in "Wall Street."  San Francisco and San Jose benefit greatly from being within close reach of both Silicon Valley and venture capitalists  4) A strategic location.  Is the city located at a gateway of domestic or international trading routes?  Is it located near a coast, an airport, and a major harbor so it is quickly accessible from around the World?   5) A strategic virtual location.  How connected is the city?  Does its information infrastructure measure up to other World-class cities?   6) Economic demographics of its residents.  What is the educational level and per capita income of its residents?  What is the level of homeownership? Business ownership?   Obviously, many of these variables are interconnected.  And, many are associated with what the author calls commerce.  However, he did not drill down on many of these related variables.  Even though such variables would allow you to truly differentiate in a statistically meaningful and analytically insightful way between cities.    Meanwhile, the author offers just vague platitude devoid of much insight on the subject.  The model he proposes based on his three variables explains a bit about distant history, but much less about the future.   This book was especially disappointing given that the same author has written one of the most original and insightful books I have read.  Indeed, back in 1994 he wrote an excellent book called "Tribes" that does an excellent job of differentiating the culture and behavior of many of the World's most interesting clans or ethnic groups.  He also maps out what such cultural and behavioral features entail in terms of the present and future success of these different demographic clans (clustered by either religion, race, or nationality).  Thus, the author was able to deliver much insight about the various clans of the human race.  Unfortunately, he delivered nearly none regarding cities.  Thus, I strongly recommend you skip "The City" and read "Tribes" instead.              
 I purchased this booklet, looked at it for about one minute, and I haven't used it since. For what it is, a simple recipe and method for making sourdough starter, it's fine.  But I could have gotten by with free info on the Internet.  Thus, the 1 star reflects my personal feeling for the usefulness of the booklet to me and does not reflect my opinion of the book itself. The booklet is clearly written and does simply tell just how to make sourdough starter. After paying for the book and postage, I expected more.  I should have taken the word "Simplest" in the title literally.   
 I celebrate the fact that a female Korean-American author created a voice for Korean-American women. However, I was dismayed to find that her book's title character reinforced many stereotypes: designer label junkie, superficiality, flighty, and most of all...weak.   It seemed as if the author was more concerned with dropping designer named clothes rather than flushing out her character's motivations, interests, and strengths. I found that the main character was overly superficial and her personality did not lead me to feel compassion for her, so I ended up quickly losing interest in her.   What irritated me the most about the way Caroline Hwang created the story was the way she made the Korean-American woman to be so weak and subservient to EVERYONE: her mother, her coworkers, her friends, her boss...she let everyone take advantage of her while making excuses for this behavior. Why make the main character so passive? How long can you keep reading until you realize that, halfway through the book, this main character has done NOTHING to absolve her weaknesses.  While I understand that the clashing relationship with her mother takes a huge chunk of the storyline, I would have liked to see more interaction with other young Korean-Americans. Must we reinforce the stereotype of the asexual Asian that American movies and television already show?   To sum it all up, I was very excited to see a new Korean-American author attempt to portray the current cultural situation of Korean-Americans. However, I was ultimately disappointed to find that this book chose to highlight the negative stereotypes rather than offering a creative and varying view of Korean-Americans today. While I did not expect Hwang to represent and capture every detail of Korean-American culture, I would have liked to relate to SOMETHING in her characters and book. Maybe her next novel will fare better 
 Gave up after 64 pages, what a sham, the heroic hero calls his SEAL buddy Harry, the man's name is Dan Harris, the President is called Woody for no explained reason as his name is Robert X. Hayes, Ramstein Air Base, Germany is called Ramstein Air Force Base, the White House security people will let just anyone in to see the Pres, you can't be serious, "the hero's lean biceps bulged under the fabric of his black polo shirt he was wearing" did we have to be told that he was wearing the shirt after being told of the bulging business, either consign this joke to the trash can or give it to a person that you really dislike. Minus 3 stars 
 This software might be recommended if better utilities weren't out there. This one gives the user a sense of security, but when my system crashed, Fix-It couldn't. I dutifully put in the Rescue Disk, booted up on it, restored my earlier system, exited and rebooted.  Nothing. Before I'd been able to get into safe mode, but now nothing. So when I manually restored my system, guess which program got yanked? And it freed up a lot of system resources, too. (Had I known how much before, that alone would have soured me.) My system now runs faster and doesn't lag while typing.  Another small criticism: Even though Fix-It has automatic update for virus scans, I found more often than not I had to go to the VCom site and manually download the anti-virus files. No reason was ever given; I'd just get a message telling me to do it. Very inconvenient.  Also WARNING*WARNING: This program has strict activation. You can only have it on one computer, so forget putting it on your notebook computer.   Finally, be careful when cleaning your registry. Look at every entry this suite wants to delete. If you run it on default, it may remove critical registry keys and settings. In fact, I'd use a different registry cleaner or some of the free ones.   Fix-It has some great features, but not enough to make it worth the system resources and a system sluggish system. (Not to mention the anti-virus problem). Try System Mechanic instead.   
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 As a white man, this book offended me several times during the first five minutes of reading it.  If an author wrote in the same way about black people the book would not even be published! I am tired of the double standard! Thank god I didn't pay for this book and only checked it out at the library 
 I had bought a copy of Harold Evans "The American Century" which I enjoyed mainly for its excellent collection of photographs. After reading reviews complaining that it was too liberal, I decided to have a look at Johnson's book for a different perspective. I have been surprised and saddened by Johnson's tone. Unfortunately his book is not written from a scholarly perspective of investigating the complexity of American history with the purpose of illuminating the truth. All history is biased to some extent, but the language used by Johnson is beyond persuasive- its arrogant. I was hoping to find a reasonable presentation of a conservative perspective of historical events, but this book is written with such narrow mindedness  that it reads more like an extended diatribe.  I find it sad that talented historians sabotage their works with such strongly divisive motives. 
 Though the gospel call of salvation through Jesus Christ needs to be made at all times to all people Dr. MacArtur's attempt at confronting the postmodern situation is unfortunate. It is obvious that he is completely out of his field of expertise. The most telling sign of this is Dr. MacArthur's stance against Rationalism. He distances himself from rationalism because he allows for supernatural revelation in the knowledge situation. He is not epistemologically self-conscious enough, nor understanding of rationalism enough, to see that his own understanding of the knowing subject, the character of truth, and science (hermeneutics in his case) are squarely rationalist. Allowing for supernatural revelation doesn't change the basic structure of his thought. I believe his essay is pastoral in nature and thus can side step some of the traditional scholarly apparatus. But, his own debunking of pseudoscholarship in this and other books does make him liable to his own criterion. And according to that, I do think this essay is lacking in good scholarship. He cites very few sources for statements clearly outside his field of expertise. I think Dr. MacArthur could learn from reading "Fit Bodies, Fat Minds" by Os Guiness and "Uncommon Decency" by Richard Mouw. I think he is an old-school anti-intellectual who could learn some about civility in scholarship 
 I bought this book hoping that I could learn how to bead. But what I found is that book is far from complete and confusing in its instructions. A  major disappointment 
 I've long meant to give Calvino a try as his name is always mentioned in the company of other magic realists and fabulists that I like. I decided on this one simply because I found a nice copy used. Unfortunately, I didn't like it very much and I wonder if I just got the wrong book to give Calvino a fair try.  This is two novellas that showcase why he's considered a magic realist, and they do meet at least my definition of that term. In "The Nonexistent Knight," the titular character Agilulf is indeed an empty suit of armor which even Charlemagne finds off-putting rather than unusual. After setting up that the Knight is about the most perfect of the paladins (so much so that his fellow paladins dread him), a meal discussion reveals that the incident on which his knighthood is based might be false, thus leading him on a quest to discover the virgin whom he rescued many years ago. A couple of other characters--including a Red Sonja-type maid who yearns for the knight because he is perfect in every respect but physicality--and a strange nun narrator who keeps inserting her voice add some side-trips to this search, but it's a strange fairy-tale that wraps up in the end but still leaves you wondering what it was all about.  "The Cloven Viscount" is even stranger, about a lord who was severed in half (down the middle) and in which each half survives, yet one side is all bad and the other is all good. The fact that I can't keep a bad Star Trek episode out of my mind the entire time I'm reading this is not a recommendation. More so than the first novella, I couldn't see what the point was. With both of these, it could be that it was simply lost in translation, or that I just wasn't open to the wonders of the stories.  I'd be willing to give Calvino another try, although I think I may ask around for recommendations before picking up the next book 
 I was hoping that this book would give me a solid introduction to home improvement but it really didn't deliver.  The information presented tended to be either too brief or assumed a lot of proir knowledge, which is inappropriate in a book with "for Dummies!" in the title.  There were some good tips but I never had enough info to embark on a project with only this book as a reference.  One exception was the info on painting, which was helpful and detailed. Also, a lot of the material seemed a little dated - there was tons of info about wallpapering and installing laminate countertops (I think these options are not as popular as they once were) but not much on installing granite counters or laminate flooring.  So, in short, having this book is better than nothing but if you really want to be well versed in home improvement, look elsewhere.   
 Mr. Dietrich, whatever his academic credentials, joins the ranks of many a China scholar that so romantasizes China that careful research and balance are rejected.  This book is so hopelessly simplistic and over-generalized  that its almost useless; documentation is almost non-existent, and his  analysis of the events of modern China are reduced to a 6th grade level  with scant detail and almost no evidence.  The "achievements" of  the communists in China are very romanticized and if one wishes to really  understand the last 50 years of China's history, this book is not the way.   Save your money 
 I agree with all the negative reviews on this list about this disc and Lang Lang in general.  I was deeply disappointed with his performances of the Tchaikovsky/Mendelssohn and Rachmaninov concertos.  Then, my friend asked me to listen to his Islamey, exclaiming that it was one of the most remarkable performances he'd ever heard.  I remember clearly thinking how boring it was and had to have my friend listen to the incredible performance by Ogdon and, even more brazen account (remember this piece ismeant to be a showpiece, and not the pseudo-intellectual piece Lang Lang thinks it is) by Barere.  Although I'm no fan of Islamey, I find it very easy to discern the difference between mediocrity (Lang Lang) and brilliance.  I got a chance to listen to some of this disc couple of months ago, and boy, he continues to disappoint.  Regarding all those who say he's the next Horowitz or Richter blah blah, I suspect that these people don't know history.  Another fundamental mistake they make is that they form conclusions without comparing to other performances.  Just compare his interpretations of the abegg variations and the Wanderer fantasy to those by Kissin or Richter.  You'll quickly notice how pedantic and uninspiring Lang Lang's accounts are.  Boring as I don't know what!  Likewise, try comparing his Tchaikovsky's 1st or Rach 2nd to those by Horowitz, Argerich, and Freire, and Richter, Kissin, Cliburn, Ashkenazy, Jando and countless others.  Lang Lang sounds absolutely amateurish in comparison.  Memory can be very fleeting and the only reliable thing is to compare side by side.  His mediocrity just jumps out and grabs you.  I'm willing to admit that my main objections to Lang Lang's musicality is subjective in nature.  Afterall, taste is taste.  While I find Lang Lang's tone terribly uneven and dull, with his interpretations without life, with his general stance of "let's not mess things up here" attitude, others may indeed find him exciting.  However, I will not concede that his technique is somehow "one of the greatest."  To this day, I cannot figure out how one can consider his technique to be great.  Just sit in a dark room, close your eyes and dissect his articulation, finger work, phrasing, octaves, and you'll notice that no way in hell does his technique measure up to those by Michelangeli, Hamelin, Barere, Berman, and Horowitz, or even to those by Leslie Howard, Kissin, Zayas, Argerich, Gould, Gavrilov, Cziffra, Kocsis, and Pollini.  To me Lang Lang's technique is dead average, nothing special, and for those who think his technique is one of the greatest in history or at least one of the greatest around, perhaps more listening and studying is required.  Sure, Clint Eastwood is a solid film maker, but to say to me that he is in the league with Orson Welles, Jean Renoir, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, Alfred Hitchcock would lead me believe that more film study of the classics is in order.  In conclusion, Lang Lang (and this disc set) is a joke.  People tend to think that because an artist is heavily promoted by a large record company like DG, then he must be good.  This effect can be very powerful and, now in this era, often very wrong.  If classical music continues down this path of promoting dead average pianists, then we are all going to suffer 
 Im not really writing this review to sway anyone's opinion of it.  Tastes are different from person to person.  Some may love this book, others may hate it, and a few will think its okay, that is just the way things are.  I only wanted to share my opinion about it, because oddly enough it stirs up strong emotions within me whenever I think about it. The first time i read this book I hated it.  I have read it again since then and upon finshing it twice I still don't like this book at all.  Yet, during both times that I read it I could not put the book down.  This is the bizarre duplicitous nature of The Relic.  I do not like the story or the characters, but still I have been drawn in.  As much as I hate to admit it I consider this book to be a real page-turner.    I don't think i need to go into the plot so I will list the offenses this book commits (once again this is just my opinion).  Predictability - I dont think I was surprised even once while reading this book.  It gives you the kind of cut and pasted characters that are far to overused these days.  From the first time a character is introduced you can pretty much tell whether they are in it for the long haul, or merely here to serve as entree's for the monster.  The outcome of most of the situations presented are easily deciphered if given any thought at all.  Not to spoil any surprises but I'll give you one guess what happens when we are informed that the museum the beast haunts has a security system with solid metal doors that fall into place to cut off a supposed thief's escape route.  Throw in the fact that we are informed of this right before a gala premier of the museums' new attraction in which hundreds of guests will be attending and...well I think you allready know where this is going.  Poor Characters -  All your cliche's are here.  From the overworked, underappreciated heroine, who puts all the pieces together, to the museums management staff who refuse to shut down the museums' premier even after numerous, grisly murders.  Why? do you ask.  Because of revenues of course. I wonder if the museums' head director wears the same suits as the mayor from the movie Jaws.  If the characters arent fulfilling the role as a needed cliche' then they are doing the exact opposite that any sane person would do.  If I heard strange noises in a closed section of the museum I was gaurding, especially after the fact that at least two horrific murders were commited in the vicinity, I would call for backup before I investigated.  Of course I am sane, so reverse what I would have done and you get the basic course of action most of the people in this book take.  UNBELIEVABILITY -  There were many times while reading this book when I had to stop and say, "Give me a break."  I also used the expressions, "Oh, please", and "That is so STUPID!".  Many times we are expected to deny common sense, and reason so that the story can progress.  Of course if you had a monster that could be killed like any other animal on this planet, then this book would probably only be 100 pages long.  So in an effort to stretch it out to 400 or so pages you need a creature that can be described as nothing short of the animal equivalent of a sherman tank.  Im not kidding, this monkey-lizard is shot no less than 5 times and probably a great deal more with no ill effects.  I don't want to give anything more away, but there will be many times when you will find something hard to believe in this book.  Many "What a rip-off" moments - To often while reading this book I found myself comparing it to some other book or movie that had come before it.  There is a reason so many people compare this book to Jurrasic Park, many plot points and supposed surprises seem to be taken right out of Chricton's book.  So instead of putting the quote "Far above Chricton's Jurassic Park" on the cover of The Relic, I would have put "Not above taking ideas from better books".  Put Jurrasic Park, Congo, and Jaws in a blender and you have The Relic. This "borrowing" of ideas seems so bad at times that I wouldnt be surprised if for every copy of The Relic sold Micheal Chricton received royalties.  Once again I feel compelled to mention that for all its stupidity, and predictability, I could not put this book down.  For that reason alone this book is probably worth reading, and sharing with your friends.  Then you can all sit down and compare notes on how many times you each found an instance where you found yourself thinking of another, probably better, book 
 Is this book scientific or dogma? Science employs unambiguous concepts, does not ignore data that contradicts; and revises in the light of valid critique. This book fails all these tests. For a comprehensive critique of its many flaws see Professor Brendan. McSweeney's widely cited paper in Human Relations  (2002) 55.1. To take an example from the Hofstede's book: they state that "the masculinity-femininity dimension affects ways of handling industrial conflicts. In the United States as well as in other masculine cultures such as Britain and Ireland) there is a feeling that conflicts should be resolved by a good fight ... the industrial relations scenes in these countries is marked by such fights. If possible management tries to avoid having to deal with labor unions at all." (p.143). This claim first appeared in Hofstede (1991) and later in Hofstede (2001). Test 1: a national culture does not affect national managers but only national labor. Inconsistent. Test 2: according to the Hofstede's own ranking (p. 121) Japan is the second most masculine country and Germany is more masculine than either the US or Britain. And yet for over fifty years the industrial relations in Japan and Germany have been the least conflictful. The Hofstede's claim is contradicted even by their own data. Test 3: In 2002 McSweeney published a second paper in which he showed that mascluninity-femininity has no predictive or explanatory power in relation to industrial relations. His data showed that sometimes such relations in feminine countries are more aggressive than in masculine countries, sometimes they are less. Despite this data the Hofstede's repeat a claim that is clearly contradicted by the data (others and even their own). A company which believed the Hofstede's claim would be discouraged from considering investing in Britain, Ireland, or the US and would be encouraged to invest in feminine countries such as the Hofstede's Netherlands which they claim is the third most feminine country in the world. Hopefully, not too many are misled by the dogma in this book which bears no relation to reality 
 Wesley Snipes plays an undercover CIA agent in Romania. Pitted against this perpetually angry hero (whose emotions are delivered with bland voice-over) is a sexy and strong-willed Russian beauty played by Silvia Colloca. Snipes must protect Colloca going back to USA from the attacks of the villains of this country, whose motives I'm still trying to figure out.  There is no denying that this is a low-budget action film made in Romania, kind of film you watch for shoot-outs and explosions. To their credits, the stunt persons of the film did a decent job and in one memorable scene a baddie falls out of the window (of the second floor of a house) and falls onto the roof of a van below, hitting his head against it really hard and bouncing like a rubber ball. That is amazing. And don't forget the cat-and-mouse chase scene in the subway where a bald-headed baddie shows one surprising stunt.  But the rest of the film is very dull. "The Detonator" uses every clichéd element of action genre taken directly from other better films, and throws them into the convoluted narrative in the wrong way. The film attempts to be different with a portrait of a gangster who owns a soccer team and several scenes about soccer games. However, it just doesn't work because of the tepid descriptions of games and banal action sequences mixed with them.   It was in 2004 when we saw the third entry of `The Blade' which was not bad. But now Wesley Snipes seems to have officially joined in the direct-to-video land where Steven Seagal is the king or the Great One. (In fact `The Detonator' is co-produced by Andrew Stevens who is also responsible for such films as "Half Past Dead" "The Foreigner" and "Out of Reach.") I'm not saying that all straight-to-video actions are bad - remember Dolph Lundgren who is doing a very good job as star and director. - but as to `The Detonator" the result is simply disappointing. 
 If you're looking for an intense work-out, this will give it to you. On the other hand if you're looking for fun with your work-out, I don't think you'll find it here. I did not like her cuing and in particular did not enjoy her constant "grunting". Some may find that motivating, I find it annoying. I have several Leslie Sansone DVD's and I love her workouts. Some complain about her chatter, I find it motivating. Leslie makes you feel like you can do it and she's right there with you. Her walk kick is a great, just as intense as this DVD but a lot more fun. 
 Im a big fan of Van Damne,but when i saw this movie i was really disapointed,the setting is dull,the story is dull and the guy he fights dull.I love Van Damnes other movie,but this is the only one that sux 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 It would be nice, as a couple of other reviewers stated, to have included some of the "score" as well as the songs and arrangements already present.  I was hoping their would be a bit of that when I ordered it.  The songs are good but didn't warrant listening to the CD more than a couple of times 
 There's an old adage amongst some of us online reviewers that kinda/sorta goes like this: if you have to resort to frequently using words like "perfect," "riveting," "startling," and "stunning," you're more than likely describing what the story isn't for the average person because the average person -- the casual reader, Joe Six Pack with a good in his hands -- tends to find these adjectives descriptive of very specific events in his life ... events like falling in love, throwing the game-winning touchdown pass, and having a child.  As a consequence of such overblown rhetoric, James Sallis' DRIVE ends up being memorable only on the grounds that one was duped into believing such a middleground neo-noir tale is destined to be literature's next classic when it'll probably be nothing in the next ten years.  Yes, it's "lean," and it could quite probably be read in a single sitting if not in a handful of hours, and, yes, it's full of the pretty-sounding, poetic prose any reader of Sallis has come to expect, but there's little meat on these bloodied bones: Driver sticks to what he does well -- he drives, be it for movie studios or as the getaway driver for a handful of hardened criminals -- but, once he's double-crossed, you find out he's a wealth of other talents in extracting revenge on those who set him up.  The grim reality here is that no one REALLY sets Driver up; he simply takes the wrong job at the wrong time, and, as generally happens in noir tales, there's a price to be paid.  Driver isn't fond of paying such a price, so he hits back at those he try to take him for a ... well ... er ... for a ride.  Unfortunately, unlike some of the other reviewers, I found the narrative extremely difficult to follow, as Sallis attempts to successfully unfold this yarn out of chronology -- think of it as sort of an even hipper, jet set, PULP FICTION type narrative where some events are even told twice ... with the same exact words and from the same point of view.  It's a gamble -- a highly calculated gamble -- and I didn't feel it came off very well here.  As a matter of fact, it forced me to flip back to the earlier section in the book to make certain I wasn't somehow lost in this 160-page novel.  Yes, DRIVE is certainly a noir tale, but it's hardly 'hard-boiled,' as Ohio's ThisWeek tries to make its readers believe.  It's been my experience that critics who don't dabble in 'hard-boiled' literature usually do this -- attach the adjective to what they believe is 'hard-boiled' in order to sound relevant -- and this tends to produce a flattening effect: less people question the validity of the description and, instead, pick up the book and read.  I give credit to Sallis to creating a inventive modern day noir, but, at this cynical, I give his salivating critics credit for selling more copies than was humanly necessary 
 What ever happened to common sense? In this book the average American doesn't exist. I am not denying the problems that exist in the inner cities. I am denying that this is life for the average American or even the average non-white American. Comparing two extremes - best case vs. worst case is always going to give you an unrealistic picture. We live in a capitalist economy, there will always be haves and have-nots. What he is pushing for is a socialist or communist system where everyone is equally miserable and those that manage to get ahead are then forced to pay the way for those who can't or won't. Hey Mr. Kozol - last time I checked there was no army on the borders of Camden or East St. Louis keeping people from moving out, and there is noone forcing anyone to accept the lifestyle they were born into. He offers a view of the problems with no real solution except maybe to hate the rich - Mr. Kozol, how much money did you get paid to write this book?? Utter liberal garbage. Conveniently leaves most of American schools totally out of the equation, only focusing on the worst cases and then comparing them to the top schools in the nation. 
 I was looking for good links for online activities, tutorials, and classes but found way too many dead links, pseudo 5 star sites that were sales sites, and too many Bible links. I compared a Google search for the topic headings and did much better than scouring the book for viable links. Don't waste your money or time 
 This is not the best version available of this fairytale...Stephen Carpenter's is much better.  In this version, the illustration and text don't even match.  The troll is described as having a nose as long as a poker and eyes as big as saucers...but the troll in the pictures has a bulbous nose and unremarkable eyes.  I don't know if it's an exact translation from Norwegian, but the grammar is occasionally ackward.  The metaphors in the speech given by the biggest Billy Goat to the troll have to be explained to a younger audience...which isn't bad in itself but contributes to the uneven flow in the text.  The pictures are good, too bad the writing isn't 
 We have had this weather station for a year now an more times then not there are absolutely no readings!  I only get an indoor reading, which I could get from my thermostat!  We have reset it, messed with the sensors, moved it around the house in many locations with a direct site on the outdoor sensors and still no readings.  Its very frusterating when its a hurricane outside and you can't get any wind readings.  This junk cost me a couple of hundred dollars and was a very dissapointing birthday present for my husband!  Also I called customer service and was on hold for over a hour and still never got a human to talk to for help!  Don't buy this product!! 
 This game adapter does not work with the DI624. But works perfectly with a ***BELKIN*** ROUTER. How strange is that 
 I had to read this in high school and when i read the first few pages i couldn't go on.  It was incredibly boring how it started off talking about the stone angel in the graveyard and i honestly couldn't care less but i had to read it for the term paper. other than hagar's occasionally amusing use of sarcasm and her bitterness towards the world, it was one of the hardest books i've had to read. her sometimes funny sarcasm, bitterness and negativity towards the people around her still cannot make up for the rest of the incredibly boring novel 
 Egan is a good writer, but in this book she does not transport us.  It feels as though she is distracted.  The research leaves a little something to be desired.  Lastly, the book seems to have a need for a brand of drama that fuels the imaginations of 18 year olds. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 
 The first book, "Starfish" was amazing, just a great read. This last book is horrible! Confusing, pointless, and extremely degrading, I wish I had never read it. I agree whole heartedly with "aisian film c" above! The rape and torture of one of the more sympathetic characters is what really pushed this book into the crapper for me 
 I found Robert Crayhon's Nutrition Made Simple to be very useful and informative.  However, I was greatly disappointed with this one.  I wish I had saved my money.  I suggest you research this one closely before  spending yours 
 A very detailed lesson on how not to undertake a sea crossing. Peter describes in great detail his lack of preparedness and his lessons wasted. The truly amazing thing in this story is that he survived and then is  foolish enough to tell the tale. A great read for anyone contemplating  voyaging and most instructive in lessons not learned 
 One needs only two Sex Pistols' albums: "Never Mind the Bollocks" and "Rock n Roll Swindle." There's just nothing out there that even remotely resembles the Pistols' version of 'Roadrunner' ("Steve, wait...wait....I don't know the f'n words!") and the pieces by Jones and Cook are excellent, and a great preview of their work together in The Professionals. For those who wish to go deeper, in addition to "Swindle" and "Bollocks," I'd recommend John Lydon's first album with PIL featuring "Religion I & II," ("Fat pig priest, sanctimonious smile...") along with PIL's greatest hits or Metal Box, also any work Lydon did with Leftfield, e.g. "Open Up"; anything by The Professionals is great ("I Didn't See It Coming"), and the soundtrack to 'Sid & Nancy' if only for the atmosphere provided by Pray for Rain and The Pogues. (By the way, if interested, you can probably find a few clips of Steve Jones and The Professionals in action on YouTube. Highly entertaining. 
 This futon is nothing more than cheaply welded garbage. The welds holding the metal mesh together on the bottom of the frame have begun to break after little more than two months of use. The matress is also very thin and after two months of use has become very uncomfortable as the frame can easily be felt through it.  I wouldn't take another if it was given free to me, so don't blow any money on this garbage 
 Because there were so many great reviews for this movie, I decided to go out and rent this film and watch it.  I was bored to death watching this film, and whats with the words "what's wrong" kept being said over and over again every time someone opened the medicine cabinet in a computer generated voice?  Those words and that voice really annoyed me!  Why does this place have not one person with hair?  Now, I'm not trying to be raciest here, but what's with a black girl and guy dancing totally nude on t.v., well  I can only say that the girl was totally nude since they only showed the guys chest and up.  What's with that guy who kept stalking one guy by saying that he wanted to be his new roomate?  Was he supposed to be gay?  I guess this film is way to so called "artsy" for me.  What I know is that this film is boring, and when it comes to ending, you don't know what happends to the guy at the end.  The film just kind of fades out after he stands on top of that cone stairway.  This film makes the movie The Village exciting to watch.  I wish that I could give my money back 
 It's too bad that Clive Cussler changed collaborators on his "Oregon Files" series.  This was terrible!  I couldn't even finish it.  I read a lot in all different genres so I feel that I'm a little qualified to comment on a book I have read.  It dragged, some of the characters were changed and even though I know you have suspend disbelief, I couldn't keep my eyes open.  Golden Buddha and Sacred Stone were much better 
 This Cd is not nearly as good as the band's pre-signed stuff. I know that it's been getting pretty good reviews but you may want to give this one a listen before adding it to your library of music 
 Narcissistic hypocrytical douche bag. Comments on Bill Clinton's sexual escapades, but settles a sexual harassment suit out of court for 2 million dollars. Douche Bag 
 i can't figure out why this album was even released. i know fans have waited about 7 years for a new album from johnny since the 1997 live in new york. in that album johnny was already showing signs of serious health problems that have affected both his singing and his once powerful guitar playing, the span of the last 8 years have seen johnny in such a state that his voice is but a whisper and his guitar playing is very labored. the only reason for 2 stars is a good backup band and a solid choice of material.this album will be a painful downer for any fans of johnnys music and playin 
 It's amazing how few people are disturbed by this wheezemeister's meaningless, annoying noise that distracts the listener from the music. What a frustrating experience it is for me - just as you are starting to enjoy a great solo, as you watch its progression, that dreadful wheezing starts and knocks the bottom out of it! Why settle for this sort of thing when you have pianists like Corea, Evans, Desmarais or Hancock 
 Are you a man who is attracted to women?  Did you know why?  It's because when you were an infant, you wanted to have sex with other men but your parents told you not to.  Then you wanted to have sex with your own mother, but your parents forbid you to do that as well.  So, unable to HAVE your objects of desire, you have to BECOME your father (the first one you were forbidden to have) so that one day you will get to HAVE your mother.  Or...a suitable stand in for her.  Yes, this is psychoanalysis at its best, which is about as good as doing a few Tarot card readings as a means of gaining greater insight into human development.  Butler seems stuck on the theories of Freud which have long ago been disproven by scientists around the world.  In her world, there are no people, only objects of sexual desire.  There is no human connection, no love and no common sense.  It is ashame that this is required reading in some humanities departments these days.  If you can get through this without falling over laughing then you either have no sense of humor or are afraid to upset the academic powers that be who have dubbed Butler worth reading.  I choose to keep on laughing 
 Great looking keyboard. Unfortunately all it takes is one minor spill and the keyboard is destroyed. That includes cleaning. And don't think you are ever going to take it apart and dry it. The keyboard self destructs after you have the, count them, 10s and 10s of screws.  I called their customer support. They weren't like DELL, nobody is that bad, but their resolution was to buy a new one from them for 50% off their retail price. shipping was extra. So you save maybe $10 off street prices.  All-in-all they are no longer the good company they were in the past. They need competition. So I'm pulling out my old logitech from retirement. Too bad they don't make those old keyboards anylonger 
 These work great initially...I bought six of them. Of the six, four broke. One stopped altogether, one stopped oscillating, and the other 2 would only work on 1 speed. I bought them in May and they broke after 2, 3, and 4 months, respectively. They are expensive fans, and I was extremely disappointed in their lack of durability. They were used at night by adults and were not moved around at all.  I have had a floor fan for 15 years and it still works without a hitch. These are cheaply put together and your money would be better spent on a fan with a better warranty (this is 1 year)and higher quality components. 
 Most of the information is very "theoritical" and "limited" -- author focus mainly on her own analysis of her mother and her relationship with her.  ...  In a nutshell, the message is that a dysfunctional mother'll pass her emotioanal issues to her daughter(s), and in turn, the daughter(s) may pass that onto her offspring(s).  ...   
 The Pick-up Artist is a dangerously bad film. There is absolutely no chemistry between Robert Downey and Molly Ringwald. Molly Ringwald may have been of the most iconic 1980's female actresses, and she certainly proves her worth here. Ringwald looks too much of a virgin to me when her character wasn't supposed to be. That marks the moment when the film had lost its believably element. The real joke in this film has to be Robert Downey. His acting is insanely moronic. I often have to wonder if he wears a lipstick. I am pretty sure Robert Downey can make a great drag queen if he chose to. From the start to the end, I was annoyed. I couldn't see how Dennis Hopper and Danny Aiello got interested in this film and lend their hands in it. Harvey Keitel gives a fair performance, but I believe he is much tougher than that. Comparing Harvey Keitel's performance in Bad Lieutenant, Reservoir Dogs, and Mean Streets to The Pick-up Artist, it is enough to make an apparent observation that Harvey Keitel should have applied his talents to a more different film than this. A smaller film that he did rightfully apply his talent was Rising Sun, and he pulled that one off better than he did in this film. Why did they have to call it The Pick-up Artist? Could they give the movie a better title such as The Player 
 ok great songs but this albums very uneven first off whys there live tracks good tracks but why put them there instead of actual song missing hits include  cabo wabo mean streets little guitars human beings summer nights  ice cream man  so this is love  abnd many more some songs that were in the billboard top 100 or 40 didnt even make the list or fn faves all in all weak compilation the new songs are pretty good but not6 classi 
 I was looking for a step by step process, but this book isn't written that way. If you're looking for a step by step process..this isn't it. One thing I don't like about this book is that it's more like stories of the authors patients and also the author keep saying I will talk about something in chapter so and so, I talked about it in chapter so and so....sign of a bad self help book 
 Let me see if I have got this right? The only way to organize the economy is the capitalist way? That way we all gain? OK the bosses of Nike, McDonalds, and Wal-Mart will gain a bit more than us ordinary folk, but our little boats will rise with the flowing tide?  Sounds good: who would want to be the party pooper?!  Well someone's got to be, and for the simple reason that we don't live on a planet the size of Jupiter.   The oil's finite: we know that but can't be bothered to act on it. Even the supply of water is turning out to be finite: the south east of England is on a collision course between an expanding population and a diminishing supply of water. OK, they could ship it in from the rest of the UK where there's no problem, but for reasons that don't quite add up that's not possible. It's not the corporate solution, if you will forgive the pun.  Has it occurred to anyone, I wonder, if it's capitalist-driven growth which is at the heart of the upcoming problems? Yes, I know Marx and Stalin don't offer any fixes, but at some point along the way the problem is going to have to be faced: growth is going to wind-down whether we like it or not.  
 This book achieved instant fame when it was published in 1919, not only for its scathing criticism of the Versailles Treaty but also for its personal attacks against leading signatories (especially Clemenceau and Wilson).  For a book focused primarily on economic concerns, the text is surprisingly easy to read.  However, the book's poor organization vitally detracts from its effectiveness.  The principle reason the book is still famous today lies in the fact that it was written by none other than John Maynard Keynes, the founder of 20th century style, gov't & debt driven economics.  The book is organized into chapters on pre-war Europe, Allied statesmen, summary of key treaty points, reparations, post-war Europe predictions, and Keynes' suggestion of remedies to provide a practical treaty settlement.  Unfortunately, within each chapter things are jumbled together without clear rhyme or reason.  (Is this indicative of Keynes' own personal organization and logical thinking?)    Within the book, he makes a very practical (but politically infeasible) argument for a non-vindictive treaty.  He basically suggests that the Allies should forget both about reparations and repayment of wartime debts from the other Allies, and instead they should settle (though not ideally) for frontier adjustments and confiscation of only German gov't property.  (Did the German gov't sponsor Keynes' work in writing this book?)  Keynes argues that a crushing reparations burden on the German people would disincent them to produce anything beyond a mere subsistence minimum and discourage entrepreneurial enterprise.  There is some logic in this point; however, later on he goes on to state that the US should forgive its $10 billion debt to its wartime allies ($5 billion of which was owed by the UK).  Forgive me if I'm wrong, but doesn't such a move disincent American entreprises from entrepreneurship as well.  It's extremely hypocritical that the Allied gov'ts desperately sought loans from the US during the war and then once it was over to claim that they couldn't pay them.  If they didn't want to repay, then they shouldn't have borrowed the money - period.  (If I borrow money to buy a home, the bank won't ever agree to forgive my debt - regardless of whether I'm out of work, injured, or the house burns down.  I don't see why gov'ts should get any exceptional treatment.)  Notwithstanding his problems with disorganization and inconsistent logic, Keynes does produce a reasonable, brief list of treaty rememdies, especially in his efforts to restore economic life throughout Central and Eastern Europe.  Not until the advent of the Cold War and the interests of extending American political influence would Keynes' policies largely succeed (albeit yet again to the detriment of American taxpayers).  Overall, I felt the book was ok.  I would only recommend it if you have an interest in reading all of Keynes' work.  Don't expect to find any theoretical economic insights in the book, though.  Based on the high ratings on this page, I think the other reviewers here might have some pro-Keynesian bias 
 I don't think this book gives an accurate veiw of what kindergarten is like. I teach pre-school and have been to kindergarten classes with the children. This book gives an idea of what pre-school is like 
 What a wonderful book ODD THOMAS was!  What a total disappointment FOREVER ODD is.  What happened Dean?  Did you have to meet a quick deadline or something and just couldn't come up with an idea?    If you really liked ODD THOMAS don't destroy your respect for it by reading FOREVER ODD.  It is really just a junked up piece up literature to keep the ODD thing going on.    I love so many of Dean's books, but you can always tell when he is just trying to throw a piece of trash out there to meet a deadline.  This is one of them. Save your money.  Don'y buy it.  Go get your original ODD THOMAS book and read it again for free.  Sheesh Dean .... help us fans out a little here buddy !!  Densel Myers Yukon, Oklahom 
 This book has the basic knowlegde tha every CM must know, its easy to read, and it give you a better and required professional overview of construccion projects 
 Clarity of CD and DVD not good compared to "Caught In The Act 
 Tyson is funnier in person than on paper, and this book was a reflection of this fact.  Ultimately it panders to narcissistic fantasies, e.g., "All the ways the cosmos want to kill us."  (Actually, the cosmos are indifferent.)  The "Death by black hole" chapter occupies 7 pages.  Also, the book rambles all over the history and theory of science, the meaning of life, nature's place, and so forth.  Finally, the jokes were not particularly funny.  Too bad!  Tyson is genuinely funny in person.  Here is an alternative book:  Simon Singh, Big bang: The origin of the universe.  It was/is a NY Times bestseller and can be understood by a layperson easily 
 I like John Grisham, but THE KING OF TORTS was a slow-moving disappointment.  Grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel, which is fine, but he ends up putting the message above the story.     Grisham devotes much of this novel to a young plaintiffs' lawyer and his new law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits.  This provides Grisham with an excuse to explain, in agonizing detail, how tort lawyers sue big companies and collect huge fees.  Grisham also produces scene after scene describing the enormous wealth of class action lawyers, and how they put their own greed above the interests of their clients.     In the end, none of this adds up to an engaging storyline.  It doesn't help that the young lawyer in this novel is a rather unlikable person that Grisham is obviously setting up for a fall.  Since I didn't care for this character, I found the storyline of THE KING OF TORTS to be largely uninvolving.  This novel is also rather preachy and heavy-handed in tone.   I personally dislike class action lawsuits, but I read novels for entertainment, not to validate my own political beliefs.   Although this book was decently written, I just didn't find the story interesting enough to recommend.  For a better version of this story, I would suggest A CIVIL ACTION by Jonathan Harr. 
 This is one of the worst books I've read. What a waste of money... The basic syntax issues are glossed over. Type polymorphism example is introduced with an error. I can go on and on -with statement, type statement etc .  Author does nothing to guide the reader through a maze of jumbled syntax. Terrible waste of a really good idea. 
 I had to purchase this book for an economics course. It does have some good examples and applications, but other times the book just bogs down and is impossible to read. Lastly, the price tag is ridiculious... Teachers, don't make your students waste their money on this 
 The recipes in this book are simply not healthy for you. There is no nutritional breakdown as to fat content and calories at the bottom of every recipe. I agree with the others who have left reviews in saying to check online for healthy recipes using the Superfoods, the cookbook is a huge disappointment. 
 Amazon is selling a copy protected CD that cannot be transferred to an iPod for personal use. Don't be bullied and do not buy this CD 
 I have no complaints about the material on these discs. They're all among the best of the old-time radio mystery genre. But Nostalgia Ventures, the company that put out this excuse for a "restoration" should be ashamed of itself.  The short-cut version of restoration that these fly-by-nights practice is the usual sort of thing: chop off as much of the high frequency sound as possible and hope that the listener doesn't hear any leftover disc noise (these were all copied from 16" transcription discs, most likely). The problem is that they cut off so much of the high frequency sound that even with headphones one has trouble making out the words. The consonants have been almost completely eliminated. Apparantly, the fact that you could barely, and sometimes not at all, undersatnd what the actors were saying did not strike the folks at Nostalgia Ventures as a problem.  I'm an semi-amateur at restoring old-records. Given a single day, I could have done all four hours of this series with ten times better sound. That's not to brag; there are thousands of people who can do that. But the weasels at Nostalgia Ventures decided that they couldn't afford even one day's work. Save your money and look for these great old radio shows elsewhere 
 My husband and I tried using this book and it's methods for almost a year with not even a hint at conception. The author's "frank" opinion about trying to conceive after 35 is negative and discouraging. I refused to believe that I was infertile but because I am over 35, it was very difficult to determine my fertile window using these methods. It caused undo stress and anxiety and my husband and I finally broke down and spent the money to purchase an OVwatch. We conceived the first time using the watch. I am not trying to plug them for any reason other than it works. We conceived twice using the watch after a year of frustration and depression. They are the most decent, supportive, positive customer service oriented company I have ever encountered. I found Terri Weshcler to be incredibly negative and judgemental of women trying to conceive at a later age-and the last thing you need is another seed of negativity when you're trying to conceive 
 One of the most fascinating aspects of salt is that it is hygroscopic.  That is due to its chemical nature, it is slightly cooler than "room temperature".  Consequently, water will form on the surface of salt from the atmosphere if it is even moderately humid (hence the reason why most of us put rice in our salt shakers - to absorb the water salt collects).  You do not have to be a brain surgeon to understand the process.  Imagine my surprise when I found in the very first chapter, Kurlansky waxing on whimsically about how he tried to "cook" all of the water out of his pet salt crystal so that water would not come out of it and dissolve the surface.  I figure that he knows that salt is made up of NaCl (although I now have my doubts) and there is not much room for water in its crystal structure (almost zero water in it).  Here is a guy that has written an entire book on the subject salt.  I presumed when I purchased the book that he would be somewhat of an authority on the subject.  To say the least, I have to question his abilities to write a book on salt based on the fact that he does not have the foggiest idea about one of the most interesting properties of his subject.  Wow.  This is a case of a good writer attempting to write on a subject he forgot to read about.  By the way, a casual search of salt properties on the internet would have given him the correct information.  
 Anything by historian (and World War II veteran) Howard Zinn would be better than Lynne Cheney's jingoism. Also, for some background info on Lynne Cheney's corporate and ideological agenda, see the book by radio host Laura Flanders, "Bushwomen: Tales of a Cynical Species. 
 This book focuses on Amanda Starkey, a young nurse who has suffered a breakdown and was sent home by her boss so she could get her act together. Amanda returns to her family home in Wisconsin to live with her sister, Mattie, and Mattie's daughter, Ruth. Mattie's husband, Carl, is off fighting in France during WWI.  The sisters are very close, and so Mattie is of course thrilled to have her sister back in her life on a daily basis again. They begin to embark on a new aspect of their life together, while Mattie anxiously waits for her husband's return from the war.  Then, one winter night, tragedy strikes, and Mattie ends up drowning in the nearby lake. Her young daughter, Ruth, almost ends up drowning as well, but is rescued in the nick of time.   Not long after Mattie's death, Carl returns from the war, wounded. He is eager to see his wife, not realizing that she has died.   Amanda, who has never liked Carl, hopes that he will decide to leave again almost as soon as he'd returned home. She figures him for the sort to not want to raise a child alone, and each day waits for him to leave, thereby making her Ruth's sole caretaker. Yet much to her annoyance, he manages to get his bearings again and remains a fixture in both hers and Ruth's life.  At the same time, Amanda struggles with inner demons, both because of what happened to her sister, and because of what happened in her life prior to returning home, which you eventually learn about. She is then sent to a sanatorium and Carl is left to care for his daughter on his own. However, he founders, and ends up relying on a second cousin (Hilda) for her grudging help.   This new upheaval causes Ruth to regress a great deal, and she stops talking and acts out by breaking things in the house and being impossible to toilet train and deal with overall. In a funny turn of events, Ruth manages to embarrass Hilda enough so that she leaves. Carl, in an act of desperation, takes Ruth with him on one of his many visits to see Amanda, in the hope that it will spark a desire in her to get well once and for all. It works, and a year after having been committed, Amanda returns home.  The rest of the story vacillates between what really happened the night Mattie drowned, and what is happening in Amanda and Ruth's life afterwards. In the first part of the book, Ruth ages from about 3-5. When the second part begins, she is already 11. I felt that was somewhat abrupt, and it took me a few pages to realize how much time had passed, as there wasn't anything to indicate that this had happened.   The book continued to bounce around a lot from this point on, between reminiscences of the past and what was actually happening to the characters months or years down the line. It got a little annoying at times to have to figure out where exactly the next installation was starting out. Also, the book jacket said the story was told from several of the main character's points of view, but the only ones you really hear from are Ruth and Amanda.   I was pretty disappointed by the end of the story. The book starts out intriguing and makes you wonder if Amanda literally went off the deep end after all and killed her sister, or if it was in fact an accidental drowning. But by about halfway through, the facts become clear and are easy to interpret. Still, I hoped maybe I was wrong and the ending would surprise me after all. It didn't.  Carl also disappears about halfway through the book. It's due to a job he takes, but it felt like he was written out of the story because the author ran out of use for him, or wasn't sure what to do with him after a certain point. She spent a lot of time focusing on Carl's desire to learn about the truth of his wife's death.   As it was, he only found out part of the truth, and that was according to what Amanda got him to believe. Nevertheless, Carl accepted it at face value and after that he accepted his wife's fate. He was then written out of the story. I didn't really like that aspect of things and didn't think it meshed with everything else that was happening. Even though he wasn't a strong character in general, he's one of the characters I actually liked. Amanda wasn't that likeable at all, and was a pretty cold person who was obsessed with Ruth and still obsessed with the past. Ruth was somewhat pliable and easily molded to her aunt's bidding, even though she made some feeble attempts to be her own person.  I don't know if I'd read this author again. But I managed to find this book for $1.. and would say it was worth it and I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it, either on here or in a bookstore 
 I purchase several feng shui books and this one was the easiest to understand. However, nothing happened after purchasing several hundred dollars of feng shui items. Instead it seems bad things were happening to me. I junked all the stuff. I think it's total nonsense and more like witchcraft...stay away from it 
 AS I FIRST BEGAN READING THIS BOOK I WAS GREATLY IMPRESSED BY THE AUTHORS PASSION, CLARITY, AND HIS THOROUGH AND ENLIGHTENING APPROACH. THEN ALL OF SUDDEN HE BEGAN PRAISING VATICAN 2 AND "HOW BRILLIANT IT WAS". WHERE EVERY OTHER PARAGRAPH REVERTED TO VATICAN 2 DOCUMENTS. I TOTALLY LOST INTEREST, I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER FINISH IT... PERHAPS BECAUSE VATICAN 2 DISGUSTS ME, I DON'T KNOW.. 
 Don't buy this book.  You need to be a surgeon to be able to remove the stickers from the sticker pages.  You then have to search endlessly with your child to find the proper location for it.  There are many other more enjoyable options that do not provide as much frustration as this product.. 
 I found this book enyoyable until I guessed who did it fairly early on. I  liked the character who narrated the story and would try another book by  this author 
 Gee, I guess I really can't rate it.  I ordered it on August 9th, and still have not recieved it as of November 3rd.  Guess I'll know better then to order through Amazon again 
 Why do you think Leary doesn't do live shows anymore?  Hicks isn't around for him to steal material from!  And that is precisely what Leary did.  He took Bill's material, excised anything controversial and intelligent (as in all of Bill's political work), added more profanity to attract the ignorant, and once again proved that the path to success in the entertainment industry is not achieved by providing meaningful material, rather it is done by appealing to the lowest common denominator 
 Military Police (Serving Your Country) is an excellent attempt at explaining to very young children the concept of Military Police. The history section is severly lacking and perhaps the author should have concidered deleting it. To cover WWII in less than a page of writing at a third grade level is a sincere mistake. There are a few references to technical data on equipment that far exceed the explanation of the Vietnam war. If this was an attempt to show young people concidering service what becoming an MP is all about, it falls far short of the goal. If it is an effort to allow parents and grandparents to sit with their little ones and read about MP's, it is excellant 
 these girls have no talent show....and are not on the road. what your going to get is basic photo shoots , very lame 
 Current events contribute to the genius of pulp prose. The larger lesson made evident by the Katrina hurricane disaster as well as the recent but already forgotten corporate corruption scandals is that both events had to happen as both meteorologists and economists prophesied they would. Our short sighted judiciary paralyzed but conflicting motives did nothing. So I would say this book proves that, along with staring at the sun too long, money causes blindness 
 I am a proclaimed lover of musicals and movie musicals and I was incredibly disappointed by Gigi. As if the overdone french accents aren't enough to turn one off altogether the acting is ridiculously overdramatic and forced. The one redeeming thing in most musicals is at least the song and dance aspect, however for me that might have been the worst part. The songs were repetitive and catchy in a way that makes you want a lombotomy or temporary memory loss to get those stupid tunes and words out of your head. The moral of this story is, spend your time and money on the plethora of wonderful movie musicals and stay far away from this on

 Not very user friendly, limited vocabulary, finally threw it away when it got stuck on Turkish which was a language I have no use for. Hope there is a better product out there as the concept is good 
 Routine Southern recipes for hams, etc.. the only recipe that would have been worthwhile to purchase and read would have been the biscuit recipe (inticingly pictured on the book's cover) however, that one they left out..every other dish u can find on the internet or in a real Southern cooking cookbook.  Save your money on this one.  I gave mine away 
 The only good part of the movie was when the female protagonist gets a phone call that the killer is inside house which was in the beginning of the movie. The rest was really boring. Don't get me wrong, i don't mind a slow paced movie which were prominent in the 1970's and 1980's but this movie was so dreadful. This movie isn't origianl in terms of the horror subgenre of a slasher/killer calls by phone type of movie. Black Christmas 1974 was the original slasher flick/killer calls by phone type of movie. When a Stranger Calls flat out copied the scene from Black Christmas. In Black Christmas 1974, A sorority sister gets a really creepy and scary calls in the house. The police then trace the call and says that the killer is upstairs in the house. Of course Psycho was the first American modern horror and the 2nd is Black Christmas. 
 ick - just bad...too bad for words.  stay far away from this, umm, I guess you could call it a movie.  anymore effort in this review would be more time in my life I'll never get back 
 I picked up this book after seeing David Sedaris on a late night talk show. He seemed hilarious, almost like a younger, bemused Woodie Allen type.   While the book is well written, his views on life are very disappointing to me. In his previous professions/stages of life, he was a ne'er-do-well, a loafer, well, basically a bum. Many of his stories are made up of snide commentaries on others around him who were progressing through their lives. These folks were getting in the way of David's quest of just figuring out how to get the next hit of recreational drugs.   He can become the poet laureaute for the younger generations whom life is never easy enough and can't put enough blame on those around them. 
 On the cover and in the book, Amy Flowers presents herself as an "insider". In fact she only worked as a phone sex operator for a brief period of time as part of her research, and it sounds like she walked away from the experience thoroughly repelled.   In every paragraph she is passing judgments on her respondents for creating the fantasy the customers pay them to create. Where her respondents do not agree with her foregone conclusions, she pronounces them self-delusional. One of the companies mentioned practiced bait-and-switch and other scams with the customers - she blames the operators, and rather than investigating how prevalent it is for companies in the industry, declares it to be universal.   Perhaps she got a grade for this because her advisors also had the same closed-minded view of the industry. She certainly whines about her research not being taken seriously because it was an adult industry she was investigating.   This could have been an important work, but someone else would have had to do it. Ms. Flowers only found what she was looking for.   If you want to learn something about the people who work in phone sex, start with Phone Sex: Aural Thrill and Oral Skills by Miranda Austin or Dirty Talk: Diary of a Phone-Sex "Mistress" by Gary Anthony.   If you want to learn how not to conduct sociological research, read this book.

 I was listening to this and the person's voice is awful. He's not even like on tune. It's  very annoying 
 A long, stupid and boring story that you MUST read and memorize at college for quiz tests. I still wonder how studying this most unimportant account of a most unimportant guy is going to help me become a better Mechanical Engineer 
 Although the revised editions of the Nancy Drew books never lived up to the originals in my opinion, the writing was always decent...But then around volumes #27-#30, it really started to decline,and became what I call poor quality. It seemed as if the writer('s) really did'nt care what thier readers would think of thier work, just as long a they got thier pay check, they were happy. And the art is atroucious! The cover paintings arent too bad, but its the illustrations inside the books that really show the lazziness of the artist. I really liked the original illustrater's (which was Russel Tandy) approach. He would first actually read the whole book before going to work, unlike Nappi who would doodle a few pencil drawings that looked as if they came from a generic color book from Big Lots... I dispies this garbage.. 
 Who wouldnt want a better profile?  I was very excited with my purchase, however I was quickly disapointed.  The sling hurt and didnt fit my private area comfortably.  After one wash, the underwear shrunk.  Love low rise, but these pair were too low.  My crack was showing!!!!!  
 Contrary to popular Christian thinking, 'Pagan' does NOT mean 'not Christian.' Paganism is a valid religion in its own right, that simply recognizes both male and female aspects of God, as well as the guidance coming from the LIVING GOD, the LIVING SPIRIT, that is all around us, at all times, in God's creation, the very air we breathe, and in our hearts, minds and souls.   Christians mis-use the name of this beautiful religion as though it were something dirty or immoral. I remember my mom telling me (when I tried to wear a bikini at age 14), 'You're no better than a PAGAN!' and she spat the word 'Pagan' as though it were synonymous with 'slut' or 'mass murderer.'  Please, Christians, please get educated about other religions. You don't like it when non-Christians criticize your religion or give false information, so please don't do it to them.   Please show some respect, even if you do not agree with the other religion. Please don't use the name of an established religion as though it were something really horrible. Pagans worship the same God you do. God is bigger than any one religion. And anyway, there IS ONLY ONE GOD - different cultures and religions just perceive God in different ways.   Blessings and Peace to you, from someone who is part Christian, part Pagan, part Buddhist, part New Ager... and has no conflict among them. Please, just COEXIST. Jesus was the Prince of Peace, not war and judgement 
 This quick-read is a cheap thrill. It has some eloquent prose and an interesting premise; however, the story as a whole is marginal and actually quite banal. The author seems almost desperate to convey "realism", but relying on photographic descriptions of sexual acts and equally graphic renditions of sadistic brutality are simply not enough to make this story exceptional.   The protagonist, Frannie, is "too constructed" to seem real. Her extreme cynicism is perhaps refreshing at times and her linguistic ponderings are often quite amusing, but overall her personality is meatless. The lover/detective Malloy is a tired police cliche with a knack for some extreme sexual precision. Frannie's student Cornelius shows some potential as a character but quickly disintegrates.  The ending is quite over-hyped and actually rather disappointing. Blood and gore and a meager "explaination" - wow, what a surprise...  Overall, Susanna Moore shows us in this book that she can be clever with words; however, her attempt to portray gritty reality comes across as merely desperate for attentio 
 I think Denise Hildreth has a nice writing style...but I could not finish this book. I did not like Savannah and her unrealistically outlandish mother. A true southern lady would most likely not call her mother by her first name, no matter how ridiculous she may be. Like other reviewers have mentioned, I found the numerous Jonathan Pierce references very annoying. I felt the book was going nowhere except a predictable ending. 
 The book starts off where Black Notice left off.  Although I have read Black Notice, that was a few months ago, so I found the book confusing and lacking in necessary detail.  And I think that writing the book in first person present was a huge mistake.  While we see through the characters eyes, the view is bland and colorless.  I did not feel that there was any connection with the character, but that she was trying a writing exercise in communicating what you physically see 
 Keep your kids away from this sewage.  This book should banned from schools. 
 I got this for my boy scout's birthday.  He really liked it and it is cute but it was a lot smaller than I thought it was.  I'm not sure if it is usable.  My son hasn't tried using this yet 
 Britain, circa 1997.  Tony Blair is elected P.M.  Princess Di perishes.  And the Spice Girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public.  This effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing.  To be fair, the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is.  Rather, they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor.  The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what "A Hard Days' Night" did for the Beatles.  Whereas the Fab Four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the Spice craze.  I was reminded more of the Monkees' "Head" than I was of "A Hard Days' Night".  Lots of celeb cameos (Roger Moore, Elton John, et al) that amount to naught.  Oh, well.  On to "From Justin to Kelly" 
 Study an atlas before you go into lab.  You can figure out how to dissect almost everything without a dissector.  If you get stuck, ask a professor, but reference this book only as a last resort.  There are MUCH better ways of accessing certain structures than the instructions in this book.  There is absolutely no reason to have your own personal copy.  The one plus about this edition is that references to other atlases besides Grant's (terrible) are given 
 I bought this expecting some informative reading.  I finished it, not having fulfilled my hopes.  The author spends his time discussing philosophy & religion, insulting scientists & mathematicians, and saying how much greater Buddha was than Aristotle.    Let's try a thought experiment:  Suppose you have a fireplace, and 1 log was left partially sticking out of the fire last night, such that the flames missed it.  Would you say that the log was burned (A) or unburned (not A)?  According to Mr. Kosko, science & math would pick one or the other.  That's bunk, we'd say the log was 40% burned and 60% unburned (A & not A).  We'd use percentages.  The author would argue that on a 0<->1 fuzzy continuum, from burned to unburned, the log would fall on a point 0.4 fuzzy units from the unburned point and 0.6 fuzzy units from the burned point.  Any monkey can see that he's taken the same thing all scientists do and changed around the words.  Oh, and for all the computer programmers out there (of which I'm one), the author seems to think that binary computer programming is incapable of utilizing multiple partial conditional statements (IF-THEN-ELSEIF-THEN-ELSE-THEN-ENDIF).  This programming construct was not invented by fuzzy science, but has been around for a very long time.  Part of the section about how fuzzy-logic controlled machines was interesting and informative.  Once again, multiple partial condition control statements are no invention of fuzzy science 
 My experience with Tacitus in the original was brief and without professorial guidance, so I can't vouch for the accuracy of the translators; however, Church and Bodribb's English is certainly readable if a bit outdated (A trait I like in translations of ancient authors). The lack of footnotes or maps is what dooms this edition, though it probably is directly related to the excellent price. I would only advise purchasing this book if money is that much of a problem for you or if you're only buying as an aid for translation, you dirty cheat you 
 You can read all about the book just from what is included in the jacket. Unbelievable potrayal of a women cast off a ship by her husband. All she wants to know is did he love her when he married her? Why did he do it? I mean give me a break! I would not lay low and try to make him go insane. I would go to the police.   I read books from beginning to end to give them a chance. This was a waste of my time 
 The author tried so hard to be quippy and cute that she missed out on warm and/or engaging.  By chapter two, she lost me.  
 Much of the information in this book is not specific to black and white photography.  It is very generic and could serve as the introduction to a broader book on the topic.  The chapters on composition and the "zone system" are disappointingly thin, and there are very few photographs within the book to serve as illustrative examples supporting the text.  The paper is of mediocre paperback quality, which makes the few photographs within the book look washed out and featureless.  The author says this material is collected from his years of teaching the subject; I'd hate to be one of his students 
 This was the first book I saw in the store in my search for a good summer read.  The cover intrigued me and so did the description of a young African Elvis impersonator trying to make a life for himself. Who wrote the summary of this book?  Did they even read it?  It's not what this book is about at all.    This book is interesting at first.  As I read on, I kept trying to find where this book was going.  This is difficult as the book switches between the past and the present; unfortunately the two are never reconciled.  About half way through, I found myself skimming through the remaining pages, scanning for a semblance of a plot.  No luck. I gave up on this book- it's just too much work.     
 I liked this machine while it worked, but I started having problems finalizing discs a bit ago.  I got busy and suddenly the warranty was up, and then the other day, it just wouldn't turn on at all.  I had it for 15 months 
 A silly and paranoid book of yet another Christian who fails to understand the theology of his own religion and its connection and spiritual ties with the Hebrew tradition 
 After waiting for 1 month to get this toy I cannot tell you HOW disappointed my 7 year old daughter was when she got it. Absolutely this thing is a WASTE of money!  It is poorly designed and there is no way you can trace from it. The image is impossible to see with any amount of detail.  DO NOT BUY THIS TOY! I would give it zero stars if I could 
 I loved the original movie, and I love Johnny Depp so I thought this movie would be awesome.Wrong wrong wrong!! First of all, the child actors were horrible, well the Charlie and Mike characters were ok, but the two girl actors were the worst I've seen in a long time. And what did they do to Johnny Depp? He was so creepy and weird. I took my nine year old to see it in the theater, and even she almost fell asleep. If you really want a treat watch the original with Gene Wilder 
 Steve Martin has become a cultural staple in the comic community.  With hysterical films and outlandish Saturday Night Live performances, it would be obvious that Martin would be a great choice to do a comic album.  Well, in this film guys opinion, you are going to need to be a big fan of Martin to stomach this album.  His humor is offbeat, never quite following a pattern or direction.  Instead of actual jokes, he resorts to making noises on the album that I am sure are funny in person, but listening to it just comes off a failure.  His "Cat Handcuffs" bit is humorous, but the rest becomes obvious that somebody was looking to cash in on Martin's popularity.  I would have loved to see Steve Martin in concert during his younger days, I am sure that he would make me laugh my socks off, but it just doesn't translate well to day's style.  I am sorry Steve, but I liked your other album better.  Grade: ** out of **** 
 I found VERY little useful information in this book...not because it isn't there but because the writing style is too "out there".  I'm sorry I bought it 
 I just finished the 4th chapter and took the review test. Like all the other chapters, I missed 50%. I might as well be studying klingon. I barely have a clue what they are talking about. I'm A+, Network+ certified, using study guides from Que publishing. These study guides were a walk in the park compared to Linux+ from Sybex. I'll go ahead and finish the book because I paid good money for it, but I can see now, I'll never pass the exam with this study guide. This guide was written for people who already know Linux, not for someone trying to figure it out. If you already know Linux, this guide would be great reference material, as it has hundreds of commands and switchs, but very vague explanations of what these commands and switchs do. I'm also using CBT Nuggets Linux+ video training and have Red Hat 9 installed on a box I built from scratch. Even with all this, I'm still only obtaining about 50% of what I'm studying. I'll still need more and better explanation of linux to ever pass the exam 
 I believe that 'Maximum Warp' was one of the worst Star Trek series ever written.  Firstly, the plot seemed implausible and amatuerish. The idea of dead zones just didn't work for me. And Starfleet was portrayed as a =n organisation that employed loony PR spin doctors to calm the public. Such a concept is totally contrary to the Starfleet that we all know.  Secondly, the characterisations seemed off. Picard didn't seem like the man we all know from TNG and the movies.  I read half the book, but was so disgusted with it that I stopped reading and threw it out.  That being said, I enjoyed previous Dave Galanter works. 'Battle Lines' was a fantastic Voyager book. Dave also provided an email address int hat book, and was very gracious in replying to my email. I believe that he is a talented Star Trek author, but he has missed the mark with this book. Better luck next time.  Don't waste your time on this book, but don't disregard Galanter's other works 
 Picked up a copy of this not long ago and it is truly a developer's guidance for code management, as told by the authors.  It is not a book on configuration management whatsoever, as some of the other reviews have indicated.  It does not cover any of the CM discipline doctrine at all.  The fact that the authors have chosen a very rudimentary tool such as CVS should indicate clearly that this is not for the more mature development shops whatsoever.  This tool hasn't an integrated change management, release management, baseline management, etc. built into it as it is strictly a version management tool.  So in a sense the title of the book is very misleading.  If you want to see how to try to improve the management of your code base because your development area is rather out of control this might be a good place to start.  If your looking for more informative books on the SCM/CM doctrine then this is not the book to purchase.  This isn't the book if your on the SW-CMM/CMMI, ISO9001, ITIL, or any other model journey either 
 Any book recommmended by Noam Chomsky, Bill Greider, and Ralph Nader is a socialist tome to be sure.  Jeff Gates, the author here, needs to acquaint himself with Adam Smith, author of "the wealth of nations". and Hernando DeSoto who wrote "the Mystery of Capitalism."  He also needs to come to grips with the truth that Marx's Capitalist Manifesto missed the mark when it failed to cite that human initiative is the most important component in the means of production and the means of exchange.    It isn't capitalism that's out of control but those in the bureaucracy who seek to interposition themselves between the money freely spent by consumers, making one voluntary choice over another, and the corporations that have provided them with the requisite goods or services.  Unlike governments, corporations go out of business if they don't squarely meet consumer demand on an ongoing basis.  The reason why those in America have a better lifestyle, more choices, and a greater surplus for the common man is that private proerty in America is protected by a rule of law.  In Gates' world he or those like him would make the decisions as to who gets what, when where and how.  This is known as crony capitalism and is practiced around the world.  Indeed, all of those poverty stricken countries would do well to have companies like Microsoft or Walmart providing jobs for their citizens not to mention the cheaper, quality goods they provide.  Instead the political elites enrich themselves while overtaxing and over regulating those who would create new jobs.  Gates' citations of statistics in support of his theories is selective to say the least.  Nowhere does he mention that the number of hours the average worker has to work in order to buy a consumer good, say a car, has dropped dratically over the last 50 years.  Nor does he break out the amount of income apportioned to capital gains by those he sees as rich.  He picks starting dates which come immediately after down markets in securities where capital gains income was at a minimum, and then uses a future date coinciding with the culmination of a long uptrend in securities prices.  This is not the way to fairly represent the state of things in the economy.  As anecdotal proof, if things are so bad in America where are so many immigrants poring across our borders trying to get in?  How many people are taking a raft or swimming to Cuba for that free health care?  This is just another left-wing screed from a guy who truncated his analysis at the point where he felt sufficiently aglow with his own motives.  Jeff Gates, the self rightious apostate of the left, needs to continue doing his homework.  Adam Smith's "Wealth of Nations" would be a good starting point.  
 This is by far the most known novel Bryce has written, and there isn't much to comment unfortunately. It's a classic in Peru as far as I read but, as Chinua Achebe's 'Things fall apart', this is one of those folklore books that won't appeal to my Fiction reading hunger. It seems shallow most of the times, the character POV of the kid Julius never works out what's going on around him; no true sequels; Julius' parents are made of one piece of cardboard; the setting is the only thing that might be of interest (very much like Achebe's novel); and Julius barely grows by the end of the novel (at page 350!). For that matter, go check Coetzee's 'Waiting for the barbarians' or Peruvian Vargas Llosa's 'The war of the end of the world', two contemporary masterpieces. 
 Very poor book, realy a waste of time. The review below said it all 
 This book has glaring errors in the chapter regarding Dr. Gary Kildall and CP/M.  The author trashes DOS as a "slapdash clone" and a "rip-off" of CP/M, which is simply untrue.  Tim Paterson, the author of DOS, is in fact suing the publisher and the author over numerous misrepresentations in the book.  Save your money and get a book that is better researched 
 These boots were the worst ever!  They were grossly missized and not as depicted.  The back of the boot had a tape with embroidery up it that was mysteriously not pictured when ordering. When returned, the company refused to reimburse shipping even though they acknowledged that this was deceiving. Never again 
 I live on the Vineyard and let's just say, this cook book does not represent island living in the least. The island is filled with an eclectic mix of people but you would never know it by this book. It tries a little too hard, says very little, is not innovative and seems to feel that it is better than the rest of us by showing some pictures and recipes of some celebrities and those who like to hang out with them. I have tried many of the recipes and few are memorable. The chatter written by the authors of the book and of each individual recipe seems overwritten and trite. Give me some humor, some grit, some wit. These are some pretty self-absorbed people. Lighten up, people. Let's hope this is the LAST of this series... 
 The author examines Inka and Mayan myths using a variety of tools, and many, many words.  To the first myth he applies the theories in Hamlets Mill to explain why the Foxes tail is black and pinpoint AD 650 as the rise of warfare in the Andes.  From here it's mostly downhill.  The author then drags us through his own internal mental processes of doubt and disbelief as he looks at other myths.  Through this long process he forcefully and unnecessarily brings up many biases such as there is no proof that a matriarchal society ever existed anywhere in the world.  Period.  He returns to the subject of matriarchal disbelief many times calling it a big 'red flag'.  He leads us through his admitted internal stubborness of this and many other issues.  Although I believe the author is correct in his assocation with the Fox's tail being black being a celestial event ala Hamlets Mills, he spends so many words looking at other myths from a plethora of angles that you are forced into a single conclusion.  That no one outside of a culture has any clue at what a given myth really means.  The entire book is like running naked through the forest yelling out conclusions about myths which rightly are interpreted only by their creators.  At one point in the discussion of 'finding father' he claims that the Andean man lacked a true heart with the ability to love while he was primarily a hunter within a matrilinear horticultural society.  Andean man only gained his heart and full ability to love when the culture changed to fully agriculture and he had to stay at home with the wife and kids.  Give me a break.  To any Andean person alive this is rubbish.  What kinds of conclusions and judgements can we make living outside the cultural box.  It is this kind of subtle talk that is a jaguars hair short of prejudice and racism.  Ultimately, although if you like reading from the 'academic' view, this book does lead you through enough alleys to make you feel like the author knows what he is talking about, ultimately it fails from it's biases and from being rooted in a combination of sexism and western scientific dogma.  If the author wanted to really understand the Andean mind then he would have had to undergo a process of breaking open his head and surrendering to the mystery of myth reather than trying to break open the myths using the rational mind.  Myth is mythic.  A view which ultimately escapes the author.  It might be worth it to take this book on if you have a university paper to write.  It will certainly scintillate your professor being of the same vocabulary and possibly biases.  But if you are looking to expanding your understanding of the Inka or Andean cultures from a spiritual or mythic perspective then look elsewhere.  Get yourself to South America, Peru, spend time with the shamans.  Then you can learn what myth is really about.  And how it lives today 
 Mere Christianity is a book often recommended to atheists by Christians and is touted as a rational, logical case for the Christian religion. Unfortunately, well-informed atheists will find that Lewis quickly uses a god of the gaps argument to explain his concept of Moral Law. Lewis's Moral Law argument will not fool anyone with a basic understanding of social evolution. All cultures have some prohibition against stealing and murder as well as some glorification of selflessness and compassion, but this is due not to a Lawgiver but to social evolution. The reason we have these moral characteristics is because they helped us to survive. Any tribe of humans who permitted murder or glorified betrayal would fall apart and die out quickly.  A warning to all atheists who pick up this book: Don't bother reading past Book 1. The Moral Law is the keystone of Lewis's argument. Without it, everything else he says is meaningless to atheists 
 The trilogy the title refers to, revolves around Patrick Melrose at three points in his life. The first is at five when he's raped by his sadistic father. The second is in his late twenties as a a drug addict who has come to claim his father's ashes. The final section is a glimpse at Patrick as a recovered addict, navigating life while trying to put the demon of his father to rest. The technical writing is great. Beautiful witty prose, descriptive and vivid characters and smart witty dialogue. Yet I found it increasingly difficult to hang in there when I detested nearly everyone in the pages of this book. Sneering snobs, and drug addicts. Not my idea of an enjoyable read 
 This book is in DESCRIPTIVE NOTATION, not algebraic notation.  Do not buy this book 
 Do not buy this.  Go with Mac OS X 4.2 Tiger, it doesn't crash or lock up.  Plus you will get access to really cool applications out of the box that lets you do almost anything media-wise.  I could go one for hours how the Macintosh operating system is better but I will say one last thing...  Tiger is faster than Windows.  Research has proved that Tiger and all the other operating systems conserve CPU performance to such an extent that 90%-100% of the speed is left for applications and such.  Windows eats up so much speed along with DOS that from 20%-30% of the performance is left for the user.  That puts a normal Windows computer (3Ghz) at less than 1Ghz.  While a normal Mac computer (2Ghz) runs at 2Ghz.  Plus the fastest Mac is a dual G5 each running at 2.7Ghz.  So actual speed is 5.4Ghz.  The fastest Windows computer is around 3.6Ghz which runs around 1Ghz.  That is a HUGE difference (5.4Ghz-1Ghz.)  When Apple moves to Intel chips next year (about,) The Macs will run around 6.4Ghz if not more.  That is an even MORE HUGE difference.  Take my word for it.  The Windows world is not worth it.  Whenever I go on my Mom's computer (which is running on Windows XP,) I encounter a lock up or annoying hickup in the OS, EVERY TIME!!  I agree that a good amount of people don't find Windows to be unstable, but even when I go to a friend's house I notice them there as well.  Every Windows computer I have used for more than 20 minutes has locked up.  But it's not just this, it's also that Tiger is so much easier to use.  Take my advice (I've converted many people) and switch to Mac... Please.  I swear that most of you who read this and switch will be very pleased.  It might be a little wierd at first to get used to the new OS, but I mastered it in a day when it took me months on Windows.  Plus you can purchase Microsoft Word for Mac as well (which I think is easier to use than the Window's counterpart.)  So go and throw that ugly Windows computer away and get a spanking new, shiny white, STABLE, Mac!!! 
 This book is worthless, even for $2.  Very outdated (phrases about telegrams).  I returned it.  Buy Rick Steve's Italian Phrases instead.  It is more compact and current (asks how to send an e-mail, not telegram) 
 Wright was way too easy on Borg.  It is nice that these guys are friends and get along, but Wright should have pointed out how sloppy Borg's scholarship is.  He has a late dating for the writing of the Gospel of Mark, then builds a house of cards on top of that to bolster his contention that the Gospels were largely fiction.  Wright should have done a better job showing how the synoptic Gospels were almost certainly written before 60 AD.    Borg is entitled to his opinions, but to call him a Christian is pretty bizarre.  His views are typically the opposite of historic Christianity.  If you hold to the following beliefs offered by Borg, you could be a Hindu, a Buddhist, an atheist, or an agnostic.  But if words mean anything, one thing you could not be is a Christian.    * The Bible is not inspired by God at all, it is just the "product of two ancient communitites."   * "A major task for Christians in the 21st century is grateful and enthusiastic affirmation of religious pluralism. This means accepting a relative status for Christianity, but a relative status as one of the magnificent first-magnitude stars in the constellation of the world's religions." * "Here in Jesus, I see more clearly than anywhere else what god is like.  This affirmation can be made with one's whole heart while still affirming that God is also known in other traditions." * "I and most mainline scholars do not think Jesus said these things.  He did not speak like this." [in reference to various Gospel quotes of Jesus] * "Do I think Jesus thought of himself as divine?  No.  Do I think he had the mind of God - that is, did he know more than his contemporaries because, in addition to having a human mind, he had a divine mind?  No.  Do I think he had the power of God?  That he could, for example, have called down twelve legions of angels to protect himself, as Matthew 26:53 reports he said?  No." * "if you think you're the Messiah, you're not.  . . . I don't think people like Jesus have an exalted perception of themselves."  Note to Mr. Borg: If Jesus was the Messiah, what is wrong with him thinking He was the Messiah?  Is it wrong for God to have an exalted perception of himself?   * " . . . candor requires that we acknowledge that the early Christians (and Jesus himself, if he had an apocalyptic eschatology) were wrong about the end being near"  The only reason the church should discuss Borg's views is to show that many people outside the church believe these false teachings, and here is why they are wrong . . .    Borg "metaphorizes" anything he doesn't like, and typically anything that is supernatural (Jesus Seminar "scholars" usually start with the assumption that miracles can't happen, so any miracles in the Bible are dismissed).    Keep in mind that you don't sell a lot of books saying that Jesus is God, He is the only way to salvation, etc.  But saying you have new insights on Jesus - whether true or not - can get attention for you (i.e., the DaVinci Code, the Jesus Seminar, etc.).  If Borg and other pluralists are correct in saying that other religions also lead to God, then shouldn't they be sending "reverse missionaries" to countries where Christians are persecuted?  After all, if Buddhism is a valid  path to the one true God (even though, ironically, they don't believe in a creator God!), then shouldn't we tell the persecuted Christians in China to just become Buddhists so they can have a better life now?  Wouldn't that be the loving thing to do?  The same would go for Christians in Muslim and Hindu countries.  There are 100 passages in the Bible saying Jesus is the only way to salvation.  So Christianity is either correct or incorrect, but under no circumstances can Christianity and other religions be correct at the same time.   
 Based on the advertisement at Amazon this was the book "In Search of Excellence.  It was not the book but an interview about the book.  I was very disapointed.  I still want the book on CD but feel it futal to try ordering it again on Amazon as it is a nusance to order and return.  If you can help, I would love to purchase the actual book on CD.  Thank you.

 Artsy French erotic drama is watchable but ultimately not very interesting and, worse, not very stimulating.  A young heroine, home for the summer from boarding school, is soon bored hanging around her parents' farmhouse and starts having all manner of erotic dreams.  As the film progresses, we see a mix of erotic dreams and actual erotic events, with the film leaving it up to the viewer which events are happening in the girl's head and which are actually taking place in her life.  Toward the end, it's pretty clear that most of the events are actually happening.  The trouble is, most of the girl's erotic dreams and/or experiences involve things like having earthworms rubbed into her nether regions and the girl playing with earwax, hardly the elements of classic erotica.  There are other things going on, and the movie's not a total loss, but really... if you've seen one allegorical French erotic drama, you've seen them all.  
 i strongly suggest that mr. block should retire willingly and do not further chip away his reputation built on his 'mathew scudder' series. this hitman series are nothing but a joke to me and himself. very disappointed to see a wash up author still tries so hard to keep cashing in with his old brand 
 The history of corporate finance is a fascinating subject, overflowing with interesting people and dramatic events that affect not only finance but the man on the street.    Unfortunately the authors of this book have no interest in breathing life into the story of capitalism.  Instead what a reader will get is a dry list of facts.  The regulated company evolved into the joint stock company for the following reasons.  The East India Company developed the following innovations.  Its example paved the way for the next step, and so on.  The book has all the feeling of a dull term paper written by a college student who simply summarized the obvious secondary sources.  Each step seems to lead naturally, ploddingly to the next, in a march that seems both uninteresting and inevitable.    While the authors have done an impressive job of bringing many important facts over a broad context together in one volume, that's all they've done.  And I detected a subtle smugness, like that of a Monday morning quarterback, as the authors pointed out flaws in earlier structures.  To me they seemed unaware that the flaws in today's systems will look as obvious to future scholars as those of the past seem now to us.  I also encountered what I considered to be lapses in scholarship (or insight) brought about by the "Ivory Tower" phenomenon of having only a an academic understanding of processes undertaken by others.  The coverage of LBOs is an example.  It's easy in hindsight to go on about the excesses of leveraged buyout era of the 1980s.  Baskin and Miranti cover this fully, detailing many of the problems that arose.  But was there any rationale for the LBOs in the first place, or were they simply the instruments of greedy financial conmen?  On p291 the authors begin one paragraph with the following: "One important method applied by LBO organizers to achieve superior performance was to change ownership structures."  Having lived through that era, I'm aware of how misleading that statement can be.  At the time there were a number of public companies that weren't well managed and had languishing stock prices that not only didn't reflect the firms' potential, but didn't even reflect the value of their current operations.  Traditionally this obvious problem (the stock's trading at $35 and it's worth $60) had no easy solution.  Until LBOs came along (both friendly and unfriendly), there was little that could be done.  LBO firms were able to convince investors that a company was undervalued, provide a method for quickly realizing this value, and prove that it could be done.  Many decry the fact that jobs were sometimes lost in the process; a point worth considering.  But this doesn't take away from the fact everyone who owns stocks today has a portfolio that's more fairly and appropriately valued because of the rationalizing force introduced by leveraged buyouts.  Valuing these companies wasn't the innovation, any grad student could have done that.  It was coming up with a way to prove that these valuations mattered, and that management would be held accountable for them, that was the innovation.    Now when incompetent management is forced out as a result of an LBO, is that a "change in ownership structure?"  I guess so.  But for me the phrase fails to capture the essence of what is taking place.  Is quickly realizing the value in a company whose stock is trading too cheaply "achieving superior performance?"  I wouldn't call it that, but I suppose an academic might.  The point here is that an intelligent laymen looking to expand his or her knowledge and become interested in a fascinating topic will be poorly served by this type of phraseology.    Not recommended. 
 I don't think that the protagonist of a novel has to be sweetness and light all the time-I can accept flawed characters, even seriously flawed characters. Philippa, however, was such a thoroughly unlikeable and despicable character that I honestly did not care what happened to her and actually found myself wishing that something bad would happen to her. She was selfish,cold,  ungrateful, cruel to her adoptive parents, and I just could not continue reading. I generally like P.D James, but I did not like this book at all 
 I was a little disappointed in the amount of HD footage displayed on this disc. I would tell anyone interested in HD video of the Space shuttle, you may be a little short changed. Many of the video scenes in space are in 480i with borders, the only HD video will be the takeoff and brief astronaut preparation shots. The disc is an excellent history package for space shuttle buffs 
  If you're going to cut these parts fron TEFL and add art work why not make something that can be put out or given as a gift like a coffee table book. After all there arew some great words to live by in here 
 This is the worst war picture I have ever seen with the possible exception of "Corregidor.&quot 
 The plot is confussing and weakly held together by the detailed personal stories. I found little that was morally redeeming or outstanding in this book. Having grown-up in Oklahoma, I found the book unauthentic. I cannot recommend this book 
 isn't wearing your ancestry on your sleeve so blatantly and in such a predictable fashion just a 21st century version of Al Jolson? the problem with so many new-traditionalist artists is that they lessen rather than deepen the understanding of the complexity and diversity of the celebrated cultural groups experience. hippies and white liberals love it, but where does that leave those that are living it? far better capturing the Latina experience are Julietta Venegas, south of the border, and east LA's Lysa Flores, north of the border 
 This is an antiquated work. I have disposed of it. It is not worthy of being on your list. I am a former college history major and this book was a major disappointment 
 The only reason I gave this book one star is because there is no zero level, as far as I can tell.  I was disappointed. I was annoyed. I was bored. I was irritated. Then I was impressed because if this could get published, ANYbody can get published.   There are, theoretically, two plots in this book. Neither plot ties in with the other. The second plot is so secondary that it is forgotten for chapters at a time by the author. I only wish we could have forgotten the main plot, and I use the word "plot" only as a point of reference.   ESP, mysticism, ghosts, real magic; a protagonist who could be a woman, or who could be a woman who can magically - yes, magically - turn into a man. Or really, we aren't sure. It's like at the end of the book, Coulter looked up, realized "gosh darn, end of the book already? I'd better slap together an ending!" and that's what we have. I actually wondered if my book had lost some pages, I was that confused and bewildered.   Also, we meet a character in this book who will return in another book in this series, a cousin of the serial killers Tammy and Tommy Tuttle (Tammy, of course, maybe being Tammy or possibly Tommy or Timmy or magically changing into Tommy or Timmy; we aren't sure and trust me, eventually you won't care). In the later book, this cousin is nice and we are empathetic with her. In this book, I didn't care if she got killed or drowned on her way to Bermuda. In fact, I wouldn't have cared if the whole cast of characters had drowned on the way to Bermuda or been killed by the weird ghosts that the Tuttle siblings feed with blood from victims.   That's "ghosts" as in real ghosts, by the way.  My complaint is that the rest of the books in this series are mostly based in factual, believable actions. This book - I have no idea what happened with this book. Probably one of the worst plotted books I've ever tried to read. And that's sad, because a good Coulter FBI series book is a page-turner and a joy to read. 
 I truly expected this soundtrack to display much, much more of the Massive "sound" than it has. Deep into the disc, I found myself feeling very bored and disappointed that I was lured into buying this soundtrack because it read "Massive Attack" on the jacket. MA, this is not.  While certainly without the well-known name on the front, it would have been a relative success. In actuality, it's not a bad soundtrack, it's just that I expected more. Fans of MA should understand how highly they've raised the bar over the years and to hear "Danny the Dog" is quite a let down.   Maybe the lack, for the most part, of vocals is a key downer. Maybe the absence of a driving rhythm or beat is the problem. Maybe it's a little of everything...or maybe it's the fact that it's a soundtrack, music made to fit a movie and it's not going to be as cohesive as an actual studio release.   In any case, this disc is pretty much only for MA collectors 
 Seriously friends...I was watching a youthful EJ on the ACL DVD and he just blew my mind, lick after lick but let's be real...Bloom is a repeat of the same old thing except not as good as it used to be.    EJ, take it from one of your biggest fans who owns all of your music...if you come out with another album, don't use samples because you think that they will help you modernize the music or "relate" to the kids.  Go into the woodshed and seriously, build a chair.  You need to practice and learn something new if you're going to do something original ever again.  Otherwise, each and every album that you put out is going to sound the same as old ones...like this one does.    Still, much respect.  You are a great master of the instrument but, PRACTICE 
 Based on what I read about the book, I thought I would be getting a detailed explanation and "user guide" for incorporating sprint work into my workouts.  But there wasn't much there that I didn't already know.  Far too many useless photos, too 
 I've looked at IJ books on the shelves for years, but never read any of her work.  This was my first IJ book and sadly I would not recommend it.  Countdown is very clearly a part 2 or part 3 of something she wrote previously.    The first part of the book is full of people showing up with no character development at all.  At first I thought it was just really poor writing, but then it dawned on me, this is a part 2 of some story started previously.  As I continued reading, the vast majority of the story flashes back to previous events, characters, conflicts and plots from part 1, whatever that was.   I think IJ owed it to her readers to mention this as a continuation.  It would be a huge help for new IJ readers (like me) so we could read part 1 first.   Then again, maybe the lack of character and plot development is typical for IJ.  Countdown was supposed to be about a bomb plot, yet 2/3's of the way through the book the bomb has received only a sentence or two of coverage and across the entire 500+ pages, it warrants less than a full page or two of mention.  Countdown is more of a romance/love story than the thriller it is marketed as.  If you go into it expecting a romance, you'll probably enjoy it.  If you're looking for a thriller, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for an ending, look elsewhere. 
 She uses taoism to fit her personal beliefs rather than adapting her beliefs to fit the philosophy.  It's clear she doesn't have a good grasp on what taoism is really all about.  Her version is way too new age, holistic, hippie tripe for me.  Further the book is written in such puerile language as if it is intended for children, give the reader some credit.  
 This book does not give advice on how to help the bride, it makes fun of the whole wedding planning experience, and tells the groom what not to do, and this is not helpful.  Whoever thinks that this book is written for a groom that wants to help, is kidding themselves 
 The contempt the author has for writers and the contempt so many of the agents have for writers is the real theme of this book. If you want names and addresses, use the internet. If you want a book that can actually help you get published, read The Square Guide to Publishing Your Non-fiction Book by Rudy Shur 
 TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED. I READ ALL NORA ROBERTS BOOKS. SPELLBOUND IS NOT ONLY THE SHORTEST BOOK (I READ IT IN UNDER AN HOUR) OF HERS THAT I HAVE EVER READ, IT ALSO WASN'T TYPICAL OF HER USUAL WONDERFUL WRITING.  I ESPECIALLY DIDN'T LIKE THE THEME OF THE STORY 
 I'm expecting my first child, and my mother gave me this book because she knows I like animals (especially the cute babies!)  After reading the book, though, I was downright depressed to the point of tears about becoming a mother.  It basically tells you your children will be horrible terrors and not ever appreciate a thing you do, and that your husband will be even worse!  The writing is bitter and twisted compared to the pictures.  I do give a couple stars, because the pictures are cute if you don't read the text 
 It's not unreasonable for authors to give the characters in their mysteries background lives, and to have those lives evolve in volume after volume. However, there is such a thing as changing a character so much that she or he is no longer recognizable. That's happened in this volume - along with a lot of sloppy, stilted writing that seems almost as though someone took words of Brown's and tried to arrange them into one of her mysteries and didn't quite succeed.  Let's start with the biggies: Harry quit the Post Office. While a reason is given for this, let's face it, without the day-to-day Post Office stuff, and the people who help at the PO and the people who come in, and the downtown businesses, an awful lot of the atmosphere of the village is removed. And an awful lot of the interesting things that Harry filled her days with, as well. Among other things that have changed all out of recognition: Harry's become friends with Boom-Boom, the woman who's the reason that Fair is her ex-husband. And, not only Harry, but all her friends as well, seem to have suddenly become Virgin-Mary-groupies. A statue we've never seen before is suddenly treated as if, oh yeah, all the women in this town go up to pray to it regularly all the time and always have, and it's really important to them. Oh, really?   Then there's the dialogue. For the first 20 pages or so, it's mainly about trucks and cars - talking about the Ford F-150 vs. the F-350, complaints about the BMW 7-series. Have we ever known these things to be so important, before, that Harry and her friends would spend 20 pages talking about them? Not only is there a lot of talking about them, Brown inserts text explanations that sound as though they came out of an owner's manual for the vehicle.   And then we have the monk, supposedly very devoted to his monastery, visiting his family for Thanksgiving, who suddenly says "Land is the ultimate wealth, you know," and launches into a speech about the land that sounds like Scarlett O'Hara's daddy, not a man who's devoted his life to God and things of the spirit for 60 years.  I could tell who had committed the first murder within about 5 minutes after we first hear about it.  And there's an irrelevant, totally unforeseen, and totally unnecessary plot twist at the end concerning one of the secondary continuing characters. Just comes out of thin air, and then is brushed away as quickly. What the???  I always endeavor to mention something I like. Well, Simon the possum makes a brief appearance in this one, and so do a bunch of the barn mice. I really enjoyed when they made fun on Pewter by singing "The Old Grey Mare" at her. (Pewter is a fat, grey cat, you may recall.)  Summary: even for dedicated series loyalists, this is a tough one to swallow. I won't bother reading the next one 
 It is fiction of course. It can not be otherwise for what it contends may happen is IMPOSSIBLE! Many reviewers are upset. Upset perhaps but they should not be worried. The Church is protected by Christ's promise that it will not err. Any person of faith sees this book as FICTION. It is a poor attempt to disguise Greely's left wing theology as fiction. The message to those liberals who find "hope" for their cause in this book: IT AIN'T GOING TO HAPPEN. Recommended reading: "Women Priests And Other Fantasies" Greely and his followers are delusional 
 I had never read anything by Roth and when I finally got around to him I made the mistake of picking The Plot Against America. I enjoy "what if" books and found the idea compelling... unfortunately the book is not. It doesn't dare enough in imagining an alternative (and frightening) scenario, it fails at creating suspence and pathos at almost every turn, and it's a slow and disjointed yawn of a book. Characters are mostly very flat and the there are pages and pages of truly useless page fillers... I can't imagine why i would ever want to pick up another book of his.   You need to be a genius to act so poorly on such a good idea for a story. 
 If you own a newer DVD camcorder that is manufactured by Panasonic, Hitachi, and others that records your movies in a .vro format you can not use this product.  You will have to buy an additional program that will cost about $40 to convert the .vro format to a avi, wav, or mpeg format.  If you own a camcorder that records in .vro do some research before you waste $80 on this program 
 "Tourists are learning that the image of the terrible Turk is false, created to a great degree by it unfriendly neighbors. Turks are quick to remind visitors that, surrounded by Syria, Iraq, Iran, Armenia, Georgia, Bulgaria, and Greece, they're not living in Mr. Rogers' neighborhood."  This is a direct quote.  It sounds like they're trying to say that the surrounding countries are painting an incorrect negative image of Turkey. Which is amusing, since he listed both Greece and Armenia there, which were both targeted by Turkey. Either this writing staff has no idea what they're writing and is just happy to sell books, thinking no one will double check the info, or they're Racist and opinionated. Either way, I wouldn't trust the info in here even as a rough guide on where to go. 
 This game is a joke!  It is immpossible for a child to get past level 3.  It took my husband about 20 tries to get past it, and he is a pro at video games.  (he beat mech 2 for x-box and halo2 the third time he played them.)  Don't buy this game for your kids until you rent it and let them try it out.  It is was a waste of money my kids won't even play it.  It should be rated N for Nobody 
 I personally cannot believe that a few of the artists in this book gave their o.k. to the author of this book. Most of the tattooers have no business trying to teach anything. I believe that if I were going to do this type of book, I'd take a little more time to get with better artists doing cooler tattoos. Even the Capo piece is lacking....it looks like he gave up on the clothes after spending too much time on the face. All in all, if you are a basement tattooer with no prior knowledge, you'll probably learn enough to really scar someone....if you're a professional tattooer with $17 to buy the book, then you probably already tattoo at least as well as anyone in the book. Its worth a read just for a laugh! 
 Having a curiosity in the entertainment that kids and teens are being given today, I happened to watch this film on TV a few days ago.  I could be biased and say that movies aren't what they use to be for kids, but this movie went beyond that. This film is a depressing example of how horribly some of today's youth is growing up. I would NOT recommend this film in anyway (unless for laughs at its stupidity).   The film starts off with our four 'rich girl' characters strutting down the street with arrogance beyond words. The arrogance, perhaps a normal thing for some teenagers. However, these girls do appear to be filthy rich of which very few kids could relate to leaving them to wonder why can't they be rich little kids too?  The goal of these girls of course - To become famous pop-singers. An unrealistic dream for most but it seems to be a moral to the film: "to have a good life, you need to become famous".  The plot moral, not a great one. The characters little lessons, appalling.  'Raven' is so caught up in the 'becoming a pop-star' experience that she becomes completely self-absorbed. This is probably one of the few morals that are presented well. Don't become a self-absorbed idiot.  Moving on. Our second character fails entirely at bringing in any good ideals. After some time working on 'the cheetah girls' upcoming career she comes home to throw a tantrum about her mother not being there (rather, she's out with a boyfriend). The real-estate agent rings about her mother's interest in selling the house, the daughter picks up the phone, rudely yelling to the agent how this house is not for sale 'Because I say so' in pure teen angst. Now she decides to go out and abuse her mother's credit card for all the money it's worth because of this small episode.  Of course when mum comes home, she is not happy. But apparently it's all ok when the daughter cries out about how her mother should be there more for her. Perhaps if this were a REAL case of child-neglect, this may be ok. But this kid was just a selfish brat who needs to find better ways to get over minor issues.   I really hope kids won't think its ok to throw hissy fit next time they discover their parents had to go out.   The next character is perhaps the most insulting to the 'real world'. Raven makes an occasional comment to this character about how trashy their fashion looks (and yes, their fashion looks perfectly fine actually).  Later in the film we realise that our 'trashy' girl is actually an orphan living in a poor foster home. It's a good idea; however, this girl looks NOTHING like a real 'poor' girl. Perhaps a 'money isn't everything' moral would have fitted nicely here, but instead we're handed the perfect fix: Get your rich friends to buy your clothes.  The forth character I won't comment on as I can't remember anything significant about her.  The process of becoming pop-stars of course, is very unrealistic, aside the sell-out factor and the lip-syncing.  'The cheetah girls' are torn between following their original dream or selling-out just to get the exposure. Their friendship hangs on the line because of this as Raven refuses to compromise.  We are given a few inspiring quotes from other characters about which road Raven should take on this matter, then its all up to the wonderful climax to do the rest.  The climax. Toto has fallen in a hole and has got dirty (horrifying experience for a dog bearing a perly white coat)  Poor Raven is so frantic, this is obviously the worst kind of tragedy that could happen in life. God forbid we learn anything realistic like the death of a family member or even of this poor little pooch. Perhaps in that case we'd even had the President of the United States turning up to comfort Raven, but no, it's just a dirty dog stuck in a hole, it only calls for the whole neighbourhood, police, fire fights and the local television news crew. Such a tragedy can only resolve in the reconciled friendship of 'the cheetah girls'.  And there we have it. Entertainment... maybe. Any benefits otherwise, I would personally hope NOT, as they're not the kind of things I would like to see in kids and teenagers these days.  Normally, If this film was aimed at a higher audience (ha) I wouldn't see as much of a problem with it. But this was a Disney film... you know, the ones that are meant to be inspiring to kids, or at least teach them some values in life? This just gave us an insight to Disney's own greedy mind. 
 The most interesting idea to come from this book is the evolved state of a dinosaur species, which subsequently was eliminated via a meteor impact. The idea of dinosaurs evolving as Baxter proposed has a lot of potential grist, yet Baxter eliminates this possibility with the meteor impact.  Too sad the high point of this evolution story ended early on.  Still, I'm a Baxter fan, here looking for more of his work 
 The index in the version I have is completely inaccurate.  What's more, to obtain errata you're required to enter a code on the publisher's website.  This code is not stamped on the book but is on the packaging which I unfortunately threw away before I noticed the index was completely inaccurate.    Save yourself the headache and get a different version 
 I was very disappointed with this product...be Warned this is not the movies it is only the special features of them 
 I don't want to bash this book or its publisher, but someone needs to make some changes. I also made the mistake of thinking this book was the book from the PBS show Kid Concoctions as did my sister. I'm sure many others are doing the same. This book is not bad, the problem is that it is very upsetting feeling that you were tricked into buying a knock off. Even if it isn't a knock off, that is the perception many of us have. Not to mention the fact that my kids could not make any of the project they saw on TV with this book. I suggest the publisher change the name to someting more original.  Just my thoughts 
 I just bought the latest model the 5000 and the machine is good but the price is quoted wrong. According to the Manager of Vitamix they add tax at all times so the price you see is not the price they charge at vitamix. If you go through ANY vender they always add extra claiming tax. So if you authorize the price they will attach tax in addition to it. Check your statement when / if you still choose to order. You will have to call your credit card company. 
 Firstly, it took two poeple to write this uninspiring book? Nowhere on the back does it state this is a Christian Chick Lit book.   Basically I cannot finish this book because the character is such a dork. One of the authors graduated from Baylor, so that explains the Christian theme, but come on! Drinking is not a sin! I guess my Catholic alcohol infused upbringng just can't relate to teetotaling Baptist types. I'll pass, now hand me a glass of wine... I'm moving on to read Smashed instead 
 This book is an obfuscation rather than an elucidation of Wong's films. If you use the word "teleological" frequently and think the following fragment from one sentence makes sense--"...because of the messages encoded in the ambivalence of the film's 'linguistic structure' - ambivalence that arises from the 'insertion of history (society) into a text and of this text into history' as Kristeva defines it..."--, then you will probably love this book.   Having recently discovered the films of Wong Kar-wai, I wanted a book that would tell me about him, his ways of working, and that would discuss his films in a way that would be meaningful to a reasonably well-education person who does not and did not work in academia. Because this book does have some of this information buried within it, I can't trash it completely. But, I will call it pretentious, pseudo-intellectual B.S. And, I will certainly avoid any more writings by Mr Teo.  Amazon's physical description of the paperback is filled with errors. The book is 191 pages rather than 212 pages. The publisher is the British Film Institute and not the University of California Press. The listed dimensions are wrong. Also, the subtitle listed by Amazon does not appear on the book's cover or title page.   If you must have a book on Wong Kar-wai, then go ahead and buy this. You will get a small amount of useful information and a filmography. The price is inexpensive enough to justify the purchase. 
 This is not the translation by Arthur Waley (which is very good) but the one by D.C. Lau. Since Lau's translation was first published, a number of advances have been made in the field of Warring States Period scholarship which render a fair amount of the supporting material obsolete (see "The Original Analects" by Brooks and Brooks for the latest). As for the translation itself, it's rife with awkward and mystifying word choices -- for instance, in a passage in chapter 11 in which the disciple Zilu (Tzu-lu, in Wade-Giles romanization, which Lau uses) gets the better of Confucius in an argument, Waley translates the Master's retort, "It is remarks of that kind that make me hate glib people," and the Brookses and Huang Chichung make similar choices; but Lau renders it, "It is for this reason that I dislike men who are plausible." Similar mishandlings of connotation appear throughout the book. For an old-fashioned translation, Waley's is a hundred times better 
 I know this seems a little OCD but I was looking up some things at the patent office and also at the US copyright office and this book does not have a copyright. odd 
 Misleading Title- This book covers only designs from Keramic Studios. No depth and no inspiration. I would rate it 0 stars. A waste of money and in  the trash it goes 
 This book was so dry and so boring. It was very clinical. I was hoping for a list of the sypmtoms of candidiasis and some helpful suggestions on how to control the condition. Most of the book was not helpful or useful to me. 
 The ice ring used to keep the salad cold burst the first time I put it in the freezer!  Evidently, the plastic did not allow for adequate expansion when the gel froze, so the seam burst and the liquid dripped out when it thawed!  In addition to that, my soup was luke warm at lunchtime 
 I would have followed the intended emotional path had I not also done some research of other sources. Americans are quick to punish themselves now days without really getting the facts.I suggest reading "Dishonoring  America" by Lilian Baker,or make an internet visit to the San Franciso  Museum website for actual, unaltered information 
 I was a little disappointed with this film. I know the name, and a fair amount of the material, but was hoping to gain some insight to the Man. Got some, but not much. Maybe a bit too esoteric for the curious. Much of the information was glossed over. There is mention of "The Lion King", and Prima's influence on contemporary rock n' roll, but there is never any further exploration of these topics. I wanted to know the thought process behind the deadpan delivery of Keely Smith's on-stage persona, as well as a host of other things, but was left high and dry... This is probably common knowledge to the fan "in the know". However, for the rest of us... The footage is fantastic, but I never felt I really got to know Louis Prima, or even his work, really. Isn't that the point? 
 I received this book as a gift, and found it unreadable. For example, EFS says cost/benefit analysis "is a procedure by which the higher is reduced to the level of the lower and the priceless is given a price". This is meaningless rhetoric to me. It also assumes that only economics provides a guide to human behavior. Or that all economic analysis is totally rational. Schumacher questioned every assumption of "economic science" using theories from the anarchist tradition. Schumacher claimed neocolonialism is the result of politics, not economic principles. But doesn't class and sectional interests drive politics? His advocacy of a search for inward spiritual space, and a rejection of the real world of politics and economics, makes this book part of the problem and not part of the solution.  The 'Introduction' says Gandhi wanted to use "labor-intensive manufacture and handicrafts" (p.5). Milovan Djilas said it was important for newly liberated countries to use mass production ("The New Class"). The historical record over the past centuries should tell you who was right or wrong. Liberating revolutions result in more production and other benefits for the people; else they're not liberating. Unlimited economic growth overlooks the availability of basic resources and the capacity of the environment. But there's always some natural problem that causes a correction.  This is a very verbose book whose arguments rest on unquestioned assumptions. Since it was published in 1973 Thatcher's regime destroyed Britain's coal industry to make them dependent on imported oil and gas. We've seen what happened after they divided and privatized the railroads. But who benefited from these political decisions?   Part II Chapter 3 notes that western Europe "deliberately destroyed nearly half of their coal industries". But the economy in neocolonialist countries will always suffer to benefit the imperialist ruling country. American was a net petroleum exporter until 1967, and influenced Saudi Arabia and Iran (just like Great Britain did previously). You can also consider the actions of Jimmy Carter against nuclear reactors. France and Japan use nuclear power, they have no oil. Saudi Arabia uses nuclear power so they can profitably sell their oil abroad. Those who criticized this book showed good judgment and wisdom. You can read this book and judge its worth for yourself. 
 Looks like Robert Sabbag couldn't let his sucess with Snowblind be.  This book just sucks.  I know Allen Long and his story is true, the smuggling, the four years as someones maid in prison but Robert Sabbag just got sloppy with this one.  He tried to take a mediocre story and make it into something interesting; didn't work 
 Though I love Brother Cadfael, this story was most tedious and far-fetched.  I couldn't believe that this young woman would do what she did for a man she hardly knew, and the conclusion drags out too long and  elaborately, once you realize who she is.  I've read worse books, but after  the true excellence of most of the other Cadfael novels, this one was a  strange, sad let-down 
 This film is just like the The Sixth Sense film.  Both films have the same borring plot.  THE BORRING PLOT. In the two movies they have 2 boys who can see and speak to ghosts and in the 2 movies there are 2 teenagers girls who are ghosts who want help and showing the boy and man the people who had kill them.  After the boy and the man shows and tells other people who has killed the 2 teenagers, the two teenager girls ghosts are happy and they are at pease at last.   The Sixth Sense and this film is deserve to be seen only one time and after that you dont want to see again.  If you are like me and love ghosts who are bad and evil and kills people, you will love 13 Ghosts.  That film is what I called a good ghost film 
 I purchased this skin to accompany my daughter's new mp3 player.  We managed to tear the skin first thing out of the box even though we were being careful, or so we thought.  I expected higher durablity 
 Okay this is starting to piss me off, why the heck are there so many anime imitations coming out? Its so freakin annoying!!!!!!  The people who made this think they can do anime but they cant.  The charcaters are lame, the story is totally cliche'd and the voiceacting is horrible.  The thing that makes me mad is the fact that true authentic anime like Inu Yasha, Cowboy Bebop,  and Akira, are totally shunned by much of the american public, while this crap is considered great.  It's totally unfair, americans just can't do anime, they try but they cant, so they should stop trying!!! 
 be prepared that most of (but not all of) the stories are fantasy (made up lands and places or dream, etc), and not realistic....probably a lovely collection if that's what you're looking for.  also, mine was bound up-side-down and backwards....anyone elses?? 
 Ridiculous, convoluted and unresolved plot with main characters that have become predictable and boring.   Did Cornwell even write this one herself? If so, she missed a glaring discrepancy when she proofread: On page 216 Marino remembers Mrs. Paulsson greeting him at the door "wearing jeans and a soft pink sweater", but later when he tells Scarpetta what happened during his visit to the house he describes her as having worn black books and a camouflage shirt when she opened the door.  Perhaps it was the author's attempt to let readers think Marino only imagined the pink sweater scenario because he was too ashamed to remember what really happened. However, to this reader it comes across simply as a mistake the author forgot to go back and correct 
 I was deeply dissapointed in this lens hood.  Given that the cost is about 10% of the cost of the lens for which it was intended (the 70-300 IS in this case) I expected it to be of stiff durable polycarbonate.   -Positives- fulfills the basic function of a lens hood- prevents flare, etc.  The bayonet locking system is excellent, much easier to deal with than scew-on type lens hoods.  that's about it.  -Negatives- The polycarbonate is so thin I half expect it to be translucent.  The hood must be gripped by the base to remove it, as grippng the thin end of the hood may break it; or at least it feels like it may break it.  Its very long.  Especially on the 70-300 which is already a long lens, this makes a fully extended zoom about a foot long.  That's pretty conspicuous.  It's very overpriced vs. generic lenses ($50 vs. $5-10 for rubber or metal).   I traded it in and went with a kalt rubber lens hood.  2 stars for the great bayonet design, but the rest of it is weak 
 This is a pathetic, shallow movie that insults person's intelligence. It is quite anti-semitic, by showing Jews not the way they are, but the way Jew-haters want to see them: as heartless bullies, obsessed with vengeance. The scene of an Israeli Mossad agent killing an Arab man on the street in Turkey before the eyes of his wife and little son elicits sympathy for the victim. We have been told that this was a Hamas leader, but this does not get much emphasis in the movie. The effect would be very different, if they would show first mass murder of innocent Jews done by such types as this Hamas leader. In this the movie is very manipulative. All three Mossad agents shown in the movie are caricature-like, made very cruel and unattractive. It is emphasized that the motivation for Mossad is vengeance and inability to forgive, but the truth is the vengeance is not a main motivation for Jews, but justice is.  If those Hamas murders are left alive, they will cause many more murders, and it is immoral to let them live. As to the part of the movie showing the pursuit of an old ex-nazi, it is totally stupid and unrealistic, and again vengeance is wrongly emphasized as motivation.  To sum up, this is a sad and un-artistic creation of degenerate secular Israeli culture, done by people without any healthy self-respect and any knowledge about their rich, beautiful and eternal Jewish tradition, which always did and still provokes hate from enemies of civilization 
 I was so happy when I found these shoes, they are cute and comfortable, exactly what I was looking for. BUT after about two weeks of wearing them, always with socks or pantyhose, they started to smell terrible. I don't have this problem with any of my other shoes. This was SO disappointing, I will either try to return them or just trash them.  
 The book Gemba-Kaizen is somewhat disappointing if you have read the book 'Kaizen' already. It gives not much new information. The only new idea in  the book is the attention given to the 'Gemba', the place where the  processes are performed. Imai is right to stress the importance of the  Gemba for operational excellence and he gives some nice tools and examples  to illustrate the Gemba's importance. However, only one nice idea is  somewhat poor to fill a whole book. The major message of the book can be  told just as well in an articel of no more then 4 pages 
 I was ready to like this book. I wanted to like this book. I'm interested in this particular era and the author has a fine reputation for the historical novel. So I began reading with great anticipation - only to discover deep disappointment. I haven't read his other works but he really strikes out with this one.  The idea is an interesting one - intertwine the story of Marconi, the inventor of wireless telegraphy with a famous murder case in which the wireless figures prominently.  The problem is the author seems to have lost all his understanding of dramtic writing - character development (there is none), tension (there is none, we know the outcome before the book starts), Plot (plodding), Pacing (the author gives away the wireless tie-in during the first chapter, so there is no mystery at all - no dramatic announcements by the keen and stalwart detective at the last moment to surprise and delight the reader).  These historic, naturally dramatic events are presented as if we were reading a dreadfully boring history book. And there is no dialogue at all! We only hear from the characters when the author dryly quotes from their letters. Rather then letting the characters speak for themselves and tell their own story, the author lectures us on all that happens. Historically more accurate perhaps but it makes for dull and dreary reading.  The murderer, Dr. Hawley Crippen, is so shockingly inept that one wonders  how the man was able to tie his own shoes. He is so stupid that he can not devise of a simple cover story to explain his wife's disappearance (like she ran off with another man, for example) He allows his girl friend to wear his wife's easily identifiable jewelry and furs - right in his own office! Does he imagine no one will notice? He even sends his flunky out to buy several suits of boy's clothing - all but telegraphing his intent to flee with his girlfriend disguised as a boy.  When its not being a dry-as-dust history book, this tome is like reading a stuffy newspaper article in the Times of London. A nasty twit killed his wife and was caught (yawn).  I gave the book two stars rather then one because at least the parts about Marconi and his struggles to perfect and commercialize his invention are somewhat interesting.  I would recommend it only if you are waiting in the dentist's office and there was absolutely nothing else to read (and you found it sitting there).   In summary: a depressingly dull and boring book. Don't waste your hard earned money on this one 
 This book provides a very simplistic view of the sociological ramifications of the Rolling Stones.   One or two of the other online reviewers correctly state that this book provides a very limited view of the Stones, in that Watts and Wood seem to be mostly "yes men," and no one who would contest Mick and Keith are given a voice.  Where are Bill Wyman, Mick Taylor, Marianne Faithfull, Anita Pallenberg et al.?   Way too much space is devoted to the period after 1972.  I couldn't care less about their disco period, the 80s, etc.  Half of the book involves Ron Wood who is, at best, a mediocre guitar player.  One chapter is entitled "The New Kid" (referring to Wood).  Barf.  The majority of the book should have focused on '62-'72.  I suppose the Stones feel obligated to talk about such garbage as "Dirty Work", but it's only to make those later pieces seem more important than they were.  Ron Wood wrote many of the songs on "Dirty Work".  What does that tell you about his ability?   The multitude of photographs point to the fact the rock and roll is mostly a visual phenomenon these days (probably caused by the Stones!).  Substance is not as important as attitude, looks, and for lack of a better word "coolness".  It's sad to see less intellectual content and more filler from the people who gave us "Gimme Shelter", "Satisfaction", "Dead Flowers", etc. After just seeing the documentary "Gimme Shelter," it becomes painfully obvious that the Stones were probably washed up as early as 1970.  Ironically, it may have been Mick Taylor (who is trashed by everyone interviewed) who kept them going musically for the next few years.  I'm not sure if it's true but I read that many of the tracks for "Exile on Main Street" were written during the sessions for "Let It Bleed".  Interesting.   Is it possible that Keith's drug problems completely ruined the band and that they couldn't come up with new, good material after he became addicted to heroin in `69?  None of this is explored.  In fact, no topic is approached with the level headedness you would hope for from men in their 60s.   Consideration is given to whether Wood or Jagger wrote "It's Only Rock and Roll."  It's like arguing over who deserves credit for picking Eagleton as McGovern's running mate.        Even with his loyalty to the bosses, Watts provides reasonably interesting material.  Mick Jagger's sections are a total waste, just pathetic in terms of providing insight.  I'm convinced after reading this book and seeing "Gimme Shelter" that Mick Jagger has the mind of a child.  Keith basically goofs around.  This shouldn't come as a shock if you have seen any footage from the `60s where Richards' PR consisted of him sticking his tongue out at a camera.   "Stone Alone" by Wyman is a quantum leap above this book, although in fairness to "According to the Rolling Stones", this is really a children's book and shouldn't be compared to Wyman's serious effort.  
  This movie is one long journey to absolute nothingness. Sometimes my favorite parts in movies are the quiet one's. Movies with great moments of silence are great if they're necessary. Unfourtunately, while i appreciated the quiet introspection, i could not tolerate a whole movie like that. I will say Morvern Callar has a great opening, one that makes you wonder. The rest though is just...boring. I appreciated nothing else, and found it empty. Nothing was gained or lost, or learned.I cant recommend this to any one, unless you have to see every movie ever made 
 Like others, I have read the whole Goldy Bear Culinary Mystery series and I have enjoyed each book...until now.  This book is slow to start and as I am only on page 100 after a week, hasn't picked up speed yet.  I can't get past Goldy wallowing in her sorrow.  Granted, I have never tripped over a dead body only to find out that it was my neighbor, but enough is enough already.   As another reader mentioned, there are a few disjointed parts for example, at one point Marla is driving Goldy to pick up Arch and Gus.  A couple of paragraphs later, Goldy is turning into the parking lot...but I thought Marla was driving???  I hope that this book was a fluke and Diane Mott Davidson will come back with a mystery of the same caliber that all of her fans have come to expect and enjoy 
 In this work, Bhagwati offers valid arguments for globalization.  He is takes some of the strongest criticisms of globalization and is able to find fault in them, and at the same time, declares the benefits of a globalized economy. However, one need not read the entire book to find out Bhagwati's views.  Bhagwati's stance on globalization is almost so extreme that he instinctively and automatically comes to the defense of globalization without providing a fair analysis.  As a Harvard professor, I would assume him to provide more academic and holistic defenses and criticisms.  However, his book is an easy read and one that opens the reader to arguments for and against globalization whether s/he has previous knowledge of globalization or not 
 This book irritated me on many levels; not that the writing was poor or the plot weak. In fact, the plot, the premise, the writing were good--unfortunately the characters didn't pull it off or keep me interested because they were all kinda indifferent or unlikable.  I read somewhere the number one reason people keep reading a work of fiction--regardless of plot--is because they care about someone in the book.   In this book, I was hoping they would all drown by the end of the story...  
 I loved the Little House books as a girl, and actually just read the last in the series this week.  I started with The Long Winter, and ended with this book, as I recently purchased the set of nine books for my children.    I wish that I had not read this book!  The entire book is depressing.  I feel that it spoils the lovely ending in These Happy Golden Years.  Yes, we can't help wanting to know what happens to Laura after she is married.  However, I really wish this book was published separately, as it really does not go with the set. None of her other books are depressing!  There is always happiness in the other books, even in the face of challenges.   As another reviewer stated, this book begins by re-telling the wedding proposal, but it contradicts the version in These Happy Golden Years.  Also, the overall voice of the writer is not the same as the other books.  There are also parts that are confusing, and not well written.  It is a fact that Wilder did not edit this for printing, and it is obvious that she did not intend to publish this. After only a few pages I really felt that she didn't even write it, that is how different it is 
 The music on this album is performed so exquisitely; the orchestrations so subtle and yet illuminating, that one is almost tempted to forget what a "What for?" musical this is.   Donna Murphy plays the title character of Fosca, a hugely unprepossessing woman who suffers from more maladies than there are stars in the sky. She lives in a remote miltary outpost where she falls in love with the handsome, virile Giorgio. Giorgio in turn is having a torrid affair with the beautiful, but vapid Clara, a married woman back home. However from the time Giorgio comes into Fosca's sphere, she becomes this relentless succubus in her pursuit of him. She shows up EVERYWHERE he happens to be; her ferocity matched only by her inexhaustive capacity for self-pity. To depict Fosca musically, Sondheim comes up with the most monochromatic score of his career. Everything is SO lugubrious, dark, portentous, tragic; punctuated by militaristic strains (with snare drums)because the soldiers like to...umm...march.  In the end, Giorgio is worn down enough by Fosca's attentions that he succumbs. He believes he has fallen in love with her, shortly after which she...dies.  As I mentioned earlier, the material is beautifully performed (Marin Mazzie and Jere Shea render the opening "Happiness" with a marvelous sense of delicacy and sensuality. Donna Murphy evokes the proper pathos in the haunting "Loving You."), but you come away wondering what the point of it all is. If Sondheim is trying to show us how love is largely a chronic disease, then he succeeds admirably 
 The Lando Calrissian Adventures (1983.) A collection of three short Lando Calrissian stories, written by L. Neil Smith in 1983.   INTRODUCTION:  The Empire Strikes Back introduced a classic character into the Star Wars universe - Lando Calrissian. Although Lando got a bad rap from fans at first for selling out Han Solo in Empire, he redeemed himself in Return Of The Jedi, assisting in the destruction of the second Death Star. However, like many Star Wars characters, Lando's past remained a great deal mysterious. To try to clear up some details about Lando's past prior to his movie experiences, L. Neil Smith wrote three short stores in 1983. And in recent years, those stories were combined into a book entitled The Lando Calrissian Adventures. Are Lando's past exploits some of the finest Star Wars stories around, or are they the black sheep of the Star Wars Expanded Universe? To find out, continue reading.   OVERVIEW:  Essentially, these stories follow a young Lando Calrissian, back before he lost the Millennium Falcon to a younger Han Solo in that fateful Sabacc game. Through an odd twist of fate and the threats of outside authorities, Calrissian is forced to go on a quest to a distant world to retrieve an ancient artifact with incredible powers. Along the way, he encounters strange locales and even stranger natives. The latter two stories expand on the events told in the first.   REVIEW:  Ugh... This is, without question, THE WORST STAR WARS EXPANDED UNIVERSE NOVEL I HAVE EVER READ. You'll notice I rarely give less than three stars to Star Wars novels, so to get two stars, Smith really must have screwed up. Sure enough, he did. These stories are just plain WEIRD. They don't even feel like Star Wars stories, and in many cases, it seems that Lando has a totally different personality than the guy we knew and loved in the movies. The stories are bizzare and drag on for far too long. Usually I can't put down a Star Wars novel, but had to FORCE myself to read this one. Every Star Wars novel I have read that existed prior to 1991's Heir To The Empire that isn't a movie adaptation is NOT worthwhile. But even Splinter Of The Mind's Eye, Alan Dean Foster's awkward story from 1978, kills The Lando Calrissian Adventures dead. I can not recommend this novel to anyone, except for those trying to read every last Star Wars novel - and even THEY should consider avoiding this one.   EDITION NOTES:  This book has been reissued a few times over the years, and it is still readily available in nearly all bookstores. If you want to read it (not sure why you would, though), it shouldn't be too tough to find. And if you can't find it in stores, there are plenty of online stores that carry it.   OVERALL:  The Lando Calrissian Adventures fails like no other Star Wars novel before or after has failed. L. Neil Smith takes the galaxy far, far away to new lows with these pathetic excuses for adventures. Of course, I have to cut him some slack since this WAS 1983, and the Expanded Universe hadn't really taken off yet. That's why he gets a sympathy star in my rating. My final verdict is simple - avoid this book like the plague. Even die-hard Lando fans are bound to be disappointed. If you're interested in a young Lando, read A.C. Crispin's Han Solo trilogy. He appears in those stories, and in much better ways, too. So just buy them instead. 
 how all yall fools gonna come up in here calling this trash gangsta.. Kali is where the real ridas live and die notthe dirty.. DIRTY... south or the LEAST coast.. everyone since the mid 90's has bitten the west coast and this is no exception.. tha frontlinerz have a track called ''gangsta in me'' and they put it right on these so-called gangsta's callin themselves trap ni66az.. this is a joke.. like everything else and whoever said this isnt commercial.. give it up.. this record is sitting on wal-marts shelves!!! i heard this and had one serious laugh.. boyz n da hood... another example of how you suckers bite the west.. 
 I couldn't find any good reading material, so I read Bloods instead. That was a big mistake. This was possibly the worst written piece of literature I have ever had the misforture to read. The book was repetitive, the underlying theme was a crock, and the book was more of a colorful adventure novel than an oral history. All in all, it was a terrible book 
 I could sum up this book very quickly:  1) Trust in God for everything  2) Read the Bible  3) Attend church  4) Ask your husband, church, other Christians for help  The book is full of fluffy ideas like: "We need to know ourselves the way God knows us" "Find a Christian counselor" and advice for single mothers to simply attend church if seeking help.  The book primarily revolves around the Bible and its interpretation of parenting. Why not cut out the middle-man and just read this "wonderful book?" It's not like the Bible is a work in progress.   This book is more about proselytizing and keeping Evangelicals reading "inspired" books rather than competing viewpoints. And with America being one of the most pure Christian nations in the world ( US is more Christian than India is Hindu and Israel is Jewish ). Anything published by Zondervan should be looked at skeptically.   I also dislike how males are stilled deemed unworthy parents in the Christian community. They can assist and help , but cannot be considered primary parents. But given this books lack of true substance, I doubt it would have made any difference 
 I like Gene, not one of my faves, but he had a great style ("Race with the Devil," "Cat Man," "Be Bop A Lula," "Day The World Turned Blue," etc. But even hardcore fans will strain to find the gold in some of these grainy, blurred takes. Some of the perfomances leave something to be desired as well. For the price, I felt burnt. Check out The Screaming End on CD and read the bio Race With The Devil while grooving to the tunes.. 
 This is a very interesting book on Hermes centered Egyptian-Greek religious practice in the pre-Christian era, much more illumination than the mere reading of mythologies. However the writing of it is unfortunate. The author fills, not just each page, but each paragraph with 1960's cliché and psychobabble that was popular with hip academia of the day. It is a trip back in time to read this now archaic speech.  This book deserves 4 or 5 stars except for its unreadability. It is difficult and arduous reading, as I found myself having to parse each sentence to extract it's meaning. I could only keep it up for short periods of time and hope to be able to finish the book someday. If only the publishers were to have the book rewritten by someone with a broader writing ability, this book would be an invaluable addition to anyone's library with an interest in Egyptian-Greek pagan religion as practiced in that era.  Even with the books faults, the subject matter is so interesting that it may be worth the trouble for the hardy 
  Reading Dark Harbor is like watching a mediocre TV show that you can't be bothered to turn off. I listened to Dark Harbor as an audio book, so I don't feel too badly about wasting my time on it because I `read it' while I was doing other things that had to be done anyway, like driving.   If you are looking for something that feels fresh and new - Dark Harbor is not for you. This novel is about as innovative as an episode of Murder She Wrote. To illustrate: Stone Barrington and his cronies quickly deduce that an apparent suicide must have been a murder because the gun was found in the victim's wrong hand. (I think I actually saw that one on Murder She Wrote) Woods either can't be bothered to come up with a new idea or he simply doesn't care.   It is clear early on who is responsible for the murders in Dark Harbor. This isn't because the clues come together in any logical way, but rather because of the predictable nature of the novel. You can just tell. This doesn't mean that the solution makes sense. In fact, there are huge inconsistencies in the plot that make the ending feel forced.   It is as if Woods couldn't be bothered to think all of his plot lines through. Woods is compelled to include his regular characters in the novel even though they have little to do (except of course, to have sex with Stone). Holly barely says a word on her first trip to the island. On her second trip she has an obligatory romp with Stone and then gets kidnapped for the remainder of the novel.   Why was she kidnapped? I don't think anyone - including Woods - can answer that question in any plausible way. My theory is that Woods needed to work Holly into the plot and decided that putting her in peril would allow him to fill a few pages. It also allowed him to include Holly's dad (another regular character) in her search. Wood's motive seems obvious. The kidnapper's motive however isn't - her kidnapping makes no sense. But clearly this was something Woods didn't think was worth worrying about.   The best I can say about this novel is that it is a quick easy read (of course, in my case it was read to me). It may not be worth the time and trouble to actually read (and certainly not to buy) - but as an audio book from the library (with a limited selection of audio books to choose from) it helped me pass the time in traffic.   
 This guy is a pop music clown who ruins careers. OLP have no business working with him and the result shows. OLP is way out of Ballards league and I have no idea why they would limit themselves to his naive view of pop music. Perhaps OLP wanted to have a sell-out sound, otherwise this disc is a disaster. Somewhere out there is pure disposable pop. None of this material would be on "Happiness" or "Spiritual Machines" How can you go from a concept album from a Ray Kurzveil book to a horrible Glen Ballard. over produced, pop record 
 I don't think the authors have ever worked.  The book seems very fluffy and theoretical.  Look elsewhere for a practical ethics resource 
 Let's face it: When you want to get started you don't sit down, read through 800 pages, then get to it.  What you really do is read a little, skimming what you really need to get started. When you need to know something, you look it up.  There's the rub.  Unfortunately, ALL of these books suffer from the problem of having a very bad index.  I know the index spans many pages, however, I have seldom found ANYTHING I wanted by looking it up under the obvious heading.  For that matter, often the subject is not to be found anywhere in the index at all.  Which means it either isn't covered in the book, or it can not be found easily.  The "9 in 1" books thing sounds good, until you realize that there is not necessarily an integrated approach to really teaching the whole of Access and the relationship between its parts.  The real problem is that Access is layered on top of 3 'languages' (VB, SQL, and Macros) and has different ways of getting things done for its three main parts (Queries, Forms, and Reports).  (And VB even supports 2 different object models, DAO and ADO.) It is often unlclear how all these different areas interact.  They can interact together easily, but why is a function spelled one way in an expression, a different way in VB and again different in SQL?  There ought to be a cross reference table translating between them.  Or when can you nest aggregate functions and when can't you?  Much of what Access is secretly doing is translating your groupings and expressions into SQL with Unions and inner/outer-joins or what not.  None of this inner working is explained, leaving you clueless when Access refuses to do what it thinks you want to do.  Yes, Access is a confusing product owing to the way different parts were cobbled together.  But it can also be very easy to do certain things, like turning a report's groupings inside out.  Some of these things are explained in this book, but most are not.  A comprehensive index would be a start, but they would of course need the text to go with it.  You'll have better luck finding specific information by searching on the internet.  I have found many great and helpful web sites, but I still haven't found any one book on MS Access that comes close to really explaining it properly.  And none with an even decent index.  It sounds great to read on a book's jacket that it will cover VB or XML or web stuff, but the important stuff is often overlooked. 
 In Refuse To Choose, Barbara Sher badly confuses two very real but very different problems: the inability of some people to finish any project they start, and the shame dumped by family and friends on people who pursue many diverse passions in life.  The book rightly dismisses that misguided shame thrust on people with ecclectic interests, and in doing so may be very helpful and encouraging to an otherwise successful person who meets that description.   But for people who are unable to bring any project to completion, the book offers little useful advice, and several suggestions that are likely to make the problem worse instead of better.  Instead of explaining how to complete projects and escape from the traps that prevent them from being completed, the opening chapters dismiss the value of completing any project we start - an assertion even this book can't support for very long.  In the closing chapters of the book, Sher gives exactly the same advice that anyone else would: pick one project and see it through to the finish, ignoring all others.  And that's a reasonable suggestion, but it leaves most readers right back where they started.   In one particularly ill-conceived passage, Sher encourages overwhelmed parents to set aside parental responsibilities in favor of other priorities; she gives the example of feeding the kids cereal for dinner instead of going through another day's shopping routine, and asking the children to help out with an important business report instead of working on it privately.  On the surface, this sounds reasonable: why let drudgery sap away any more creative energy?  But a deeply misguided philosophy of parental and personal responsibility lies underneath this type of suggestion.  The children in this scenario learn that it is their responsibility to solve the parent's problems, and they also learn that eating properly and other such "adult" behaviors are ultimately unnecessary.  The parent in this scenario learns that the sound parental decision-making is unimportant - and then the parent wonders why the adolescent child shows no ability to make good decisions.  There are good ways for a parent to maintain a reserve of creative energy, but this ain't one of them.   Some of the ideas in the book are useful.  It is indeed a good idea to put aside others' negative judgments of our many exciting projects, and to find encouragement by making lists of past accomplishments, and to keep a journal of creative ideas, and to occasionally abandon a project with the same enthusiasm with which it was launched.  But these are not new ideas: Julia Cameron's The Artist's Way covers the same territory with much greater insight and wisdom.  If you're looking to free yourself from your inability to complete any projects you start, get The Artist's Way, follow its program, and find out what the real problem is.  And keep pursuing your many interests - but do it to satisfy your deepest desires, not to distract yourself from them 
 it's surprising that so many people gave this book a favorable rating - did we read the same book? i found "purple hibiscus" a little to simplistic and childish for any accolades - there was no particular insight on any of the issues e.g. physical abuse, first love, teenage angst/rebellion - to speak of, and the political ranting towards the end is laughable. apparently, everyone that can write a few words is now styling themselves as political activists, i wonder where ms. adichie was during those tumultous times - enjoying the breeze well away from the conflict in london - and now she's spewing out all the stuff she probably heard from her parents. i doubt that any self-respecting nigerian - unless you're the type that thinks "mills and boons" are literary masterpieces - will find anything remarkable about this book. as for people who don't know anything about nigeria, or africa, i suggest you read chinua achebe, buchi emecheta, or wole soyinka (for the cerebral) to get a real flavor 
 Got this tea kettle for a gift recently.  It's discontinued on Amazon but they sell it at Home Goods for $ 24. 99.    PROS ~ * Asthetically pleasing (looks pretty) * Removable top for wide area to fill with water AND makes it easier to wash * Removable whistle (I can't stand the sound of a whistling tea kettle, so I remove the "plug")  CONS ~ * It'd be nice if the tea kettle had a flip up "plug" on the spout instead of the removable one (I'll lose it eventually, the other Le Creuset models have the flip up "plug" that opens with a press of the thumb) * The poor design of the spout is dangerous.  No matter how slowly I pour the boiling water (even with the small amount I use, only 4 or 6 ounces at a time), a few tablespoons of water "blub" out very quickly - sorry I can't think of a better descriptive word.  The spout opening is WAY too small, but the width of the spout itself allows more of a flow of water, so the first few tablespoons GUSH out.  So when you pour the water, do it as slowly as possible, put the mug on your counter or another surface that won't get ruined when wet, and don't hold onto your mug as you pour the water because the "blub" of boiling water will burn 
 Once again, Konstantinos has created a book on Goth culture that has little, if anything, to do with traditional occult themes. Readers expecting to find detailed, practical rituals will be sorely disappointed: instead of providing such information, Konstantinos fills this book with musings drawn from his obsessive interest in the Necronomicon and his reprobate New York City lifestyle. Furthermore, I doubt that many readers will have the time or resources available to attempt many of these stunts: rituals frequently call for the use of alcohol, drugs, Gothic sex partners, long, dark hallways, deserted beaches, basements to simulate a descent into Hades, etc. How Konstantinos' target audience of teenage/adolescent Goths are supposed to obtain such things is beyond me.  It is standard fare for a book on the occult to begin with circle casting techniques and basic methods of raising energy. Oddly, Konstantinos has discarded the techniques outlined in his previous books and devised weird new rituals to replace them. These involve lying down in the black of night, imagining a swirling mist of specters surrounding you, whispering at you, inhaling the vapors of said "whisperers," and trying to self-induce terror at the thought of suffocating on this mist. The circle casting that follows is then composed of little more than "pushing out" against the "whisperers" in the shadows. Interestingly, at each of the respective quarters Konstantinos has his readers alternately breathe against the outer edge of the circle, warm their hands and press, lick their fingertips and press, and fall upon their knees, but nowhere in the text does he explain the obvious elemental association of these acts as invoking (or attempting to invoke) air, fire, water and earth. The lack of such basic explanation puzzles me: Konstantinos surely must realize that his failure to explain the symbolism of the ritual to his readers will make the motions ineffective.  Now to the heart of the material: The first chapter of this book contains standard-issue, largely plagiarized material from Austin Osman Spare on sigil magick (to his credit Konstantinos makes a rare acknowledgement of the derivative nature of this section). Nothing new here, and this section seems strangely out of place for the rest of the book. Readers will be thankful, however, for its inclusion, because it is one of the few rituals that most anyone can perform successfully. The next chapter describes a standard-issue method of sex magick (repeating a commanding phrase to oneself at the height of orgasm). Nothing particularly new here, except that Konstantinos insists (contrary to his earlier Gothic Grimoire work) that one should perform this sort of work with a partner (which seems like a strange thing to concentrate on in the midst of shared passion, but therein lies the mind of Konstantinos).  Then the book goes straight downhill: Konstantinos advocates the use of alcohol, absinthe (illegal in the U.S.), and psychodelic drugs (illegal in the U.S. and most everywhere else) to aid in the performance of rituals. He follows this up with "Hadetic" magick, which is a fancy name for Greek psychodrama about a vision quest to Hades that seems lifted from Bulfinch's Mythology. Divination material is copied from his other texts (themselves copied from Cunningham's materials) on different forms of scrying, except Konstantinos also recommends use of blood in the scrying dish. Yuck. Then the most disturbing part of the book: a dance with a Gothic partner who pretends to be a corpse (which Konstantinos calls his "Dance of the Dead"). I kid you not! He even strongly suggests that sex should follow the Dance... very disturbing. Then he discusses random conversations he had with Lucifer while he was suffering from a BRAIN INJURY (I highly suspect that explains a lot of this book). Oh yeah, Lucifer is a great and brilliant guy, by the way, although the author will not share with the poor reader, Lucifer's brilliance (apparently the wisdom is just too personal, and potentially marketable for another title).  To wrap it all up, Konstantinos spends fully the last half of the book pontificating on the glories of the Necronomicon, and how it's been so wildly successful (the version he referenced was published in the 1970s) that it's created the very entities that Lovecraft invented out of his sick imagination seventy years ago. Oh, and this includes a Call to Cthulu ritual, the alien god creature bent on destroying the earth. Anyhow, I suppose this section is harmless enough, since everyone knows Lovecraft spun these monsters out of whole cloth. It's mainly filler material, and mainly demonstrates how nostalgic for his 1970s sci-fi youth Konstantinos was feeling when he wrote this part. All in all, I think this book is mostly devoid of new thoughts about the occult, generally reflects a disturbed worldview and mindset, and becomes vividly uninteresting in the last half. But on the bright side, it is an interesting psychological portrait of Konstantinos. Not worth the price of admission, but since it's the only thing to admire about the book, puts it slightly above the one star minimum 
 What in the world was Jax Peters Lowell thinking when she wrote Chapter 17, "Rx for Health"?  I cannot begin to express the fear and anxiety I felt when I saw Celebrex named as a drug that contains gluten.  I stopped taking it immediately and began searching for a gluten-free alternative.  I was so upset that all of my efforts as a celiac to live gluten-free were being undermined by my Celebrex.  I had thought it was gluten-free!  I found the website that Lowell mentions on page 394,  Glutenfree Drugs.com, hoping to find a gluten-free alternative pain medication.  Imagine my relief at seeing Celebrex on the list.  I contacted Pfizer....no gluten!  I Googled gluten and Celebrex.....NO Gluten!   There are many responsible guides for celiacs.  Lowell's book is certainly not one of them 
 Bad special effects as far as the model work goes.  Stupid love story that you have to fast forward through.  60s hairdos on what are supposed to be 1940s women.  It's just low budget and lame 
    Like the cheap piece of junk Grundig S350, reception capabilities are way over-blown, and like the S350, is way over-priced.. 
 I (...)like the previous person, was assigned this book for required reading. The SAT vocabulary used in the story is simple, 5th graders should be able to comprehend what these words mean. The plot is dull and insipid, and the author strains to use the SAT vocabulary, making the dialogue seem too unreal (no one that age uses those words in their daily vocabulary) and eventually taking away from the story, making it a hard and unhelpful read 
 This is,i belive,the worst "jazz" album i have heard in a while.Save your money 
 as much as I have been a lifelong fan of black moon and buckshot in general this album just lacked the ironically titled "chemistry"between buckshot and 9th Wonder.  The beats were a bit lackluster and boring and rides that razor thin line of boring and laid back with most of the beats raiding the boredom zone.  they are working on a part two so I hope they take their times to create something permament rather than something disposable as this album was.  
 the two stars i gave this turkey is for richard dawson as the running man host damon killian,he steals this movie and makes it his. using every gameshow trick he ever had dawson turns killian into the anti-gameshow host as he deals death and prizes out to the masses. richard dawson should have gotten an oscar nod for his funny and scarey turn in this otherwise waste of a movie. "let's play the feud,i mean the running man 
 If the Kranks really did what they set out to do and skip Christmas, that would have been a good story.  The end.   Instead, they end up having to scramble to try & make Christmas "happen" for their daughter unexpectedly coming home.  In other words - a typical stressful material holiday, instead of a celebration of friends, family, or even, gasp! Christ's birth.  I agree - if you don't want to celebrate Christ's birth, if you don't want presents and holiday decorations and family time - skip it.  Why torture yourself?    It would have been a good story if they did this.  Instead, the plot deteriorated into a very stupid, ridiculous and unrealistic dash to the finish line of "making Christmas happen."    A completely unsatisfying and unfunny read.  Threw it away so others wouldn't have the displeasure of reading it 
 Completey and utterly unfunny performances by Oldman and Roth. Stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not, having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen. We get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his much-touted play. Watching the first fifteen minutes of "heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads," is colossal torture, like status elipticus. It's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen. Having hopes it might pick up, that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever. A classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums. Don't take my word for it, watch it yourself and see. 
 First, despite what the socialist apologists tell you, Walter Rodney almost certainly was killed by a bomb he was holding in his lap while plotting to bust some co-conspirators out of prison.  Only afterwards did his fellow socialist party members concoct a story about exploding walkie-talkies.  Come on.  It exploded in his lap for goodness sake.  Mark Hoffman tried that defense and it didn't get him anywhere either.  Second, championing the cause of the poor, which Rodney admittedly did, is not the same as actually helping them, or even more important for HEUA, being a perceptive scholar.  Rodney's book is riddled with distortions, fallacies and unsubstantiated premises.  One glaring example.  Rodney pays practically zero attention to Mediterranean Africa.  For him, only sub-Saharan Africa is the "real" Africa.  Why?  Because his natural ethnic affinity for the area.  Nothing wrong with that, but then again, you shouldn't title your book "How Europe Underdeveloped Africa" but rather "How Europe Underdeveloped Sub-Saharan Africa." Rodney has engaged in thinly veiled racial rage and socialist dogma to rail against a bogeyman, a straw man, or almost anything other than the truth: Africa's problems arise from its residents, not from outside forces.  And spouting Marxist dogma isn't going to change that fact.  It was known 25 years ago; it's known a fortiori now 
 Step by step we are moving to the truth. The fiction is banal. Hence - one star for the book. The reality is amazing. Hence - 5 stars for the next book on the Ames-Colby case. The next book will be based on Dekov's memoirs 
 I thought that the story line would be cute. But it was lame, very under devloped, the charicters were boring, i didnt feel like I really got to know them or had any connection to them at all. And I felt like their tale of parenthood and so called love was very untrue and borning. I was waiting for the story to pick up and for Calvin and Frannie to have one of those moments were they were filled with passion and fell deep in love, but short of him introducing her to his stoner friends as the love of his life, that didnt happen. And OMG who names thier baby Lester? The story was borning, the whole book was dissapointing, so do yourself a favor and not buy this book, but something more along the line of Little Earthquakes by Jennifer Weiner 
 Okay, so to catch up on this exciting new series, I decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - Amazon Unbox!  I selected the first 10 episodes and hit Purchase.  Minutes later, I was watching the first episode, it came quickly, sounded great, and looked wonderful... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end.  Forgiveable, until... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video, making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing.  But, this IS a good concept... unfortunately, Amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality!  So, until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds... DO NOT try and download Season 1, Episodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7!!!  1, 3, 8, 9, and 10 were the only ones that were 100% complete for me 
 I just finished reading this from my local library.  As much as I love Mind over Matter and Robert Klein, this really isn't a funny book.  Maybe he didn't intend it to be, but with a title like that I thought it would be a lot more entertaining instead of blandly anecdotal.  It's really just one tale after another about women he slept with, in too much detail, or girls he fantasized about- again, too much information.  And the book ends abruptly before covering any of his success in the 70's, his political comedy, etc 
 This book is a huge disappointment.  Instead of discovering the history of a wonderful people, I found bigotry, racism, snobisness and intolerance.  At page 200 or so, and after many tries to warm up to this author with her narrow-minded and slanted views, I decided to just put it down and search for unbiased history in other sources. To readers who haven't visited the Balkans, I'd suggest save your money to actually travel there.  You won't be disappointed by the wonderful islands or it's people. 
 Poor singers, annoying sound effects in what some people call songs. Their voices are just auful at times, like a sqeaky old granma. God I hate this album 
 Big disappointment.  I expected this book to be hysterical.  Her sense of humor is certainly different!  Very shallow material. Marty Wurtz Author of Deceptions and Betrayal 
 The only redeeming points of this book are the few conversations that the author has with his uncle. The rest is just quotations from other books. There is enough original material here for about a chapter and a half. The author was set on making a book out of it so he just padded it with things that other authors had said.   I read it to the end though. Probably because the author has a very nice writing style. He is probably a good playwrite though I have never read any of his plays. He just didn't have enough material for a book here. I'm surpised it got published 
 Sheila Foster bit of from another book called C by Disection, she cant think for herself. She is too tough, but not though in the way you respect someone but rather insanely tough that makes you wonder what the purpose of all this is anyways. I currently have her in a class which is CECS 174, and she is totaly hard and difficult to understand. When she talks for a while she starts to get lazy and starts to slur her words. Don't be decieved by FALSE reviews, unless your a super school nerd you WONT like it. I hate her class, she should take a chill pill damn hyped up woman 
 I took all the advice given in this book and put it into immediate practice.  One year later, I can barely put food on my table.  Be very careful if you try to start your own store.  Keep your day job.  Most people lose money in this venture!  Be warned 
 This book is written by an annoying, weak man.  The formal innovations are vaguley interesting, but in any case do not rescue the work from its primary deficit: you must sit there for several hours with the voice of a neurotic chatty little wimp who reminds one of a certain kind of homosexual man streaming through your mind, mostly in the form of digressions and non-sequitors.  This is neither entertaining nor enlightening, and since it's the product of design it is actually a little infuriating.  I too listen with good faith to the academic hierarchy present and past for recommendations, and I had in my version the hitherto utterly reliable Frank Kermode as Introducer; but damn, this book - its characters, its plots, its language, its taxing convolusions - is just annoying.  Its only virtue is that reading it might raise awareness that vaguely condescending moralistic little works like this about unheroic, petty, neurotic, sordid, idle, superficially cosmopolitan people are a mistake to begin with, and - since we all have only 70 or 80 years on earth and aren't all compulsive aesthetes - time would be better spent elsewhere.  There is nothing of the hard Sophoclean light here 
 I also bought the hype of NYTimes Best Seller.  Goes to show you some people have really bad taste.  The story was promising and could have been exciting without the awful dialog.  It seems like the author was being paid by the word - too much repetition, entire scenes which added nothing to the story, etc.  I would NEVER purchase another book by this author.  Glad it's over and this ones in the trash can...  Charli 
 I hated this book for all the same reasons that the previous reviewer loved it.  Latour's voice changes add some depth to the story, but are done in a manner so convoluted that much of the substance is lost.  Using Aramis itself as the voice of martyred technology just becomes increasingly absurd throughout the book.  There are much better books than this out there about man's relationship with technology, do yourself a favor and find one of them 
 This is an okay general guide for beginners in home landscaping.  However, it is not particular to Texas, despite its title.  There are only about 30 pages devoted to plant material, and this is not covered in depth.  The text makes no real attempt to help gardeners select plant material suitable to the many different soil types and environments found in Texas 
 Everyone (or nearly everyone) seems to love this book. So, we tried it - and had a visceral negative reaction. We read to our daughter every day. I try hard to stop what I am doing and read to her when she comes toddling up with a book in her hands. For the sake of sanity, we've experimented with picture books, particularly rhyming picture books, but really anything with very brief text so we don't go completely mad with repetition. This is NOT behavior we wanted to introduce to our toddler daughter. That said, when she's older and able to understand that the pigeon's behavior is not to be emulated, we might give this another try. maybe 
 The book documents well the development of American coastal forts of what was known as the Third System.  These Civil War forts were impressive works built of stone and brick.  The drawings are excellent, but there are numerous historical errors in the details and several forts are mislabeled.   A revised edition would be appreciated and make this a 5 star work.   
 So I'm flipping through the book and thinking "Did I actually pay money for this?".  So many of the activities were things that I (and many other parents) are already doing with our babies.  Like playing with rattles, talking to your baby while looking in the mirror, kicking at toys, pointing to objects and saying the sounds they make, peek-a-boo, waving bye-bye... you get the idea. But the moment I knew I wanted to get my refund was when in the 0-3 months section, the author suggested going to the hardware store to buy a blank set of keys to put on a strong ring to "make great noise and be cool teethers".  The thought of my infant's delicate gums knawing away at the sharp edges of metal keys--YIKES! 
 This novel is narrated by a senior at an exclusive boys' boarding school, portrayed as the type of place where all of the students are hiding their true selves.  Those who are wealthy try desperately to hide that fact, and those who are on scholarship, as is the narrator, try even harder to hide their heritage.  As this story is told from the point of view of one character, it is impossible to determine if this is actually true, or if his fear of being exposed as a fraud clouds his vision of everyone else.  It is hard for me to believe that these boys are so disconnected from each other.  According to the narrator, nobody is really friends with anybody else, despite the fact that they have been living with each other for so many years.  No student has any real relationship with any other student.  What is real, is literature.  Writers are artists, who form their own social club and are therefore able to escape the boxes into which their heritage has forced them.  It seems every boy at school aspires to write, and once every semester the class is rewarded with a visit from a famous author.  These visits are paired with writing contests, in which boys submit a piece of writing in the style of the famous author.  The student whose writing is chosen by the visiting author is rewarded with a private audience with him or her--an unbelievable honor for the student.  The narrator of the book is desperate for one of these audiences, and devastated when his opportunity to interact with Robert Frost and Ayn Rand passes him by.  When he finds that Ernest Hemingway is to be the next visiting author, he is willing to do anything, even plagiarize a story he comes across in a literary magazine, to meet the famous man.  Some of the parts of this story are interesting, especially those focused on the visiting authors.  I particularly liked the passages about Ayn Rand and was delighted when a boy asked her, quite seriously, "Who is John Galt?" and received nothing but looks of utter loathing in response.  I also liked the responses of the authors to the works of the students.  The boys submitted very earnest bits of poetry or fiction that were terribly misinterpreted by the authors who judged them and read much more into them than the boys had ever anticipated or expected.  However, I didn't really connect with any of the characters, perhaps because the narrator of the story never got close to anyone.  He talks about his roommate and how the two of them lived together for years and kept seeming like they might become friends, but it never really happened.  In fact, the narrator, although friendly with many, seems to have no actual friends.  There is only one girl who might be a love interest in the story, but the narrator also has only minimal feelings for her.  In the end, this lack of interest for anyone in the story left me feeling rather uninterested in everything, as well. 
 This is a total waste of time in reading, Has no value for anyon 
 The 2002 version of the Star Wars core rulebook is an improvement over the original.  It upgrades some underpowered character classes, adds some breadth, and makes much-needed improvements to the very abstract and annoying vehicle operation system used in the 1999 rulebook.  Unfortunately, the central, crippling problem with the 1999 version remains:  the d20 system just isn't well-suited to Star Wars storytelling.  Playing this game is nothing like playing out a Star Wars story, and a lot like playing Dungeons and Dragons in space.  Star Wars is fast-moving, fluid, and dynamic, and not much concerned with power balance.  A kid fresh off the moisture farm can fight his way past elite enemy troops to save the princess, and one Sith Lord can arrange the downfall of the entire Jedi order.  Audacity and heroic (or villainous) attitudes matter more than experience and number-crunching.  Major characters rarely die, and then only if there's a strong dramatic reason for it.  Plotlines are loose and free-form.  A game based on Star Wars should reflect that.  By contrast, d20 is very cut-and-dried, and very regulated, and much too lethal.  Concepts like "level", "class", and "hit points" are fundamental to the d20 system, but are not very applicable to the Star Wars universe.  The system has a lot going for it, and it's great for Dungeons and Dragons, but here it's a case of trying to stuff a square peg into a round hole.  I prefer the West End Games "d6" version released in the late 1980s.  It has its flaws - it doesn't deal with very powerful characters as well as it might, and character creation could use some tuning (particularly for Force-sensitive PCs) - but it captures the feel of Star Wars.  A revision of that rule system, or a completely new system incorporating the best features of both d6 and d20, would have been a much better choice than using the d20 system as a "one-size-fits-all" set of mechanics.  However, it seems unlikely that Wizards of the Coast will forsake their flagship d20 system for something as high-profile as Star Wars.  So I suggest that if you really want to get into gaming in the Star Wars universe, look for a used copy of the West End Games version 
 I used to love Iris Johansen's books esp. her Eve Duncan books. The last few though have been terrible. On the Run was the final straw, she's lost me as a reader. I read about 100pgs and gave up. The plot was so dumb I can't believe she got someone to publish it. 
 and now the ghosts of the aztec return to the land they never left  MacBush trembles as his slain Banquo shakes his bloody hoary head at the state banquet  heck about one half of the continental USA was MExico for centuries until anglo invaders squatted and invaded 150 years ago and declared it theirs. Look at the history of TExas for instance. The MExicans are simply coming home, or remaining where they never really left  BUchanan, grandson of illegal immigrants, Pat Buchanan, an apologist for the corporate capitalism that is destroying our nation, culture and our free democratic ideals. Do not believe a word from this hypocritical inhuman effete lying liar, former speechwriter for the great Liar "Not a crook" Nixon and the utterly vile criminal GOP VP and tax evader Spiro Agnew. So now Patty has his own hired mouth and greedy ghostwriter. CHeck the copyright.   Ever wonder how so many old Jewish Democrats and African Americans in Florida voted for the ancient bigot Buchanan in the 2000 election, whose bigotry and prejudice and propagandistic disinformation campaign glow so harshly in this miserable book? The butterfly ballot was so rigged that anyone with poor eye sight and/or less than acute reading skills would punch out Buchanan's hole rather than the intended Gore hole. Algore won 2000; America lost. Everything and forever.   One star is an infinity too many for Patty's traitorous garbage  Get the Honorable Senator Byrd's brave book "Losing America" for a truer view of how and to whom we lost our revolutionary constitutional democracy  We once had jobs and room for everyone but now Wall Street and their Washington puppets send all of the jobs overseas to cheaper slave labor in China and leave us with no industry. Huge agribusiness sneaks slave labor across our border in what their boy George Bush calls a "guest worker" indentured slave system, in order to bust our own citizens who need a living wage in America. THese are the enemies of America, the wealthy multi-national corporations that pay Patty to parrot this claptrap propaganda that distracts us from the true enemy of America, the loss of our jobs and our constitution and our human, civil and voting rights. 
 I am embarassed to admit that I saw this video several years ago; I give it 2 stars.  I suppose the film quality is excellent, but in my opinion, a waste of film to make this.  The plot is forgettable, and, at the risk of offending those who like it, "I spent two hours out of my life watching this, and can't get them back again for something constructive. 
 This book deals with older Palm Operating Systems; so old in fact, that my year-old T5 was way beyond it. It has a copyright from about 2000. If this was in a real bookstore, I owuld have been able to see this fact and avoid this out-of-date product.   Perhaps my worse Amazon experiece to date 
 THE BEAT GOES ON is proof that you do not have to own EVERY record by a favorite group.   This one is excessive artsy-fartsy "lowlight of 1967" stuff. I listened to it back then with bemused tolerance, but 40 years later I would rather get root canal than sit through this painfully embarrassing "concept" record. The concept was silly then, and with the hindsight of four decades, a huge misstep. 
 This is a poor knock-off of the classic book "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain" by Betty Edwards. Save your money and go back to the original!  And if you are a painter, try the new book she has written, called, simply, COLOR.  It's fabulou 
 I agree with other reviewers that this is a survey or concept book.  Schlossnagle is a bright php programmer but a lousy teacher.  Do not buy this book if you are hoping to learn 'Advanced PHP Programming' from it.  This book is too superficial in it's coverage of the many subjects.  Ie: Schlossnagle's coverage of Object Oriented Programming is less than six pages (why bother?), and does not adequately cover the basics.  This book is good for introducing you to things you may not have thought of before.  Ie: I liked the section on exceptions but found it too brief and assumed too much.  I was therefore forced to read other materials, including the official php manual, before I had a real grasp of exceptions.  Larry Ullman does a much better job of explaining subjects.  His PHP Advanced for the www (first edition) is an excellent book to actually learn from.  Unfortunately it is a little dated and the second edition is still a couple months away.  Do yourself a favor, spend your money on another book if you are intending to actually learn 'Advanced PHP Programming' from a book 
 Warning: this mini-series is three hours of sex games followed by three hours of thriller. It would have made a decent movie but was a disappointing, slow and overly explicit mini-series. Six hours is plenty of time to guess who did it 
 I bought this camera for my 13-year old son to take with him on a soccer trip to Bermuda.  It was ok.  Felt sort of cheap, but seemed like it would do what it was supposed to.  BIG DRAWBACK....there is no lens cover that slips into place when a picture isn't being shot, so the danger of scratching the lens is immense.  My son was so afraid of scratching the lens, that he barely used it.  Some of the few pictures that he did take were ok, but others were not of the best quality.  I think this camera is a bit too costly for what you get, and I'm surprised, because I usually love Samsung products 
 Despite the fact that the country (not just the right, as in Reagan's case) practically beatified Roosevelt at the time of his death, and also despite the virtually unanimous opinion among historians that he was one on of the three truly great leaders this country has ever had, authors like Flynn just cannot seem to let it go. The anti-FDR/New Deal/Yalta smear brigade, fueled from the beginning by the same 'big money' that ironically caused the Depression in the first place, marches on to its own drummer, preaching to its own choir.   If a man is measured by who his enemies were, then the legacy of FDR, only perhaps second to Lincoln, may rest undisputed 
 I read approximately 75% of this book while waiting for a delayed flight in middle America. It is quite simple to sum up: take 100 people who are not employed by Fox News, have ever opposed George Bush, or who have ever taken a political stance that is anything aside from right-wing conservative, and call those people traitors or anti-American.  If you oppose the decisions of the leaders of this country, does this mean you are automatically undermining the social fabric of America? Not in the very least. In fact, many of these 100 people are helping to steer this country away from the downward spiral the US is currently caught in with this dismal administration. Any book with such a title that does not have George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Karl Rove, Condoleeza Rice, and Ann Coulter in the top five is simply an embarrassment to journalism.  Who is this book for? Well, plenty of right-wing conservative folks still think that President Bush is doing an excellent job, we are winning the war on terror, and the country is safer. These are the type of people who need this book. It will make you feel better about the fact that you blindly swallow the bull that is fed to you by the murderers you voted for.  In addition, if you tend to lean left, you should read this book at a library so you can get more enraged at how unintelligent your fellow countrymen can be. But be sure not to pay for it. Don't further line this man's pockets, instead donate the money you would have paid for it to Katrina victims 
 Normally I don't take the time to write a review, but this book just bugged me.  When I finished I felt like I had run a marathon.  The book was just too drawn out and I felt the descriptions were long winded.  Faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem.  The plot was good, but moved slowly.  I am typically not drawn to Danielle Steel books and probably with good reason that I never seem to like them very much.  I am glad that this book was in a box of 30+ books that I paid $15 for at a used book store.  I would have felt like I wasted my money had I actually paid full price for it 
 Mini DV cams are better, and should cost about the same. This particular camera has poor quality video and it is a pain to get video transferred to your computer. The software is glitchy, so you'll probably end up downloading drivers yourself. Find a different camera 
 Lian Hearn lost me on this one.  This is the third and final book of the original Tales of the Otori trilogy (there's a fourth book set decades after this one ends that reportedly resolves the one dangling issue from the trilogy) and it is easily the worst.  Across the Nightingale Floor was very good with swift pacing, a mentally tough heroine and solid action; Grass for his Pillow was a decent middle volume that moved the story forward, set up the final book and did not lose too much momentum.  Brilliance of the Moon is a relative flop.  The two main characters, Takeo and Kaede, make laughably stupid decisions.  Kaede loses too much of her inner strength -- she becomes simply the damsel in distress.  And the anti-climactic, deus ex machina resolution to Takeo's quest is entirely too unsatisfying.    If you can read Book 1 and enjoy it as a stand-alone novel despite its status as the first in a trilogy/tetralogy, do so.  But you're forewarned before you get too deep into the story, the ending in this volume is pure disappointment 
 The country music crowd built the Chicks up, then they went to England and showed their true side.  As a result country music lovers, true to their country, turned on the Chicks; so now the Chicks say that their music isn't country.  I say that their music isn't music but it just noise 
 The title and book cover tells you it's not a boring book.  The contents are not boring as well.  A bit of wisdom here and there worth carrying with you on your next chit chat on strategy but I had a hard time with the book's flow.  I find it poorly organized jumping here and there.  There are many authors which made it difficult to tie together but still, I think it could have been better 
 Women write excellent novels about women. This should not be startling news. Some men write well about women, but not that many. This also should not be news. Baldacci does an excellent job. He stays away from sex and clothing. LeCarre does a magnificent job. Robert B. Parker on occasion hits nothing but net with his new 'Sunny Randall' series, but not all the time. Too often, they're male characters who are a size 5. This is the case with Deaver and 'Rune.'  First of all, the one name bit. Who are we kidding? Have you in your personal lives ever known a human being with one name? I  have not. I don't know anyone who knows any one named persons. So at the very outset, it's incredible.  Then she's an assistant camera person who talks her way into the major talent on a news program, and talks herself into an assignment of major consequences. That happens every day. She worked in a video store before this! She was a salesgirl!  She lives on a houseboat in Manhattan. Now you know that Manhattan, insofar as Real Estate goes, makes Ann Arbor, Lincoln Park and Santa Barbara look like the ghetto. So . . . how? How does she afford this? She has a $50,000 dollar camera . . . how?  Her tastes are promiscuous, she's caring for a 4 year old abandoned child, feeding her cheetos and sardines, she get's a murderer out of prison on guile and deception.  It was a struggle, Mr. Deaver, to finish this book. And finally, most readers CAN'T STAND when the agent says 'Hey, you're really selling now. Got anything you wrote 20 years ago?' That's what this is. It's just a republication of a republication. Come on. We deserve more than that. We are your faithful fans. 1 star. Larry Scantlebury 
 This book is packed with information -- there is no question about that! It is full of accepted, conventional wisdom. And that is why I did not like the book. When I read it I said to myself "here we go again". The introduction says "You can trust us, we are from the American Dietetic Association". But I think it is the same old junk that the FDA and the USDA and all our so-called experts have been giving us for the last 25 years while we get fatter and fatter and lose more and more of our grandparents and parents to heart disease and diabetes. Diabetes has become a problem now even for children as young as 10 years old. Why? I cannot understand why it is taking so long for the word to get out. There is a revolution going on right under our noses. In my opinion, while people like Dr. Atkins and others were on the right track, only Doctors Michael and Mary Dan Eades have put it all together and come up with a health program that really works. I've lost 55 pounds,lowered my cholesterol by 17%, my triglycerides by 66%, and my LDL by 15%. Moreover, I've rasied my HDL (the "good" cholesterol)by 13%. My blood pressure is now around 120/70. My ratio of Total Cholesterol to HDL is down from 5.0 to 3.7. (5.0 and over is associated with heart disease). I've read all of this stuff before! I've been to Weight Watchers, Nutri Systems and Jenny Craig. I've tried all kinds of diets. Trying to follow the food pyramid just doesn't work. Let's face it, we just don't have time to prepare and eat so-called "well balanced meals" (with too many carbs anyway)day in and day out. In my opinion, this book is a waste of your money and time and effort. If you want to know what really works and why buy "The Protein Power Lifeplan" by Doctors Michael and Mary Dan Eades (on this site) instead of this book. Better yet, buy them both! Try this one (or the other) for a year and then try the other for a year and then email and let me know how you did 
 My problem is not with the TV, it was fantastic when it worked. But 36 days into owning it, the picture went out completely and the TV has now become a VERY expensive paperweight. What's the problem? Well, Amazon won't exchange it because it was 6 days past their policy. And Sony? Well, they've sent out an "authorized" repair person who has proceeded to strip half the screws that hold the TV together and despite replacing everything but the panel, its still not working. Sony's solution? Keep me on hold and force me to have a new panel installed - in a 36 day old TV!!! They refuse to replace the entire TV with a new one and are telling me that I am "screwed." I suggest you buy this TV from a local retailer - at least then you have somewhere to go when everyone treats you like $2000 is nothing. Not really Amazon's fault, but they haven't been the most "customer friendly." SONY Warranty service is not worth the picture quality of this TV.. 
 Seriously, this is a lame and blatant attempt to sucker fans out of their money. I have never been so disappointed in something that carried the Misfits logo on it. I'm a fan of the Danzig era, I'm a fan of the Michael Graves era. I even like the current lineup with Jerry, Dez, and Robo. I'll always support the Misfits no matter what, but this album is just trash.   This album for one was not performed with the true spirit of the Misfits in mind. This my friends was made for one purpose, an easy, cheezy way to make a buck. After three songs you'll find yourself shutting it off. I actually made it to song 5 before I decided I couldn't take anymore. Their is no vocals on this album, just cheezy Casios and piped in strings. I would put this album on the same level as the worst songs on the "Pac man Fever" album. 
 This is her pre-Skyscraper direct-to-video attempt at becoming a Hollywood film star. Acting and writing are poor. Lighting, sound, editing are professionally done 
 *warning* spoilers What an awful adaptation. The worst part was the music. Saxophone muzak and synthesizers playing in a story set in the early 1800's?????? The only character that didn't bore me to sleep was Robert Hardy's General Tilney. I had to fight to keep my eyes open on this one, and I love Jane Austen movies usually. I didn't even rent it, I borrowed it from the library. They should have paid me to take it. I don't quite understand how Catherine and Henry managed a passionate kiss at the end when throughout the movie they had no chemistry or indication whatsoever that they cared for one another. Isabella and her brother were way overdone; it was no secret to me immediately that she and her brother were the "bad guys" and part of the excitement of Jane Austen movies is the discovery that who you think is good, isn't. This is probably on my list of the ten worst movies I've seen. 
 I am a preschool teacher and the finger plays in this book are too long and wordy.  The illustrations were not very easy to follow either 
 Thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we're reading a story.  We like to look for clues in what we've read to help us unravel the plot, and find out who did it and why the crime was done.  John Grisham cheats us out of that fun.  The villian of this book isn't introduced until there less than 75 pages left, which means that when you get that far, you realize that everything you read before then wasn't valid. To have some red herrings in a thriller is fine, but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings?  That's bad.  Read another thriller instead of this one, one that plays by the rules 
 I've been dancing Salsa for more than 2 years and had a look at several videos. This video series is so bad that you think it must be a joke, but after a while you start to realize that these guys are serious about it. Susie dances worse than many beginners I've seen, hopping around like she's doing jive. Marlon is more mumbling than dancing, his method in teaching is not having one. His moves are very basic and some look just ridiculous. Actually I'm speechless. If you're so bad it's a crime to let people pay $ for a DVD... At least my friends and I had a good laugh! If you want to get a fabulous instructional video, from beginner to advanced, get the RedHotSalsa series from Ron and Bethana Rosario! This is Salsa 
 This album exemplifies the relentless self-absorption and boredom of performance art.  I would never voluntarily buy anything else produced by this man.  It is artless, stupid and monotonic.  Did I forget to mention self-pitying and annoying?  If you want to ruin your day, buy this CD and listen to it first thing in the morning 
 I think one of the other reviewers said it best: this book is for unapologetic elitists.  It completely turned me off from the first chapter.  
 Like others, I have read the whole Goldy Bear Culinary Mystery series and I have enjoyed each book...until now.  This book is slow to start and as I am only on page 100 after a week, hasn't picked up speed yet.  I can't get past Goldy wallowing in her sorrow.  Granted, I have never tripped over a dead body only to find out that it was my neighbor, but enough is enough already.   As another reader mentioned, there are a few disjointed parts for example, at one point Marla is driving Goldy to pick up Arch and Gus.  A couple of paragraphs later, Goldy is turning into the parking lot...but I thought Marla was driving???  I hope that this book was a fluke and Diane Mott Davidson will come back with a mystery of the same caliber that all of her fans have come to expect and enjoy 
 Let me start by saying that normally I'm a big Popcorn fan. I read any article that she's quoted in. I've read "The Popcorn Report" at least twice and loved it. The same for "Clicking." Great book. They're part of my permanent library.  So I was more than disappointed after the first few chapters of EVEolution. I hung in there as long as I could, but the male bashing that pervades the early part of the book overwhelmed whatever golden nuggets were in its way. I just couldn't tolerate reading any more.  Perhaps her comments about or against men are warranted in some people's view, but I didn't see how they fit in with the intent of the book. The comments seemed gratuitous and unnecessary.  So hopefully her next book will be better.   
 A biography about a boy - and a very tough and brave one - who was in battle for such a short time he was spared the continuous horror that veteran survivors (or killed and maimed) of Iwo experienced. He saved the wounding or death of the three other members of his fire team in an apparently instinctive and singular act of self sacrifice. By strict definition, this act was deserving of the Medal of Honor. His terribly painful recovery from wounds received is heart wrenching, but the relatively odd sense of personal glory is in sharp contrast with other accounts of Iwo veterans, or any other battle, I have read. The other accounts I have read generally conclude: War is a horrible thing to experience, and not glorious, but "I would do it again.........". The recent books I have read will illustrate this contrast: "GOODBYE, DARKNESS", William Manchester "GOD IS NOT HERE.....", Richard Overton "THE QUIET HERO", Gary W. Toyn "FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS", James Bradley "THE LAST LIEUTENANT", John Shively These men may have entered combat as boys, but they certainly left as men.  
 After seeing both Peyton Place and the sequel I can tell you that I could tolerate the recast, Carol Lynley and Tuesday Weld were wonderful in their perspective parts.  But I have to wonder was it only the cast that changed in this sequel did the writers change as well?  My reasons for asking, the glaring inconsistencys to the original movie.  Over and over in this film it is stated that Selena was raped when she was thirteen, yet in the original film Selena, Alison and the others were graduating from high school when the incident occured.  Since when do thirteen year olds graduate from high school, also she looked pretty mature for thirteen.  Then there's Selen'as boyfriend (whose name escapes me at the moment) in the original film he stood by her, through the murder charges, the revelation of the rape, and the miscarriage, yet in the sequel I'm suppose to buy that he couldn't handle any of it dumped her and left town where he met and married someone else.  Then all the towns people after being put in their place by the town Doctor all rallied together at the end of the original film to give their support of Selena, yet in the sequel she is considered the town outcast?  I have nothing against sequels even with recast but this one strayed way too far from its original film that all creditbility for it as a sequel went out the door. It was all too obvious that the original film wasn't taken into account when writing the sequel.  Not credible at all 
 I found this book interesting but quite distasteful.  The "journalist" is so biased its laughable.  As western communities crumle and become more disfunctional white people will have to wake up and face some unpleasant truths.  We owe this to ourselves and our children!  The multi culti morass we find ourselves in is a terrible failure and we need to wake up and fix this problem.  Weak men like Ryan are a product of 30 odd years of marxist, feel good, sappy politics.  
 I read this book I don't remember how many years back. I think about 15 years ago. And just remembering makes me nauseous, for the amount of time and effort it took me read it just to get to no point. I was younger, naiver and I got engaged, I confess that. Clever Author no doubt, to make a huge pile of unrelated ideas and make believe you would get somewhere following his lead. Just wandering around and playing with analogies. I had the time back then, I guess. Today I only have the time to write a review stating how surprised I am today I could finish this kind of book. I can't speak for anyone else, suffice to say I was a nerd with a lot of time in my hands 
 This book is pure heresy clothed in feel-good, new age sounding terminology. The author blatantly states that he doesn't believe in the basic dogmas of the Christian faith, such as the virgin birth, the physical resurrection, or what he calls the "traditional" redemption and atonement of Jesus Christ. He also does not take the bible at all literally. Granted, there is much spiritual depth to scripture; however, excessive spiritualizing of scripture can lead to this type of "enlightened" Christianity.  His concepts are not Christian, but emphasize the divine nature of mankind while downplaying the role and true divinity of Christ. This is all subtly concealed under the guise of a re-interpretation of the "true" gospel message.  Anyone with even a cursory knowledge of scripture can see the errors in the author's observations and conclusions.   The author has dabbled in mysticism - unfortunately not Christian mysticism as experienced by the myriad of saints of the Roman Catholic Church. This book should in no way serve as a reflection of catholicism for anyone seeking to discover the true Roman Catholic faith. 
 I can not stand this book. I can't even finish reading it. Kevin J Anderson can not write original Star Wars books at all. The only thing I have ever seen with his name on it that was entertaining was the Dark Lords of the Sith comic book. Everything he writes is unoriginal and lacking in story. He seems to have some obsession with Death Stars and world destroyers because all he seems to put in his books are those. Darksaber, Jedi Search, Dark Apprentice, Champions of the Force, heck even the IG-88 story he wrote for Tales of the Bounty Hunters had the Death Star tied in (IG-88 transfers himself into the Death Star...what the heck?) Seriously, this book is not worth it. Try Timothy Zahn or Michael Stackpole. At least they don't always use Death Stars. And while Zahn's last 3 books are based around Thrawn, the original Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising and The Last Command, when Thrawn first appeared, was not him dry humping the same concept over and over 
 Dow Jones is still going through its major corrections after the roaring 80s and then the 90s. We are experiencing the same cylical phase that happened in the 70s - when war, energy crises, international market expansions, and demographic changes were gradually driving the economy to a malaise.  The main difference is that the country was in little debt 30 years ago. We are now owing other countries trillions of dollars, and the trade deficit will continue to soar. The economy may sink as a result, but it has nothing to do with bubble bursting. That was already done in the stock market years ago. Should the economy finally collapse, it will have to do with our structural economic problems.   Most probably prefer a soft-landing rather than a hard collapse. It will take some sacrifice and some political leadership to achieve a peaceful and endurable transition. It will be about our committment to paying down the debt, ending our oil dependence, and educating the workforce to take on the jobs of the new century that are not to be "outsourced" to other places.   As this review is being written, the alleged "greater bubble" has yet to be materialized. However, stocks will NOT emerge into a greater bubble unless the American people can become optimistic about the economy again. Dent has been wrong in his past predictions, so please do not take this book too seriously either 
  The People of Sparks by Jeanne DuPrau is a horrible book that I would not recommend to people under the age of eleven. This story takes place in the city of Sparks. Lina & Doon have just lead the people of Ember out from underground. After coming to the city the Emberites are mistreated, malnourished, and misunderstood. So Lina goes out into the Empty Lands with a roamer that is looking for treasure. The Empty Lands are full of owls, coyotes, and other odd animals. There are also destroyed homes and buildings. Following this she comes back, and there is a large fight involving everybody. After that the climax is still climbing, and the most important part is ... I can't tell you!  	The above ground city of Sparks is an incredibly small city. The population is only three hundred twenty-seven and then to make matters worse, four hundred odd some people of Ember come to live with them. With food being scarce and people on the brink of war, Lina leaves with a roamer and goes to the Ancient City. This roamer that Lina left with is very rude, odd, and is looking for buried treasure that isn't there. When the roamer leaves, Lina leaves with the roamer's partner and head back to Sparks. When the two meet a new roamer, that is going to Sparks, they travel with him. The Roamer tells Lina the clues to the treasure, and Lina tells him that it is... I can't tell you, you have to read it.  	Truly, I thought the book was horrible, and weird because I don't like Fantasies, but if you like Fantasies you should read it 
 I dont enjoy this publication at all anymore, dont know if editorial leadership has change 
 I didn't know there was a "Parental Advisory" on this cartridge until it arrived. Clearly not suitable for children. Also, I didn't know any of the songs on the cartridge. It would be helpful if there was a way to see the songs included before purchasing 
 The table of contents to this book is very intriguing--Mothers, Fathers, Daughters, Sons, essays presumably about what it means to be a man in today's world. This is a topic seemingly of introspective interest to all males, yet the actual writing struck me as either completely off topic, or so obvious and sentimental that it offered no quiet, contemplative wisdom worthy of the time it takes to read. These are all brief stories from a variety of authors. In reading prior reviews of this book above, I tried to see if those who liked the book were male or female. From a female perspective, perhaps there is an easier acceptance of the stories presented, that they really do have relevance somehow. There are some sentimental values expressed in "A Man's Journey," and perhaps that appeals to some, but for me, I think it utterly fails in the premise expressed in the title and offered me nothing of probitive value. This is not meant to diminish those who liked it, but I'm scratching my head trying to see the value to me, a male very interested in the topics listed in the table of contents. There are six "Top Ten Things" listed at the end of every section. Things like, "I wish we'd had a few more laughs and a few less arguments" (10 things I wish I'd told my father), or "Change a tire"(10 things every man should know), or "How much of an effort do I make, really?" (10 things every man should know the answer to). If you want a quick litmus test of whether this book offers you anything, just pick one of those lists for a quick review. If you like what's listed, you'll probably like the book, if not, it's a waste of time 
 this isn't not worth buying or even staring at. i mean if you read it you might be thinking right now...why do people even bother read these reviews this is a horrible book imma watch tv! i defenetly recomend throwing this book away i don't even know why they made it a book.  this is the worstest thin i have ever read. i have seen the show and it's ok...only when it ends i can't beleive people actually like this stuff 
 Grisham's worst book by far.  90% of the story is preaching to the reader that homeless people just have bad luck and are good guys.  It would be ok if that was woven into a good story, but it is not.   For great Grisham read The Firm and The Partner.  For very good, read Runaway Jury and Pelican Brief.  All of these are page turners.  Street Lawyer is a stomache turner.  Really bad.  What happened 
 This book is not for filmgoers. Its focus is geared to the elite and erudite college student who will be impressed by name dropping of prominent philosophers in Western Lit. To be polite, it is dripping in stream-of-consciousness commentary that wreaks of self-indulgence, suggesting adult attention deficit problems. It is not uncommon to find sentences in excess of 50 words long, that if grammatically diagrammed would make Watson and Crick's double helix look like a straight arrow. Save time and save money. The clip art of movie scenes is primitive and should have been a clue as to the author's intent. A great disappointment 
 Having had very good luck with two Belkin G routers, I thought that the G+ would be a no-brainer. NOT. First of all, the router would not install at all from Windows 2000. I called customer support, and after interminable waits and two tech support people (who were very polite), we finally decided to install from another computer with Windows XP. All seemed to be going along fine--the router installed--but did not allow me to set a security password for the wireless in the regular set-up process like their G-router setups did. Only when I logged on wirelessly, it let me set a password----meaning had any of my bandwidth-thieving neighbors tried to log on before me, it would have been THEM setting MY password (which would have effectively locked me out of the wireless!). It also came without a user's guide (though that is listed on the box contents) and the CD-ROM also was supposed to have a user's manual, but when I clicked on the "user manual" tab, nothing came up! After all was said and done, I did manage to get my XP system connected, but the Windows 2000 would not connect even with a cable (it was working fine on a Linksys direct cable before). Overall--a very painfully long installation that was not Windows 2000-compatible (or perhaps a firewall problem), items left out of the package, and a big step down in ease of installation from their G router. And if that isn't bad enough--the signal strength was no improvement over the Linksys G router I was replacing. Belkin, sorry--this product was below your previous standard. This one's going back to Best Buy 
 ... I was so happy to see that someone wrote a book about protools 5.1... and of course i did buy it right a way.... then i was shocked when i started to read it.... this book is only a really simple reduction of the protools Reference guide.... and actually a lot, lot less ..... i was hopeing to learn some new staff and some tricks ... well, i lost my money.. 
 I thought this was great at first until I realized that it works sporadically. I can get up in the morning and walk all over the house, look down and check my Sportline to find it is still registered at 0 steps. Other times I can walk a mile or more and find it recorded maybe 20 steps. One of the problems with it is its shape. Unlike some pedometers (like Omron) that are a vertical oval-shape, the Sportline is a horizontal rectangle, which makes it easily roll with the waistline of your pants or skirt. It's important for a pedometer to be perpendicular to the ground for it to record accurately. After much frustration, I finally bought an Omron pedometer which I love. Unfortunately, this Sportline model is so inconsistent and inaccurate as to be useless. 
 Was not about small container canning. Was a nice book, but was misleadin 
 I ordered this book with a lot of expectations, which were not fulfilled.  It is very skimpy and just gives a few "example" charts and predicts for them.  Basically, the book is interesting but not detailed enough.  I wanted descriptions of each progressed planet to each natal planet, not wanting just to see a few token examples and having to understand from them, what others might be.  I WON'T be getting any other Celeste Teal books ever again 
 i watched this film while just channel surfing&it got my attention for it's vibe but after a while I couldn't tell where it was going or wanted to be?but anyway it was a trip out film.seemed put together in spots 
 After reading the great reviews of the votivo candles I decided to spend the rediculous sum of $24 on a moroccan spice candle.When I received the candle I smelled sweet spice coming from it even before I opened the packaging.Readying myself for a rocket of rich fragrance immersing my room in exotic spice I hopefully lit the candle.After about an hour of the candle being lit I came into my room and it scented only about 3 feet around the candle.Dissapointed, and perhaps to prove that there was absolutely no way I didn't get jacked on this purchase I lit it again-this time for 3 hours.There was still no smell.Compare this with the $6 'tea' candles I bought from the Gold Canyon Candle Co. which when I lit 6 of them richly scented not only my room (which is about 13' 13') but the hallway, as well as my mothers room next door (16' 16')!If your thinking that maybe the $22+ dollars would be worth it for the exotic fragrances-think again as there was nothing special about the scent that you couldn't get from the grocery store. Jipped-you bet 
 I rarely do write up reviews on Amazon and I felt it was my obligation to tell anyone who happens to read this review to tell them that this cd is lousy.  Wow, where do I begin, I have been a GBV fan for 10+ years and have seen Bob and his boys in concerts many of times.  There are so many cult classic GBV songs that come to my mind when I think of Pollard and this cd makes me wonder if the ability to produce one more gem may never happen again.  This cd makes EMO look good, it has no melody, no witty stream of conscious lyris, no Who-esque "Sell Out" riffs...there is nothing possitive to say.  It is total rubbish. 
 Very dissappointed.  My son (I bought this for them) hooked it up and there is so much interference it cannot be used.  Audio just static and noise.  I did find it interesting that the instructions tell you it might NOT work.  Try telling this to me before I purchase thank you.  This is the last I purchase equipment on-line.  I will stick to books thank you very much 
 Very disappointing. Summing this book up in one sentence would read - "We're all genentically so similar it makes no difference, all religions are bunk, why don't we all hold hands and love each other?"  To elaborate a little, this book is a loose collection of ideas strung together by dubious inferences derived from incomplete and poorly referenced source concepts that atttempts to reduce the highly complex to the banal.   We read about how "psychopaths" and personality disorders are biological in origin (essentially), so these people can't help their behaviour, but oh wait, they have a choice so their actions really are their fault (just like WW1, in the author's view, was all Kaiser Wilhelm's fault).   We read that religion is the result of a "reglion center" in the brain, religions cause wars, there's so many of them none of them are right, and the author has never met anyone who pratices what they preach so all religions are bunk and the source of much discord, the inference being we should discard them in favour of...? A rather pathetic and trite "conversation" with a theologian is also presented as evidence as to why religion holds no answers (ignoring the billions who could present a more cogent argument either pro or con religion off the cuff than the one presented).  The reader is invited to engage in anthropomorphism in examining the social behaviour of various groups of apes and monkeys with the author wondering why we can't be more like them (ummm, because I'm human and a good deal more complex? (and besides which, I have no desire to live in a tree and spend my time grooming others for fleas)).  We also take a trip to the stars - or rather we don't - as the author rambles for some time about how far away stars are, how we could never get there, Einsteins theory of relativity and so on ad nauseam - what this has to do with holding hands and being nice to each other I don't know, but I suspect it's about being stuck on this rock together.  The books essentially trails to a distinctly uncompelling end after meandering around enormous issues that have plagued the best and brightest throughout the ages all the while cavalierly dimissing this or that point of view in favour of poorly supported author opinions, derived, as mentioned, from odd-ball bits of information loosely strung together.  I rarely write reviews, preferring to let others (and myself for that matter) read and digest materials independent of prejudice. In this case, I was so annoyed about the quality of the arguments and the tenuous support for them that I felt compelled to make my opinion public. Read it for yourself if you enjoy being irritated - be warned, however, that when you're finished you'll be wishing you'd spent your money on something more productive, like video games, or renting National Lampoon's Vacation etc 
  I always laugh at radical conservatives that long for "the good old days". Like most righties, Bork thinks America should revert to a more simple time. A time when blacks knew their place, women stayed pregnant and silent, the average life span was 50 years, and the police ( J. Edgar Hoover was the worst one of the bunch)could spy on an unsuspecting public with impunity. You betcha!! Those were  "the good old days". I suppose, speaking from a strict constructionist perspective of course, that we should repeal all the amendments of the constitution. I mean, the founding fathers were infallible right? If that happened we would still have slavery, and only land owning men would be allowed to vote.  Dare to dream huh Bork 
 medieval lives is quite possibly the worst historical book that I have ever read. In this book, it is hard to connect with the characters and thus makes it less interesting. In addition, the historiacl backround for each chapter is so complex and written as if he was trying to confuse you that it is almost impossible to ever fully grasp what he attempting to say. I had to write a paper on two chapters from this book and I got nothing out of it. If you need a nice book to make you go to sleep, this is the one 
 a HORRIBLE GUIDE!  I am an arborist and use field guides all of the time.  This is the WORST guide I have ever tried to use.  There is little or no organization in the way each tree is described.  Sometimes a tree's height is given in the opening description, other times you have to search for it in the body of the entry.  Sometimes a flower is described, other times no description appears at all.  Each feature that may define a tree is thrown in, in a slapdash manner, or left out, completely.  It's as if the authors knew that NG was paying them big bucks for a guide, and they simply threw it together as fast as they could to get their paychecks.  Forget ever trying to read this guide if you don't have your degree in the sciences, as I do.  The terminology is straight out of Botany 101/102, and you'll use the glossary to make it through each and every tree description.  FWIW, the measurements are given using the metric system. I guess it's a guide for Canadians, so if you're in the US and haven't been raised with metric measurements, you'll be frustrated on this count, as well.  The tiny symbol key that lets you know which symbol stands for each type of area a given tree may be found in is almost impossible to make out.  If you have a magnifying lense, you'll be OK.

 There are many reviews of this book that are on target.  I will keep mine short.  The author of the book is hostile to Christianity and hides behind supposed scholarship.  The book is largely biased opinions.  If one strains, one can find some useful information.  For anyone who wants to see the author's bias most clearly, get a copy of the book and look at the last page of the last chapter.  There, the author puts forth such an absurd anti-Christian, anti-Bible, and anti-American vision that the rest of the book is put clearly into the context from which the author writes.  I read the whole book, looking for a few nuggets, but finding few.  My recommendation is that this book is not worth reading and certainly not worth buying 
 I have known Tina for many years and lived with her even, her music is all the same and never seems to progress in any other direction other than , neo-folk, high register, she is better off staying in coffee houses 
 If you are new to the business of getting gigs, and know absolutely nothing about business in general, then this book may be helpful.  I was looking for something more.  To me it seemed that the author's approach was that he was speaking to dead beat musicians who are lazy and complaining all the time.  I personally think that there are many talented and hard working musicians out there who hustle each and every day to get gigs and are far beyond needing the advice that you must pick up the phone, treat your band like a business, etc.  We already know all of this.  I was looking for a book (and still am) that would get into more depth on this subject of getting gigs and give some original ideas.  This book had nothing new to offer me.  However, if you are brand new to the business, and to the business world in general, you may get something from it 
 No George Harrison, but Milli Vanilli and Paula Adbuhl? This just goes to show you what a joke Rolling Stone has become. Looking at the publication date they omitted George Harrison after his death. What insensitivity, compounded by the fact that he was one of the Beatles to which credit is certainly due for helping to exist a culutre that a magazine like Rolling Stone started as a result of, and certainly thrived from.  Rolling Stone has lost most of what little respect I have for them anymore. 
 Just as a note, I picked up this book at a local used bookstore, in one of the boxes by the exit listed as "FREE." I guess that would be a sort of portent for what was to come next.  The plot is simple and almost cliche enough: ten people gathering for a 30-year college reunion. Ten different stories basically, plus one recount of a dead graduate. These people are in their early fifties, with each little story/chapter reminiscing on their lives after college graduation.  As a previous reviewer has stated, yes, the major flaw with this book that had the potential to be quite good is that all these people are being whiny, whiny, whiny. Now. Of course, everybody has their own right to be sad and whatnot, but these people seem to take it one step further. I'm gonna just get to the point and state that I absolutely abhor the women in this book (except for two). The rest, sadly, are basically just emotionless bitches in some way or another: one thinks she's 'incapable' of falling in love (and note, she was an art major, haha), another is some blonde with 2 husbands because she wants it all, another, I think, gets what she deserves after cheating on her husband. And so forth. And the men? The men, they just basically sit there, brood a little, and take this BS from the women. Not that I'm saying to go and beat the gals up, but at some point, a guy will have to realize that he was being f***ed over by this lady, true love or not, and has to move on and stop wasting precious time over what has already been done.  So if this is adulthood, or rather, being middle-aged--a bleak overview of their failed love lives so far and nothing else--then I think I'm gonna kill myself before I turn forty. The ending was simply ridiculous and not really an ending at all. The conclusion, the characters, it all just made me angry. It could be that O'Brien's intention was to pick the saddest group of lovestruck losers you've ever met to poke fun at them. But if your some heartbroken idiot who can't get over your unrequited-love situation and wish to indulge in a story that shares your pain, this is the book for you. Now, on a personal note, I've known love too, and experienced its pain, but this is just ABSURD. If your fifty, feeling sorry for yourelf, and still aching over what happened years back, stop watching Lifetime and go read up on people who REALLY suffer; our fellow humans in third-world areas and countries that practice political oppression 
 I usually like what Mr. Peretti writes, but this one was dissapointing. It felt a little disjointed, like it needed more character development. When the characters of Randy and Leslie first appear in the novel, it's as though the authors just left two chapters out of the book. Who are they and how did they get where they are? And Who exactly is this "Tin Man" and where did he come from? There should've been alot more interaction between him and the heros in the book or at least a little more background on him or anyone else. This book could've been much longer and should have been.   Frank Peretti's other books like "The Oath" or "The Visitation" are much better. I haven't read any of Ted Dekker's books yet (I did buy "Showdown") so I won't blame him for this book. It's almost as if one or both of these guys had an idea for a movie based on a book, but had no book to base it off of. With the movie about to start filming, I fear this might be close to the truth. This may be one of those cases where the movie is better than the book. Overall, I have to say stay away from this book. 
 This single device could potentially have everything I want.... if it all worked.  (Rev B).  The specs are great which is what made me buy it, but like most D-Link hardware, it's very poorly executed and rushed to market.  Major issues are:  1) Occasional 'freezing' and random disconnects for several moments while browsing folders 2) No option to automatically boot back up after a power failure 3) UPnP-AV does not sort alphabetically.  This makes playing an entire folder in alphabetical (or chronological) order impossible. 4) Tech support seems focused on turning around emails (albeit slowly), and not doing any actual tech support. 5) EXTREMELY noisy fan... and I mean ridiculously noisy! 6) No option to edit email server port number for email alerts 7) Overall poor quality, should have had a lot more testing before being released to the public.  Not bad for the price, but if you don't need all of these features in one device, look elsewhere 
 I found this book to be rather dull although I did learn a lot about fox hunting. The description was fabulous but I don't think that it was much of a mystery. I kept reading but I also kept wondering when something was actually going to happen. I did love the character of "Sister" 
 Stupefying and moronic is the most apt description of this waste of celluloid. Though made during the Cold War, its portrayal of Russian people is unfairly mean-spirited and in a review I read elsewhere, it was described as xenophopic. I would go so far as to say it is propagandistic. Its the kind of film which will appeal to today's dumbed-down American who thinks he's a little more special than everyone else in the world and that he has the right to blow up foreign villages and otherwise disregard laws and civil behavior. The idiotic characters justly deserved the punishment they received in this pathetic film 
 Love Michael Buble, but this was more like a home made movie of someone using their camcorder from the audience. Parts of Michael's head was cut off, and then; sometimes, his whole head was cut off. Most of the time, the camera man didn't expect where Michael was going to move to and you'll get a jerky movement of the camera man trying to get Michael back into the picture. I wish they would have said in the description that this was more of a documentary than a concert. That this was just home made videos. This was definitely not worth $20. If you want a professional quality concert, I would recommend buying Michael Buble's Caught in the Act. Caught in the Act was worth the $20 bucks. You get professional camera men who anticipated Michael's movements, and parts of his head was never cut off like Come Fly with Me's DVD. Also, the sound quality on Caught in the Act was way better. Now, I understand why some places sold Come Fly with Me DVD's and had the word enhanced after it. The DVD that I received was not enhanced. Anyways, skip this one, and get "Caught in the Act" instead.  
 I bought the book thinking that I'd be getting detailed information about homeowners insurance but the author merely glosses over the subject matter.  I think he's an agent and, as such, doesn't have that much experience when it comes to the information I need, such as claims (particularly mold since I was just cancelled as a result of filing a mold claim), how to interpret specific policy language, etc 
 The setting of this book is beautiful, exotic, and interesting. The author, unfortunately, does nothing to take advantage of this. I am shocked that this book could possibly have won a National Book Award. It must mean that either the award itself is meaningless, or that there were some truly dreadful books out that year -- which I doubt. The topic of this book could have been more ably handled by just about anyone else, as far as I am concerned. I can't imagine it being done worse! Tuck's writing style -- short vignettes or episodes, one after another -- is terribly ineffective and disjointed. I felt completely detached from all of the characters. I didn't feel like I gained any understanding of who they were, and was unmoved when they died or otherwise encountered tragedies. Another thing that completely irritated me were Tuck's sexual references. Throughout the novel, Tuck would end her lame vignettes with one or two sentences mentioning some crass sexual encounter (a finger inserted in an unmentionable place or a character participating in a masturbating contest, for example). These sentences seem to be thrown in just to shock or perhaps to intrigue the reader; all they did was gross me out. They were written in such a way that they seemed to have been written by a teenage boy, not an adult woman trying to tell a compelling story. I don't know what Tuck was trying to do in this novel. I think she has failed to write anything that succeeds on any level: It is not entertaining. It is not profound. It is not educational. It is not beautiful. At only 248 pages, I can't say it was even a quick read. Utterly forgettable, once you get past the irritation of having wasted your time reading it. 
 It usually takes a lot for me to give up on a book. The second volume in this series did not live up to it's predecessor or even reach half its potential. Following the first book, I was excited to see how Sarah and Wessex would reconcile their differences and live together as husband and wife. Unfortunately, none of that ever materialized. The footnotes were ludicrous, the direction of the story even more, and the writing dismal 
 I bought this car seat based on the good ratings it received.  However, it did not work for my son until he was about 5 months old.  My son was born 5 lb. 11 oz.  He did not fit snugly into this seat, even with the head cushion.  His head rolled around or rolled forward.  I tried to put washcloths or towels around but it did not work.  Also, if I adjust the base so that the car seat is flatter, it would roll around a lot more (I have leather seats). Additionally, the material on the seat is not breathable--it is velvety--so my son's back and head would become very sweaty on longer trips, even in the winter.  I would say that once my son was bigger (about 14 pounds and 26 inches), I removed the head cushion and moved the seat belt to the higher position--this is when he actually "fit" into the seat, however the fabric is still an issue and his back and head still become very sweaty, making him very uncomfortable for longer trips.    
 Change can be good; however, sometimes change can be very bad.  Earlier this year PC Mag decided to become a magazine for the masses instead of providing technical information for their longtime dedicated readers.  Before the change this was a magazine that I would keep for a year or so to refer back to the content; now I can skim it in 5 minutes and don't feel there is a reason to keep it for any length of time.  As a longtime subscriber (20 years) I will not be re-subscribing to the magazine.  I wish them luck, but I believe they have lost sight of their subscription base and are chasing a broader base of subscribers that might disappoint them 
 This is one of the most presumptious and  arrogant works I have ever had to read.  Doody's arguments are poorly presented, and the reader gets lost in her difficult, convoluted, circular explanations.  The grammar and usage mistakes (fragments, run-on sentences and comma splices) detract from the overall message of the book.  The topic is interesting, until you try to follow Doody through her presentation.  Questions are posed, and if the reader expects an answer one is DISAPPOINTED.  The explanation of the tropes of a novel make several unbending assumptions, and overreach the evidence.  Not worth the money...and if it required reading for a class I am very sorry.    
 I have recently moved to Ecuador and thought this book might give me a better understanding of what is going on here.  There is plenty of information in this book--but it is completely garbled!  I have read many political science books, and this is the most disorganized, badly written, unedited one I have ever tried to get through.  There are outright misktakes, frequent repetitions, poor translations, and no clear storyline, chronological or otherwise. Could someone please write a better book about Ecuadorean politics? It should be a fascinating subject.  
 My son loves Ben 10 and was really disappointed in this toy.  If they just designed it with a built in light it would be so much better.  Who would design a viewmaster that doesnt let in light so you can see the images???? I agree we've had fast food freebies that were better quality than this thing 
 i hated this book with a paaion. i had to read it in english class last year ansd it was the worst book i have every read in my entire life. dont read it!! 
 Tony Brown's paranoid fantasy about world orders make this an almost impossible book to read.  Not backed up with any facts but the authors claims jump from topics a diverse as the implied assassination of Princes Diana to a general Freemasonary plot to rule the world to the world banking system.  Often these topics are covered in a few pages with Mr. Brown liberally jumping from one topic to another.  His only references are other conspiracy books as bizarre as his own.  Schitzophrenic paranoid fantasies quoting other paranoid fantasies and masking itself as some sort of intelligent thesis.  What nonsense!  But hence the crux.  Since it is a "conspiracy" (a word Mr. Brown uses liberally), it can never be proven or disproven, hence it's validity.  Based on that version of logic one could never disprove the existance of Santa Claus either 
 I think this book is worse than the others written by Savage-Weiner, which is saying a lot. Unfortunately, most reviewers never bothered reading this book.  On page 2, I am reminded why I hate this guy. Observing "while I'm no military tactician," he forgets to point out he was dodging the draft picking flowers in Hawaii while I and others were serving in Vietnam. He then states, "we still had to fight the real war, a guerrilla war--something our nation does not have the stomach for." Oh, please dude, people like you and your followers don't have the guts to serve. Like on page 10, where he forgets that people like Ted Kennedy at least served in the Navy during WWII. You may disagree with his politics, but at least the Kennedys had the guts to serve.  Skip ahead to page 172 (you ain't missing much) for more of his idiocy on Vietnam. He states, about the Vietnamese, that "in the sixties, no one really knew who they were." Well, he didn't, but 3 million Americans who served in the Vietnam War did. That's what happens when you sit out the war of your generation. He also erroneously claims that Vietnam "was a civil war." At the time of the war it was considered communist aggression. Conservatives of the sixties, like me but not him, knew about the communist threat. This is also the same page where Savage-Weiner claims "Iraq was not a civil war." Where have you been lately?  The "Afterword" really says it all. On page 203 he claims, about liberals, "for far too long you have lived in a cage where liberal ideas--and only liberal ideas--are expressed." He is really talking about himself and his followers. At least liberals, by definition, read and review all points.   For all those who hate "liberals," I would like to remind them that our Founding Fathers were the liberals of their day. A real Patriot of our Revolution (one of my real ancestors in Virginia) would have burned his house down and sent him packing on his big honking yacht.   
      After using Dr.Dyer's aaah meditation CD for a month, I decided that I wanted to learn more this meditation. Therefore, I bought the book Manifest Your Destiny.  The book reads like a personal journal about nine insights he has gained from his own search for spiritualism.  There are many things that disturb me about this book.        Dr. Dyer cites quotes from the bible to substantiate some of his points without citing the book, chapter, or verse.  One of the bible quotes he uses is "Is it not written in your law `I have said, You are gods?'" (John 10:34)  This is the passage to which Jesus referred when He said this to the Pharisees who were attempting to charge Him with blasphemy: " God standeth in the congregation of God; He judgeth among the gods. How long will ye judge unjustly, And respect the persons of the wicked? ... I said, Ye are gods, And all of you sons of the Most High."  (Psalms 82:1,2,6). The unjust judges of Israel (i.e., the Pharisees) were the subject of these verses.  They were civil magistrates because of their authority and power; and, they represented divine majesty in the government of the twelve tribes of Israel.  Dr. Dyer uses this verse completely out of context.   Scripture cannot be broken.        Jesus believed in the bible because it is infallible and immutable as are God's other laws.  A true seeker of spiritualism cannot reconfigure God's Word for his own purpose.  Neither can the true spiritual seeker be ignorant about God's Word and actually expect to know God's and come into a relationship with Him.  Dr. Dyer takes a little bit of truth and expands upon it in a somewhat convincing way to fit our desire for an easy road to spiritualism. The fact of the matter is that according to Jesus the door to God's kingdom is narrow (Luke 13:24).   There are no shortcuts.       Lastly, a true spiritual seeker does not strive to become spiritual with the intention of manifesting worldly possessions.  This appears to be a main theme of Dr. Dyer's book.  Those who seek God first gain all they need to be happy in this world as a "gift" from Him.  We do not need to grasp at anything as long as we trust God and put Him first in our lives.  Dr. Dyer seems to miss the point. 
 I purchased this movie because I love Chris Cooper as an actor and because the reviews were very positive.  I played the movie yesterday and boy, was I disappointed.  The movie was much too slow and boring. I love mysteries and hate dramas therefore I thought the little personal stories throughout with flashbacks actually detracted from what I thought was going to be a good mystery story.  In the end the mystery is solved with a thud and don't get me started on the quasi Luke & Leia moment at the end.  PLEASE! 
 For those that are looking for something new and different to become inspired, this is not the choice. Just a bunch of inspiring sentences over and over again that seem redundant 
 It was a very slow and boring book! Never got to the ending woth any build up or expectation 
 I love "The number one detective agency" series, and hoped for the same writing quality in this collection of folk tales.  Unfortunately there was no narrative flow, making the stories stilted and un-interesting.  Maybe a narrative explaining the lessons would have helped.  I suggest this book only for those interested in collecting african fable 
 Oh Helen Gibb...what happened? I would highly recommend all 3 of her other books. I use them all the time for ideas and inspiration and they all teach something different. But this book didn't teach me anything I didn't already know. The front cover is the only design that I hadn't seen in any other Helen Gibb books. And of course this book shows you how to do that technique. But my first and best ribbon flower book is The Artful Ribbon, and it has the same technique in it only more variations of it. This book has a few bridal type ideas and other projects but it is seriously lacking all those beautiful vintage examples of fabulous creations that all the other Helen Gibb books have. It has some but not what I'm used to with the other books. It just seems to me that this book was cranked out in a hurry and I was very disappointed with it. I'm really considering sending it back. 
 It amazes me that in this day and age, a novel about two people who remain passionately in love throughout the book, and which uses an African-American maid and a Korean neighbor for its simpering supporting cast, which uses time travel merely as a conceit, with none of the philosophical implications of how time affects relationships: it obviously doesn't have any impact on the eternally horny Henry and Claire, can be taken seriously. This book is a Hillary Duff movie, paint-by-numbers cliches( the mourning virtuoso ruined by the shakes) racist(Black maids and Asian neighbors who say cute things and always pop over with ethnic dishes) stereotypes hiding behind a "love makes the family" veneer. This book was Barbara Cartland hiding behind Chip Kidd style cover art. No doubt Anne Hathaway will star in the film 
 This stand looks okay but it is very unstable.  When I put my monitor on it it took 20 seconds to stop wobbling.  Very unsturdy 
 A mediocre piece of realist propaganda, now elevated to the ranks of "film greats" because of its conformity to certain techniques of the era, this film has nothing to offer except rigid, cliched "villains" (the Germans) and the "noble born oppressed" (Italians).  It is sentimentalizing at its worse, I particularly found the portrayal of the German commander weak, as he looked like a gerbil, and did not seem very apt or capable.  There is very little in the way of story and the expected brutality of the Germans is what takes up the greater part of the screen time, how predictable 
 This is an exremely informative book.  It gives a history of the development of different cheeses, how to make many of them at home, the uses of various cheeses and recipes.  I got a little bogged down in the history of cheese, and don't really plan to make my own, but it was great for giving me more information about the uses of various cheeses.  If you want to learn about cheese, this is your book 
 Victoria McKernan's book is a disappointing read.  I have already enjoyed Jennifer Armstrong's Shipwreck at the Bottom of the World : The Extraordinary True Story of Shackleton and the Endurance and found it a much better telling of this extraordinary tale.  McKernan's writing did not flesh out the characters and her choppy pacing did not convince this reader to finish the story 
 To cover all the problems with continuity, logic, theology, geography and plain common sense in _Left Behind_ would take a whole book.  One hardly knows where to start.  Perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to Christian religion by this trashy novel.  As such, it isn't even a decent trashy novel; instead of steamy sex scenes, we get sanctimonious sermonizing.  Worse than that, what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the Bible into a cheap comic book, ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self-centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it's too late.  The comic book aspect can not be overemphasized.  Even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario (an idea with virtually no scriptural support), little in the characters' actions, thought processes or dialog rings true.  One gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student.  God ends up looking like the ultimate villain, demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side Or Else.  Whatever happened to the inspiring Christian writers of yesteryear?  Who is the present-day equivalent of C. S. Lewis, or Catherine Marshall, and why aren't they getting more attention?  These were writers who actually made you THINK.  LaHaye and Jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing God wants us to be doing; they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought.  They show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non-believers in such a world might ask.  One wonders if they have ever met a non-believer at all, or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter.  These days, it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of Ann Coulter or Pat Robertson, whose mission seems to be to turn Christianity into a twisted, bigoted caricature of what it once was.  Perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured.  If _Left Behind_ is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from Christian writers, then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind 
 I usually try to avoid reviewing an item unless I have something positive to say about it, but in this case I'm making an exception to warn others. While I can't say for sure that you'll find this CD to be as bad as I think it is, please understand that I am an Amanda Marshall fan. I think her two other albums are excellent, but this CD is so bad that after just a few plays I think it will end up in the trash can. I was hoping some of the tunes would catch on after a few listenings, but it didn't work. Save your money for something with better potential for a positive outcome 
 This cover of this book should read "For Entertainment Purposes Only - Do Not Try This at Home".  It is as unreliable as the other book by this author, entitled "Milk: the Deadly Poison" - or something similar. It is also unreadable, deadly chunks of stoggy prose interrupted  by highlights, boxes and exclamation points - each "fact" more  wrong than the last. If you want to know about nutrition, Amazon sells  dozens of very reliable and well written books (those for freshman college  courses are usually excellent for the general reader) for other  medical/health issues affecting adults and children, there are also  hundreds of good books - Reader's Digest, Dr Spock, for example. Perhaps  not fashionable and without such a hysterical title, but MUCH better value

   Robert B. Parker is stuck in a rut. That he has a profound and almost pathological hatred of suburbia, the traditional family and conservative Christians should be patently obvious by now to any of his readers this side of raving idiocy. Sadly, these obsessions get progressively worse with each book he writes. I say sadly because cleary Parker has no small talent as a writer. If he could overcome his irrational prejudices against normal people, and attempt to construct them as real characters instead of laughably absurd cardboard cut-outs, he might become a truly great author.    One scene where this paranoia passed the absurd and entered the realm of the bizarre was when the character Rita Fiore, a single and openly  promiscuous career woman, lamented about the upbringing of her niece in the (gasp!) suburbs, and how she wishes she could "save" her from her Mom and Dad. How nauseating! Spoken like a true social engineer. I guess only the elite who live in chic downtown apartments and drink imported beer should be allowed to raise children.   But seriously, the way Parker not only belittes, but casually writes off, 75% of his fellow citizens (that is, normal people who live in 2 parent homes, go to church, and recognize a moral code outside of themselves) is sometimes quite chilling. He portrays them as being something almost subhuman. It makes you wonder what would Parker and his intellectual ilk do if they were ever put in charge.   Despite these serious shortcomings, Parker's writing is as disciplined as ever. As usual, he does a good of showing rather than telling, and his characters evoke strong emotions in the reader. I always hold out hope that Parker will one day overcome his tragically stunted view of the world, and make full use of the gifts the Good Lord has given him 
 Not the best book in my library.  I'd take a pass on this and buy an extra roll of toilet paper.  It is softer 
 I normally don't write reviews for books, but I had to for this one because it is so bad, as many others have said. I too am a Gibson fan. But I want the time spent reading this book back, I feel it was so wasted.  I almost put the book down, but instead I foolishly hoped Gibson would somehow tie all the scattered, half hearted events together in the end. As many have said, you never find out what this "nodal point" is. The payoff NEVER comes.  You don't get close to really any of the characters. You want to get close to Rydell, but there is not enough of him there. There is WAY too much jumping around.  And there is way too much of "look at what a clever writer I am" by writing incomprehensible "creative" prose.  I don't know why some writers - even great writers- fail to grasp the most important point about writing: It's the STORY stupid.   This book is a chain of events that are disconnected, unfinished and unsatisfying. Read some of his earlier works, sure, but don't pick up this painted mess, regardless of what the so-called reviews on the cover say 
 If I hadn't already read the book I would not have been able to figure out what was happening, because the abridgement hacked up the story so badly. The reader is a different person than the male/female team who did the first five books, and he pronounced everything so differently (names, places, foreign words and phrases) that I couldn't recognize the characters. In addition, his mis-phrasings had a tendency to alter the meaning of conversations he was reading. It was like he did not rehearse it at all. I only got this because there was no unabridged version available, and it was a waste of time and money to get this abridged version 
 I bought both this book and Nolo's Every Landlord's Legal Guide thinking they would address different things. I really wish I didn't waste my time reading Landlording! It's verbose and wastes 75% of the book (and your time) trying to be cute with silly examples. The information is in there but you have to weed through a morass of text just to get to it. I couldn't believe how much more succinct and effective Every Landlord's was, providing ALL the same information with none of the bs. And that comes with a free CD of all the documents you'll need. I agree with the other reviewers that the information is useful. But there are much better ways to get at it. If you don't believe me, go to a bookstore and look before you buy 
 I am a 38 year old adoptee and adoptive parent.  I was adopted as an infant, as was my own adopted daughter.  As others have pointed out, this book is clearly both overly negative and overly dramatic.  I would like to add that following the advice of the author could even be very harmful to your adopted child.  In particular, I was taken aback by the author's suggestion that you should essentially tell your child that he or she must have unresolved grief issues and help him or her uncover them.  That is just plain wrong.  Please understand that it is entirely likely that your child, especially if he or she was adpoted as an infant, will never have any significant feelings of loss or grief.  DO NOT CREATE THOSE FEELINGS OUT OF SOME MISGUIDED EFFORT TO HELP YOUR CHILD "UNCOVER" SUPPOSEDLY SUPPRESSED FEELINGS.  In my own experience, I have always known that I was adopted and that I have been loved by my parents.  I simply have no negative feelings regarding my own adoption.  None.  However, if my parents had read this book when I was a child and decided that they needed to tell me that I must have those feelings and we had to find them and focus on them, I undoubtedly would have needed years and years of therapy.  The advice in this book might have some helpful relevance to those who are adopted as older childen.  However, for those adopted a infants, what you should do is tell them early and often that they are adopted and loved.  Let them know that you are always available to talk with them about any feelings or questions they might have.  If they have questions, answer them matter of factly.  Do not burden them with negative feelings that they probably do not have and will never develop 
 The author is reusing a similar plot device than in "Twisted":  a somewhat obscure reference material that shows up late in the book and clarifies everything. That is a poor strategy for a mystery novel, because the reader expects to be given clues so as to be involved in the logical process of solving the crimes. The narrative in general is not Kellerman at his best, either. The characterizations are so shallow that one wonders all the time why the characters act like they do.  A small part of the book talks about Brazil, and Kellerman simply invents a couple of Portuguese words making them sound Spanish:  ("favilla", "favillitos"). One wonders how much of the author's research is similarly fictional. In sum, a book carelessly executed 
 As an extended story on film, Stephen King popcorn entertainment doesn't get better. Julian Sands, Kevin Tighe, Nancy Travis and the rest of the cast do their best. But the story of a parapsychologist assembling a team of psychic athletes to investigate a long-haunted house with a history of inexplicable deaths is the legacy of Shirley Jackson's "The Haunting of Hill House," made into a genuinely frightening classic film by Robert Wise, "The Haunting." Do yourself a favor ... get the Wise film. This TV fare is creepy and entertaining, but by no means memorable 
  What a mess of the royal proportions - such a great cast (Peter Sellers, David Niven, Orson Welles, Woody Allen, Ursula Andress, Deborah Kerr, and Jean-Paul Belmondo), the James Bond's story, plenty of beautiful (and I mean it) girls, the music by Burt Bacharach, most famous sets - but the movie is almost totally unwatchable. It started funny enough - at Sir James Bond's (David Niven) home where he was approached by four international agents that forced him to come out of retirement and head up the operation against the evil organization SMERSH. His mission is to destroy Topple LeChiffre (Orson Welles} at the baccarat tables where he never loses and wins a lot of money to supply SMERSH. Then, the movie becomes silly, stupid, pointless, and (what is the worst) not funny. Only Woody Allen, (as Bond's incompetent nephew, Jimmy Bond) brilliant as usual has appeared in two scenes and made them silly and hilarious. I think that "Casino Royale" (the way it was made) illustrates the fact that bigger is not always better - overlong and overblown, written and directed by five or more writers and directors, it brings to mind an old saying, "Too many cooks spoil the broth".  OT: the abbreviation SMERSH really existed during the WWII. It means "Death to the Spies" in Russian.   
 This was a very thin book for the price. I didn't get a lot out of it. I love spiritual books but this one was not very informative and each page there was just a lot of repition. I got bored with it 
 THIS BOOK HAD SOME THINGS IN IT THAT WERE OK BUT IT ISN'T REALISTIC AT ALL. SHE IS ALL ABOUT PROVING YOU ARE BETTER THAN A BOY. SHE ACTS LIKE IT IS ILLEGAL TO HAVE A CRUSH ON A BOY UNTILL YOU'RE AN OLD MAID.THIS BOOK IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD GO IN MY BURN PILE. IF YOU ARE AROUND THE AGE OF 7-9 YOU MIGHT AND THATS A REAL BIG MIGHT LIKE THIS BOOK 
 I listen to Enya's music and all I feel is this empty sadness...that's what Enya's music IS sad music with plain arrangements, mechanical choir(s), and mostly lame melodies.  I like a few of the songs on this album.  "Hope Has A Place" is kindof a highlighted song I hope to use in a movie I'm writing a script for.  "Tea House Moon" is OK; kinda sleepy-sounding, though.  "The Memory of Trees" opens with a promising group of melodies, then gets caught up in finishing too quickly or SOMETHING that causes the song to fall short of its intentions...I can't even remember anything else that I really like off of this album or almost really like.  And, like any Enya album, this one has at least one really dark midevil sounding song.  Perhaps the only reason people like Enya is b/c she's a more gentle sounding artist, as opposed to guitar-clanging janglers like Sheryl Crow and Alanis Morissette, who seem to be liked by the same crowd 
 Save your money or give it to charity. This is one of the worst films for a long time. The characters are one-dimensional, you don't care who they are and when they die, you're indifferent. The direction and the screenplay are lame and the acting comes right out of a telephone directory. I was so bored with this film that I can't even bring myself to write anything else about it 
 First show on Broadway I ever left at intermission. I bought the tickets because I didn't think I could go wrong seeing a show directed by Strohman, starring Craig Bierko who was fantastic in Music Man and was flat flat flat in this show, and music by Harry Connick Jr. whom I have loved forever. It taught me that everything has it's place and Harry's place is not a Broadway stage. I hope for his sake, he does not try again. If I could rate something at zero stars, this would get that rating 
 I've seen cheesy and I've seen wannabe with the difference between the two being the level pandering to a more intelligent audience. This movie is definitely for guys that like to get their Shakespeare from WWF. Schwarzenegger's best movie will ever be Terminator. If he could have ended with the classic "I'll be back" and not really come back to make any number of horrid films we might actually have some decent science fiction. Last good science fiction I saw was Gattaca. Total Recall definitely ain't science fiction and isn't even very good action as compared with say the mindless gore of predator. Now that was action you could taste and you knew there wasn't much pretense of science fiction going on. I'd give Total Recall a 0 or less but they only let me enter a 1 
 I bought it from another store, turned it on to toast it did nothing. Changed setting to bake and soon after it started to smoke. I smell a recall 
 i was amazed that you could take such an innovative TV show from the 80's and make it into such a boring movie. Action was slow and predictable. Casting was horrible. Even the cars weren't as good as in the TV show. I am glad I only rented tis and didn't buy it. Don't waste these 2 hours of your life on this flick 
 I travel for work, so I often rely on fitness DVDs to help me stay in shape. I've only been working out seriously for a few months, and this DVD is definitely too easy for me.  There are 2 cardio workouts, 5 toning work outs, a warm up, a cool down, and an all over toning workout.  This seems great, but when you actually look at the details, you'll see that the cardio workouts are only 13 minutes each, and the toning workouts are only 5 minutes each. So when you actually look at the pre-set workouts (without warm up and cool down), you're only getting about 20 minutes of real exercise.  I would say this is a good DVD if you've never exercised or you are really out of shape.  But even if you've been exercising for a little while, you'll probably find it too easy.  I strongly recommend The method cardio bootcamp, or 10 minute solutions carb burner, or 10 minute solutions pilates.  All three of these videos will give you the ability to choose your workouts or combine smaller segments into a longer workout.  If you're looking for a good toning workout, try Self Bikini Ready Fast.  
 I will admit, I flipped through a few of the pages in this book, read some funny bits and decided to buy it. I might as well have thrown $15 down the toilet.  After suggestions that people with potential eating disorders should be "banned from the universe" and telling a pregnant women, with hormones raging, that if she isn't having sex with her husband that he'll probably have an affair, I gave up on this piece of trash. There are other comments too, that could make any woman not "Playboy" material (She is a Playmate, ladies) feel like garbage. If you want to make yourself feel horrible, go ahead and buy this book. If you'd like to celebrate your pregnancy and feel good about yourself, there are plenty of other books out there for you. STAY AWAY. 
 I never read the book and never plan on reading it so unlike most of the other low rankings based on a bad adaptation of the book, mine's different. I saw Patriot Games and enjoyed it, so I bought this one too. But, it doesn't come close to its predecessor. The first one never let up and was always suspensful and exciting. This one is completely different. Personally, for all of you complaining about how it strayed from the book which I haven't read, that would be tolerable if it were a good movie. I'm not even going to talk about the plot because it's so complicated. At times, I would be tearing my hair out because of all of the stuff going on at the same time. Double crosses. Hidden deals with Colombians. Secret partnerships. Weird murders. Well, anyway, with all of this stuff plus a lot more going on at the same time, I lost all hope and was staring at a screen which appeared blank to me.  Sure, movies shouldn't be very simple but there comes a point when a movie is too complicated. And it was in this movie. So, don't rent or buy it, because you'll be very confused and bored. Believe me, it's boring. So, rent or buy Patriot Games and act like this doesn't even exist. 
 To be fair, I don't think someone can accurately tell the story of the Rolling Stones in 600 pages; it's been an extreme 40-year career, full of ups and downs for 7 talented and colorful band mates, countless managers, wives, girlfriends, musical contemporaries, along a socially changing atmosphere surrounded by endless drugs, sex and money. 600 pages would be a good start on a biography of only one of the musicians, let alone trying to capture the history of the whole band and everyone involved with their phenomenal success.  The book paints a very sad, trashy image of the band. It tells tales of a sordid past, but doesn't offer a fair counterbalance. I get the feeling that I was reading a tabloid newspaper; not representing a fair side of the story, but sparing no ghastly detail of their misery. For instance, I happen to know that Mick Jagger used to own a home in Venice Italy, however this was not mentioned in the book; what was mentioned were various tales from the homes where his drug or party reputation gained the most momentum. Other facts and/or journeys were neglected to save room for the real dirt.  This book is very heavy on the drug stories, but light on insights to their individual and collective personalities so we might catch a glimpse as to why they were taking so many drugs. It will speak about how high they were when they recorded album "X", but then after listening to album "X", you hear some great songs and wonder how someone you've been led to believe was out of their mind could participate and contribute to an extremely enjoyable end product.  The book also skips through the last 10 years in 40 pages or so. It made me think that they couldn't dig up any sources to give dirt during this period, so the author whizzed through it.  All in all, it's a tabloid newspaper. And I believe the tales in it. I happen to want a fair balanced perspective to really learn about the band, not just their tales of woe. But with the kind of career like the Stones have had, this perspective would require several thousand pages. It's really your call.. 
 The classification of dog "types" didn't resemble anything I've learned in other books on dog breeds.  I'm not aware that dogs are either clever or friendly, but not both at the same time. How would one choose a pet?  Let's see, do I want a stupid friendly dog, or a dog who is very clever but aloof and indifferent to me?  A big disappointment was the section where the author shared his intense dislike of cats and their owners.  What does this have to do with the title and theme of his book and why should any of us care? Dr Coren, for unknown reasons, finds it necessary to express his admiration and love of dogs by bashing cats with the same old tiresome comparisons that are always unfavorable to cats. If this was necessary, then why not include a chapter listing all the ways that guinea pigs, gerbils, parakeets, and tropical fish fall short when compared with dogs? Better yet, let's have an expert on rabbit breeding write a book about taking care of rabbits, and then include a chapter describing the faults and inadequacies of dogs? After reading much of this book,I find it hard to believe that Coren really likes any animals. I wonder whether he needed additional ncome and thought he had a new angle for a dog book.  As a lover of both dogs and cats, I have no trouble realizing that they are two different species that require no comparisons. The author's decision to share the story of the woman who seemed indifferent when her cat went missing is supposed to prove that even people who choose cats for pets, don't really love them the way the author loves dogs.  Is Coren really unaware that there's a surplus of uncaring PET owners who neglect dogs as well as cats? I don't know what Coren's grudge against the cat owning woman in his book is all about, but it tells us nothing about what cats are like as pets!    Coren thinks cats are seldom seen during the day.  He would enjoy meeting my cat, who along with our dog, greets people at the door, follows us from room to room and cuddles with us on the couch at all times of the day or evening.  Mr Coren, let the real dog and cat experts write the books.Your time would be better spent developing some insight into your own anger and resentments 
 I saw Mike Doughty open for the Barenaked Ladies and he was horrible.  I walked out until the screeching had ended.  Do not waste your money on Mike Doughty!  I beg you 
 I am so glad that I purchased this Brad Maldau album first.  After seeing all these rave reviews for this album, with comments that tell me this is his trio at its strongest, I know that Mehldau is not for me.  I will give him one star for his strong fundementals, but that is all I have good to say.  Where is the heart, where is the fire.  Some people say "you don'nt understand, it is supposed to sound cold and haunting"; to this I say, look at Bill Evans.  Even at Evan's most sparse and meditative, he always had that subdued passion; that is just not there with Mehldau.  Even Mehldau's syncopations seem forced and predictable.  His voicings are the worst--tediously homogenous. The whole thing sounds so terribly forced: as if someone made him make the album at gun-point. The hipe about Mehldau must be the fact that there are'nt many new musicians playing this kind of original material these days.  I could see people going to Mehldau as an easy access into this type of jazz (or jazz in general) and not knowing any better and thinking that he is expressive.  Even worse, some might think that this is what "introspective" jazz is like and become completely turned off.    His playing is so lifeless that its scary.  If you need an introspective, meditative pianist, look harder or look to the past.  
 Mark Steyn in Broadway Babies Say Goodnight (Musicals Then and Now) has accomplished an unique objective.  He has written a book that is meant to appeal to people whose veiws are strictly politically conservative, love musicals (particulary fond memories of older musicals that they are in fact too young to have even seen) and do not know any actual facts about the history of the genre so the author's glaring mistakes will not prove an annoyance.  Even stranger is that he has found these people and, God bless them, they have the book they have always dreamed about.  For anyone else, this can be a bit of a slog.  It is funny (espcially if you like puns) in places but the arguments are so often backed up with mistakes as to be worthless.  This book is not truly bad.  It is just simply odd.  If you like Mark Steyn (this book is more about him anyway) then enjoy.  Othewise, it is worth a pass 
 This is an extremely cheap product (poor grade of plastic) and sound quality is...for the lack of a better word...gross! The earbuds that came with my ipod are 10 times better! It's on it's way back! STAY AWAY 
 I'm afraid, very afraid for the Preston/Child team. I loved their early books and recommended them to countless friends. But their latest offerings (specifically, Brimstone and its sequel, The Book of the Dead) show signs of too much fame and too much formula. They're writing less well and they're trying to write "blockbusters," hoping, I imagine, for that booty call from Hollywood. Significant portions of both Brimstone and BotD are set in Italy - and we know what that means, don't we? It means, "We've caved in to pressure from agents/publishers/Satan and decided to try to shove our way onto Dan Brown's overcrowded coattails." It's a little bit sickening, really. In books like Thunderhead and Mount Dragon, you felt you were in the hands of someone who knew the territory he was describing--knew it inside and out, and could take you there. P & C's Italy is generic, google-search, Lonely Planet Italy. Sure, they've been there. Who hasn't? But it isn't what they really know well, and the result is a warmed-over hash of Italian sterotypes and shibboleths that make you shake your head in disappointment. Doug, Lincoln: Why'd you do it? Brimstone isn't a terrible book, though there are at least a half dozen particulars of the central mystery that the authors never explain or wrap up. What's terrible is that it's like 50 other assembly-line thrillers, and their books, once upon a time, were unique. Now that the Wal-Martization of the Preston/Child franchise is nearly complete, I worry that there's going to be less and less reason to keep shopping here 
 I purchased this item a a reputable retailer in New York, NY (B&H Photo).  You couldn't beat the price of $139.95 plus tax for a 5GB mp3 player with FM tuner and speakers.  I had a problem with the set up.  I was not able to install the music management program to get my music onto the player.   The player did not come with any CD so I installed the software as instructed by Virgin's "customer support."  and as per the quick start manual.  I also updated the player with the latest firmware as per the instructions of customer support.  I still could not transfer my songs.     I've e-mailed them twice within 24 hours detailing my situation but all they wrote back was to do the same thing all over again as I explained abve.  They kept referring me to the web site but there is no link for the management software.  It only have the firmware updates and the player desktop update which does not contain the music management software.  The only thing that works is the FM tuner.   The player along with the speakers is a great deal for the money.  However, given the fact that I cannot put my music on it doesn't make it worth it 
 This is maybe a 4 Star book - IF, and ONLY if, this is the first book on Jack Welch and GE you have picked up.  If you have already read "Jack" skip it.  There is nothing here that hasn't already been said elsewhere. I was disappointed how little "new" information was presented in this book.  If you are looking for something on the topic of controlling your own destiny this title is somewhat misleading.     
 4 poor examples from the horror industry, have a allnighter with all 4 film and you'll get a good nights slee 
 This is the first of Benford's I've read, and I was disappointed. The idea of the intelligent black hole, while not totally novel, was fascinating, and supported by utterly convincing fact-based detail about ergospheres, magnetically controlled plasma, Alfven waves, and the Kuiper belt.  But when it moves beyond his area of expertise, astrophysics and the bureaucracy of big science, the story suddenly seems sophomoric.  This is basically an old-school 1940s pulp/Trek/Independence Day style plot.  I found quite a few implausibilities in the alien's history, the reaction of Earth's population to it, the politics, and the ability of scientists to outwit the US security apparatus.  The first 3/4 is very slow, although it gives a good picture of what it's like to be a high pressure astronomical researcher.  The characters seem cliche - the superior, cultured Brit, the spunky female astronaut.  The love story is nicely mature, but still slow and kind of wooden.    The biggest fallacy and irritant in the book was it's rah-rah anthropocentrism, with good ol' American homo sapiens managing to do what thousands of other civilizations couldn't - kick the alien's [...].  There were also a few disparaging remarks about Carl Sagan, whose alien contact novel 'Contact' is light years better than this one - in my opinion the best.  If you want to learn about plasmas and scientist's rivalries, read this book.  If you want a convincing alien contact story, read Sagan.         
 The good thing about the book is its abundant information (more than you need, actually).  However, the writing is horrible!  I can't imagine how a person--a college professor in this case--can come up with such a poor job despite a very clear-cut framework.  Redundant and illogical paragraphs are no surprise in this book.  The first edition is bad, but believe me, the second one is even worse! Also, be fully prepared for loads of typographical errors and the mix-up of figures 
 Verynice looking however I had to return mine because the plastic separator that keeps your writing from bleeding through to the next checks carbon copy was about a quarter inch too short and did not cover the date on the checks. It was also a bit on the thin side so even if it did cover the date I'm not so sure it would keep someone who write's a little harder than the norm from getting bleed through writing. Side note- would be a little nicer looking if the corners were rounded instead of square but would have kept it if the other hadn't been a problem. The service was excellent from Belt Outlet. Arrived in a normal amount of time.. Very courteous when I called and explained why I would be returning 
 Writing style a bit stodgy, but a lot of good fact based information on the subject of the much hyped Hyrogen economy which I have not seen set out so clearly or comprehensively anywhere else 
 What could have been a hilarious, informative account of breaking outlandish old-fashioned laws and getting (or not getting) in trouble for them turns out to be no more than the story of a couple of clueless young British guys (I think the author is around 23) wryly making fun of America's perceived backwardness. Sometimes it just seemed like they were trying to do things and, when they couldn't, they outright gave up on some great chances. The Swedish girls in Frisco: WHY include it if it didn't come to fruition and, furthermore, involved no lawbreaking??? I'm still wondering why they included their 2-page tour of Hearst Castle when it was little more than a miniscule travel log (cool, Hearst had Greco-Roman statues in his poolroom).  They don't get arrested and they don't really accomplish anything. Too bad 
 Patty really wants to settle down, get married, have a baby, and get that house with a white picket fence. She is in love with her best friend and former fiance, unfortunately, several years ago, Ethan broke their engagement because he's gay. Ethan even sets up Patty on a couple of blind dates, one of which is probably a good match for her, but since Ethan is in her heart, she has no room for anyone else, and he manages to marry her best friend.  Patty, not wanting to accept life without Ethan, proposes that they instead have a baby since neither is in a serious relationship and both want to be parents. Ethan surprisingly goes along with it in a moment of despair, and Patty is bummed to discover that a single encounter results in a pregnancy (she wanted more practice).  I really was disappointed with the storyline. I found Patty's character to be really sad and lonely and so willing to settle by wallowing in self pity. The ending only proves how sad and lonely Patty is destined to remain, particularly with her best friend so happily married and pregnant herself 
 Early on and ever so earnestly Shaw likens the process of choosing a sushi chef to choosing a psychoanalyst. If you are convinced that finding the right person to slice your fish is every bit as important as selecting a specialist to help cut through your neuroses, then this book is for you -- and you must be fortunate to have nothing more dire to angst over than the shape and thickness of your morsel of toro.  It is impossible to overstate the gravity that attaches to each piece of Shaw's advice to restaurant consumers; in his guide to how to how make friends and win influence with your carefully seleted sushi chef, he leads you by the hand through each step of the ordering process -- first "make eye contact"; then: "try to say with your eyes 'very serious sushi customer coming your way'"; next "order two pieces of sashimi...do not place the rest of your order, just get those pieces...reflect deeply as you chew...if you did like it, this is time for a knowing smile...[then onward] announce 'Now, sushi!"  and on and on goes paragraph after paragraph as though writing the liturgy for the most solemn of occasions.  There's a 37-page chapter on how to fawn all over the minion who answers the restaurant's phone-- "call every day and become the reservationist's best friend. Talk to the reservationist as if he or she was God." You get the idea. To Shaw, fine dining is a religious experience, and this book gives nothing less than talmudic fealty in its devotion to prestigious eating establisments. It had me nauseous in no time 
 I've read a lot of the books in the series, and Hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers, but I have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries.  My main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author--his well-crafted mysteries almost always hold water, but not this one.  I whole-heartedly recommend most of Hillerman's other Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novels, but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill, this is not the book to pick up.  
 The ebook version contains maps, figures and pictures which are unreadable 
 I am an avid Michael Crichton fan and have read pretty much everything he has written aside from his nonfiction books.  Crichton's writings are often full of action, complexity, character development, as well as a deeper underlying theme or message about society, technology, and human nature.  The Great Train Robbery was either lacking or painfully deficient of every one of these elements.  As I expressed in the title, it is written more as a historical documentation of an event rather than a traditional novel and is frequently interrupted by lengthy explanations of historical perspective.  The Victorian criminal slang used (although brilliantly) to tell the story makes it a slow, and at times, unintelligible read.  I give it two stars because it is obvious that Crichton has written a well thought out, well researched book; I only wish it didn't feel like I was reading his history report 
 I bought this before a monthlong trip to MT hoping it would be a good resource. The author has bitten off more than he can chew--too shallow, not authoritative,  and not the book I thought it would b 
 I bought this based on the glowing customer reviews. I'm new to meditation and thought this would be a good start. I was wrong. There was nothing I liked about this. I found Ms. Larson's voice annoying, not soothing. It's very nasal.  I didn't like the background music either. It was too synthetic.  I was unable to get into any kind of zone or relax. Cannot recommend this 
 Because we are human!! We have the same greedy and lustful desires as everyone else. Anyone who disagrees and uses some theology on why we don't and how and why everyone can and should resist this is a hypocrite. Evangelicals are the epitomy of hypocrisy. 
 This is basically a book of few words, many uninspiring photographs, and a some weak hints here and there that reveal to you the astonishing secret of clutter-free living: just buy a bunch of cute and clever containers to store all your junk!  There is virtually nothing meaty in this thing about how to get organized and STAY clutter-free.   
 Simon & Garfunle wrote a lot of forgettible music(most notably for the film The Graduate, which would have been a better film without thier dated msuic).  This cd dates very badly as all thier music does, it's got a very limited appeal, only for diehard fans, but beware thsi music really sounds DATED, I mean it's really unlistenable 
 As a big fan of both Mulligan's and Piazzolla's works, I was incredibly disappointed by this CD. Recorded in 1974 (need I say more?), the session finds both artists straining to find common ground, periodically relying on cliches that complement the '70s percussion perfectly. This would have made a nice soundtrack for a Starsky & Hutch movie. Mulligan is one of the most versatile blowers that ever lived, but this pairing just didn't work. Yuck 
 The author cannot seem to grasp that there is much discontent amongst the people. She swallows the Islamic doublespeak about women's rights but I'm sure she wouldn't tolerate one tenth of what Iranian women must endure. Also she is fixated on being a blonde in Iran. Weird 
 I really wanted to like this book, but it pains me to say that is was terrible.  I am mystified why the author chose to call the book Charlotte because after JA's portion, Charlotte is rarely mentioned.  The rest of the story is a collection of rambling, tedious speeches by minor characters.  The story becomes ridiculous when the author introduces piracy and horse racing into Sandition.  It ends with the inevitable, but unbelievable uniting of Charlotte to Sidney.  It is unbelievable because they have barely had 2 or 3 superficial conversations in all of the author's addition to JA's fragment.  Don't waste your time on this one, check out Sandition instead 
 It claims to be "the saddest story I have ever heard". Well, it is certainly not the saddest story I have ever read. Usually, sad things happen to good, thinking people. It is beyond my understanding how this tepid book can have so good a reputation. No doubt, adultery and the passions that surround it can be a great subject to write a novel, but the problem here is that characters are at the same time plain and unsympathetic. The trick, in my opinion, is that they pass for profound people, when in fact they are void, useless and jobless persons. The florid language in which the book is written gives the impression of psychological depth, but the truth is these characters have not much to search for within their personalities. Edward Dowell, the narrator, is the typical cuckold, unaware that his hypocritical wife is sleeping with another man -his friend, to make it worse- under his nose. Fool. Florence Dowell is a typical hypocrite (funny, they all seemed to me to be the "typical" something, which may tell you how profound I found them), an emotional blackmailer. Her husband gives his life to her, devotes himself to take care of her illness, and she goes and sleeps with a friend. And she's not even sexy or wicked or nymphomaniac. She's just an unfaithful common woman. Pig. Leonora Ashburnham is at the same time proud, detestable, arrogant and fool. She devotes her life to mend the fences broken by her irresponsible, philandering husband, who spends all his money on other women and gambling. Leonora is always there for him. Dumb. And John, well, John Ashburnham... Lucky guy. Rich, seductive, idle, always generous to easy women, always losing money and depending on his wife to talk to creditors. Always with nothing to do but seduce other women, including friends' wives. Pathetic loser.  The funny thing is, everybody knows what's going on but no one does anything about it, and later they all complain and are perplexed. Boring and despicable lives make, in this case, for a bad novel, representative of the worst traits of XX century literature. The ending is exhilarating by way of trying to be tragic and moving 
 The Band deserves a first rate boxed set, and we have seen various greatest hits and other packages.  The problem with this collection, besides its inflated price, is that the two main audiences for this (completists & solid fans) are both poorly served by this bilious box.    Completists will have all of the previously released stuff and will be wasting money on having it all yet again.  Dedicated followers (not fanatics), mainly drawn by the idea of a single source for some of the best released material, will be wasting money on alternate takes and previously unreleased material which just does not live up to the released material.  Remember, there is usually a reason unreleased material was "unreleased."  The book, etc. will sit on the shelf after one read through.   Why did I purchase this?  I am a Band completist - albeit one who feels more than a bit ripped off by this over-inflated marketer's ploy to pull in both segments of the market.    My advice for the 90% of the people who just want a really good Band collection?  Find the out of print two CD set "Kingdom Come," and pick up the "Last Waltz," and you will be MUCH happier, and still several bucks ahead of the game.  
 As with the reviewer of the Wachsmuth & Krogmann Thomas the Tank Engine, that clear little plastic piece designed to light up the tank fell into the tank after the third time we filled it. Then water leaked everywhere, including onto the electronics. Apparently the plastic is simply glued into the tank and with even the slightest touch it falls back inside. When you place the tank back onto Thomas this piece fits over the other clear plastic piece that houses the actual bulb light. This apparently is enough to cause the piece to loosen and fall into the tank. There is no way to fix this or any warning NOT to touch it. In the course of normal filling its almost guaranteed you will touch this at some time. I dont know about you, but mixing toddlers, water and electricity is a recipe for DISASTER!!  CHILDREN SHOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED ANYWHERE NEAR THIS PRODUCT!! THIS IS A MAJOR DEFECT AND SAFETY HAZARD!!!! THE PRODUCT SHOULD BE RECALLED!!! 
 I read so much about her down to earth humor and wit that I picked her up. You have to be really right wing, and realy christian to truly enjoy her book. And if you are, you will enjoy her breezy depictions of her marriage, identify with her horror at discovering her son has succumbed to the `homosexual lifestyle' (as the blurb puts it.) and egg her on all the way, upbeat despite all her travails. If you are slightly more iiberal, you will question the very basis of this book, think her humor extremely offensive (he cannot be gay, he is a christian) and believe there are many people who have lead much more difficult lives than her, who do not try and make a book out of it. 
 Gave up after 64 pages, what a sham, the heroic hero calls his SEAL buddy Harry, the man's name is Dan Harris, the President is called Woody for no explained reason as his name is Robert X. Hayes, Ramstein Air Base, Germany is called Ramstein Air Force Base, the White House security people will let just anyone in to see the Pres, you can't be serious, "the hero's lean biceps bulged under the fabric of his black polo shirt he was wearing" did we have to be told that he was wearing the shirt after being told of the bulging business, either consign this joke to the trash can or give it to a person that you really dislike. Minus 3 stars 
 This volume is a book about something.  But its not about Robert Johnson, its not about escaping the Delta, and its hardly about the blues.  It is more a rambling chronology of popular music, and the ways in which Blues is nested into that overall context.  It is as much or more about musicians other than blues musicians.  And when it focuses on "blues musicians", it goes to great and repeated lengths to demonstrate they were not really "Blues" musicians at all.  We understand them to be such today, the author labors, because Blues sold.  In fact, the author repeats, the "Blues" musicians we have come to revere liked to play, and did play, other kinds of music as much or more than blues, including ragtime, tin pan alley, fife and drum and spirituals.  See?  They weren't really blues players at all.  They were versatile musicians forced into this genre by the music business, many of them preferring to play something other than blues.  Huh.  Further, the author posits that latter day (white?) blues musicians are not really playing the blues either.  They are acting "as if", affecting musical styles and inflections that are not their own.  Sort of make believe blues performing.  Imitating the blues musicians of yore, and not authentically expressing themselves in their own right.  Despite Fred McDowell's and John Lee Hooker's assertion that "the Blues is a feeling", the author would apparently have us believe that it was only THEIR feeling, not one available to others.  Suffice it to say, the author and I do not share a fundamental view of what the Blues is.  Would I buy, read, or reccommend this book.  No, no and no.  It isn't what it says it is.  And what it is is superficial in its depth of understanding of Blues expression, and how and where that happens 
 The main ingredient should be SALT! 750mg per serving and there are 2 servings per can. Come on, we usually sweat or need more salt in the Summer, but we tend to eat more soup in the Winter. My first impression was "boy this is salty". It would be great as a gravy but so is a much cheaper Cambell's cream of mushroom. 
 This movie was so bad (How Bad Was It?) that I turned it off after about 25 minutes. This is only the second time in my life I stopped watching a movie because it was so poorly done. DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE 
 My boys have grown up with Dave Hood playing all sort of characters like Busdriver Dave, Pilot Dave and Fireman dave. I was excited to get this new DVD as my youngest is crazy for tractors and dump trucks.  Unfortunately, there's a new Dave (kind of like the change that took place in Blues Clues) and it's just not the same.  The new Dave is not bad perse, but after years of Dave Hood's cheesy grin, I can't say that we watch this one much if at all 
 Albeit you'll learn many things about Area 7 & 8. Although you'll learn about chemical  and nuke weapons, this book's really boring. Each chapter begins with a persecution. So, how many persecutions could you read in a book? How many times the book's hero can save himself or being save by other person? At half book when you're still reading persecutions, you'll know that Schofield and Gant will survive. About the inexistent love story that of course is pathetic I won't write more. So if you like my kind of books (check my listmania! list) don't read this one 
   Iknow that sets like this aren't going to look great, but this set is so bad that in some scenes you see nothing and sound drop out will drive you crazy 
 Cold Mountain is an unfortunate novel.  It is unfortunate it won the National Book award (why did it win?).  The novel has an unfortunate structure; Fraser simply strings along one incident after another, with little connecting thread.  The weight of flashbacks alone drags the novel to the ground (and it hardly gets off the ground in the first place!)  There are glaring anachronisms.  It is difficult to believe that some of the sentiments he puts in his characters mouths could have been uttered in 1864.  This is a forgivable sin, if the novel is well written, if it rises about the banal, if it offers something more than surface.  But this novel is all surfaces and all banality.  Its publication is indicative of some of the pathology of today's publishing world (this will be a BIG novel, this will become a BIGGER film, which will sell more of this BIG novel).  Too bad for us the novel does not justify the claims of its promoters.  Fraser's eight million dollar advance for his next work is probably a clarion signal of another BIG novel to come 
 Eat two grams of fiber for every 90 calories.  That's it.  That's the book.  To some degree, that's the case with a lot of these diet books, but most of them reward the investment with a wealth of health information, nutritional studies, and medical data.  This book is light on the writing, heavy on the filler -- a couple hundred pages of menu options, for instance.  I couldn't shake the feeling that this was a rather cynical moneymaking gambit -- a Florida cardiologist trying to capitalize on the South Beach Diet by coining the 2:90 brand.  In any case, there's nothing wrong with the book, or the advice it contains.  Eat more fiber -- go on, do it.  But this isn't a very good book, and the whole thing was too rife with self-conscious branding for me to enjoy.  
 Although this book contains 27 house plans, in my opinion only a very small percentage of these are innovative enough to warrant publishing. The most exciting being the design by Earth Rammed Works which could have  easily taken over the whole book and I wished it had.! Some of the designs  used new  energy saving materials such as photovoltaics, but these were not  given explanation space and left the reader feeling quite frustrated 
 This book reads like a hand picked set of scientific facts woven together to support the argument that dogs are not man's best friend at all.  Although interesting and informative in some parts, this book is also repetitive, meandering and overly negative in others.  The first half of the book runs through some interesting observations about the genetics of dogs and their behavioural links to wolves.  This is interesting and you can read through it in one enjoyable sitting.  However, as the book goes on you notice that Budiansky gets more and more negative about dogs, using a thinly veiled veneer of science to try and make his arguments look objective.  He basically describes domestic dogs as being inferior mutations of wolves.  He seems to be trying to tell us that we need to face up to the fact that our dogs don't love us, but that instead they are using us like parasites.  Moreover, all their signs of affection, play and obedience are actually just instinctive behaviours that have evolved to help them in the wild.  OK - if this corresponds to your experience with dogs then this is the book for you.  For me, I haven't got time to read all the underlying scientific papers but this just doesn't square away with empirical evidence.  Budinsky himself makes a point of the fact that comparatively little scientific research has been conducted on dogs.  This doesn't seem to stop him from using what has been done to denigrate them.  Overall this book doesn't give man's best friend any credit at all, and I suspect that many dog owners would find it quite disturbing.  The fact that it tries to use science to back up its bias claims is even more troubling 
 Much to my chagrin, I have discovered that the book cover does not match the one that Amazon advertised, but two things bother me immensely:  1)  I noticed that the book came from India and that the ISBN # for this book does not match the ISBN # I had ordered.  2.) It is a first Indian reprint, 2006 and states: "This edition is manufactured in India and is authorized for sale only in India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.  This has left me to wonder if the content in this book even matches the content of the book that I need for my course which starts in three weeks.  Where is the quality control 
 Is "Ladykillers" a buddy-caper movie? Is it a religious metaphor? Is it a quirky comedy with supernatural overtones? Is it "Reservoir Dogs"? Is it a star-making turn about an unforgettable character?  It apparently tries to be all these things.   What it ACTUALLY is is an unfunny, schizophrenic, mean-spirited mess.   The movie starts out with great promise. Tom Hanks stars as what appears to be a somewhat-pompous, Edgar Allan Poe-quoting, Colonel Sanders vest-wearing, over-educated, genteel Southern professor of Renaissance music. What he actually is is a (still-likable) con-man and swindler. At least, that's what he starts out as at the beginning of the film. His dialogue is supurb, his accent and portrayal spot-on.   He decides he wants to rob a casino. In order to do this he devises a scheme to tunnel into the casino's counting room from underground. To fascilitate his plan, he lets a room in an old woman's house close to the casino, and convinces his landlady that he actually needs her basement to practice with his band of musicians. He cobbles together an unlikely assemblage of partners in crime, which include a Chinese general who has a Hitler complex (he even has a Hitler mustache), a strange jack-of-all-trades and explosives expert who can't stop farting, a stupid football player to do the digging, and Marlon Wayans, who plays the beyond-stereotypical black thug who loves rap music and constantly threatens to shoot people with his gun while yelling expletives. The Chinese general has a total dialogue of four words the entire movie (I'm not kidding, I counted!) and the football player about 12. What the point of those two characters was I'm not really sure.  Now, you'd think that with such a motley crew, there would be slapstick humor galore. Well, nope. There are "incidents" which often revolve around farting, one scene where a guy blows his finger off with explosives (I THINK that was supposed to be funny---it's tough to tell) and a lot of scenes with Mr Wayans saying "F-this" and "F-that" while waving his gun around.   Still, for the first 75% of the movie, I was still fascinated--simply because Tom Hanks' character is so unique and so memorable. His genteel humor and dialogue (which seems to come directly out of PhD theses on esoteric medieval literature, Rococo music theory and Edgar Allan Poe) and his portrayal of such is fascinating. Unfortunately, even that is not enough to carry the movie, as it loses focus and becomes mean-spirited about 3/4 though the movie.  After what appears to be an attempt at a quirky buddy-caper flick, about 3/4 through the robbers decide that it is necessary to kill their landlady. They are very serious about this. Suddenly things aren't funny anymore. Marlon Wayans' character gets killed in a struggle with the farting explosives expert after he attempts to kill the landlady. This is not funny. He is not killed in a funny way--- and why is there suddenly killing anyway, when the tone of the movie up to that point had been slapstick humor? They dump his body off a bridge onto a garbage barge going down the river. Not long afterwards, the Chinese general kills the explosives expert by choking him graphically with piano wire while he is farting. Apparently this is also supposed to be funny --- but is actually extremely not funny. It is sick and disturbing. They dump his body off the bridge onto a garbage barge going down a river. Soon after the Chinese general tries to kill the landlady and kills himself by accidentally falling down the stairs. Body to garbage barge. Tom Hanks tries to convince the football player to kill the landlady. He refuses, but accidentally shoots himself in the face with the gun while on the bridge. His body falls of it's own volition onto the garbage barge. This is extremely graphic, violent and not funny. Finally, a head of a gargoyle falls off the bridge and hits Tom Hanks on the head, and his body falls into the garbarge barge, too. Everyone's dead. The landlady keeps the money.   What's the point?  If it wasn't for the quirky performance Tom Hanks gave, this would have been a one-star for me.   Avoid it unless you're stuck on an airplane or are a big Tom Hanks fan. 
 Colorado's San Juan Mountains from Durango to Silverton to Ouray is my  favorite place to vacation in the USA.  So when I saw the preview of  Durango Kids on another DVD, I decided to rent it on Netflix.  It is  one of those movies where villains are cartoonish, and the kids, while cute, outsmart all the stupid adults.  The first 30 minutes showed some nice locations in and around Durango, including the steam train (that's why I purchased a used copy) but then it goes into time travel to save Ouray from becoming a ghost town and the movie becomes a stupid bore, intended for young and undemanding children.  Don't bother unless you love Durango as much as I do 
 Disappointment quickly followed excited anticipation after reading the first story. Hoping it would get better I kept going just to become more and more exasperated and frustrated. I realized that I was actually angry at having been taken for a fool. In my opinion, Mr.Lehane used his fame to bring back some of his previous work which sounds like lines written with no purpose other than to lose the reader or even worse: a small attempt " a la Steinbeck" in Out of Dogs which came too close to  "Of mice and men"which WAS a great story 
 I was vacationing in Kenya when I finished "Eldest" and needed a new book desperately.  The only book of interest I found a bookstore in Mombasa was Crossroads of Twilight.  For some reason I do not remember, I read all previous 9 books in the Wheel of Time epic (and I use that in the negative sense).  So I place the blame squarely on my shoulders for reading such an awful book.  Jordan creates a fascinating world, but after Book III, he gets lost in his own story.  Honestly, and without exaggeration, there is not ONE plot development in this book.  Yes, that's correct: not one thing of importance happens in the 800+ pages.  Unfortunately, that has become the norm for Robert Jordan.  If you just have to finish this series (I am officially at the "I could care less" stage), do yourself a favor and skip this book and go on to Book XI. 
 This book was so boring I couldn't even finish.  The book was nothing more than the character "Roo" ranting about her miserable pathetic teen life on her boat and at her school.  And those footnotes!!!!!!!!!! That was terribly annoying!!!!!!!!  This book is definitely not one I would treasure 
 I was never a fan of Steve Martini, and, unfortunately or not, I will not be one after having listened to this audio adaptation.  Now, sometimes bad audio versions of book can be due to the ineptness of the reader.  But Joe Mantegnas reading was full of energy and nuance, what there was available.  I believe the problem lies within the source material.  Martini has committed the cardinal sin of courtroom thrillers--hes made them boring 
 The premise of people with animal DNA I thought had potential for interesting differences and conflicts.  Having read and enjoyed other paranormal and "romantica" novels, the reviews had me looking forward to this one.  The main characters were attractive enough, and although the plot was fairly predictable the book's biggest disappointment was that the hot encounters between Callan and Merinus was so motivated by an overwhelming chemical dependency (via Callan's pheromones) that the sex was disturbingly and distractingly involuntary--like a drug addiction.  If this sounds like it would bother you, look elsewhere 
 Gloom and doom with a left wing slant.  Peak oil is real but this guy is extrapolating many trends to arrive at his version of a gloomy future.  The sky is falling, the sky is falling 
 I received nothing of sailing value beyon paying attention to the local tide tables, along with ebb & flood flows... The story was interesting on how two fellows of different social levels were able to enjoy time on a small boat.  The ending left me empty and unsatisfied.  If you are from or sailed the North Sea area of East Friesland (Germany), it will be most interesting, because of the detailed maps of the area.  Looks simular as seen from GoogleEarth map 
 If you're looking for real recipes using roses as the ingredient this book is pert near useless. Yes, there are recipes, that the author has copied verbatim, in "olde world" language that is hard to understand.  "Take drie rose leaves and keep them close in glasse" and what is a "grosse powder" how much is "twentie graines", or "half a drame"?  What the heck is a "Taffety bag"?  Very quaint, but can someone translate please?  I gave the book a 2 because it is pretty. If you want more than pretty, if you really want to know how to dry roses or cook with rose hips and petals, this book doesn't deliver. 
 HORRIBLE is the only word I can think of to describe this product.  I'll preface my comments by saying that I do not consider myself to be an audiophile.  I am an average guy who wanted to be able to listen to my Sirius Sat Radio or iPod throughout my house and in my backyard while relaxing or entertaining.  Here was my experience with these speakers -  I received them on Friday, they were very easy to setup, and connected easily to my Sirius receiver in my Office.  The first thing I didn't like about the speakers was that even when connected to the power supply they were not very loud.  At max volume in a quiet office, they were at a decent volume but not what I consider to be loud.  More of a background ambience level, not a pure listening volume.  I then took the speakers into my backyard.  I set them on my patio roughly 20 feet from the transmitter, but outside of my brick house.  The sound quality was HORRIBLE.  Lots of popping, hissing and drop outs, while only 15 feet from the transmitter.  I opened my windows in my office, tried all 3 of the avaialble channels, nothing improved the reception.  When I could hear these speakers, at full volume they were barely loud enough to hear about 10 feet away from the speakers.  It was impossible to hear them at all in the furthest corner of my yard.  I tried moving the speakers to that corner of the yard and completely lost the signal from the transmitter about 50 feet from my house - nothing but static at that point.  This morning I took the speakers into my Kitchen - roughly 40 feet from the transmitter with 2 walls between - the only place I could get a signal on the speakers was sitting them on top of my Fridge.  While there was no popping while in the Kitchen, the hissing was considerably more pronounced in the house.  The volume was good while in the kitchen and could be heard anywhere within that area - but that also includes hearing the hissing throughout the entire space.  This morning I contacted Amazon to return these speakers since they did not meet my expectations.  To add insult to injury Amazon will be charging me to return the speakers as well as the shipping to send them to me.  Since they were over $25 I got the "FREE" Super Saver shipping.  I guess it's only "FREE" if you keep the item, if you return it Amazon will charge you.  Therefore, it's going to cost me about $20 to find out these speakers are HORRIBLE!    As a solution for all of you who are looking for the ability to hear your music in every room of your house.  Do an Amazon search for "Whole House FM Transmitter Gold".  For less than these speakers you can buy a Whole House FM Transmitter and pick up your Sat Radio, iPod, TV, etc off of a crystal clear FM Signal.  I received one of these units yesterday as well and I am keeping this.  It produced a signal I could pick up on every radio inside and outside of my House including my Basement.  I will replace these Sony wireless speakers with an under cabinet radio for my Kitchen and a Boombox for my backyard.  My recommendation is to AVOID these HORRIBLE SRS-RF90RK speakers 
 Not especially useful for beginner grass identification because concentrates on structural detail rather than overall appearance of growth.  However, I recommend it for its excellent illustrated glossary 
 Not only is this rife with errors as other reviewers have mentioned, but it completely glosses over Asian edged weaponry and labels it as "mediocre" and "uninteresting".  The book should not be sold as a guide or as a handbook or as anything short of an incomplete and inaccurate school report on European weaponry 
 It's very good book in Probability and Statistics, a must-have for any researcher.  Book's Condition is bad. There're 2 pages severely scratched 
 This book doesn't make any sense. It is so, so, so b-o-r-i-n-g. The book is not well written, and the sentences are way too short. I woudn't recommand this book to anyone 
 I was so disappointed when I got it today in the mail!  I read the reviews and information about it and found it to be a basic baby journal book for you to write in, really stupid and I am so bummed that I got it.  
 This coffeemaker makes the WORST coffee of any I have owned in 26 years.  It "brews" very quickly, losing a "cup" or more of the water added in steam that just pours out of the top.  The coffee is weak and bitter (no matter what brand we have tried).  About the 4th time we used the pot it overflowed, creating a mess of grounds and coffee all over the countertop.  We thought maybe we had put the carafe on the base incorrectly, and were careful to always be sure it was pushed in completely from then on. The same thing has happened twice more. This coffeemaker is a piece of junk 
 This book is dated; the law changes at least one a month, sometimes more often. Your examiner doesn't live or work in the past or regard out-dated laws as useful tools for business. You will never know what is current, right or wrong when you trust a dated law book. NO. NO, NO, NO, GET SOMETHING NEWER 
 I liked the first one so I bought.  I'm still not clear on how Darcy stays alive after being in a coma for about a month in the 1800's.  Did they have IV drips back then?  If you can put up with it being totally unrealistic, it's not bad.  
 This book tries to defend the defenseless, and misses the entire culpable behavior of Pope Pius XII.  Diaries, letters, reports, and books that attempt to excuse Pope Pius XII are guilty of condoning the very actions that this title attempts to hide in "The Myth Of Hitler's Pope".  The book fails to point to the one thing the Pope could do, that was totally within the Pope's power, and what the Pope should have been expected to do: "Expel the wicked man from among you."  1 Corinthians 5:13.  What Rabbi David Dalin reveals as a Communist propaganda, was just plain acquiesce to the murder of millions of his fellow Jews.  This Catholic Pope knew better than most, that the Church is to judge those inside the Church and that we are not even to associate with anyone that calls himself Catholic, or that is sexually immoral, greedy, an idolator or even just a slanderer, let alone permit the criminal conduct behind the murder of millions of innocent Jewish men, women, and children, again,  all while withholding his power of excommunication.  In fact, by failing in this one excommunication, the Pope made all other excommunications a trivial pursuit.  David Dalin has written an entire book that misses the point by a whole country mile!  As long as Pope Pius XII allowed Hitler to remain a Catholic, the Pope supported his actions, period, and end of story.  There was no conspiracy, just failed responsibility, and lack of action.  David Dalin's book, "The Myth of Hitler's Pope" demonstrates very little except to try and defend the ridiculous.  Gordon A. Stamper    
 This book would've been a "find" if I were in my early teens, but for any adult who considers themselves a bibliophile, this book is just too lightweight.  Yes, it is about books and literature, but the coverage is extremely shallow.  I would consider this to be something like the Reader's Digest Condensed Books form of Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia.  Buy that work instead of you're looking for a good reference work on literature 
 This is my first review for Amazon.  I write this so that some reader can avoid the pain I suffered.  The book was the worst mystery I have ever read.  Wild plot twists have been mentioned by others, nonsensical plot twists are a better description. I found none of the book to be believable and must admit the the only reason I finished to the book was to see if the final half was worse than the first half.  This book was factually wrong in so many ways. Here are a few; 1) The prices listed were off. 2)College professors held office hours late on Friday afternoons. 3) Someone was paid with $1000 dollar bills.    I will give away one plot twist.  Someone has been stealing rare books for months.  Someone is given a contract to kill a girl two weeks before the first attempt is made to kill the girl who happens to be reading the rare book.  The brillant detectives assume the book thefts are to a smart way to cover up the murder.  I would have found the book less offensive if the plot twist was that young aliens were playing with their parents' time machine and that the aliens had given the murder contract in order to prevent their parents' from discovering the youthful indecretion 
 Good if you have lots of time to kill, because it has some pages devoted to useless information such as the stupid poem on page 1022 that has  nothing to do with accounting. It appears the authors placed lots of  "real world" trivia that is boring and useless. Entire page of  964 talks about the reason why Coca-Cola will not do business with Lakers  because they signed Pepsi spokeman Shaq O'Neill, it has nothing to do with  the subject but  the extra pages makes you think you got something for the  high priced book. If you absolutely need this book, go borrow it from your  public library and save your money.The book manuscript was NEVER approved  by a CPA or business owner but a long list of college instructors. It does  cover all the basics 
 Bill O'Reilly stole his idea for burying his enemies in the sand from Twilight Zone. His vision reminds me of "Manhunter"-- the Michael Mann film not the lame book he based it on. O'Reilly, tall and deformed, is the Tooth-Fairy. O'Reilly is gutter-trash 
 This is what you get when you have a philosopher, other than a backwoods philosopher or a Good Ole Boy Philosopher, talk about this subject....(See Title, leaving out "On))  Some kernals of corn here, but not worth the effort in working through the rest of the "stuff" to find them.   This gentleman didn't have a whole lot to do when he wrote this book!! 
 We used this book in my accounting class. The coverage jumped around a too much for my taste. Also, not having an accounting background, the constant language changes (with no cross references and very superficial glossary), especially between the chapter text and the exercises made the endeavor excruciating. The worst part was not being able to check answers. The answer key should come with the book. Not having an answer key invalidates this books use as a learning tool even if it were better written 
 There was such promise, a woman who had "escaped" her ho-hum marriage, gone back to her roots was finding herself, starting her art work back up, caring for her mysteriously crazy mother, and then she "had" to fall for a monk, and turned this story into a romance novel.  When she "married" herself with knots into the sea, and lovingly talked about mermaids, it had some hope of independence, then it failed, going back to her husband after the "affair" (she got dumped for God.)  She didn't go back stronger, she went back wimpier and needy.  Sure, she had art in a gallery, but whee....where was her growth??  There wasn't any.  Sorry.  This novel leaves the reader disappointed and sad.  Ugh! 
      "Let us be willing to test our spiritual experiences and evangelistic practices by Scripture," Pastor Will Metzger implores (51). Regrettably, Pastor Metzger was loathe to follow his own sound advice, opting instead to test his and the rest of Christendom's spiritual experiences and evangelistic practices by the standards laid down so long ago in the Westminster Confession of Faith (1646). And that is the main reason this latest revised and expanded edition of his ironically titled Tell The Truth (Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press, 2002) remains a wealth of hyper-Calvinistic misinformation.       Twenty-one years after the first printing of Tell The Truth (hereafter, TTT), Pastor Metzger remains deeply troubled that increasingly cynical Christendom is still attempting to evangelize the unbelieving world by showing only the attractive parts of the gospel message, and as a result are creating a vast army of God-damned (literally) pseudo-converts. Pastor Will, who began his career as a campus minister on the staff of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship at the University of Delaware the same year Sir Winston Churchill departed for his eternal reward (1965), believes a return to "biblical evangelism" can reverse the curse of "me-centered" evangelism (38). And so TTT attempts to remedy the current sorry situation by explaining fully the content of the gospel (part 1: pp. 23-86); insuring that gospel message converts intellect, emotions, and will, i.e. the entire soul (part 2: pp. 87-111); explaining proper Calvinistic soteriology (part 3: 112-158); and learning how to competently defend and communicate the faith (part 4: 159-207). If for some reason the reader feels the need to have the main points of TTT rehearsed and/or get some idea how they might be put to good use in the real world, Pastor Metzger offers appendixes A-D (pp. 208-259).         In Pastor Metzger's considered (read: Reformed Church tradition) opinion, the numerous miracles performed by 1st century A.D. evangelists in the book of Acts may be hanged, because there are really only two ways to proclaim Christ: "The airplane of Christian witness has two wings: our lives (conduct) and our lips (conversation)" (25). Strangely, Pastor Metzger offers no scriptural reference(s) to buttress this rather sweeping claim. The omission is particularly glaring given the bitterness of the complaint he voices in TTT's introductory chapter: "Why is there such reticence to examine the biblical basis for methods of witness (especially if they are the ones our church uses)?" (17). The irony is already palpable.       Just a few pages later Pastor Metzger folds and tucks away one of his two wings of Christian witness, observing that numerous religious persuasions and philosophies will also produce positive, observable changes in conduct capable of impressing others (28). But a few pages later the wing is reopened by Pastor Metzger, who now declares new converts may safely conclude they are truly saved when "they see the fruits of a changing life" (38). Fine.       Pastor Metzger next reminds that "in the book of Acts we see the apostles as teachers--reasoning, persuading, explaining--involved in all sorts of teaching activity in order to communicate as much truth as possible to nonbelievers" (34). Unfortunately Pastor Metzger omits the fact that secularists, Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, and numerous other cult leaders are also actively engaged as teachers--reasoning, persuading, explaining--involved in all sorts of teaching activity in order to communicate as much "truth" as possible to nonbelievers. The all-important difference is that unlike these false witnesses of God, the apostles were able to perform many wonders and signs (Acts 2:43). Those signs and wonders authenticated the apostles' divine bona fides, just as they had previously authenticated Jesus Christ's divine bona fides, and the divine bona fides of the true prophets' of the OT before him.        (Where exactly in the NT did Pastor Metzger read that God would go into semi-retirement immediately after giving the apostle John a revelation of the future? Where?)       Pastor Metzger spends the rest of part one differentiating between "me-centered evangelism," i.e., spreading Christianity by emphasizing the many personal benefits that will attend salvation, and "biblical evangelism," i.e. five-point Calvinism. "Conversion is both a turning from and a turning toward" Pastor Metzger insists (67-68). "Both law and love are basic ingredients in telling the gospel story" Pastor M. admonishes (71). Consciences need to be pricked. People must be made to understand that they do not have proprietary rights to their own lives, God does.       Pastor M. is not keen on encouraging new converts to make a public confession of their faith, ala Romans 10:9-10. He thinks they should be left alone to meditate on Scriptures like Isaiah 53, Psalm 51, and Galatians 2:20 (76). Apparently never having read Acts 16:31 or Philippians 2:11, Pastor M. declares "There is not one exhortation in Scripture to `accept Christ as Lord,'" (77).       On page 79 Pastor M. lists three ways to know you are saved. The first is when you "trust in the promises of God as being promises to you." The second is "a change in your attitude and actions corresponding to the fruit of the Spirit (Gal 5) and the marks of salvation (1 Jn)" (Pastor M. ignores his earlier observation that New Agers can also experience profound attitude changes). The third assurance of salvation is "the inner witness of God's Spirit to your spirit." Pastor M. does not unpack that statement, leaving it to the reader to exegete what he will from it. By marked contrast, the gospel writer Mark recorded Jesus' decidedly different criteria for determining who is saved:   And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well. (16:17-18).       Part two tries to distinguish professors of Christianity from possessors of same in order to increase more of the latter. Conversion is a process, not an event Pastor M. cautions. Christianity is not a self improvement plan; it is God's method for restoring you to fellowship with Him. Converts need "to ask God for faith," since "they are not choosing to be saved" (91). Pastor M. then presents a short, biased analysis of the age-old Arminian-Calvinism debate on soteriology, concluding that the five points of Calvinism are "orthodox theology ... in need of further filling out" (109).        Part three, "Wholly by Grace," is largely a continuation of the Calvinist rant begun in part two. Pastor M. admits the arbitrary election of a relative handful to heaven and the overwhelming majority to hell is not fair, but hey, God is sovereign, and He would have been justified to throw everyone in hell, not just almost everyone. Humanity's free will has been disabled by sin, and now it cannot choose anything but sin (if that is true, and doing right is not an option, how could sin then be termed a "choice?"). "God hides the truth from some people. He doesn't reveal himself or Jesus to them. Why (Lk 10:21-22)?" (146). Pastor M. misinterprets that passage in Luke to mean intelligent people are tricked into unbelief by a vengeful or capricious God, as opposed to them being deserving victims of their own misplaced self-confidence.       Part four begins by enumerating some of the difficulties philosophical pluralism creates for successful evangelism. Pastor M. defends Christian exclusivity by referring to John 14:6: Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."  Pastor M. ignores the fact that Jesus' comments were offered to his own disciples at a private gathering, not addressed to the masses in general during a public sermon.       Pastor M. observes all religious faiths save Christianity require its adherents "to do something" (165). Pastor M. apparently has not noticed that repenting, confessing, baptizing, trusting, etc., are verbs.       Pastor M. believes the evangelistic value of Christian apologetics is limited. "God's chosen instrument in conversion is His Word, not our reasoning ability" (169). In that case we can only pity that great swath of humanity that was never taught how to read, or could never afford to purchase a copy of Scripture, or never had the Word translated into their native tongue.       Pastor M. soon changes his mind about God's chosen instrument in conversion. "Prayer for others is the supreme God ordained method in evangelism" (178) As usual, Pastor M. offers no scriptural support for his emphatic, sweeping statement. He goes on to say "evangelism is asking the right questions" (189), but once again cites no NT anecdote to support his contention. Besides asking all the right questions, the Christian evangelist also needs to make sure an unbeliever understands "the impossibility of ... exercising faith on their own" (203). Fine.       In summary, Tell The Truth proffers a pneumatology, a soteriology, and a strategy for evangelism that seems alien to those described in the book of Acts. When all is said and done, TTT is hoisted by its own petard: "... to be unwilling to evaluate our evangelism in the light of the Bible is to not take Scripture seriously" (19). 
 I also bought the hype of NYTimes Best Seller.  Goes to show you some people have really bad taste.  The story was promising and could have been exciting without the awful dialog.  It seems like the author was being paid by the word - too much repetition, entire scenes which added nothing to the story, etc.  I would NEVER purchase another book by this author.  Glad it's over and this ones in the trash can...  Charli 
 Nothing against Ian Fleming. Maybe it's just me, but I couldn't get into this book. The Bond movies are more exciting than the books 
 Roger Ebert is a great movie reviewer and he is the most famous film critics in The United States, but this book will be an unnecessary waste of money.  To find all these reviews, a film lover just has to go to Ebert's website on the Internet.  There, the reader will find all these reviews and many more!   
 The book concentrates on only a few scholarships and if you are not targeting one of these scholarships, the book is a waste of money 
 I got this for my daughter as a surprise, she was so excited UNTIL she actually used it. It showed her at one weight, she stepped off of it and back on, and it showed another weight. Better yet, she lives in the dorms and took it upstairs and weighed up there and it showed an even different weight! Good grief. It also showed her at an acceptable weight, next then underweight, then the next overweight. So, needless to say after others trying it and getting the same errors, I returned it for my money back. Boo, hiss...can I give it a zero 
 I bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old.  Luvable Friend's onsies are awful.  The biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies.  And the velcro doesn't even stick.  They becomes undone and fly loose within minutes.  Also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old. Lastly even the shirt tag stinks. It is this cheap oversized tag that I had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son.  Shame on them for making such a cheap product - shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review!  
 I saw this movie on on demand and I would have to say it is the worst slasher film I had ever seen. The characters are really bad in this movie. The killer is a boney 115 5'5 girl. The way she kills people is so weak. She beat a guy up with a large stick but it looks so weak. It does not even look like it would hurt you. And he some how dies. The movie also made it seem like she kills only bad guys bad guys but she kills everyone. Most of them did  nothing. Don't know why the director seem to hint that she kills only the bad. And it is not even scary at all. It takes place for the most part in the day time. And the killer is the main character making no suspense at all. I would recommend to everyone to aviod this movie at all cost. It is so stupid. I really don't see what the priase the other reveiws gave is all about. All I can say is it is UTTER TRASH!!!! 
 Robert Kennedy says that President Bush is responsible for Hurricane Katrina to hit New Orleans because of global warming.  Not the aftermath, mind you, but the ACTUAL HURRICANE!  Wow, didn't know Bush was a wizard and had the ability to create hurricanes.  But apparently Kennedy thinks so.  Maybe Robert Kennedy is a crime against nature, eh 
 The title says it all. They could have put a better group of songs togather 
 I bought this book expecting to receive a comprehensive 31-day plan complete with recipes.  As I began to write out the recipes, it became apparent that nine of the lunch recipes were missing in the first week  alone!  Since the author does not respond to email at his website, I am  stuck with a lot of expensive health food ingredients for breakfast and  dinner, and no way of knowing what to do about lunch!  It can also be very  difficult to locate a lot of the ingredients, even if you can figure out  what they are.  I don't recommend this book for anyone serious about the  specific diet plan because you will be disappointed.  There are other  points he makes about exercise and self-empowerment that are probably  covered in many of his other books 
 This book was assigned school reading.  I found it rather boring and the language used in the story became annoying after a while.  Not recommended 
 Very nice alarm clock, easy to set up. But huge draw back is that the time screen is not backlit, so if you want to see the screen you have to push a button. Very inconvenient!!!! 
 Like another reviewer, my DVD's were blank--except for the producer's ads.. I'd really like to see the workouts, but do I risk getting another set of blanks, too 
 Great idea that doesn't live up to it's hype.  Two issues, it steals the USB ports completely and often causes problems with one's computer.  More importantly, it doesn't cool down drinks, or even maintain them.  They usually warm up to room temperature within an hour, whether on the coolIT or not.  Disappointing performance 
 Mr. Higgins must wiht nine fingers, because most of the time he has  his pointer aimed at American cutlutre, and its values. On the other hand, Higgins preaches about Christian living, and while he chastises people of his faith, he defends and justifies eroticism and sensuality, solely for their purpose. Attacking a culture and a way of life for sipte sake is not insightful. Hard to read 
 The first time I wrote a review for this book, I gave it 5 stars.However, this book is the least accurate of all the Lucy book I have read, and I have read a lot.  While I was reading it, I noticed that some of the things Mr. Brochu said about Lucy directly contradicted with her autobiography. I didn't think much of it at the time, but then I went to Luie Arnaz's website. She distinctly said that this book was not accurate at all and to skip it.Then everything started to fall into place. This is as much of a cartoon of Lucy's life as anything. Yes, it's touching, but what good is touching if it's not true? Everytime I think about the fact that Mr. Brochu so plainly lied, it infuriates me to tears. If you want to know the REAL Lucy, skip this book. Go staright to her own touching, candid memoirs, "Love, Lucy.&quot 
 I knew I was in trouble with FOUR BROTHERS when I saw that Josh Howard (of SPORTS NIGHT fame) was scowling hard, trying to be a tough Detroit cop. Not believable for a nanosecond. And then it got worse when Marky Mark said, "Why don't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee?"  The rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and clichï¿½d rhythm. Almost every scene in this thing is a howler. And watching it, I remembered I hadn't forgiven Tyrese Gibson for the travesty that was 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS. Still, Tyrese is better than Garrett Hedlund, who looks like he's a refugee from THE OUTSIDERS.  But the movie's not a total wash; after all, it's got a GREAT soundtrack 
 Come on.  This is a book by Jim Belushi.  Need I say more 
 This CD was supposed to expose a new side of Dar Willams, it has failed to do this. The lyrics, and songs are repetitive of previous works. I would suggest buying something else 
 Anyone can write a book like this claiming to be based on extensive research and fact, but often books like this come out completely biased.  Signs of autism usually surface at about 1-2 years of age and at about the time that many vaccines are being given.  Medical records have shown that the increase in autism falls several years after the use of thimerosol being stopped, therefore the children in the group of increased incidence were not even born early enough to have received the thimerosol laced vaccines. By the way, that would be medical records in countries not including the U.S., because yes thimerosol is still used in vaccines in the states.  Although, research has also shown that the levels of mercury in the vaccines are well within the safety limits.  I would hope that anyone getting all riled up over this book would not limit their knowledge of the subject to this one text.  If its going to cause you to go on a crusade, please educate yourself completely and not just regergitate the first thing you hear about a subject.  It will only lead to more ignorance, which this world is in no need of.  
 I learn much more from watching the two great masters in TV than reading their cook books. I was really looking forward to receive these 4-disc DVDs.  Unfortunately when the package arrived, two of the discs were not secured inside the box and there were deep scratches on the surface of the discs.  I returned the set and asked for a replacement.  The second package arrived with the same problem.  A La Carte, the distribution, could have come up with a better packaging than cramping 4 discs inside a single box.  I decided to keep the merchandize because I really treasure this TV series.  But if you are not as crazy as I am, don't buy this set until the distributor comes up with a better package 
 My four year old picked this toy out with a gift certificate given to him by his grandmother.  He already had pirate sets made by Playmobil, but this looked like an interesting addition to the sets.  Well, set up took nearly an hour for his very mechanically able father, and almost as soon as he began to play with it, pieces fell apart.  NOTE:  he is NOT a careless child, nor is he rough with toys.  But this toy doesn't stand up to even the most basic four year old play.      After he had had it up without playing with it for six months, we finally just boxed it.  We found all the parts and sold it for five dollars at a garage sale.  I just hope those people don't come back to reclaim their money.  Save yourself the pain and frustration and buy Playmobil's Pirate Lagoon -- this is just a cheap knockoff 
 This book has a very serious omission on the subject of outdoor cats.  The book does not mention at all that outdoor cats are in grave danger of attack by coyotes in many parts of the country.  Coyotes are in places where many people wouldn't even expect them, such as in cities.  There are precautions you can take to eliminate this danger or greatly reduce the chance of an attack.  Unfortunately, this book does not list the precautions that should be taken.  And by the way, bobcats will also be happy to kill a house cat and similar precautions would apply 
 Well, I know I'm in the minority here.  But a real history of the connection between music and race in America is something that it desperately needed.  One might expect an academic historian to have provided that.  But this book is NOT a good history - it's highly impressionistic and rather anecdotal and full of ideas that aren't exactly explained.  It jumps around from chapter to chapter making much of the impressions that the author has about the 'hidden' messages within songs, but I'm afraid that he states rather than argues or proves his case.  I hope someone out there DOES write the book that's needed.  In the meantime this one is interesting if the style doesn't bother you too much.  
 I don't know who else bought this but I can't imagine what would have happened had we waited to actually get INTO the bed before we turned the thing on...IT FRIED.  Then they tried to charge me the postage and handling when I returned the item.  They did get that quickly straightened out but it was a very frightening purchase.  Always test a product before you risk it on your self or others 
 I wanted a cute & funny desk calendar for my office at work.  I decided to break my tradition of Get Fuzzy calendars, and picked this one up instead.  Big Mistake.  Not only are the photos and captions Not Funny, but some of them are inappropriate for the workplace as well.    I just want to know how you can screw up a cat calendar 
 No offence,but I couldn't agree more with most everyone else who's rated this collection.It just isn't right without Sons Of The Desert,Way Out West,The Music Box and Another Fine Mess.For me the best films in this DVD set would be March Of The Wooden Soldiers,Be Big and The Lucky Dog.The latter being a collector's item going by how it was Stan and Ollie's very first film together,even before they became the famous comedy duo.Utopia would be another collector's item,being their very last film from 1950.I hadn't realised they were around that long.However,their appearance in this film is an eyesore,with Stan so thin and sick looking and Ollie three hundred pounds overweight.One thing you may notice,is the film's remarkable simularity to Gilligan's Island 
 After reading other Network+ books, I found this one to have  many errors. I thought it's test questions at the end of the chapters looked like they were going to be better training material. Big mistake. One answer tells you one thing and the very next answer contradicts what the previous one just stated. I also read Ron Gilster's Network+ for Dummies so you would think the material would contain the same information. The Dummies book tells you a Brouter is found in the Data Link and Network Layer, while this book says it's on the Physical and Data Link layer. Inconstistent information and it's definitely not worth the money I paid. This book will be returned 
 This product serves its purpose, but does not need to cost almost $30!  Basically, it's a foam wedge with white mesh fabric over it. I'm sure you can find the same product that performs as well, if not better, if you take the time to look 
 DO NOT BUY!!! Great movie bad studio!! It has been announced that NEW LINE is replacing Peter Jackson as the director of The Hobbit. The only way to stop this injustice is to hit them were it hurts the wallet. Do not buy or see anything New Line till The Hobbit is returned to its rightful director!!! 
 He writes with a lot of descriptive detail, to a fualt. Every person he mentions gets their biography put in. Way too much extra junk about people no one would ever here of. Chapters start out with the continuing story and quickly break down into the life story of some high ranking account for the PGA, and so on. Read only if you need to get some sleep 
 Say dear, if you are interested in Sgt. York's life, this book might be just what you are looking for, but if you are curious about the war, I don't recommend it.  A very small portion of the book is given to  discussing Sgt. York's involvement in battle, and the rest is  a rather   painfully detailed account of York raising money for schools.  Though his  cause was always worthy, at times the reading becomes mondane with  financial and political jargon.  The book seems to be worth reading, but  perhaps with a little scanning being done. I believe the best part of  Perry's writing, is simply seeing Sgt. York's character and reading his  charming letters.  Ho, ho.  Only read this book if you are prepared to do a  little perservering to find some gold 
 We gave this toy to our 4 year old son.  That was 1 1/2 years ago.  It worked at first, but the balls did not pop up high enough for him to hit.  After about 1 month, the balls did not pop up at all.  Little Tikes replaced it with a completely new toy.  Again, it worked for a few months, but now it does not work.  The beeps sound (a nice feature), but nothing happens.  My son has given up on the automatic feature and will sometimes use it as a t-ball stand.  Most of the balls are lost.  Thank goodness I only paid $10 for this on sale - but not even worth that much 
 When I was 15 and first discovering guitar, I loved this album. Listening to it now, it just sounds incredibly soulless and cheesy.Vai is technically very impressive, but the man can't write a decent song to save his life. Vai's modus operandi is to get a bunch of faceless studio musicians, lay down a generic rhythm track, and go wheedily wheedily wheedily whee for an entire album.  Technique on your instrument is never a bad thing, however, technique should be just a means to an end, not the end itself. And that's what no shred guitarist seems to understand. The fact that shred guitarists like Vai aren't more popular is due to one thing: they're more concerned about playing faster and more cleanly than the next guy rather than writing songs. There's a GOOD REASON why non-guitarists hate this stuff.  Basically, once you get past the "Gee, that's neat" factor, this album, and nearly all of Vai's music, feels incredibly stiff and lifeless.To be blunt, this is what John Tesh or Yanni would sound like if they played guitar rather than keyboards. Not only that, his guitar tone is absolutely awful. Very thin, high pitched, and brittle sounding.  The best thing on here is the blatant Van Halen rip-off "The Audience is Listening": the rest is just masturbation. Vai's best work has always been as a sideman, especially the stuff he did with David Lee Roth, because then he's forced to play actual SONGS, rather than 5 minute long, tedious guitar solos. On his own, he's just unbearable. I considered giving this one star, but I gave it 2 stars due to the fact that Vai CAN play, it's just WHAT he's playing that's the problem. 
 This product was nothing like how I expected it to be. The quality is terrible, do not waste your money on this item  
 Big print, lots of charts and illustrations. Lots of hype, weak content.  I was 50% through and couldn't take it anymore.  I returned the book for a refund 
 Considering that this is virtually the first attempt (as far as I know) at a Dictionary of the Pentecostal/Charismatic movement, this is a good start. It is worth the price for what it does contain but it is not without glaringflaws.The title "International" leads one to expect much more coverage of Pentecost outside of the U.S. Canada, where Pentecostal movements thrived in parallel with those in the U.S., is given very scanty treatment.Some major early Canadian apostles, such as O.J. Lovik, are skipped entirely. There is also too much opportunity given for some controversial movements to propagandize. A balanced article would necessitate an article by an unbiased observer, rather than by the leaders of those movements.Finally, there is too much credence and space given to sociological assessments of a movement that requires, above all else, keen spiritual discernment to separate the wheat from the chaff. That said, I will consult my copy often, for the great amount of useful material it does contain 
 I read parts of this "book" until my intelligence was thoroughly insulted and I immediately returned it to the library. What a stultifying simpleton this man is. He is someone who wants to appear to have all the answers without having any foundation of intelligent ideas. And unsurprisngly, this dolt absolutely embarrassed himself during a recent appearance on the "David Letterman Show" and what made matters worse was just how oblivious he was to his infinite stupidity. First, he claimed that no one should criticize President Bush "because we're at war and it's no good for the country." Come again? I say that such a statement is "no good" for democracy, which is something this submental gasbag has forgotten about. The right to openly disagree with an alderman or a president is guaranteed by the First Amendment. And this man is a graduate of the John F. Kennedy School of Government? Also, he insisted that Cindy Sheehan, whose son was killed in Iraq, not have the right to be publicly upset with President Bush and the invasion of Iraq because "she's connected with left-wing elements in this country." What left-wing elements? I feel that Cindy Sheehan is as connected to left-wing elements as much as Bill O'Reilly is associated with logical reasoning. 
 Less Than Zero was hailed all over the place when it was released....hailed by all but the critics. Sure, it did fair box office, because it had some of the "hip" actors of the day appearing in it AND because it was based on THE hip book (I was right there living it too!).  The unfortunate aspect of the film is that neither the script, the actors, nor the directer ever really provide us with a "baseline" from which we can launch any sympathy for Julian (Downey Jr.). We see he, Clay (McCarthy) and Blair (Gertz) all graduate high school, but we don't know what they were like IN high school. Therefore, as we are thrust into Julian's ever downward spiraling drug habit, we don't know if this is normal or not.  Clay and Blair dated through high school. Julian was their best friend. All three come from obscenely wealthy and priviledged West coast families with little in the way of family values to show them their way in life. Everything has been handed to them and that was it - no real parenting apparently ever took place.  After Clay leaves LA to go East to an ivy league school, Julian and Blair start bedding each other. Even though Blair is contemptible for her actions, it appears that she and Clay are the only two in this film who have any real sense of responsibility and Blair realizes hers late in the film.  Julian's daddy gave him tons of money to start a business and Julian lost it all on drugs and partying. He's been "homeless" ever since, sleeping in parks and at friends houses when he can. In the process, his drug habit has gone from coke to crack and possibly a little heroin along the way. Where does he get it all? Why their high school friend, Rip (Spader) of course. He's not only a major drug dealer, but apparently does some pimping of women and men on the side. Julian is in for $50K to Rip and the only way he can work it off is to turn tricks with guys....  Aint this all uplifting and exciting? Well, it has its exciting moments. And when you consider all the action in this film takes place over Clay's college Christmas break, it's all the more distressing.  The film effectively captures the ambiance of privileged college kids gone wild in the 80's. The clothing and the excess is all very very real. It's a shame that the film just never lets us feel too sorry for Julian. I wanted to shake him or kick his rear end. What a tool! And Clay and Blair...? If I'd been them, I'd have kicked ol' Julian to the curb long before - what a bore taking care of a drug addict (forgive me my seeming lack of concern, but I have ACTUALLY taken care of a drug addicted friend - it gets old really quickly...the lies, etc.).  Anyway, if you allow the script's lack of a true emotional center, then I have to complain about one further thing: Andrew McCarthy. I have never understood why he was a working actor of such popularity. Downey Jr. (amazing in this film, because it was at one of his greatest times of drug abuse - which makes it a true case of art imitating life and vice versa) and Gertz are fine in the film. But McCarthy...I've never thought him capable of acting his way out of a wet paper sack. There's nothing going on there. No emotion. No sense of urgency other than when he moves quickly. His face is blank, completely vacuous...  Anyway, buy this for its value as a real time capsule into some of the excesses of the 80's but don't get it because it's a great film or for any DVD extras, because what's there is slim to none - mostly various versions of the film's trailer.  
 When Professor Polk describes the sweep of history in Iraq, he is at his best, but the book often descends into a political diatribe that is neither appropriate nor grounded in the facts.  Much of the political ranting is supposition, marring what would otherwise be an interesting and informative work. The ranting gets especially tedious towards the end.  My advice, read the first part and skip the last half 
 The sound quality on the DVD was atrocious.  Too bad, given the great Burt Bacharach score 
 Naturally, my hair is wavy, with very thin strands but piles and piles of it. My hair is somewhat difficult when it comes to straightening -- usually it looks fine when I leave the house, but comes completely undone after about four hours. So, when my last Conair straightener broke, I went out and invested my money in this one.  Overall, it's okay. It straightened my hair in one stroke, which is rare for me. However, it seemed to just suck all the moisture out of my hair, leaving it extremely dry and dull (which is definitely not good for a vegan such as myself, since my hair is already dry enough!). The movements were clumsy with this, and I occasionally snagged my hair or burned myself due to the plates unexpectedly shifting toward me. It didn't break, and it's still going just as strong as the day I first bought it.  This straightener had problems dealing with smaller amounts of hair, or the fine "baby hairs" around my forehead. And sadly, it couldn't keep my side bangs straight to save its life -- they were as wavy as ever two hours after I'd straightened it. This straightener does the most minimal job -- at least it straightens your hair somewhat -- but save your pennies for a straightener more worthwhile. 
 This book came out when America was all aflutter with the Communist scare.  China had gone Red.  The Soviets had "the bomb."  We were at war (correction, "police action") in Korea.  And Tailgunner Joe was in his ascendancy.  Mickey Spillane's earlier Mike Hammer novels had been apolitical for the most part.  The villains were just hoods, gangsters, motivated by money.    With "One Lonely Night" Spillane went full-bore anti-communist, without much understanding of the threat beyond the Chicken Little the-sky-is-falling outcry.  The reality was that American communists were self-styled intellectuals talking revolution in darkened Greenwich Village espresso shops.  The laboring class Marx so adored were not having any of it, and the threat wasn't much of a threat at all.    But Spillane made straw men out of the commies and shot them down.  And somehow Mike Hammer was the loser for it.  As a young man in the 1950's I admired the prose in Spillane's first few novels--and then I came to this one and was weaned.  He was way off the mark, but I forgot that until I picked this up again after a hiatus of five decades or so.  I will admit that the first chapter is a gem of writing, perhaps the best Spillane ever did.  But one gem is not enough to get the book much praise.  It's just barely enough to get it two stars from me 
 We bought the 'Amazing Allysen' doll for our 7 year old.  Unfortunately, Allysen is more aggravating than amazing.  She's a pretty doll, but we had a lot of difficulty "programming" her.  You have to squeeze her hand to set the date, time, etc.  No problem, right?  Wrong.  Her hand was so hard to squeeze, my daughter couldn't do it, so I tried to help her.  Long before Allysen was fully programmed, I had to hand her to my husband.  He was a little more sucessful and we now have her programmed.  The other complaint I have is difficulty in communicating answers to Allysen.  She doesn't seem to hear well--I know she's a doll, but the commercials showed a far more advanced Allysen than we received.  She'll ask my daughter what she wants to do next and give her 2 or 3 choices--but she doesn't always understand the answer, even if it's repeated several times CLEARLY.  My daughter has played with her maybe 3 times since Christmas.  She says it's just too irritating.  That's why I'm giving 'Aggravating Allysen' 2 stars.  
 Same stuff you hear in the news.  Doesn't tell you about why or how her marriage broke up or anything else really.  
 The book is written terribly. It is written in a fashion like those cheap supermarket promotion leaflet.   Other Jack welch books can get you the same idea about Jack, but more pleasant reading. You will regret if you spend money/time on it 
 I CAN ONLY SAY, HOW DID SHE GET ON THIS ALBUM??? THE PRETENDERS VERSION OF THIS SONG IS HORRIBLE!! SHE IS SO OFF KEY. IT RUINS THE ALBUM!!!! OH ITS HORRIBLE 
 While I loved My Sister's Keeper, Piccoult has failed to create the same ethically-challenging dilemmas in Vanishing Acts. In my opinion, as the reader discovers the true situation of Delia's childhood relationship with her mothers boyfriend, what loving parent would not do anything within their power to take their child as far away as possible from that situation? I don't think it is nearly as confusing and dramatic a situation as that found in My Sisters Keeper, and after reviewing the facts of Delia's childhood the reader should be able to form a quick decision that her father took correct action. It is also difficult to understand why Delia is so coveted by her male friends, as Piccoult has done little to explain Delia's attractiveness and special qualities. 
 I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It is completely useless. There are only exersises in this book and Ravenwolf isn't bothering about any safety methods. Some of the exersises are fine, but you would find them in other books too 
 The cover blurb made this book sound amazing; if only it were as complex and fulfilling as it sounded.  The book is very dependent upon Katherine's character, yet she simply didn't mesh for me.  She didn't come off as dangerous or interesting; she sounded more like any immature, impulsive, hard-drinking twenty-two-year-old. And the plot seemed bogged down in a "Groundhog Day" scenario, the same scene happening over and over.  There were snippets here and there that showcased talented writing; I agree w/ the other reviewer that Sabina Murray seems more suited to short stories. Over all, the book seemed poorly edited, with no real cohesion or feeling that the plot was moving forward 
 I should have paid more attention to the reviews...I was warned ahead of time that this crate shouldn't be used as an everyday or long-term solution. We've been using the crate for LESS THAN three months and already the zipper one one end (that we use all the time) is screwed up and half the time it doesn't open. At least one of the two zippers on that end can still move so the dog can get in and out, but I'm afraid of the morning when I try to open it and both zippers are fully stuck. (We leave one end open and place the crate up against the bathroom so the dog can at least have a little room to roam plus still have her crate to sleep in. When she gets a little older, we will leave her in her crate all day.) We could still use the zippers on the top, but we don't like those since the dog can't get in and out at her leisure.   Although in general it's a nice crate, I probably would not buy this item again just due to the poor quality of the zippers--hence the two stars. I am completely surprised that we only got three months' use out of it before the zippers bit the dust. We've already purchased a different, sturdier, latch-style crate that we're much happier with...and we should have bought to start with 
 By Love Possessed is one of those gassy, 1950's faux Henry James stinkers about small town life that only a middlebrow critic could love. They did love it, (mostly because it was so pompously unintelligible, I suspect)and because in the 50's people still dutifully read what they were told to read, the thing sold a lot of copies. It's awful. The prose style is this baroque AND roccoco mess, which takes three read throughs to even begin to understand, but unlike a difficult text that a genius like Faulkner might put together, good old Cozzen's text doesn't yeild up any gold for all that digging. It's a stale story about a lawyer whose most interesting action was an affair years ago. NOTHING HAPPENS in this book until the very end, and by then, you couldn't care. Less. Worse, most of the characters are astonishing bigots. There are so many pages devoted to how the hideous Catholics are taking over the country that you begin to suspect that you are listening to Cozzens himself. In fact, you are. The man WAS a hideous bigot. There are anti=Jew, anti-black, anti Irish diatribes that go on for pages and pages. How did this crap get printed? Ah, the power of the middle brow critics in 1950's America. Think they have lost their power? Not entirely. We have them to thank for David Foster Wallace. Oh, and it isn't a coon that gets run over in the road, RE the earlier review -- it's a opossum! And yes, it is the high point of the book. BLEEEEEEEEEEEECCHHHHHHHH 
 This book doesn't make any sense. It is so, so, so b-o-r-i-n-g. The book is not well written, and the sentences are way too short. I woudn't recommand this book to anyone 
 This movie made me sick to my stomach. Here we have a woman like Nora Ephron, a woman with professional job skills and talent and when she marries, she turns into a needy, desperate women whom evidently believes her own self-worth is determined by having babies, one after another. I ususally love all of Meryl's movies, but I could not stand seeing her turn into a needy, always pregnant "homemaker". If I were a man, I would have run awary screaming, too 
 This over-the-top memoir of the glamorous slash grueling experiences of two narcissistic women left me satisfied as a reader. While I felt my stomach curl at passages describing how they sent fancy invitations to A-listers while sending el cheapo e-vites to their close friends, I still managed to enjoy reading about it, similar to the way I like watching Anna Nicole Smith make a complete idiot of herself on national television. 
 I was waiting to get into ths book...then I realized I was halfway thru it.  I always stick with Berg...you never know when you'll get hooked.  But this one did not have it...I was relieved when it ended 
 This book says too little about so much. Save your money and buy a real book not a promo type book for other books 
 This book combined an exciting title with quite disappointing content to me. This is definitely not a book for those looking for solid analysis of the future of markeing and advertising, but just a laundry list of all exciting eye-catching gimmicks using wireless technologies. It looks like a cursory pachworks of materials from newspaper columns rather than a condensed book. 
 This album rates one star only, and that for its historical context.  While other reviews tout it for some remarkable reasons (proving only that there are folks out there who can indeed find something in nothing), the bottom line is that, from a musical standpoint, this is pure [...], plain and simple. John and Yoko fool around with recording equipment, treating the attentive listener to such mind bending treats as flatulance. The only reason the album garnered attention in the first place was the nude photograph of John and Yoko on the cover - the album was sold in a brown wrapper as a result, and the discerning buyer will take that a step further as a warning that the album's contents should be left under wraps as well. I own an original vinyl version - purchased soley as a collectible. I listened to it & was astonished by both the worthless content and the headache it gave me. Buy vinyl if you can find it as a collectible. Save your money and select a different Lennon CD. Unless you like a splitting headache.. 
 While Liz Greene has a smooth writing style, it is unfortunate that it  has not been put to more constructive use.  She identifies some of the key characteristics of Neptune, but views them in an almost entirely negative light.  What is worse, her descriptions of "Neptunian" people and problems are done in a  condescending and belittling manner.  Although she dismisses much religion and spirituality as Neptunian phenomena in a negative sense, her book offers no viable alternatives.  There are few constructive suggestions given in this book for the supposed weaknesses of those with hard aspects to Neptune in their charts.  Reading this book might lead some "Neptunian" people to think of themselves as being problematic and of little use to society, and could do more harm than good in many cases 
 You won't find a single expert on hummingbirds who recommends "instant nectar" products such as this one. Why? Because 1) they're a complete waste of your money and 2) they expose the birds to ridiculously high concentrations of inadequately tested chemicals. The cheapest and easiest feeder solution also happens to be the closest in chemical composition to natural flower nectar: a solution of 3 or 4 parts water to one part ordinary white sugar. If you want the sugar to dissolve faster, get additive-free superfine baking sugar. DON'T use honey, food coloring, Kool-Aid, Jello, or any other junk - the birds drink nectar just for the energy and get everything else their bodies need from eating insects 
 Clarke opens this book stating that he hopes it will, "cause readers to think." In reality this book is nothing more than an anti-US diatribe wrapped around fictional schlock. Here the US is the bad guy, and the Arabs are the good guys who only want democracy. Clarke conveniently forgets that every terrorist on 9-11 was Arab. He also ignores the basic structure of US government in composing this fantasy.  Clarke must be very bitter after losing his position in the US government where he was the failed National Coordinator for Security and Counter-terrorism. This book is the result of that bitterness. Pure pap. 
 I eagerly awaited the arrival of this cd wanting to hear some new rockabilly bands I was not familiar with, but I was severly dissapointed. The quality of the tracks on this cd are mediocre at best and some are just downright bad, the two standout tracks are red hot and real gone by the spinouts(great tune, good hook, excellent slap bass, guitar interplay)The other standout is girl of my dreams,by peter and the wolves very Elvis, Maries the Name era early sixties sounding. The majority of the other tunes are just dowright pitiful.If you are new to the rockabilly scene, a few helpful suggestions, The Stray Cats, The Blasters, Robert Gordon, The Planet Rockers, Sun era and 56-59 Elvis, Carl Perkins, Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, the list goes on and on of better spent dollars on QUALITY rockabilly music, apologies to these artists, but if this is the current state of rockabilly, please somebody help us!!!!! 
 This book begins with a letter from Jimmy Buffett where he asks Eng to not  undertake this project.  As a Parrothead, I enjoy hearing about the life of  Jimmy Buffett.  But, as Jimmy stated in his letter, if anyone is going tell  his story, it should be him.  Eng's writing style is, to sum it up in a  word, boring.  It was a chore to read and I filed it away after reading  only 60 pages.  Let Jimmy tell his own story and don't waste your money 
 Unable to review this movie as at this stage have been unable to play it on our dvd player.....however, we can play it on our computer but have not viewed the complete movie yet!!!   
 This movie is a disaster. There is not one single memorable performance by the cast of "stars". If you want to see a little boy happily running to school, get hit by a car, walk home injured and die, have at it.  There is a reason that this movie is deeply discounted by Amazon. Criterion is probably losing money on this release and they desire it. They should be is ashame 
 I was able to finish this book, unlike Gilead but this author is soooo boring!  Will not read another by her, no matter what the reviews 
 I am going to be the lone voice in the wilderness... I could not get into this book, could not make it past the first thirty pages.  The narrative voice rambles from first person to third person, often it is not clear what is going on...  I think this is a challenging book and most certainly is not a novel for somebody who is looking for a light read 
 I have seen some bad ones in my day but this is the worst. I couldn't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life on it. They literally stole scenes from Runaway Train in this. Not the ideas, they stole the filmed scenes. The train kept going from one engine to the four in RT. The continuity was a joke. Had a semi truck go from tandem axle to single back to tandem. Seems like some of the actors must have had a house payment coming up 
 Although fantasies were given by "regular" people, I found the descriptions of making it with dogs and dreaming of what you'd do to your baby neice, not only objectionable, but just plain gross. I don't think your average person would appreciate such fantasies. Based on other  reviewers here, I thought it would be about really erotic/possibly romantic  escaapades. I had no idea it would be bizarre and ugly. I think there were  2 I liked, but they were just so-so. I wonder about an author that provides  a forum for such material 
 I have ordered from here before and haven't had a problem but this time I never received the item.  I ordered it for a class that I was taking so I could do a report on motivating employees and I never got the book so I just ended up doing it on something else.  I wouldn't have given any stars if that would of been on there 
 Half the movie is looking through a screen and the rest was to dark to see what was going on  
 This Dvd had a lot of Promise:  A Great selection of Songs from a Legendary Band, Ronald Isley is One of the Best Singers in Soul History, and Ernie is Wonderful on Guitar...However, The Concert here is lacking;  Ronald's Pipes, though holding up well for Someone in His early 60's are not what they used to be. He struggles on the high notes, of which there are many, and He does the James Brown trick of employing many Stage Dancers too obfuscate His own decline...The Dancers appear too often, and clutter the Stage, and Ronald overdoes the Mr. Biggs routine; too much "Show" and too little Musicality shining through.  The Band is Fine, but there is little muscle to the rythm section, and the ending number, "fight the Power" is bogged down by chanting and an almost Disco instrumentation, not the Meaty Licks found on the Recording;  Avoid this One and put on Your "Ultimate Isleys" CD, You'll be far more satisfied. 
 It is an inspiring story of truly epic proportions. One problem though.  Bruce Olsen couldn't write to save his life.   I am no stranger to books such as this, I have read dozens and all of them are interesting in their own way, this by no means is the worst of the pack but I had heard such good things about it, probably the only reason I am giving this two stars instead of at least a weak three is because of the dissapointment I faced in comparison to what I had heard. 
 Simon's typing and creativity are here, but little sense.  Let me go on my own mind journey about the NECRONOMICON. Back in 1973, I met a man named Robert W. Dills. He was a caligrapher.  A man named George Scithers hired him to do a faux Arabic Text and it was to pose as THE NECRONOMICON.L.Sprague deCamp wrote a lengthy introduction, claiming the book was written in "Duriac". At a gathering at Scither's house, after the book had been bound up in a limited edition of 300 + copies, he proudly showed who ever was there the one amusing item he wanted to do: get a copy in the British Museum. Just like it would be in a H.P.Lovecraft story.  And there was a title given to it as "Al Azif". Duriac does not exist. The book did well for what it was--just a conversation piece. Dills admited there was a translation of sorts, and it would reveal a laundry list.  Go to January 1974. A woman I was dating dragged me off to a science fiction convention, and before the convention was to begin, dragged me off to The Warlock Shop, which involved going to Brooklyn.  There in the shop, was the NECRONOMICON, perched on a shelf, surrounded by advertising that subscriptions were being taken for the translation of the book.  I asked Herman Slater, "Don't you know that's a joke?" Herman Slater said,  "It's not a joke. It's real. And we have lined up someone to do a translation."  Thoughout the whole book Simon has written, he never mentions this tome, and this is signifigant, since Herman Slater said "It was real", and didn't see the joke after it was explained to him.  Of course, Simon claims he was a charming interesting man, a claim that goes against all other descriptions of Herman Slater I've ever encountered.  Anyway, the book's history in Simon's hands seems to be throwing as many names and issues together and hope they might make some sort of collage impression that something important had been discussed. Tossing Charles Manson and David Berkowitz and other names together that don't tie into the book's history isn't signifigant. And Berkowitz was a Postal Worker, not a cab driver when he was arrested. 
 This is a cheaply made, over-priced product.  It didn't last a week and I paid over 30 dollars for it and since I ordered it early as a Christmas gift - I can't return it because it has been over 30 days!!  The drawer to pull out to get the coin rolls out will not go back in all the way, therefore the coins fall to the bottom, get stuck, etc.  Total waist of money that I now cannot get back! 
 I think this quote from a review sums this up the best - "As we all know, we have the power to rule ourselves. This being said, what are we waiting for?"  If this were in a book from the world, I would expect a statement like that, but from a professing Christian?  I had control of my life for years and it progressively drove me further and further away from God.  Having control of our own life is the PROBLEM, not the solution.  The solution lies in surrendering control of our lives to the God who created us, not continuing in rebellion against Him.  When I was the ruler of my own life, it led to me breaking every single one of his moral codes that He gave to mankind.  Just look at them (the ten commandments) -   1. I thought I was fine with this one - I didn't believe in Allah or Zeus or any other gods. Of course, I was still nowhere near keeping this one ("don't have any other Gods before me") - there were plenty of other things I put in my life before God. I'd rather sleep in than go to church. I'd rather watch tv than read the Bible, etc.   2. I thought I was fine with this one because I didn't make any silly carved gods or idols. But I still made a god in my image. Every time I would say "why would God..." or "my God wouldn't..." or "I don't think God would...." I was making up a god in my image. Coincidentally enough, it was always happy with the things I was doing, but He was going to get all those other "bad" people. (Also, if you agree with Dr. Schuller that the key to knowing God is self-love and a positive attitude, you're guiltly of breaking this one also)  3. OK, I knew I was guilty of taking the Lord's name in vain and using it as a profanity, which was bad enough, but I was even worse than that. I was calling myself a Christian, yet I lived with my wife for years before getting married, never attended church or even had any idea what the Bible said and basically just living a competely ungodly lifestyle. While using God as a profanity is violating this commandment, what I was doing was taking the Lord's name (i.e. calling myself a CHRISTian) in vain in an even worse sense.   4. I would also admit I was guilty of this one. No matter how you want to interpret the sabbath law, I wasn't putting aside any days for God, they were all for me.   5. Honor your father and mother? Not even close. 'Nuff said.   6. Don't murder? Good, I'm fine on that one - oh wait, Jesus said that whoever hates anyone is a murderer. Got me on that one too.   7. No adultery? I was fine on this one too, I never cheated on my wife. Of course, as I already mentioned, I lived with her for years before we got married. I didn't see this as wrong because I had no idea whatsoever of the seriousness of this in God's eyes. Under God's law the penalty for adultery or any sexual sin was the same as murder. In the New Testament, it is clear that even professing Christians who don't honor their marriage commitments are only fooling themselves. That's because marriage isn't about us. Sure it's a wonderful, beautiful thing for us, but more importantly it was designed as an earthly expression of God's love for His people. Corrupting that gives a distorted picture of who God is which is why it is so badly under attack today, even from professing Christians. Some people think that if you're a Christian, you have to stop liking sex. Not true at all, I love sex. The Bible has a whole book in it about sex. According to 1 Corinthians 7 saying "not tonight dear, I have a headache" is a sin (and just before the guys get too excited about that one, it says that our bodies don't belong to ourselves, but to our spouses, and while the concept is obviously sexual, I think that if your wife wants to use your body to take out the garbage or do the dishes, that qualifies too). But God designed it and it needs to be done his way (and of course I disagreed with this, which took me back to the second commandment). But even more so - I was really in trouble with this one because Jesus said that whoever looks at a woman with lust has already commited adultery. Well, I was in trouble there.   8. Don't steal anything? Well, I never stole anything big so I was fine. Doesn't matter, even when I stole toilet paper from the buildings on campus so that we wouldn't have to buy any for our apartment in college, that's still stealing.   9. Don't lie. See my comments on honor your father and mother (which is actually kind of ironic, since when I tried to proclaim my honesty, sometimes I'd say "well, I lie to my parents sometimes, but that's ok.")   10. Don't covet. See those same comments again. Don't want something that doesn't belong to you - if I told you that I've always kept this commandment, you'd probably die laughing and you don't even know me.   But God's a loving God?  (these quotations are all from the New Testament and written TO CHRISTIANS)  "Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God." (1 Cor 6:9-10)  "For this you know, that no fornicator, unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. Therefore do not be partakers with them." (Eph 5:5-7)  "Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God." (Gal 5:19-21)  The reason Dr. Schuller's television show and books are so popular is because people want to feel good about themselves while continuing in their sins and yet still feel that somehow they'll still get to go to heaven when they die.  But there's one problem with this - why did Jesus have to die?  Dr. Schuller's gospel has no answer for this question.  But the Bible does.  The Bible looks at the sins that you and I have committed (and after reading that list, if you can honestly say that you have not sinned.... well, I have no answer for that other than to pray for you) and say that we deserve hell.  Hell is a real place (not just low self-esteem or any kind of hell on earth that we can imagine) full of pain and torture.  It's what we deserve, but God loves us and doesn't want us to go there.  So He took all those sins that you and I have committed and paid the price for them Himself.  He took the penalty for our transgressions so that we don't have to.  That's the true Gospel, and you can accept that forgiveness.  All you need to do is stop believing in a self-love gospel and recognize sin for what it is - sin.  Then turn from those sins and put your full trust in Jesus.  Stop reading these books and start reading God's Word - the Holy Bible.  He will not let you down.  You will move from death to life, your final destination will change from hell to heaven.  Please at least take the time to look into what I'm saying.  Right now there's a million and one things I'd rather be doing (and some I should be doing) than typing a review for something I completely disagree with, but I'm doing this for the exact reason that I mentioned above - HELL IS REAL WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IT OR NOT!  God doesn't want you to go there (just look at all the agony He suffered so you wouldn't have to) and I don't want you to either.

 This book is hardly the ideal "mad scientist in suburbia" tale. It was read in one sitting...literally. I did not move from underneath the covers of my bed, but my wanton lethargy was not the result of an example of riveting literature. The book didn't need to go atilt on the BSA. Wasn't a rant--WAS a distraction. The tale just wasn't very interesting. Pragmatism must acquiesce to the rapture of dark allegory, and morbid chuckles were my anticipation. Look at the title; how could I reasonably anticipate anything else?? BLAH 
 As the sole dissenting view so far, I'll say that perhaps one has to have read Byatt's critically acclaimed "Possession" in order to appreciate what she's done here but I must admit I was unable to do so.  I found it sorely misleading to lable these stories as horror stories since absolutely nothing about them was scary or even remotely horrific in any way. I wasn't expecting to find a Stephen King story here but neither was I expecting to find "Body Art" - a story about a doctor who gets a young woman pregnant and forces her to have the baby. An interesting character study perhaps but nothing at all supernatural or like anything that's advertised on the back of the cover.  Something may be said for the author's poetic writing style and she does effectively pull off the modern fairy tale for grown-ups tone but frankly it was a tone that lulled me to boredom and eventually to sleep.  I found most of the characters dull and many of them unlikable.  I thought that these stories would be an interesting and short introduction to an author I keep hearing so much about. Sadly, as I was barely able to finish this little black book I doubt I'll be picking up any of her longer works. If you're looking for poetic character studies with dark tones, I recommend this one. If you're looking for something scary that won't bore you to death with page long descriptions of nature at every turn look somewhere else because you won't find it here.         
 This author has nothing to do with real Taoism, but spins things in Taoism his way, calling himself an achieved "Master". A total fruad aimed at the naive and gullible 
 Before I started reading "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," the book had a lot going for it: stellar reviews on the cover, an intriguing title and its status as one of five or six books found in the meager philosophy section at Walden Books in Pocatello.  Unfortunately, despite these advantages, the book failed to deliver anything but ambiguity and disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't very good.  I'm not sure whether the book is a memoir, a novel or a philosophical treatise. In "Zen" Robert Pirsig tells the story of a motorcycle trip he went on with his son, Chris in the 1970s. But the story, I guess, is not really about the bike trip itself but the thoughts the author has about quality and technology.  The only interesting passage of the whole book can be found on page  17:      "The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower."  That passage is good. The rest of the book is depressing and confusing. Throughout the entire motorcycle trip, the author ignores his son and becomes lost in his own head thinking deep thoughts about the definition of "quality."   I'm not sure if this book was intended as a novel, but if it was, it failed to produce character growth. It's standing as a work of philosophy is not much better. The author's ideas could have been explained in a 20 page essay and been much clearer.   Whatever the book was supposed to be, it didn't impressed me.  
 If you're a deer hunter who actually enjoys watching late night infomercials, have I got a book for you! John Weiss' "The Advanced Deer Hunter's Bible" is 190 pages of commercial endorsements thinly  disguised as a book about deer hunting. Weiss doesn't even camoflage the  advertisements with the old "I used Dr. Zook's Buck Dee-See-Ver and  shot the biggest buck of my life!" Instead he "proves" the  value of the products by quoting "experts" who just happen to  work for the company that makes the stuff. There may be valuable  information in there somewhere, but I was too disgusted to find it after  wading through ten separate Name-Brand endorsements in the first eleven  pages of text. My advice is to save your $10.36 plus shipping and handling  or spend it on three issues of "Outdoor Life". That way, the  advertisements are labeled and if you don't learn anything useful you can  still read Pat  McManus. I give this book one star only because zero isn't  an option 
 The purpose of this book is to act as a FAQ concerning religion and how it fits into their life. According to the authors, they do this by bringing to light evidence that proves that the way of Christianity is the true path for a happy life, however the supposed evidence is merely Bible passages. The rest is the author preaching almost archaicly, about the danger of the devil's temptation and the glory of God. It doesn't have the free-thinking and open feel that is necessary for a book targeted towards teenagers. The rest of the language feels dated, as is expected for a book written in 1992, however I doubt it would have impacted teens then either. It isn't funny, it isn't "real", nor will it satiate curious minds about what Christianity really is about. Really, for a book targeted at an audience with questions regarding their faith, it is remarkable that it is so reliant on the reader blindly believing it 
 Ryan Reynolds plays a smarmy, crowd pleasing new teacher who immediately bonds with all the angelic waifs in this fairytale of a school. He wins them over by being their buddy, finds the time (and money) to kit himself out as an indian chief, and even re-inacts a civil war in the playground (complete with black powder rifles). His destiny is clear from the moment he blurts out, "How much time do we have? Not much...". David Paymer is the comic relief, all that's missing is the floppy shoes and clown makeup. There is also the usual puppy love sub-plot with the not so awful young actor Andrew Robb, just a shame that the plot has nowhere to go.  The entire film reeks of trite, moralistic falseness. If this were just a comedy then it wouldn't matter how silly it was (accounting for your tastes), but it tries to aim too high and preach to us the meaning of life. I'm guessing this was targeted at younger audiences by the studio, but give the kids some credit, they can spot a stinker a mile away. We just need more people to be bothered leaving honest reviews (not just the fans) to lower the feedback to a realistic score, so people don't get suckered into buying such drivel.  If you want truly decent teacher/student heartwarming stories (without the shmaltz), try "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" (the remake is good too), or "Mr Holland's Opus". For some good escapist fun I'd also recommend "School of Rock" 
 I'd read most of King's stuff during the uh decade of  my UTe.  Salem's  Lot and Pet Cemetery being  the hook on the line and     The Stand, Shining, Christine  and   IT reeling me in.  I thought he'd never come out with a book  that I didn't want to read cept anything of or related to his wife's stuff and the Gunslinger series.    Then one day I started to read Insomnia and I couldn't make it to the halfway point, the antiChristian Proabortion garbage was too thick for me to ignore and I found myself throwing Insomnia away, I did that with Cider House Rules by John Irving too.  Even Needful things with it's anti evangelical stuff could be ignored cause there is some truth to the anti Catholism and hypocrisy  but Insomnia was just plain mean spirited. 
 Ick.  I bought Ultra Light Kirsch because I thought it would be similar to a discontinued grapey color that I used to love by Loreal.  Smell - Fake grade-school grape-aid smell grossed me out.  Feel - I LIKE lip gloss that feels glossy.  This stuff did not shine enough or last long enough.  Color - The color was to mild for me.    I was very disappointed.  I felt like I had wasted money and time. I still recommend Loreal Lip Juice, though. I believe it's the same company, and Lip Juice is glossy, shiny, long-lasting and way more cost-effective 
 This book was not good, and that hurts to say because I agreed with the overall diagnosis. Society - Western civilization specifically - is in trouble. Anyone who bothers to look past the rosy 'two cars in every garage' and the multiculti 'diversity is the greatest morality ever' can see that today we face problems which did not exist fifty years ago. There were no Columbines, there was no loss of purpose. I also dare say that desegregation has caused as much animosity between the races - if not more - than originally existed. Heresy, I know.  If you don't agree with that last suggestion, that would be because it is my opinion. Mrs. Jacobs has a lot of opinions in her book...though none so 'unenlightened', I'm sure. This book is just an intelligent person's attempt to talk about the things that irk her. There are no timeless insights, which is what a problem the magnitude of her thesis requires. Blunt ideas liks "Cars bad! Roads bad!" are not going to dissect our woes. Opinion is often presented as fact or maxim. I did not agree with many of those opinions. Although I have not read Jared Diamond's work cited, the applause he receives here had an unintended consequence for me. Many of Diamond's own reviews hint of the same problem that beleaguers Jacobs' work: opinion given as fact.  The positives I would attribute to Jacobs' Dark Age Ahead is that the subject matter is a poignant question of our time. Victory is bittersweet in that 'it is all down hill from here'; but if there is one constant of Western civilization, it is that the citizens are authors of their own destiny. Regrettably, too many of these same people choose to author a brave new world. The debate is needed, and anything that spurs that is ultimately a good thing. I would first read Barzun's From Dawn to Decadence or Bloom's Closing of the American Mind, however 
 Although the setting and factors involved appear to be intriguing they just come off as "boring".  The characters are stale and PLEASE the endless details of the streets, roads, mountainside - NOT necessary.  I'm truly disappointed because up to this point I have had nothing but the highest praise for Daniel Silva's works.  But, like someone else pointed out in another review - something happens when an author writes about the same characters over and over.  I believe Mr. Silva has gotten just about all he can out of Gabriel Allon, et al - and I was disappointed when I discovered that although he had thought to put an end to the character Gabriel Allon in his latest book he was advised by some friends NOT to.  Too bad - I know I won't buy that one.  I LOVE to read and "consume" a book in a relatively short time period given my busy schedule.  Yet, I've been "trudging" through this one for weeks - not days 
 I like my book because it's confusing; it messes with your mind.  It messed with my mind because I didn't think his friend Andy died in the Tuttle place. I thought he was alive the whole time cause of how he talked to him and he wasn't really there. Is he like schizophrenic or something? I think that that was pretty mean to put him in an all boys school I didn't thing that it was where he belonged. But he's crazy and sick in the mind because he used to look into Melissa room at night. This book really didn't make much sense. All it was pretty much was a guy writing down really long lie. I would recommend this book to people with time to waste. 						  
 I admit to being curious about Rihanna's music because like a previous poster from Brooklyn stated " I was not trying to become a Rihanna fan!!".  I was really pleasantly surprised by the quality of this disc and although Rihanna is no vocal powerhouse, the songs on the disc were produced in such a way as to mask this fact and create more than a few enjoyable songs.  I really loved her lead single, PON DE REPLAY and since I don't listen to the radio, it never grew old to me because I heard it so infrequently. It's almost an instantly classic dance track with its hypnotic beats & fun lyrics.  The other standout tracks to me are:  HERE I GO AGAIN - like the island beats of the music and again, her vocals are utilized well on the track  WILLING TO WAIT - more of a straight r&b track with great beats that again, work well with her vocals  LET ME - has an interesting "go-go" beat mixed with a middle eastern sound  RUSH - again, a great dance track  It's unfortunate that her vocal skills are so slight because there are 2 ballads that although featuring very pretty music production, ultimately fail as singles because she is such a weak vocalist: THE LAST TIME - Rihanna attempts vocal runs that are way out of her league and NOW I KNOW - although she has moments where her voice sounds pretty, this song would've been a big hit for a stronger singer.  Honestly, I'd recommend this disc to others who are curious about Rihanna's music and to those who like Ashanti - ultimately they are cut from the same cloth as "artists".  They are able to produce enjoyable singles (through the magic of ProTools) but don't do much in the way of live vocal performances 
 First, the good news:  1. I lost 8 pounds in two weeks on this diet, even with the occasional skim latte and granola bar.  2. Following it wasn't logistically impossible, as some have complained. Even as very busy grad students, my roommate and I were able to stick to it by making meals in advance and marking off on a daily list the things we were supposed to eat or drink throughout the day.  3. I really liked the cranberry water, and still make it when cranberries are in season. I'm not much of a water drinker, but enjoy guzzling the cranberry water, so it helps me stay hydrated and cleansed.  Now the bad news: 1. I gained back all 8 pounds and more within the weeks following the diet, even though I eat little junk food. 2. No noticable reduction in cellulite while I was on the plan. 3. I frequently felt hungry or experienced cravings (hence the skim lattes and granola bars mentioned above). I was having fantasies of buying a loaf of crusty bread at my favorite bakery and tearing into it the minute I got into my car. Definitely not a good sign. 4. As with all diets, food and body became an obsession. Finally, two things that made this experience somewhat worthwhile: 1. I learned about cranberry water. 2. It brought me a step closer to leaving the insane world of dieting. That was three years ago. I'm not and don't ever expect to be a size 8 like I wanted at that time, but I have no regrets. 
 This book had many of the same recipes as the first Betty Crocker Slow Cooker cookbook--even the same pictures! The recipes are OK, but many are dull and made with prepackaged items. I'd rather know what's in my food, thank you. Not impressed. The new Southern Living Slow Cooker cookbook was a million times better 
 Sorry folks, this is not a serious book by any standards. Much of what Shenkman has to say is either unproved speculation or purposeful misunderstanding of events and indeed of history itself. Please do not take this as a serious effort. It is not 
 I only enjoyed one song.  The one they always play on the radio.  How disappointed I was to pay a high price to just enjoy ONE song.  
 Andy Rooney's writings are usually well worth reading. The letters certainly were, and very enjoyable. However, I was more than shocked and offended by Mr.Rooney's attack of religion. This is one of his books I wished I had skipped 
 Good if you have lots of time to kill, because it has some pages devoted to useless information such as the stupid poem on page 1022 that has  nothing to do with accounting. It appears the authors placed lots of  "real world" trivia that is boring and useless. Entire page of  964 talks about the reason why Coca-Cola will not do business with Lakers  because they signed Pepsi spokeman Shaq O'Neill, it has nothing to do with  the subject but  the extra pages makes you think you got something for the  high priced book. If you absolutely need this book, go borrow it from your  public library and save your money.The book manuscript was NEVER approved  by a CPA or business owner but a long list of college instructors. It does  cover all the basics 
    Diamond spends twenty one laughable pages on male lactation.  What's next?  How about implanting a uterus?  After all, men are stronger and could probably carry babies better.    Big game hunting by the males of indigenous tribes was probably more effective when there was more game.  But, for Diamond, it leaves the question open as to "What are men good for?"      My question is "What is Jared Diamond good for?" 
 The book is poorly written, full of fictional rantings and generally liberal recapping of other historial history books. The author rants like a lunatic and how this book was ever published is a mystery to me. 
 I will give this movie two stars, simply for the two memorable scenes in the movie that make it worth seeing - at least once. The demon coming out of the TV set scene is suprisingly well done, rivaling even what we would see years later in movies like The Ring. The second scene is where the demon kid is chasing a woman around the apartment, then he falls to the ground and an alien demon crawls out of his chest and continues to chase her around the place. There's pastel neon lights flashing in the background, and the whole scene is jam packed with 80's cliches. It's almost like a cross between The Omen, a Billy Idol video, Aliens, and Return of the Living Dead. It's so ridiculously absurd and campy, it makes me crack up every time I see it 
 While this book may be helpful to children who are seen as "special" or "crippled," I would never recommend it, because of the title,  which is bad as "The Nig**er Lamb" would be. Get it?  I'm an advocate for people with disabilities, the preferred term, and can assure you that a book called "crippled" and terms like "special" will have the opposite of the intended result and could cause  children to be perceived even more as "special" instead of different but equal 
 I was so excited when I got this book. I love stories about Presidents. However, everything in this book I had read somehwere else. Same old boring stuff. No new pictures. Basically, I thought it was awful 
 I don't understand how anyone who chose his dog over his wife and daughter can be extolle 
 I am giving Truffaut's interview with Hitchcock a single star because it has been revered as "the" book on this master director for way too long.   I first read this book years ago as a new student of film and Hitchcock.  Since that time I have read lots more about Hitchcock and with each new piece of the puzzle, have determined after re-reading it recently that there is little that is new or exclusive to this book.  Hitchcock often told the same stories elsewhere, both before and after publication of this book some thirty plus years ago.  The books sole value is as an entertainment, or as a Hitchcock-primer.  This book merely provides what Hitchcock wanted to say of himself, the packaged image, just like his famous caricature.  There are many other books to choose from which offer a more complete portrait.  Seek them out .. 
 This book really takes a deeper look at how challenges and adveristies affect you. It definatly makes a connection with the reader and it is very helpfull. The author speaks to you as though you are having a conversation and offers some wonderfull advice. I would highly reccomend this book 
 It's hard to exactly know what to make of this book.  It is generally well written.  The author has a way of using clever turns of phrases and the prose is rarely awkward or stilted.  One the other hand the plotting is, while engaging not particularly captivating.  Voting as a form of redemption?  Well...maybe...but I don't know.  That was a mite too anticlimactic for me and the chapters that tried to capture what was going on inside the thoughts of Carter and Reagan in the Sunday before the 1980 presidential election seemed forced and a little half baked.  Readable, but utimately less than satisfying and not particularly memorbale.  2 1/2 stars 
 So, I joined a book club because I read a lot anyway.  I am the poster child for the Summer Reading Program.  The book club has all these super interesting girls that I really like, but the book they chose to read was "Admissions".  I was very suspicious because the cover said something like, "If you loved Devil Wears Prada or Nanny Diaries."  I laughed out loud when I saw this and said to my friend, "Ha!  Are they trying to turn me OFF from this book?!" But she didn't laugh.  She apparently likes those books.    Admissions obeyed the following chick lit rules:  1) The Heroine must have a super interesting and accomplished job, but there must not be too much time spent on this job.  Mainly the job will consist of running errands or dog sitting the boss' dog.   Even if she's an art critic, her job must not take up much more than 10-12 hours a week of her life.   2) The conflict in the story must not be life threatening - no AIDS, cancer, etc.  Or too serious, like terrorism or stock market crashes. 3) One character in the story must hate the heroine for no particular reason, but it must come out in the end that she was secretly jealous the whole time. 4) The Heroine must love shoes and buy shoes and think about her shoes. 5) The Heroine must have a best guy friend who turns out to be in love with her at the end, which is obvious to everybody but the heroine. (This rule stretches a little for this book.  The affair was so beyond lame.)   6) Another character has to be tall and thin to help point out how not tall, thin and blonde* she is. (not blonde but the rule still fits) 7) Most of all, the heroine must never have any sort of strong political, religious or social views or think about any subject that might cause her to think more on any of these three subjects.  This book goes beyond the mold to have a couple of story lines going on all at once.  But then at the end, just drops them all except one.  And the one she keeps was the most annoying of all of them.  Does Julian get to go to the artsy school?  Does the girl with anorexia die?  Does the stupid English lady go to jail?  Dumb dumb dumb.  And the pop culture references are SO far off.  A 14 year old rebel with a Kurt Cobain shirt at one of the schools? What average 14 year old even knows who Kurt Cobain is?  Pick up a Billboard magazine and update that reference.  And Julian, the gay kid, loves Judy Garland?  Is he a 50 year old gay man? Did Nancy Lieberman learn everything she knows about gay men from late Roseanne reruns?  I hate books like this because they read like they're just waiting to be picked up for a Hollywood movie, "Heroine, who is a dead ringer for Kate Bosworth, but if she's busy doing Superman sequels could look a lot like Anne Hathaway, if she's available...  Exits right."  Write a screen play if you want a Hollywood movie.    I might have to find a new book club.  
 I've been a huge fan of Ms Cornwell for a long time, and I have a hard time believing that the author who wrote the first nine Scarpetta books is the same person who wrote Blowfly, Trace, Predator, and now, At Risk.  The last of Ms Cornwell's books that I actually purchased was Blowfly (big mistake!), and since then I will not spend a cent on one of her books until I've read a copy from the library.  When I first read the jacket on At Risk, I was very surprised and pleased to see that it wasn't another Scarpetta novel - all her characters in that series had become much too bizzare, pathetic, or just plain unlikeable - and had great hopes that she had written something new and fresh.  However, At Risk is no better (and probably worse in many ways) than her last three.  It actually doesn't start out too badly (not brilliant, but the characters and plot have some potential), but then, just as the plot and suspense are rising, you start the next chapter and find out that the detectives have it all solved!  The story has no rhythm, continuity, or logic to it.  The last half of the book reads like it was thrown together in about an hour.  Very disappointing.  I'm still hoping that Ms Cornwell will write another wonderful thriller (particularly if she continues to concentrate on fresh material and forget about the Scarpetta series) - after all, that talent must still be in there somewhere!  In the meantime, I won't waste my money and will be using my library card more 
 As a Gene Autry fan, particularly of his Christmas recordings, I was really looking forward to this release.  But...what a disappointment!  I will look over the dropouts - obviously the source tapes have deteriorated - but what happened to the final three cuts?  They are so laden with noise reduction artifacts that they are barely listenable.  And, I know the disc is short, but were the 2 second pauses between tracks REALLY necessary?  Talk about choppy. No flow at all.   This CD did make me do one thing...go back into my archives and pull out my original Grand Prix vinyl.  I think I'll be doing a transfer and retire this CD to the bottom shelf. 
 I give this book one star as there was nothing lower to choose from.  Save your money.  This book is not worth either your time or your money.  Was she on drugs during the writing of this piece of tripe?  
 I purchased Relacore to give myself a boost in my wieght loss. I am exercising very regularly. Nearly everyday and had hit a wall in my wieght loss. Relacore PM did not help me lose any wieght and I certainly didn't sleep any better. Matter of fact I seemed to have more difficulty drifting off to sleep during the 3+ weeks I used it 
 I don't really like books about older couples, and did not read all of this one because of that, even though I do like Kate Welsh as an author.  Here is the back cover review. For years, Evan Alton had avoided forming ties and concentrated on building his ranch. But now his twin baby grandchildren needed urgent care, and he'd do anything for them...even let Meg Taggert, the one woman who infuriated him as no one else could, stay on the ranch to help.  Lucky for Evan, Meg was there temporarily. Yet as they took care of the babies together, arguments changed to playful banter, and the harshness in their eyes gave way to understanding...and more.  Funny, suddenly matching wits with Meg was making Evan feel more alive than he ever had.  Could he be the one Meg was really sent to help 
 Great cover, enticing premise. I couldn't wait to read this book...BUT... Every one-star review before mine lays my feelings out perfectly. Let me add a couple more. Frannie grows up, decides to live with a man and writes home to tell her mother what she's going to do. What does her mother say? That's nice, dear. I trust you to make the right decision. Oh please!!! This is the 19th century after all! Then for good measure let's throw this one into the mix. After the indomitable Una shows understanding and makes decisions that earn her the admiration and accolades of every living person, famous or not, that she comes into contact with...she decides to buy into an oil well to help a friend even though everyone agrees that this is throwing money down the rat hole. An oil well! You must be kidding! Of course, she eventually recoups her money plus a bunch.  I could go on and on. I finished every page of this book although I must say I skimmed through the last 100 pages. When I finished and my husband asked how it was, the only way I could think to describe it was SILLY 
 I started this book the same way I started almost every Marquez book in the past - expecting to be mesmerized and taken away for a while from my world to one of the magical-real worlds of Marquez. The first few tens of pages of this book took off the way those in any other Marquez book do: slowly, but promisingly creating a solid loom to weave a tale on. And then the next tens of pages continued in the same vein, as did the next few chapters, and so on and so forth.   Actually, to be fair, at least a part of the problem could be with my expectations. I was expecting another stunning piece of writing, even if it was a recount of reality. But then, how many readers of Marquez would hold that against me and expect differently of him? After all, his books have been as much about his writing style as they have been about his vivid imagination, haven't they? So that's primarily what I felt let down about in this book - the book just fails to grip. Marquez's writing seems weak like never before (except for the odd brilliant phrase here and there), and there aren't enough interesting tales to tell anyway. The book never moves beyond the context-setting; there is almost no dramatic arc, and; there is hardly any climatic resolution.   To summarize quickly then, I would recommend this book to very die-hard Marquez fans only. The only real value of this book lies in helping Marquez's readers undestand how he came to be the writer he did. If you are prepared to go through 500 pages of tedium for that, go for it. 
 I've grown into quite a Modest Mouse fan over the past year, and after listening to all their CDs, I must say this is their worst one. The music is loud, screechy, and outright poor. If this is the first CD most people hear from Modest Mouse, than I can see why many people don't find it to their taste.  I enjoyed Lonesome Crowded West, The Moon & Antarctica, Good News for People Who Love Bad News, The Fruit That Ate Itself, and many others, but this is just not up to par with the rest of it. Some might find it to their taste, as many reviewers here have, but I seriously recommend trying to borrow a copy and listen to it first before purchasing. This doesn't sound at all like the rest of their music, and I am of the personal belief this whole CD pretty much blows.  So beware, and check it out before you buy 
 I've just started to try and read this book as part of my MBA, however the book is of terrible production quality.  The pages are all out of order, and some are falling out as I turn over the pages.  If you have this book mandated as part of a course as I did, you'll just have to live with it, otherwise choose another book that you don't have to hop around in just to get the pages in order 
 Everything everyone said about this is true. I wish there had been reviews before I bought this thing. I think giving it one star is being rather generous. It will not cut anything but soft cheese. Do not buy 
 This cd is not music, steps are not music artists in the slightest! they are just a manufactured group of dancers who are laughing all the way to the bank. This cd is so unbelivably bad that i can't believe that anyone  over the age of 8 would like it! It is really depressing to have groups  like steps in our charts - they are whats wrong with the music industry  today 
 I guess you get what you pay for, so I wasn't totally surprised that the battery didn't work.  What was worse is that when I sent it back to get a new one, they instead just refunded me a PART of what I paid for it.  Don't do business with these guys, and don't buy this battery 
 I wish I had read these reviews before I bought the book.  I would have saved myself $26.00.  As an American who has traveled and now lives in Europe part of the year I was continually appalled at how she maligned other travelers. She writes of being invited to be a guest speaker on a cruise ship and insults in print all of the other passengers. She had a free trip while others paid, but she ridiculed everyone. I was totally horrified of the things that she said about her former Father-in-law. Those statements had no relevance to the book and they do not belong in public print. This man is the grandfather of her daughter.  I am astounded at how she thrashed him publicly. Her book consisted mainly of telling the reader what town she was in, what was wrong with it and the rest of the chapter boring us with what books she was reading and quoting other authors, and relaying in detail every morsel that her and her husband ate.  I have visited and even lived in several of the towns she wrote about. Of the ones I have not been to unfortunately, nothing she wrote made me want to visit them. I am an avid reader of travel books and essays.  I will never again read anything by Frances Mayes.      
 This is really cute & the idea is nice, but it broke in less than 2 minutes. We got it assembled correctly and let our 5 year old play with it. In less than 2 minutes, the twirling mechanism broke. As other people have mentioned in their reviews, there is a very small screw that is supposed to keep it all together, but it seemed as if it was not screwed in all the way at the factory (or the plastic threads were stripped). So with  a little creativity, we tried to fix it (numerous times)--all ending in the twirling mechanism breaking in less than 5 minutes of use. We did not do anything to damage this product, we are very deligent about teaching our children how to take care of their toys. I would not recommend purchasing this item.   Looking at the other reviews of this item, I think it is great that some reviewers have had success with this product. But seeing the number of people with problems or issues--all very similar issues, we aren't whining, we are simply stating the truth about our experiences with a poorly designed toy 
 I'm a big fan of Carly phillips but I could not get through this book. I kept trying to finish it but it became too much work and not enough entertainment. If you're going to read a Carly Phillips book I wouldn't suggest this one. Her other books are fantastic though 
 While this book MENTIONS many basics of investing, it fails to aptly discuss many, most, or all of them.  The author, quite frankly, really fails to discuss, to any understandable length, many fundamental analysis items to include such notables as earnings per share, quarterly earnings growth, and book value.  He doesn't discuss in any appreciable detail what each of these mean.  He fails to inform the reader what degrees in any of these metrics an investor should look to gain or avoid.  He does mention them, but fails to give them any study in detail and worthiness.  As far as technical analysis goes, he sticks with his technique of mentioning items of interest without explaining them to any appreciable depth.  He really fails to describe, in any usable detail, how bands or moving averages can be used, or how they are used by some.  He has illustrative charts to demonstrate typical named historical patterns, but his narrative is poor.  Additionally, he fails to highlight the areas on the charts he writes of and therefore fails to make anything clear.  This analysis of historical patterns was very cryptic.  In the end he proposes, in about a page, and not in very good narrative, one system for investing that really is not only not generally achievable, it's not really generally feasible.  If your goal is to read a book to explain the basics of the stock markets, stock measuring, and knowledge needed for investing, please look elsewhere 
 I got this from JnR . This unit powers up but the computer fails to detect it. I tried this on multiple computers. MAy be this was just a lemon. I will exchange it to a better brand 
 I read Hollister's Henry I recently and I must highly recommend it to anyone interested in the history of the English monarchy. I knew virtually nothing about Henry when I first began to read this book (as he is one of the less famous English rulers amongst the general public), and came away feeling as if I actually had met the man. Hollister's style is colorful and easy to understand and follow-even his more analytical chapters on the church and the sources he used are interesting.  If you want to learn something about a underappreciated figure in medieval history, give this biography a try. I am sure you won't regret it. 
 I can't believe that I'm NOT ALLOWED to give this zero stars.  This band is garbage. The record is worse than garbage. It's septic sludge. The music is unoriginal, cloying and boring. The vocals are the most annoying sound I've ever heard. I wish the courts would gag and restrain this band. This band couldn't stop a war if they had a nuclear bomb.  Boycott 
 This is a very terrible text book. Don't ever look at this book if you are a newbie in OpenGL, trigonometry, calculus, linear algebra and the mathematic's dot product. I think this book is suitable only for the University which the author is lecturing in. My university is using this book as the core text book of the computer graphic course, the end result is that almost 95% of the student cannot code well using OpenGL by following guidance of this book, where everyone is looking for coding and references from Internet just for the assignment, how annoy it is. Further, the lecturer also cannot understand the book's content, they lecture only by using the powerpoint slaid which is from the author himself, which make the situation worst.  If I am not mistaken, the author has claimed that the book is to help the student to program graphics as soon possible using OpenGL. It is absolutely not the true. This book will lead you to hell if you don't prepare yourself well in C/C++ and of course, OpenGL API. And if your lecturer does not know well in OpenGL API or C/C++ as mentioned, may God bless you. Another thing, if you look at the exercises of each chapter, I wonder if anyone who is beginner in computer graphics and by solely depend on the book can solve the problems.  Anyhow, I rate the book one star do not mean that this book is not a good book. To my opinion, this is absolutely a good book for those who have very strong computer graphic background together with mathematic skills or those who are advance learner in this field.   In fourth edition, I really hope that the author will come out something such as 'International Edition' of this book which the content may vary from the original version. This is because the computer science syllabus may vary from country to country. Bear in mind that the Top-down approach is suitable well in author's University or country does not mean that it is suitable to other University or country. This is what I mean the book is suitable only for the university or college that the author is lecturing in.  Remember, buy this book only if you already well-prepared yourself in C/C++, OpenGL API, trigonometry, linear algebra, geometry and some calculus basic 
 Im typing this rview through my belkin omniview.I have impcbble spelling, but thfuing thing dropsalmost everkestroke. If you don't mind your writing loking like ths ten go aheadand buy it. 
 Filled with insider gossip and scatter-shot observations on the sexes, this is not exactly a work for the ages. In fact outside of the catchy title, I wonder who reads this stuff besides other chatty insiders who have made a cottage industry of feeding off one another like intestinal mites. So why did I read it. Well, I got it free, it's well written and I was "seduced" by the title-- okay, it was by the nubile cover that comes across like 1940's noir I used to sneak past my mother. In short, it was strictly a glandular decision and not exactly a flattering one, proving I suppose some testy thesis about men buried somewhere in the 300-plus pages. And that's the book's main problem. I don't know any more about how the author feels about these issues than when I started. I guess I was expecting something stereotypically masculine, like a cogent train of thought. But then, I suppose that just proves some equally testy thesis about women buried somewhere in the same text. In my fantasy life, I dream of voting out of town not only the whole greedy Clinton-Bush, Repubocrat axis, but the incestuous political culture that feeds off them. Most definitely, it's about driving out all those within martini-mixing distance of Pennsylvania Avenue. After setting down this book, my fantasies ran wild. 
 I expect a lot out of anything with a Disney association, and in many ways this does not disappoint. However, I believe it has a fatal flaw that makes it less child-friendly. I love to read with my children, but I view these read-alongs as a good alternative so our young children (3 & 5) can "read" a book on their own. However, none of these stories include cues to let a child know when to turn the page! This leaves them guessing and was a severe disappointment for all of us 
 I found this to be a really annoying, and - in the audio format - annoyingly-told story. It sounds like a screenplay, with symbolism, mystery, and trivia that are so mediocre... how best to describe it? Here, read the book if you think this is fascinating: the orange is a symbol of the divine feminine because it's round like a mother's womb. If that doesn't blow you away, read something else.   The two leads are so stereotypical, it hurts. Lastly, the guy reading the audio version puts on these heavy nasal French accents that actually impede understanding of what's being said, and then he has French people speak to each other in these accents - way overdone. Then, layered on that, they are explaining things to each other that any French person would already know (cle de voute, for example) for the reader's benefit.   Taking in the many supposedly intriguing objects and situations in this book was exactly like watching the movie Van Helsing for me - I'm watching that thinking "a werewolf, and vampires? and frankenstein? and hot chicks? why, it's got everything! what next?" Short attention span theater. The fact that this book is so popular makes me sad 
 What is the longevity of John Bradshaw's book, and how does his writing stand up in the perspective of time?  The book was published over ten years ago, and it seems to have dropped through the cracks of the large and populous human growth floorboards, of which it was a part.  The first thing I noticed about Bradshaw's writing is its sheer verbosity.  He writes in a roundabout way, rather than concisely and to the point.  Contrast him, for example, with a writer on Buddhism or Taoism (say, Alan Watts?).    Writing on Buddhism or Taoism may provide authors with a natural impetus to be concise, but the human growth movement is broad and billowy, and concise writing may not be important to the authors.    And Bradshaw seems to drag in every alley cat he ever heard meow in the human growth movement, to help him reflect on what he sees as the underlying principle of it all: Shame.  Bradshaw reports that he is a theologian, but also someone who recovered from alcoholism, and was deeply shamed as a child, which shame he finally learned to deal with and overcome.    There are many fine snippets from his book, which may be of use to folks, but overall, I think most people looking for direction are going to be repelled by his constant conceptualizations.  To paraphrase another well-known quotation, "People cannot live on concepts alone."  If he had given more personal studies or little case histories, it would have been much more helpful.  Instead, he includes page after page of some "guided" meditations or shame inquiries, which were totally useless to me.  If you are looking for guided meditations, this is the place for you.    So, in all, Bradshaw's book does not hold up to scrutiny after time, in my opinion.  It's one of the many from its era and niche that was forgotten and will be unlikely to remembered henceforth.  Anyway, it was a bestseller once, and that's what counts, I guess.  It did have its 15 minutes of fame, and a lot of books never even get that.  Diximus.     
 The translation was impeccable it seemed, but I've NEVER enjoyed Homer's Odyssey. The book was bought as a class set and we used it in class for annotation of the text. Let me just say that it dragged on in some parts, but that wasn't the translator's fault, that was the WRITER'S fault. I just want to say that if you're interested in reading the Odyssey for PLEASURE: don't. The story drags on, it's filled with confusion and overall, the whole story is just stupid. If you're reading it for a CLASS: Then this is definitely a good pick. The easy-to-read format helps with jotting down precise line numbers, and the text is written in a simplistic format. However, again, I do not recommend this for choice reading. It's just boring, seriously. 
 Bought dozens of different varieties of these - all arrived way past expiration date and were terribly stale. Don't chance it - I'm not the only customer who has had this problems with these products 
  It sound like a 5year old mischievious girl fooling with violin for pure curiosity! it make no sense to serious classical music but probabily still sounds 3stars if you take it for a vivaldi-pop 
 I've owned mine for 2 months and all of that time has been spent driving around with it in my car trying to get it fixed or exchanged since it hasn't work since day one.  Some Dream System.  The 'authorized' repair center is a total joke as well.  After being at the repair center for 6 weeks, i get a call saying they can not fixed the system and that I need to send it back to Sony in texas.  I get to pay for the boxes, packaging material and the shipping yeah!!!!  And i haven't even watched a movie ye 
 Well, I love listening to books on CD during my commute. Frankly, I can't decide after 4 of the 10 CDs included in this package whether I should continue to listen or not. The reader's voice -- C.J. Critt -- is really irritating. Her inflection on certain words doesn't work and the voices she uses for some of the characters are so off-putting. After being almost halfway through, I really would like to know what happened to this AP reporter/scuba diver, but I'm not sure I can handle sitting through 6 more CDs. The whole story seems amateurish, and I agree with another reviewer who said that the know-it-all aspect of the protagonist is tedious. Let's just say I wouldn't recommend it. This is the first book I've picked up from Cornwell, and I probably won't pick up any others. 
 Several months ago, I purchased this cookbook to expand my collection of vegetarian cookbooks and reference. Although I am an avid cook, I have not tried a single recipe. They look interesting, but in order to actually prepare them, you would have to hire a prep team. Each recipe requires the preparation of about six OTHER recipes...  Just looking at the recipes makes me tired 
 FIRST LET ME SAY THAT I AM AN ARDENT TCHAIKOVSKYITE. I WOULD HAVE LOVED NOTHING MORE THAN TO HAVE A GOOD REVIEW ON THIS MOVIE. UNFORTUNEATELY I HAVE NOTHING BUT BAD NEWS. YES I CAN SAY IT. THIS IS THE WORSE MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE! IT IS MOSTLY A FABRICATION. VERY POOR STORY LINE, DIRECTION AND THE BLANDEST OF ACTING AND POOR CINEMATOGRAPHY ADD UP TO MAKE THIS TOTALY UNACCEPTABLE. ANY AMERICAN OR BRITISH DIRECTOR COULD HAVE DONE BETTER WITHOUT EVEN HALF TRYING. THERE IS NO DRAMA, NO CONTINUITY TO HOLD YOUR INTEREST. NOTHING TO INDUCE ME TO SEE IT AGAIN. IT AUGURS BADLY WHEN THE SOVIET COULD MUSTER THIS OUT AS A VIABLE FILM. "THE MUSIC LOVERS" LURID AND SLEAZY AS IT WAS WAS A MASTERPIECE NEXT TO THIS. THIS IS AN UTTER FAILURE IN THE ART OF FILM MAKING. COMPARE THIS WITH "LUST FOR LIFE" TO SEE HOW BIOS ON THE LIVES OF ARTISTS CAN BE MADE ENTHRALLING. STICK TO THE FACTS AND RECREATE THE SPIRIT OF THE MAN AND HIS TIMES. THIS WAS A COMPLETE FIASCO. I RATE IT "0" 
 I bought this book because it was written by same author who wrote "Beyond the Downbeat."  I thought DB/ UB was sort of prerequisite to BTD.  It was not.  I would not say it was money well spent 
 I honestly do not understand what all the hype is about.  I forced myself to read this book because all I had ever heard was how it was one of the best and most influential pieces of modern literature, but eight hours a day of manual labor would be a less tiresome task then trudging through this pile of rubbish. In all honesty, the plot is entertaining, if you can find it.  I am sure the Cliffs Notes of the LOTR are interesting and entertaining, but why anyone would want to torture themselves reading this collection is beyond me.   I read one chapter a night until I was done, and that was too grueling a task.  I constantly found my mind wondering and having to reread every page because it could not hold my attention.   You don't have to believe the hype.  This collection of books is really, really terrible and boring, and I wouldn't wish the task of reading in on my worst enemy 
 I like the idea that Michael Lewis wrote this book/article to defend a man whose coaching techniques are clearly out of style in todays world of my child this and my child that. Having said that I did not like this book:  1) the writing was chopping and hard to follow at times. i had to re-read many sentences to understand lewis' point.   2) the story lacked the depth of lewis' other wonderful books - where's the who/why/what that lewis used to moneyball (and others) educational - i wanted the story behind the story.   3) who were all the pictures of? i found them distracting...   i'll continue to read lewis' books bu thope the next one is bette 
 I didn't watch Millenium when it was on ten years ago, so I thought I'd give it a try on DVD, as I'm a big X-files fan. I watched two shows: "The Beginning and the End" and "The Dogs". They were ridiculous AND boring. I'm done with Millenium 
 The conclusions about regret about sex and being abstinent may be shared by some, but certainly not all senior girls. This book concludes abstinence is the way to go, but since 70% of seniors of both sexes have intercourse, this is not likely. Why not recommend other sex acts, and intercourse once out of high school? 
 An English Teacher's review.  To my fellow educators:  I have just finished spending the better part of an afternoon watching all three film versions of "Treasure Island."  I've seen the version with Charlton Heston, the one with Jack Palance and the 1950 Disney version.  It is my unpleasant duty to report that a proper film of "Treasure Island" has apparently not yet been made, as all three were so abysmally bad that I was unable to finish them.  What no director has yet come close to capturing, is the relentless grandeur with which the book itself unfolds, and the simple directness of Stevenson's 19th century morality tale.  Without exception, all three of these films seem to flounder in a sea of confusion about what this book should actually be; and none of them seem to have even the tiniest jot of the kind of vision displayed by classic illustrators such as Wythe.  Again and again with each film, someone seems to have made the decision that the story exactly as told by Stevenson apparently wouldn't be interesting enough or exciting enough for the big screen.  What I really want to know is if any of these directors actually READ the book, or had a personal relationship with it?  I find it hard to believe that they did, since the films all give the impression of slapdash commercialism or outright confusion about what the book actually is.  Jim Hawkins is living quietly with his parents in a seaside inn, when the Captain shows up with his sea chest and a mysterious fear of "a seafaring man with one leg."  The Captain should be tall, mysterious, powerful and terrifying.  In two of these films, he seems to be played by short wrinkled winos; and in the third by some middle-aged guy who is apparently married to the lighting director's sister.  It only gets worse from there.  The tragedy of the Captain is that he is still physically vigorous and imposing at the start of the book - but Stevenson is bringing a doom to him that will shatter even the English oak of his adamant constitution - the combined forces of rum, terror and stroke.  The Captain's fate - to fall dead of a "thundering apoplexy" on the floor of the inn, forshadows the essential purpose of Stevenson's novel - to illustrate that a life of bloodthirsty avarice and short-sighted greed leads only to an ignominious death.  In the guise of a boy's adventure story, Stevenson pursues this deeper moral with a terrible purpose and with great dignity and power.  His pirate characters are not comic or lighthearted.  They are not caricatures.  They are not the wax mannequins of a Disney ride; they are real men with fears and desires and second thoughts; even with regrets.  They do not dance or traipse merrily through this story - they grimace and battle through it, gritting their teeth against the death, (from violence, sickness, treachery or rum,) that is always staring them in their faces.  Jim Hawkins' innocence and youth is the perfect foil for the pirates' hard-bitten cynicism and gold-lust.  It is no accident that, despite the courage and resourcefulness of the cabin party, (led by Captain Smollett,) it is still only Jim Hawkins' youthful optimism and curious spirit that ultimately saves them from "death at the hands of the pirates."  Stevenson is alluding to the biblical command to "be like the little children in order to be saved."  To tell this story properly, it must be told absolutely straight, and with the same committed earnestness with which Stevenson tells it.  None of these films is that brave.  To make a film that is faithful to Stevenson's moral, the director will need more courage and simplicity of purpose than we find in all three of these films combined.  Those of us who love and understand the novel for what it is must continue to hope for a film that does it justice. 
 While I agree with reviews indicating that the author has a beautiful style, I was tremendously disappointed at the lack of payoff in this book.  Yes, there are interesting situations, compelling descriptions... but the entire last third or so of the book fails to deliver anything worthy of the set-up prior to that. Did the author just get tired out?  Too committed to just tying up loose ends from the previous book?  This was quite a bummer as I wanted to like the book and had invested time and emotion up to that point 
   This Cd suck a** and d*** all at the same time, what a waste of trash coming from a good atrist, but bother picking this s*** at the stores. get any other album from Twista except this one. I guess no one had balls to rate this 0.0 just to cover and rap this up 
 I bought this book based on the rave reviews. Totally disappointed. This is a book of fortune-cookie adages with unnecessary mystery. I'm not giving it 0 star because I keep thinking if I get drunk, or I read it while I'm at sleep I might get at the messages 
 I've read many, many books in my life. Good and bad. This leans towards the bad. I gave it two stars simply for the love of the game. That is the only reason I made it through this horrid attempt at literary adaptation. I read fall of reach and found it to be a fairly decent novel. I noticed they switched writers when they published this one. This was a huge mistake. Dietz is possibly the blandest writers I have ever forced myself to read. There is absolutely no feeling to what he is writing. He even makes grievous grammar errors throughout the entire book. I found myself reading sentences time and time again in order to mine the meaning from them. Simply put, this is a bad. Real bad. I don't even think the back story is worth it. I noticed they switched back to the previous writer for the next book so someone must have noticed. If you really feel the need to read a book you've probably already played, then go for it. If you want to skip the shudders and shakes that Dietz's writing style will induce, don't feel guilty; you're not missing much. 
 This book has little story and a lot of bad porn. Read only if you are into fairy sex 
 Ring of Darkness (David DeCoteau, 2004)  Former porn director David DeCoteau, whose most notable mainstream flicks have been the Puppet Master franchise (he directed 3, 4, and 5, the last two under assumed names), takes an absolutely brilliant idea and makes an incredibly stupid movie out of it. Now, to be somewhat fair, not only is it a made-for-TV shlockfest, but one that certainly didn't have the budget of a Danielle Steel miniseries (IMDB estimates the film's budget at three-quarters of a million dollars). Still, it would be hard for this movie to be worse than it actually turned out; about the only thing that saves it is its premise and the fact that DeCoteau took nothing seriously.  We open with Gordo (Club Dread's Greg Cipes) fleeing from a mansion. Just as he gets to the beach and seems as if he's going to get away, he's cornered by four dark shapes. Cut to an announcement that boy band Take Ten are auditioning for a new lead singer. (I'm sure you can draw the proper conclusion.) After a round of auditions, during which you're liable to get as sick of the catchy little tune they play just as much as you did any nineties boy band hit, the four remaining members of the band choose three possible replacements for Gordo-- Shawn (Guiding Light actor Coltin Scott), Jonah (DeCoteau staple Jeff Peterson), and Xavier (Baywatch's Jeremy Jackson), who are all flown, with Xavier's girlfriend Stacy (American Idol finalist Ryan Starr, whom you will be pleased to know does not sing at any point in the film), to the band's island mansion. Which, of course, looks very familiar. As the three continue the auditions in a slightly more stressful situation, weird things start happening...  With all the young-and-beautiful male skin on display, you're likely to think you're watching a Victor Salva flick. However, comparisons with the superior Salva end there; DeCoteau directs as if Ring of Darkness (the title, by the way, has absolutely nothing to do with the movie itself) were his first film, not his fifty-second. I haven't seen this much obvious shot repetition in a movie since Night of the Lepus. The acting is atrocious, as one would expect from folks who cut their teeth in T&A-fests (the two notable exceptions to this are Adrienne Barbeau, who plays the band's manager, and Coltin Scott), the script is bad even for a horror-flick parody, and the whole thing is just on the right side of unwatchable to keep you glued to the screen.  Or maybe you just want to watch a boy band get theirs. I know that was my motivation.  
 Trying to break the cycle of reading a book until the bitter end whether I like it or not (and if I like it, there most certainly is not a 'bitter' end), I gave up on this one literally halfway through.  Part of me wanted to finish it because I had gotten so far into it, but I gave up and said 'enough.'  This book has so many elements repeating from many other Koontz books, thus it felt like a retread.  I did not care if the protagonist won the battle over his doppleganger.  I wasn't impressed by his perfect, adorable wife and children, or his career as an author of horror fiction.  And the afterword by the author seemed smug.  I'm sorry I read so much of it before I stopped, but better late than never 
 It's too bad that those responsible for releasing Stones complilations can't seem to find (or bother to remaster like the Beatles re-releases) Stereo versions of all of their 60's material. Anybody listening to this collection on a  good modern system will find some of the early tracks painfull and muddled. Even the later tracks chosen are the edited versions. Uneven releases by those controlling the Stones catalog are common. For example, every track on the Stones UK Aftermath release are in true stereo and sound crystal clear conversly all the songs on both versions of Out of Our Heads were released in mono only (remaster!). Talk about an uneven treatment of a catalog. There are no excuses why the best possible versions of every song could have been included in this release- they haven't, therefore the low rating. 
 This small book (120 pages)has 40 pages of content and 80 blank pages to record your personal history.  The author's personal history and lab results are included and offer little in substantive advice on managing the illness 
 Breaking up is the catalyst that will transform the lives for four people. Lucy Miller-Materson finds that her husband, who has recently flipped out in front of their family, has made one New Year's resolution, to leave her. Her sister's life of serial monogamy's most recent break up has left Miranda with many regrets, and what if's. Miranda's new room-mate and the girl Lucy has recently hired as an assitant, Roxy, walked out of her own wedding, and Christopher, the single father competing with Lucy for a promotion, faces the challenges of being a noncustodial dad on a daily basis.   Told from each of their points of view, this story often seems very disjointed. However, the fact that each does manage to make a comeback from disaster is noteworthy. Yet, a cleaner ending without more resolution would have been appreciated.    Amanda Killgore 
 This has got to be one of the worst books I have ever read.  It was boring.  You would think that a erotic fiction book would be at least a little bit sensual.  It was not.  Don't  waste your money 
 This was not Miami Vice. It was a cop movie with the same characters as the tv show. I realize they were trying to make an updated version of the show, but they updated it so much that it wasn't the show at all. Fox and Colin were not a goo match up on the screen. It felt like they weren't even in the same movie. 
 I ordered this book based on the great reader reviews it had.  After receiving the book and had a chance to look at it, I am not sure why the great reviews.  A second book I ordered, "The Ultimate Windows Server 2003 System Administrator's Guide" by Robert Williams and Mark Walla is a much better book 
 Much like the naturopathy school founded by one of the authors, this book LOOKS slick, professional and science based.  But, a closer look reveals a lack of any real substance.  Far too much emphasis is put on questionable diagnoses.Though the treament sections looks to be well referenced, many of the studies cited don't support the author's assertions and others are outright irrelevant!  Many of the disease monographs recommend a shoppingbag full of supplements--Polypharmacy at its worst.  Also it should be kept in mind that the second author is a rep for a nutritional supplement company, a potential conflict of interest not noted in the text.   Poor works such as this one only serve to damage the reputation of natural/integrative medicine.   Choose David Rakel's "Integrative Medicine" for more reliable information at a fraction of the price 
 I thoroughly enjoyed the author's earlier work on how the Irish saved civilization.  But this book was a disappointing compendium of Greek myths, legends and history that never reveals a plan behind the book.  Taken in its subparts, many sections are engagingly informative in an elegant if sometimes pretentious prose.  Yet the author ambles from here to there in a disjointed narrative with interesting nuggets but little insight.  Where's the big picture?  The author attempts to wrap it up at the end with a sentence about the Greeks' "variety of human response, lightening quick transmutations, resourcefulness, and inexhaustible creativity."    A subtitle like "A Greek Treasury of Personal Vignettes" might have been more descriptive and merited another star. But it falls short as a "hinge of history" with impoverished and even maladaptive connections (FDR as Solon - really?) to the modern world. I am sorry to not recommend it. 
 A friend recommended this book to me, so I picked it up.  From the start, I had to force myself to keep going.  I read the whole book, but I wouldn't recommend it 
 I didn't like the book Freak The Mighty. I just like it at all. It was a book that I never would have read if it weren't for our class Literature Circle. I didn't like it because it was a book that didn't have a good plot, and it jumps around alot 
 I got through 5 chapters out of 12 before the ideas started to become repetitive and muddled. It was like someone who talks very fast, sharing every thought and theory without a clear idea of the desired outcome. Way too much jargon and Phrases That Were Needlessly Capitalized. Maybe useful as a text book, but for somone looking for a clear process to assist my organization, it really missed the mark. Oh, and the book started to fall apart the second time I picked it up. 
 I love Heinlein.  I think that he has a unique voice and perspective in the world of science fiction.  I find that his plots and ideas are inventive.  Even this story was inventive in many ways, like some of the business ideas in regards to the new source of energy in the first chapters.  However, I found this book as a whole to be very boring.  Much of this is due to the lack of fully fleshed characters.  The "main" characters of each section of the book aren't fully realized at all.  I wouldn't recommend this book unless you picked it up for free and were really, really bored 
 If you are looking to obtain a basic knowlege of web programming, then this is not the book for you. I wanted a basic guide, but the author managed to create a book that is TOO basic. Yes, I was able to get my first website up on the internet, but it doesn't DO anything. For that, I'll need to buy another book. 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 I have purchased and returned two sets of these headphones. The first set overheated and fried itself as soon as the batteries were installed. The second set worked for a little over an hour before developing constant hissing and popping. Also the head band adjuster would not retract on one side, making it impossible to fold them up for storage in the travel bag.  I consider the quality of this headset one of the poorest I have ever seen. Even frayed bare wires were visible on one side.   I recommend you avoid Taurus products completely 
 i really liked the first one and even went to my mom's house to pick up the second one (this) at 10:30 at night right after i had finished it because i was so pumped to read on. from the get go i could not get into this book and i had to force myself to get to page 120. not much has happened to make me want to finish it. very boring. not really into roz and mitch characters, i don't think they are very well developed, they seem kind of blah. and the story is kind of blah. blah, blah, blah, and just words for the blah, blah, blah going on and on.  
 Joy's book reflects the comedy I see from her on TV. This book is very cute and entertaining. A fun read 
 In our opinion this book is a poor excuse for scholarship. The seminal work by Harry Oldmeadow on this same subject shows what a scholarly work should be - thorough, balanced and properly sourced. Interesting that Oldmeadow isn't listed in the Index.   This book appears to rely on hearsay and an incorrect understanding of Traditionlism to concoct a sensationlist work that is a marketer's dream but a true scholar's nightmare. 
 I read this book many years ago as a philosophy student, and I was eager to commit any amount of study this book might require to develop a comprehensive understanding. Now, the reason I approached Being and Nothingness with such enthusiasm is because of the reputation which precedes this book: it was hailed as the existentialist's bible -- and, to some degree, remains as such. So, I gave the book several careful readings and meditations.  Okay, let's be forthright here. The book is a waste of time. It is a lot of "nothingness" concealed behind a dazzling wall of language that is purposefully esoteric and employs vague and ambiguous terminology. Naturally, proponents of this book (and others like it -- there are plenty more out there) reason that such critism is the result of frustration, the readers' having not given the book an ample study, or are lacking the intellectual capacity to comprehend the matter. But the truth of the matter is, the book  provides nothing satisfying, practical, or enlightening. And of those who do acknowledge Sartre's elaborate charade, a few insist on praising him solely on the grounds that, hey, at least he devised a grand philosophical system. So what? Any buffoon with enough time on his hands can devise a system...just look at L. Ron Hubbard.  At any rate, whatever you think of Sartre's existentialism and phenomenology, consider what Einstein said. He said (among other things) that if you cannot explain your theory to a child, your theory probably isn't worth explaining at all. And also consider that Einstein was able to write his The Special and General Theory of Relativity to be understood, not only by physicists, but by laymen as well. Unfortunately, most philosophers abhor clear, concise writing (especially 20th century philosophers of deconstructionist and postmodernist movements).  My advice: save yourself some disappointment. Take your money and buy something worth reading. The only purpose of this book was Sartre's using language to force others to defer to him as the authority of an elusive ideology...that, and to make himself a buck 
 The Lusiads places the decadence of the epic genre in its end. The Lusiads bears no power, it is only the song of a feeble hero which is not even by far compared to great characters just like Odysseus. Vasco da Gama is uninteresting, he is in no profound context of living except that of praising Portugal's doings in navegation and conquest. Camoes doesn't matter how many peoples were killed and explored in name of this. The Lusiads is, so, a song of ideological doutrination with less masterpiece characteristics, that means it is not a classic, but a book imposed as part of a certain canon. It is not a good book because its aim is not to make art, but to USE art in order to praise the advancement of the portuguese project of conquering and exploring. The Lusiads placement as a classic is, so, ideologically played to a specific economical and religious aim 
 I expected this book to have ideas, rituals, projects, etc. to share with your child/children on the traditions of the god and goddess, which it did.  What I didn't expect was the small section on Youth and Maiden Lovemaking, and the irresponsible advice it touted.  Written by a 14-year old (which is surprising enough) who obviously has no idea what he's talking about, it opens with "A lot to being a Pagan is being a good lover.  My attitude is, why not start sooner than later?"  This child is 14!  Our kids are already out there experimenting at early ages, and now we have this boy promoting that?!  Next he talks about STDs - "You may hear about STDs, and the fact is, the *only* way to prevent STDs are condoms and outercourse."  Uh, no...the *only* way to fully prevent an STD is abstinence, but since that is not a realistic way to think, why not say that condoms will *protect* you from STDs, but not always *prevent*, so make sure you use them correctly and responsibly.  And you can't get an STD from "outercourse"?  Really?  I think this kid needs to go back and do his homework on this one.    It's a shame, because up until this point, this chapter was really beautiful and informative, but by throwing in this drivel it managed to take away from the previous good advice and end this chapter on a negligent and dangerous note. 
 The professional "review" is a puff-piece. This is a horrible piece of kitchen equipment. It is a flimsy piece of plastic and a danger to the cook.  There is no built-in holder for the blades. These, inevitably, float aound your kitchen cupboards and, just as inevitably, get lost. And, if you have never scrambled around in a drawer for a razor-sharp metal hedgehog, you have still have a treat in store for you.   The finger-guard is a travesty. It is flat, small piece of plastic. It cannot be attached to the machine, so it will get lost too. Your fingers run very close to the blades when cutting. One mis-slice and you can cut a deep little pocket in your finger.   The blades are badly designed and catch and tear, rather than slice, your food. They are small, easily lost and fall out when you are cutting.   (As I did. Coulda studded it with garlic and baked it, but seeing the bone in my finger turned me off meat for a while. Sorry folks, a description of the taste of long pig will have to wait awhile.)  The blades are attached with a small, badly designed screw which you have to tighten HARD with your fingers a few mm from the blades. Same problem when you remove a blade.  And it has a ridiculously high price. You can get better mandolines right here at Amazon at a much lower price. Also MUCH better mandolins at somewhat higher prices.  Take my advice: If you don't cook enough to be very handy with knivies, then a mandolin (despite "finger guards" and the like) are dangerous. The mandolin is a lovely thing for the serious cook. Slicing, julliennes, etc are a breeze. But, as with kitchen knives, dont get a piece of junk. 
 A rewiver In a big music magazine wrote that this record reminded him of Bottle Rockets and The Drive-By Truckers. He must be kiddin`. You can't compare apples with oranges. I rather say It sounds like Bon Jovi were playin somekind of Nashville pop-country, like the Great Divide.  Some compare this to legends like Lynyrd Skynyrd and Allman Bros. They couldnt have been listening to the same record as me!  But If you like Shelby Lynne and Pat Greens newer stuff, lend an ear to these guys. But If you want blood, search the real thing In these bands The Lost Trailers thinks they have something In common with. 
 I bought this book at the SF Garden Show on a whim and am kind of disappointed in it. This book features pictures of large, grass filled mini-estates in Georgia. This type of gardening style is not that useful in the Bay Area, where people have smaller homes and smaller yards, and are trying to eliminate large lawn areas to reduce water usage. I found some of her advice to be strange -- like avoiding groundcovers because they are not low maintenance. It seems like every single one of her featured evergreen shrubs is a neatly trimmed boxwood. Even in Georgia it seems like there might be a few more choices.   The bottom line: if you have a MacMansion somewhere east of the Mississippi and you like conventional landscapes then this book is for you. For everyone else there are better choices available 
 Not at all what I wanted.  It is a plastic slip on that pushes the buttons when you don't want them pushed.  Ordered 2 and plan to return them.  I usually don't even bother to write a bad review; I just don't write one, but in this case I'll make an exception.  Yuk!  Actually, I rate it at a "0" but there was no "0" selection. 
 This isn't as bad as the garbage tracks Morrison did to get out of his Bang recording contract (nothing like "Ringworm" in this collection), but this is not even a mediocre Van release. I like most of his releases, even COMMON ONE, INARTICULATE SPEECH, and BEAUTIFUL VISION. Here, Van just seems commited to getting the "product" out on time. DOWN THE ROAD was much stronger, and DAYS LIKE THIS 
 This was hands down the worst movie I've ever seen, and I saw Bats, starring Lou Diamond Phillips IN THE THEATRE. That was two hours of my life that I will never get back. I could go into detail, but it just isn't worth it 
 I'm in charge of a weekly touch football game where we use an official NFL football from a previous year and I wanted to get another one for backup. I know 'The Duke' is supposed to be the official NFL ball from this year, but there seems to be something wrong with the balls Amazon is shipping.   The first ball I got from Amazon was hard as a rock, slick as all get out and had poor stitching in the laces. I got a second one and the stitching was a bit better, but it was still hard and slippery. And when it was exposed to rain, the ball stained the hands of everyone who touched it with red coloring. I have no clue if that's to be expected or not since it's all leather but it seems odd.    In any case, you can grip the ball with a good pair of sticky football gloves, which also help mitigate the pain of catching the ball. So, it is usable and throws a nice spiral but maybe I play ball with a bunch of wussies cuz no one else wants to get near that thing out of fear of breaking their hands (which is kind of annoying given how much i paid for the balls).   Maybe the footballs just need to be broken in, but I'm not really sure how to do that aside from playing with them, which no one seems to want to do. I've tried to let some air out to make the things more user-friendly, but it doesn't really help.   Anyway, I find it really hard to believe this is the ball the NFL played with this year. Something about them just seems cheaply made. In any case, I suggest you save some money and go with a decent composite leather ball.  
 Hi, I have never written any reviews and don't plan on making a habit of it, but I know what it is to be truly heartbroken. I want to help you in any way I can because I know what you are going through. I have read every book on the subject that is out there, believe me. If you are really hurting, this book is not for you. It does not give you practical advice to help you get through the hurt. It's goal is to make you laugh and even at that, when you are hurting so badly, that is hard to do. I recommend two books for you: "You Didn't Complete Me" and "It's Called a Break-up because it's Broken." These were much more helpful to me. 
 These are paper thin cotton and feel rough.  They may soften if washed a few times but the fabric is so thin they may also disintegrate!  A big thumbs down from me and I'm usually a CK underwear fan 
 This book is embarassing.  Even worse than Icons of Evolution.  What he presents as science is mostly a mix of ignorance and outright lies.  There are many sites by real scientists which expose Wells' errors and fabrications step by step (Panda's Thumb is a good one.) Anybody who is unfamiliar with the actual scientific literature on evolution would be well advised to visit one of those sites and at least begin the process of self education.  If you do, you will quickly see how unreliable Wells is as a science writer 
 I enjoyed the half of this book that I read--which is to say, I found the Byronic novel-within-novel completely unreadable (and I am a fan of overembellished, melodramatic nineteenth-century novels, so this was actually the part of the book to which I was most looking forward), but was completely engrossed by the relationships depicted and developed through the series of emails. To me, those were the richest and most eloquent part of the novel, and I could easily have spent another 200 pages with those three characters. (Every time I would hit a section of "novel," I would get irritated at being interrupted.) So I'm not sure if I would recommend this book or not, as the only way I could enjoy it was not to read half of it 
 This is Mr. Hansens translation of the fourth chapter of the Tao Te Ching.  Guidance pours out but in using it, something is not filled. Whew! It's like the ancestor of the ten-thousand natural kinds. Dull its sharp, untie its tie, blend its bright, together its  diffused particles. Ooh! it's like it partly endures. I don't know whose son it is. It is before the emperor of signs.  Whew! It's like you don't know how to read classic Chinese, Mr. Hansen.  Ooh! It's like your ignorance is pouring out.  I don't know whose son you are, but they wasted a great deal of money on your education. Whew! Ooh!  P.S.   I would suggest, Mr.Hansen, stop consulting Rick Flair when translating ancient Chinese characters. 
 After a couple months, the humidity became stuck at 20%.  Even holding it by my humidifier didn't help 
 Sorry, I'm a big fan of the first two D.F. CDs. Anxiously awaited the third...bought it without hesitation...mmm, sadly disappointed. The magic the first two brought to the world is what seemed to set them apart.  Cosmic, mysterious and almost spooky. So fitting to the groups name, Deep  forest made me feel sensuously connected to the natural world. Comparsa on  the other hand, though it must certainly fill the musicians desires to  expand their creative global conquest, fans like myself feel abruptly  misdirected. Harsh, tinny, fast Latin rhythems, overwhelm a majority of the  otherwise liquid and textural backbeat tracks. I just can't seem to kick  back and drift away with this latest endeavor. Unfortunatly, it reminds me  more of a Nature Company Latin sampler (don't get me wrong, I love the  works of groups such as B-Tribe). But if you're expecting more of the same  to come out of this beloved duo, get ready for a hard right. Perhaps their  next albumn will return to a kinder, gentler world 
 This is, without a doubt, the worst investment I have made so far.  The grammar and punctuation is deplorable, and the information is next to useless.  There are infinitely better sources for anyone looking for information on how to start a small business.  I would have given it a rating of less than one star had one been available.  Save your time and money 
 I must respectfully disagree with the esteemed reviewers of this book listed above.  I expected so much more from a book with such a fine pedigree (Brookings and the US Council on Foreign Relations).  The topic of how states use financial instruments towards their foreign policy goals is an area which certainly requires more understanding.  As such, I expected this book to be an in-depth study of the various ways states have used such tools, and how the authors expect such tools to be used in the future.  I thus expected analyses of topics such as how states respond to currency crises of allies and enemies and how states use counterfeiting of enemies' currencies as foreign policy (i.e. as Iran is alleged to do with the US dollar).  I also expected a study of how states manipulate access to important currencies (as when the US cut Panama off from receiving dollars as part of an effort to topple Noreiga) and how they have sought to manipulate the foreign financial press (as is alleged to have happened during the classical Gold Standard era).    Some of these topics did receive  mention.  The issue of how the US should respond to allies' crises received good coverage, especially regarding South Korea.  There was also one paragraph acknowledging that countries have counterfeited others' currencies, and a brief discussion of petro-dollar recycling.  Moreover, I found the chapter on how interest groups have attempted to restrict access to US capital markets to further other goals very illuminating, and there was a nice summary of anti-terrorism finance legislation.  Overall, I found the first half of the book very enlightening.  Unfortunately, the other half of the book dealt predominantly with the authors' assertions that dollarization should be the way forward for developing countries to prevent currency crises, and in particular, that the US should encourage this and absorb some of the costs.  The issues of whether countries should use floating, dirty float, pegged or dollarized exchange rates is an important one.  However, I did not pick up this book to read about the authors' assertions about dollarization--I picked it up to read about financial statecraft.  Financial statecraft will only grow in importance, and as the authors note, it is critical that policymakers understand how it functions and what tools are at their disposal. This book only discusses financial statecraft primarily in its first 80 pages (and scattered in some places in the latter part of the book as well).  I feel eighty pages was just too little to adequately examine financial statecraft.  Instead, the reader is unfortunately left with a quick gloss-over of only a few aspects of such an important and under-analyzed topic 
 Sadly, Chicago Poems (1916), the author's first published work, is the book for which self-styled folk poet Carl Sandburg is best remembered today. The collection takes a hard and unswerving look at the grim realities of urban life for the common man, funneled through the flume of the author's committed socialist ideological perspective. Such an approach to poetry may have been somewhat novel in the America of the time, and both history and critics have been kind to Sandburg's sympathetic portraits of human suffering.   But whether he is addressing "a dago shovelman," an immigrant who has forgotten the dignified being his ancestors in Europe or who can no longer recognize "the new-mown hay smell calling on the wind," a street walker with "haggard poems and desperate eyes," or a young woman burned to death in a factory fire, Sandburg continually adopts the simplistic notion that the lower economic strata of society is always victimized but virtuous, while governmental institutions, bosses of all stripes, the professional classes, and the wealthy are uniformly cruel, oppressive, exploitive, and, at best, indifferent.   Thus, Chicago Poems reads like a 132-page polemic with a very narrow political point of view. While many of the author's observations are poignantly insightful (such as the poverty-stricken family of a dead boy in 'The Right To Grief,' who are "glad it is gone, for the rest of the family will now have more to eat and wear"), the poems, when read together, take on an oppressively unbalanced character of their own.   In 'A Fence,' for example, "the rabble and all vagabonds and hungry men and wandering children looking for a place to play" stand outside the gates of a newly constructed "stone house on the lake front" built by a wealthy man, who, the poet infers, can be nothing but immoral, amoral, or corrupt. In the author's Usher-esque vision, nothing will be able to pass through the gates to the property except "Death and the Rain and Tomorrow." And tomorrow, for such a corrupt individual or family, will inevitably bring nothing but waves of bad conscience and fevered isolation. 'Soiled Dove' examines the life of a woman who "was not a harlot until she married a corporation lawyer," but who automatically becomes one by acquiescing to such a marriage, and who soon discovers her husband also loves "six other women," as if marital infidelity was limited exclusively to the upper economic classes. In contrast, 'Happiness' is confidently represented as "a crowd of Hungarians under the trees with their women and children and a keg of beer and an accordion," an image which may seem simultaneously naïve, patronizing, and condescending to many readers.   Occasionally, Sandburg wisely acknowledges that some portion of the tragedies of man's existence are simply inherent in the natural human life cycle. "The hand of God" also comes in for blame in several poems.   Chicago Poems is most effective when Sandburg bypasses social divisionalism--as he often did in his later volumes of poetry--and simply addresses the everyman in the individual. While these poems are often infused with a lyrical and tender sentimentality slightly reminiscent of James Whitcomb Riley, they also locate and acknowledge the beautiful within the tragedies that perpetually arise from human frailty, vulnerability, and mortality. In 'Dream In The Dusk,' the author warns that "tears and loss and broken dreams may find your heart at dusk," while 'Under The Harvest Moon' identifies "Death" as "the gray mocker, [who] comes to you as a beautiful friend who remembers." 'I Sang' describes a lover who has given up his heart to "you and the moon," but "only the moon remembers, and is kind to me."   Other poems have the more pronounced folk character of Sandburg's later volumes. The speaker in 'Theme In Yellow' is the pumpkin, who celebrates the paganistic dance of children around him "on the last day of October...singing ghost songs and love to the harvest moon...I am the jack-o-lantern with terrible teeth and the children know I am fooling."   The most recent edition of The Complete Poems of Carl Sandburg (2003), which contains Chicago Poems in its entirety, is 832 pages long, and provides its readership with the full range of Sandburg's original and often gloriously rich and sensual vision of life. It also contains works like 'At The Gates of Tombs,' from Slabs of the Sunburnt West (1922), in which Sandburg, "the crazy wild dreamer," more fully and maturely developed his political vision. Comparatively, the reductive, often despairing Chicago Poems reads like the immaturely polarized work that it is.   
 Can you say "sanctimonious hot air", boys and girls?  This author should know better. I only got through the first few pages of this while I was bookstore-browsing one day before I tossed it aside with a roll of my eyes.  Kitwana completely misses the point.  The "loss of a mainstream cultural identity among whites" doesn't turn these kids onto hip-hop.  Nor do today's underclass whites' socioeconomic status (identifying with being a minority) and being raised in more racially-integrated neighborhoods solely make them idolize and mimic rappers.    The reason Eminem is the biggest selling rap artist today among white youth is the same reason Elvis and the Beatles were huge in the 50s: APPROPRIATION, black American creativity in the Arts and Music arena is a CASH COW.  We live in a Capitalist society, we worship the Almighty $$$, and any time there's money to be made off of the popularity of some new thing, it is pimped out for all it's worth.  Everything is for sale here and inviting any other theory for this "whites loving what blacks do" argument is akin to spinning your wheels in a ditch. One major support for my opinion is this: blacks had to do much assimilating into the white Anglo-Saxon culture of the U.S. in order to achieve success, wealth, and equal representation of their civil rights under protection of the law.  "Survival of the Fittest" in a social context is common sense - adapt/adopt the ways and habits of the ruling class to raise yourself and your family up, and you will be tolerated (but still not truly welcomed, trusted or appreciated).   Black culture, marketed and sold as an image, a lifestyle, to other races is a big moneymaker because interracial love and whites with blacks is still taboo to many (and I daresay MOST) people. All sorts of bizarre, racist lies and jokes are still popular (just not PC) and feed the psychological flames of fear of the unknown. The psychology of racism works both ways - as a tool for fear, hatred and ignorance (the three-headed dragon that never dies) and as an emotional vessel for the expression of exotic sensuality, sexuality and rebellion.  I call it the rape of the African queen, but that may be too harsh for some.  From the antebellum period of the 1600s when slavery was constitutionally protected, up until the Civil Rights Movement, whites have always admired, patronized, supported and profited from black art forms, not just Music (Jazz, Bebop, Rock and Roll and the Blues before Rap, all of which have deep roots in Afro-Caribbean culture) but our achievements in the Sciences, in Engineering, Sports, Medicine, Education, Dance, Theatre, and so on.  Even when black American athletes were treated worse than dogs in the street at home, they were sent to Greece in the 40s to participate in the Olympics, because EXCELLENCE cannot be ignored.  It is costly to hold talented black people back, and when they excel, they are considered ASSETS (instead of second-class citizens or property).  But it's still all about money.   Americans must have the most short-term memory of any other creature on the planet when it comes to race.  Either that, or they just like living in a dream world.  Books like this one try to convince the reader that there's something going on other than white folks turning a buck off of hard black labor (akin to the slave days).  The fact that now, in today's society, more blacks have education and affluence, have more equality under the law, and can make nearly as much money as "The Man" (lol) doesn't change the reality that CAPITALISM makes it all possible.  It's a conceit there's anything else going on BUT the mass exploitation of race.  There's always been a strong, historical undercurrent of attraction/revulsion of whites toward blacks, this dangerous sexual paradox, and it continues to this very day.  This book should be four pages long, at the most, with a picture of Al Jolson in blackface on a $100 dollar bill. Or, better yet, Eminem, since our TiVo, Xbox, Internet and Ipod generation of profligate youth don't study their own history (unless it's about war or Christianity) and wouldn't know who Jolson is.    Even though I don't mean to equate ALL Rap music as Minstrelsy, to a disturbingly large degree, the most anti-social, anti-law, violent and "proudly thuggish" Gangsta Rap is an update on the stereotypical Black Menial, all brute strength and raw sexuality, but no brains.  Gangsta Rap is self-destructive, but it is based on something all men love - the extravagant power of the Mafia.  A dark-skinned millionaire with gold teeth, dressed in a suit and tie (or track-star party clothes !!!), spending all his money on jewelry, cars and mansions, carrying a Glock - this is the updated Black Buck of the 21st century. Like Shaft, dangerous and cool. And we can all appreciate a scary "urban" legend.  Besides, Christian values are full of duality - white/black, good/evil, rich/poor, and this is one way for whites to celebrate that walk on the wild side.  To play with fire but not get burned. So out of a compulsive Liberal-guilt-for-white-privilege complex (which is self-pitying behavior) or a delusion that the differences between whites and blacks no longer matter (which is insulting), many young whites co-opt black styles until they grow tired of it, subvert it, or find a way to exploit it themselves.  I'm just letting you know how this works through a CAPITALIST perspective.  It's just business as usual.  And I guess after my explanation, it still must be said that to most black people, Jewish people are white people, too.  We don't differentiate.   The use of the terms "wangsta" and "wigger" are laughable and obnoxious at best, not damaging to any white person's psyche, because they're still white, no matter what music scene they're into. There are sociocultural reasons.  Many whites grow up in mostly black neighborhoods, and like any other group in that environment, many of them learn to take on the appearance and mannerisms of the prevailing ethnic group.  They "talk in ebonics" and throw up gang signs to be ironic... is this odd behavior funny to the rest of us not raised in these environments?  Sure, you bet.  We love to poke fun at people who don't quite fit.  Human nature, I guess.  But this book doesn't even begin to articulate or provide any measures to eradicate the problem of racism or classism.  Classism combined with racism is worse these days.  Rich white kids especially think it's cool that they can somehow "be down" and "get gangsta" with disenfranchised black kids, which is really downplaying the seriousness of the social disparity among blacks and whites, as if the world's just a great big ferris wheel of stupid fun.  Some would say maybe it is and I need a sense of humor.  But tell you what.  Instead of reading this book, read a book by Dr. Cornell West or Tony Brown instead.  Even "Soul On Ice" by Eldridge Cleaver.  Then you'll begin to understand why whites love rap music so much. And why most blacks still mistake flattery for fellowship.  
 Another reviewer said it perfectly - this book is overrated, and that's being kind.  The purported "twist" at the end - you'd have to be blind & imbecilic not to see it coming.  Even though the "twist" isn't explicitly spelled out at the end, it's fairly obvious.    I listened to the audio version of it, and while all 3 main narrators were great, I had to fast forward much of it when Ralph Trilipush was the narrator - the incessant droning on and on and on got to be very tedious.    In the beginning, I liked all the characters but Ralph, Ferrell seemed nice, and Margaret seemed OK too.  It annoyed me that the main (titular) character seemed to have no redeeming qualities - he was arrogant, condescending, and altogether disagreeable.  By the end, all 3 main characters devolved into unlikable, although the reason we come not to like Ferrell may have been in another characters imagination.  I finished it mainly to see how the author tied up certain things and wished I hadn't bothered.  The only reason it's even getting 2 stars is that there were points when the author has Ralph exhibit fits of temper that are quite humorous 
 Author devotes 2 pages to mathematically prove & philosophically justify that a manager should chose the highest NPV project before chosing the next highest NPV project.  Such logic continues ad infinitum throughout the 800+ page text.  Time for 3rd Ed 
 In the Introduction, Arthur Benavie tries very hard to make the case that this book offers a fair and balanced analysis of Social Security reform.  It does not.  Chapters 1 and 2 are designed to present the cases for and against privatization of Social Security.  In Chapter 1 (Fixing Social Security) he presents the case for saving the system through a long list of tax increases and benefit reductions.  The opposing side of the argument is not presented at all.  In Chapter 2 (Should We Privatize Social Security?), he starts out by presenting as many cons as he does pros for the privatization point of view.  For every item he describes what the supporters of privatization espouse, he provides a rapid response in attempt to discredit the idea.  By dedicating one chapter each to the "higher taxes/lower benefits" and the "privatization" viewpoints, he must think he is being "balanced".  Bottom line...this book is advertised as a balanced analysis of Social Security reform.  But it comes down clearly on the side of being against any reform designed to privatize a portion of Social Security.  This may be a good book for you if you want to read an author make the case against privatization of Social Security.  If you want to truely understand the trade-offs associated with privatization, this book will be a big letdown 
 I am so tired of reading IBS books that promise to help and don't deliver.  The book had the standard "eat bran" and "keep a food  diary" advice that my doctor gave. This doesn't help me. I also don't  want recipes for hamburgers and alfredo sauce when I KNOW that high fat  foods make me sick. The author claims she has IBS but if she eats the way  this book suggests I doubt it. I didn't learn anything new or helpful for  controlling my symptoms 
 The problem with the book is that it's utterly uncritical of the entirety of Stephen King's work - it's simply a basic recounting of the novel's plot, followed up with a few bits of trivia and the author's "What I Liked" section.   The problem is that the author of this book likes everything about Stephen King, even when he's talking about King's weaker material. You could write the words "I love Stephen King and everything he's ever done!" on an index card, then post it next to the Amazon search results for Stephen King and you'd have this book in a nutshell.   Plus, he refers to the Gor novels as "wildly popular". Uh, no.  -Darren MacLenna 
 I was disappointed with my purchase.   The first two tapes in the series were fine, but when I inserted the 3rd tape into my machine the tape started feeding out the front of the machine.  I checked the tape and the wheels or sprockets they were wound on were loose and free floating inside the plastic casing.  I, then examined the other remaining cassettes and 4 of the 8 had the same problem.  I wonder if these products were seconds or something?  I would not order from this vendor again because it could have ruined my machine and because it is a hassle to have to return merchandise in today's busy work world.  
 This exceedingly short memoir of a Swedish SS volunteer in the last days of the SS Nordland division in 1945 is short on real specifics yet long on multiple condemnations of the Bolshevik hordes. Wallin through Hillblad (the editor), gives little in detail on his unit or men he fought with. This contrasts with his unrepentant and relentless anti-Soviet propaganda which even reaches out to American flyers. Wallin conveniently forgets a couple of facts: (1) Nazi Germany was the aggressor nation in WWII., and (2) Wallin volunteered to fight for this criminal regime.   Apart from this, the quality of the Wallin's writing or recollection and Hillblads editing is very simplistic. Fictional works like the Forgotten Soldier capture the drama and action of the Eastern Front conflict much better and without the speeches. One star only and that is for the few pages of photos at the end of the book. "Twilight of the Gods" yeah, sure Erik 
 I was really looking forward to settling in with this book and having a good laugh.  Instead, what I found was a pretentious book where the author tried way too hard to be funny . . . and very little of it actually was.  The author definitely has a way of turning a phrase in an original way, but you cannot hang an entire chapter on one cute phrase.  Reading this book was just way too much effort and not nearly fun enough.  Yuck 
 The MF's once again have used a real issue (rape) as a means to drive a wedge between the sexes and pretend as if the source of all evil resides in one gender.   I can't take seriously any research, conclusions, statistics, or anything else that derives from the minds and lips of misandrists like Dworkin--a person who believes that sexual thrusting on the part of a man should be discontinued.  Who are you kidding?  The human beings five-starring this book are complicit in this crime of opportunity.  The real agenda on all MF fronts is to permanently divide women from men by any and all means necessary, the primary means being fear and propaganda.  And I can hear all the screeching now: HE IS DEFENDING MEN WHO RAPE WOMEN!  Not at all.  I'm condemning MFs who use rape to scare women into thinking that every man they meet is a potential rapist or would-be rapist.  I also resent the MF inability to recognize that women engage in sexual gamesmanship, seduction, and sexual domination behavior.   
 This book was implausible and boring. Lots of errors that editors should have found -- I'm too uninterested even to bother pointing them out because fixing them won't improve the book anyway. Dumb premise -- stupid characters -- unanswered questions -- bad ending  Where is the "medical" in this thriller?  I am even tired of Jack and Laurie and basketball and unrealistic chase scenes that have absolutely no bearing on the climax of the story or the rationales the doctor provides. Nothing at the end made sense and I didn't like this book at all 
 I read the other reviews before purchasing this product (thank goodness!) and decided that I would just remove the tapes that were considered offensive.  Out of curiousity, though, my husband and I played them after my 4 and 2 yr. olds had gone to sleep.  I am utterly blown away that someone approved this!  I'm assuming only adults are reading these reviews and that I can't be held responsible for quoting the lyrics included on this product, but I think everyone should be aware of just how offensive these songs are.  One song is all about how the teenage boy doesn't want to date the girl he's singing to, Stacy, but instead that her "mom has got it going on" and that he saw the mom in just a towel when he was mowing the lawn and could tell she's hot for him as well by the way she was standing... I do NOT want my 4 yr old singing those lyrics.  But even more mind-boggling was the Outkast song that followed--the guy kept telling his girl to "give him some sugar" and "shake it like a polaroid picture" and then said "I don't wannna meet your Daddy, I just want you in my Caddy, I don't wanna meet your Mama (said "Mumma"), I just want to see you cum-a."  OH MY GOSH!  You can't believe my husband's face upon hearing this on a child's toy!!!  I'm disgusted and would encourage EVERYONE to call in to complain about this!  If I hadn't read the reviews, my daughter would be singing along with that!  Someone needs to lose his or her job over this 
 If you like Rush Limbaugh you'll love this.  And no that certainly was not a compliment.  This is a poorly structured essay and it reads like political commentary from a sixteen year old conservative fighting hard to win his first extemporaneous speaking competitition.   I think I've written one review before and I've purchased somewhere between 300 - 500 books from Amazon over the last seven years.  But this little short at the wee cost of .49 irked me into such an apathetic frenzy (it's like when you are furious but so drained) that I had to write one more.  I would put it into the category of 'Hey Mike and Greg... I need a few pages for a short on Amazon by 5 pm tonight, you guys know anything about Space travel [uh yeah... we've read Clarke and Asimov]... Cools... alright mail me the document by 4.30 pm... ok.'  In a time when we have so much literature to choose from I am astounded that Amazon would even alot megabytes for this.  My recommendation ... if you like Rush (and no I'm not talking about the band)... buy this... hey buy ten copies.  But if you have a deeper insight into the workings of people, cultures and society... pick up Kim Stanley Robinson's 'Imagining  Abrupt Climate Change - Terraforming Earth'.  And no I'm not with the publisher or anything like that. I just read them back to back. I wasn't sure if I read the Space Travel one however until I woke up and felt something wet on my head and a blood stained, cracked monitor glaring back at me with this closing statement...   "Big nuclear rockets heaving up into deep space will be a clear emblem of soaring ambitions, a bright metaphor visible everywhere in the promising night sky."  I don't know if he is talking about space travel or phallic symbols.  To conclude: The article is filled with a lack of vision and reeks of copy paste from various sci-fi stories from the late 1960's and early 1970's... yes Greg/Mike we know about the donut shaped thingies ... and yes we know about centifugal (not exactly that but let's just say that) force. Yes we know about the big pretty rockets. And yes we know about the dream of water as a fuel source....  To the authors... nothing personal. :)  Sincerely,  Arthu 
 ...at how bad this book is and at how so many reviewers gave it 5 stars (not humanly possible, they must be friends).. I spent this last New Years reading it with a couple of friends.. and laughed and laughed on how stupid it all is... for a laugh its great... a waste of money though 
 This is the kind of work that causes mental illness. A young, impressionable reader will turn to this author with the expectation of discovering what reality is, only to be misled into a corrupt concept of the author's personal, mystical "reality." A nightmare.  Authors like this should be held legally liable for the damages they inflict.   If you prefer your reality clear, honest and concrete, consult such works as Vitzthum's "Materialism."  
 Not a good book in many ways.  Lots of slapdash comment, quite a few innacuracies and badly edited.  Seems like it was rushed out to fill a gap in the market.  I've worked in banks for years, and followed cyrypto development and written crypto policy, we bought this book to introduce the subject to some of our new guys, and we quickly fell out of favor with the content.  Save your dollars and buy something a little bit more credible 
 I have to say I truly hated this book. The premise sounded interesting so I decided to give it a try.  I've read all her other books in the series and found the characters to be quirky.  This time I found her usual friends and co-workers to be boring and self involved caricatures. The groundwork was there for an interesting serial killer with complex motivation but it never developed that way. The constant head hopping was annoying and the ending came out of nowhere.  Cromwell has obviously gotten bored with her characters and it shows.  This is my last Cromwell 
 My first viewing of Fahrenheit 451 since its initial release in 1966 was last night via DVD.  Any casual film fan who watches will fall to sleep very fast. Based on the novel by Ray Bradbury, the clever idea of the future sets the stage for an interesting movie. The vehicle that the 451 unit drives is one of the most unusual devices science fiction will ever see.  The plot, the sound and the characters are all completely uninteresting, minus Montag, whom Oskar Werner plays very well.  The moment with the lady with the hidden library was probably one of the silliest examples of what books meant to some. FAHRENHEIT 451 may be considered a classic to some, but without a remake quick, this is a boring artifact to science fiction theater. In the future, the government outlaws books and promotes people to do nothing but watch TV and take drugs. Miserable firefighter Montag, set for a promotion in the 451 book burning unit, takes up the suggestion from a fellow monorail passenger to read a book. His life then goes upside-down from there. Skip the movie and read the book instead 
 I had to read this book for english class. It isn't all that great, it's too melodramatic at some point and too classic. The only good one is the character of Colonel Wain which is an interesting one because of it complexity 
 I read this book as part of a book discussion group I had joined and it was so wretchedly lackluster it proved to be the death knell of me ever going back to the group. This book was half-baked, boring, and grievously devoid of even the tiniest bit of interest. I can't even give it credit for having any sort of vocabulary beyond the comprehension of an average twelve year old. The characters were so flat that I didn't even finish it. Later I heard from the other book discussion members even the title was a let down as Morgan never actually passed away (`twould have been a fitting end though - much like converting a testy horse into glue, something of actual use.) I've never read any of Anne Tyler's books but after this little gem I doubt I'll ever pick up another. 
 This book was not good, and that hurts to say because I agreed with the overall diagnosis. Society - Western civilization specifically - is in trouble. Anyone who bothers to look past the rosy 'two cars in every garage' and the multiculti 'diversity is the greatest morality ever' can see that today we face problems which did not exist fifty years ago. There were no Columbines, there was no loss of purpose. I also dare say that desegregation has caused as much animosity between the races - if not more - than originally existed. Heresy, I know.  If you don't agree with that last suggestion, that would be because it is my opinion. Mrs. Jacobs has a lot of opinions in her book...though none so 'unenlightened', I'm sure. This book is just an intelligent person's attempt to talk about the things that irk her. There are no timeless insights, which is what a problem the magnitude of her thesis requires. Blunt ideas liks "Cars bad! Roads bad!" are not going to dissect our woes. Opinion is often presented as fact or maxim. I did not agree with many of those opinions. Although I have not read Jared Diamond's work cited, the applause he receives here had an unintended consequence for me. Many of Diamond's own reviews hint of the same problem that beleaguers Jacobs' work: opinion given as fact.  The positives I would attribute to Jacobs' Dark Age Ahead is that the subject matter is a poignant question of our time. Victory is bittersweet in that 'it is all down hill from here'; but if there is one constant of Western civilization, it is that the citizens are authors of their own destiny. Regrettably, too many of these same people choose to author a brave new world. The debate is needed, and anything that spurs that is ultimately a good thing. I would first read Barzun's From Dawn to Decadence or Bloom's Closing of the American Mind, however 
 "OF PARADISE AND POWER" - BY ROBERT KAGAN  "Americans are from Mars and Europeans are from Venus" - apart from simply raising a few eyebrows, this line by Robert Kagan author of "Of Paradise And Power", has not only caught the attention of many but managed to stir up a wave of discussions among the politicians and elites concerned with cross-Atlantic relations. Kagan's thought provoking book became extremely popular and received international acclaim for its analysis of the deteriorating US-Europe relationship, not to mention its catchy and striking phrases systematically introduced throughout the slender yet captivating book. Kagan introduces multiple chapters in his book, in order to deconstruct the key underlying issues which he claims are causes of the ever widening divide between US and Europe. In the chapter "The Power Gap", Kagan starts from World War I to understand the aversiveness Europe displays towards military and wars. He argues that while both the World Wars weakened Europe tremendously; they helped the US emerge as a super power. He further elaborates on the might of the US in the chapter that follows - "Psychologies of Power and Weakness". Kagan explains how lack of power can not only affect psychologies and ideologies, but change perspectives as well. He claims Europe's paucity of military power compels it to not only tolerate threats but ignore them all together and at the same time try and counterbalance the US force by constructing a world which is governed by economic and soft non-violent methods. This chapter culminates into "Hyperpussiance", a chapter in which Kagan discusses intricate details of Kosovo and Bosnia, highlighting Europe's failure and America's effectiveness in handling the situation. He finally presents his central argument in the chapters "The Post Modern Paradise" and "The World America Made" where Kagan states, "Europe's evolution into its present state occurred under the mantle of the U.S. security guarantee and could not have occurred without it." Casting doubts on Europe's intentions, Kagan centers his argument on the growing self-centered policies of Europe and questions the validity of cohesive terms such as `west' in his chapter "Is It Still `The West'"?  Finally, it seems Kagan provides a solution to this insolvable problem of the US- Europe divide in his concluding chapter, "Adjusting to Hegemony", by simply stating one line - "the task for both Europeans and Americans is to readjust to the new reality of American hegemony". This extremely small book, as compared to the issue it addresses needs further analysis and some close examining. There are many issues to be addressed in Kagan's brief analysis and one might not be completely satisfied with certain claims, reasonings or the manner in which such a grave and sensitive topic is handled. While there is a tone of underlying bias (in contrast to the general opinion of a well-balanced view that the author holds), Kagan manages to miss out some crucial facts and figures, not to mention present stark paradoxes, and the essay lacks sufficient citings.        To start with, let me point out the contradictions in Kagan's arguments, the presence of which highly undermines his claims, leaving the reader in a dilemma unconvinced of either argument. Kagan claims, "Europe's relative weakness has understandably produced a powerful European interest in building a world where military strength and hard power matter less than economic and soft power...rules of behavior" (pg.37). He goes on to say, - "Since Europeans lack the capacity to undertake unilateral military actions, either individually or collectively as `Europe,' it is natural that they should oppose allowing others to do that they cannot do themselves."(pg.38) in contrast to "...Europe today has the wealth and technological capability to make itself more of a world power in military terms if Europe wanted to become that kind of world power" (pg.53-54). Kagan contradicts his own views, stating many times that Europe is militarily weak, nor does it have the capacity to build up its forces yet at the same time, puts forth an argument of Europe's capabilities of increasing its defense spending and military might to match the US.      In the chapter, Psychologies of Power and Weakness, Kagan's one claim contradicts another which is made in the next chapter as the reasoning for both his claims seem to be absolutely tangential. He first explains Europe's greater tolerance for threats is due to its weakness and the fearful past, which it has suffered from. He then metaphorically explains it by giving the example of a man with a knife and the same one with a rifle having different interpretations of the word `threat' when confronting a bear (pg.31). But again Kagan himself feels Europe can become a military power as and when it wishes to, when he says "They could easily spend twice as much as they are currently spending on defense if they believed it necessary to do so" (pg.54). So this forces me to ask a question, would one be mauled by a bear if one could produce a rifle to prevent this misfortune? So isn't it quite possible that Europeans feel safe, not because they "...enjoy the `free ride' they have gotten under the American security umbrella over the past six decades" (pg.54), but rather because there was and is no real threat at all?      With the use of phrases such as "The Axis of Evil" and "Rouge States" (pg.30), which Kagan uses to describe Iraq and Iran, not to mention his references to `Weapons of Mass Destruction' (which he uses as a pretext to the war in Iraq), which still seem to be elusive for some reason, he seems to perplex me by blatantly ignoring his own creation. While Kagan maintains that Iraq was a threat and the US perceived it as one while Europe did not, he might want to explain as to why, in 1997, he (Kagan was the Director of the Project for the New American Century) signed a document which justifies American occupation of the Middle-East, irrespective of threats from Iraq or Iran.  "The United States has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in Gulf regional security. While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification, the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein... From an American perspective, the value of such bases would endure even should Saddam pass from the scene. Over the long term, Iran may well prove as large a threat to U.S. interests in the Gulf as Iraq has. And even should U.S.-Iranian relations improve; retaining forward-based forces in the region would still be an essential element in U.S. security strategy given the longstanding American interests in the region."(pg.17 - Rebuilding America's Defenses - *1)  This forces me to conclude that either the author has resorted to `cherry picking' of evidence or he suffers from selective amnesia.     Some of his reasoning, analysis and analogies seem to be too nave. When explaining military action, one cannot justify it by saying, "When you have a hammer, all problems start to look like nails". The author speaks about the nation's (US's) willingness to go to war simply because it has the ability and the capacity to do so. Without discussing a need or providing concrete reasons for the use of aggression, the author seems to be content in justifying use of force, simply because one has it. One important aspect Kagan leaves out in his analysis are the political and economical aspects of the ongoing US-Europe feud. While I have discussed some economical aspects later in the review, one must note that Kagan does not mention the Kyoto Protocol (apart from Clinton's negotiation of it (pg.45)). The US withdrawal from the Protocol had created serious problems and divisions between the two giants (www.climnet.org - *2). While there were many other issues that further fanned the growing fire, disagreements over the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty for example, which Kagan conveniently sweeps under the carpet, needed to be addressed if one is discussing transatlantic relations (www.bbcnews.com - *3, 4)      For a book which covers issues from the pre World War II decade (occasionally going back to ancient philosophy) to the present issues, 72 citations, from which many are simply extended explanations (for examples, see supra notes- 19, 20, 22), seem to be alarmingly low, especially with the absence of some important ones and not to mention, certain citations which wrongly allude to historical facts. Kagan mentions, "As `some' Europeans put it, the real division of labor consisted of the United States making the dinner and the Europeans doing the dishes" (pg.23), yet he does not refer to any source for this cynical statement. He says, "The vast majority of Europeans always believed that the threat (if any) posed by Saddam was more tolerable than the risk of removing him" along with other alleging statements like, "The rehabilitation and reintegration of Saddam Hussein's Iraq is precisely what they(Europe) sought" (pg.44) , and again gives no source for the origin of these beliefs. Strangely, he supports one of his claims by stating in his supra note.20, pg.30, "for that matter, this is also the view commonly found in American textbooks". One might not generally expect to see such puerile purporting evidence in a scholarly analysis of transatlantic relations. Kagan at times jumps back to Athenian times and has injected strong philosophies in his essay. He mentions a number of times how Americans see the world from a Hobbesian perspective while Europeans are followers of Kantinian policies. Kagan seems to have overlooked the fact, that though Hobbes had described the state of nature as that of "all against all", the only reason Hobbes justifies a sovereignty is to ensure peace on earth. Kagan conveniently cites Hobbes (Hobbes theory itself was flawed as later philosophers termed it as `Hobbes Dilemma') to justify American aggression, but no where in Hobbes' theory is aggression justified by the sovereign (Leviathan - Ch.17).       There are some conclusions Kagan draws which seem to be beliefs of an American idealist living in a world where politics is as pure as religion. He concludes that while the US was providing "free security" to Europe after the Cold War, "...America's great power and willingness to assume responsibility for protecting other nations..." (pg.34) has given Europe the opportunity to build up economically. Kagan further asserts his point when he says, "Given America's willingness to spend so much money protecting them, Europeans would rather spend their own money on social welfare programs, long vacations and shorter workweeks" (pg.54). These are inaccurate presentations of facts, which are more of subjective, bias ideologies. I would like to put forth two points in order to accentuate the conspicuous fallacy of these two statements. First, America's interest in Europe was not to provide it with security whether before or after the Cold War. One must not confuse the fact that measures taken to restrict the Soviet advance was purely for selfish motives, rather than for the benefit of nations which were under the watchful eye of the communist empire (Kagan himself acknowledges the fact when he says, "With the check of the Soviet power removed, the United States was free to intervene practically whenever and wherever it chose..."(pg26)). Second, when Kagan acknowledges that Europe which has a "$9 trillion " economy is in a comfortable position to support its welfare programs along with increased military spending; attributing the fact that Europe spends more on welfare, as he calls them "free-riders", results in a faulty analysis.  When I had mentioned earlier that Kagan chose to omit and ignore certain facts, the example of the Balkans, which the author has cited many times in his book would seem most relevant. Kosovo is one of the primary issues he discusses to bring forth US benevolence and European incapacity. "American involvement in Kosovo or Bosnia was not based on calculations of a narrow American `national interest'...While Americans had a compelling moral interest in stopping genocide and ethnic cleansing,... the US had no `national interest' at stake in the Balkans"(pg.50), this is how Kagan sees it. Indeed stopping genocide was a concern, but was it the only concern? While Milosevic had very much agreed to station NATO troops in Kosovo to stop the conflicts, none seem to have been interested in his offer; they rather wanted complete access and control to all of Yugoslavia. The Rambouillet Accord, to which the Contact Group added an Appendix B on the last day of the conference held at Paris, one must note was the primary reason for rejecting NATO troops, as it demanded Yugoslavia to surrender its autonomy and sovereignty. Yet, he does not mention of Milosevic agreeing to station NATO troops in Kosovo (http://wsws.org *5).      Some thing missing from Kagan's entire book are the words "Latin America" and "Africa". As seen above, Kagan believes America was spending its money protecting Europe and Europe alone from all the threats around the world, before and after the Cold War. But what baffles me to quite an extent is that not once does Kagan mention about any American intervention in Latin America (official or not), Africa or the Far East for that matter. Those who are well aware of the world around them, will be aware of America's support for dictators and other corrupt regimes throughout Latin America and the far East, Indonesia for example, which were for self serving purposes alone or is it that the author is implying that the Latin American and African countries were a threat to Europe, hence the interventions and no mention of them? (A complete timeline by Steven Kangas can be found on multiple sites *6, 7, 8)       There is one severe `defect', as I put it, which undermines the entire argument of this book. Kagan's tunneled vision approach, which refers to the word `power' only in terms of military strength and capabilities, ultimately results in a false dichotomy, which is the stumbling stone for his thesis. Kagan believes the world and in particular, Europe, is left with two options, that either they follow the US or be a tacit audience. The reason he reaches this conclusion as I previously put it, is due to his convergent view. "Rather than viewing the US as a Gulliver tied down by Lilliputian threads", says Kagan, "American leaders should realize that they are hardly constrained at all, that Europe is not really capable of constraining the US". He reinforces this claim throughout his book (see pg- 33, 37-40, 59, 62, etc). The author's abysmal ignorance about hard-hitting, highly valid and relevant facts has rendered severe blows to the validity of his claims. Kagan has committed serious errors here, by ignoring Europe's strength, not military but political and economical indeed. With a population of 456,953,258 (the CIA Fact Book *9) and still growing, the EU, leave aside Europe, cannot be simply overlooked or brushed aside as a dead competitor or a bygone culture. Europe is economically strong enough to trouble the US as and when it wants to, the recent problems over the genetically altered meat, banana dispute, steel industry debacle, Airbus-Boeing clash and many more, have all proved that Europe's economic strength is much of a concern for the US.  While I must point out a rank deletion, I believe this is `the' single factor which is capable for arguing against all of Kagan's thesis and arguments, and that is the American Economy. Not once has he mentioned the deteriorating state of American economy (2001), even though problems did exist when he wrote this book. He seems to be blissfully ignorant and persists that America can sustain its exorbitant defense spending, "...the US can sustain its current military spending levels and its current global dominance far into the future". Strangely, the growing inflation rate, rising unemployment, stagflation, trends the economy was showing of heading towards a recession, were I believe dismissed as myths by the author (for statistics see - www.bbcnews.com; http://wsws.org *10, 11). Also, Kagan's final solution suggest that, "The obvious answer is that Europe should.... and build up its military, even if only marginally", leaves me with a conundrum. Is Kagan implicating that Europe has no military at all or is it that he wants to begin a new arms race, this time Cold War II? Kagan must understand he is writing this book for international publics and not simply those, whose ideologies are in tandem with his. Hence, I doubt most would disagree that the world should get into an arms race here, as we all know, there is no stopping to this evil if it once starts.  While I have already discussed the effects of trade and economics (which Kagan ignores) on the US-Europe relation, there is something I must point out before I end this review. Kagan, rather conveniently digresses of the topic, which is transatlantic relationships, to justifying US hegemony in a neo-conservative fashion. While most Americans themselves would probably not agree with Kagan's ideology (as the public opinion and faith plummets - see polls from various news sources *12), leave aside Europeans or rest of the world, Kagan writes almost 15 pages to justify it. This was a rather disappointing conclusion to his book, where he thinks the only solution to the ever widening divide is "Adjusting to Hegemony". When Kagan says how many (statistics seem to abandon him) Americans believe that by advancing their interest, they advance the interest of humanity, he sounds exuberantly jingoistic and to drive the point home, he quotes Benjamin Franklin as saying - "America's cause is the cause of all mankind" and again I must bring to the author's notice, the recipient of these remarks is an international audience, which is diverse, has its own culture and heritage, religious beliefs and ideologies and has no reason to believe why their culture or beliefs are inferior to any other.  An author of his stature must realize that it is transatlantic relationships and not a primary grade bully that is being discussed. While he seems to take pride in saying that America has a "go it alone" attitude (pg.39, 99), it does not abide by the UN Security Council (pg.40, 99), takes action unilaterally irrespective of international laws (pg.45, 61, 99), is justified in adopting `double standards' (pg.62, 99), he fails to fathom the gravity of the current day (or rather the day when he wrote this book) situation and the growing unpopularity of American foreign policy around the world. While he sees Europe as an obstacle in the path of America's imperialistic goals, a neutral observer would be more than justified in pointing out that may be it is the US that hinders progress and efforts of the EU to establish a world which respects international laws, human rights, collective public opinion and most of all - peace. He fails to give an impartial, if not a complete solution to rid the world of this wedge as he weakly concludes his essay by saying, "...a little common understanding can still go a long way". While many have nothing but words of praise, as a one line summary by Francis Fukuyama calls it - "Brilliant" (a co-architect and signatory of the Rebuilding America's Defense Project) and according to Dr. Henry Kissinger, [against whom innumerable charges of human right violations have been levied, who ironically, Kagan terms as a "quintessential realist". See - http://en.wikipedia.org(for cases) *13; http://www.thenation.com(for list of crimes) *14] the book is a "seminal treatise" which would "shape the (US-Europe relation) discussion for years to come"; I do not particularly endorse it it. As I have already put forth immense supportive data to show why the book lacks a concrete argument, sane reasoning or supportive evidence, though its lucid prose, easy comprehension and its articulate linking makes it a good read, it barely digs deep into the problem or the solution, apart from scratching the surface, `the military surface'. Indeed the book did create waves in the political arena, which was probably due to its impeccable timing, but I cast serious doubts on the claims that it would be "discussed for years to come".     *1   - http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf *2   - http://www.climnet.org/news/march2001.html *3   - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1383385.stm *4   - http://212.58.226.30/1/hi/business/2052405.stm *5   - http://www.wsws.org/articles/1999/apr1999/yugo-a14.shtml *6   - http://www.atrocities.net/  *7   - home.att.net/~Resurgence/CIAtimeline.html  *8   - www.serendipity.li/cia/cia_time.htm	 *9   - http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ee.html *10 - http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/dec2000/us-d30.shtml *11 - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1263211.stm *12 - http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/index.php *13 - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger *14 - http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames?bid=3&pid=17 
 Hi, In a nutshell, if you have a visual learner who likes colour, or one who struggles to blend this book is not for you.  My four year old was totally turned off by this so instead, we purchased the online Headsprout programme and now he is a really confident reader in a short time.  My advice is to go for a different book but if your budget allows, buy Headsprout because it is brilliant and it works.  My son loves reading because of that programme. Hope that helps you. Fay 
 Grisham is one of my favorite authors. However this one is not one of his bests! We all understood that he loved Bologna and the culture of Italy. It is a nice written travelogue but this is not what I want to get from a Grisham novel. What about the pace, the adventure, the chase..?  And talking about the end...could it be more simple?   Those who are familiar with Bologna or the Italian Culture, or those willing to visit Italy, you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel, try something else 
 This review concerns the original 1932 edition and the revised edition published in the 1960's.  Both books follow the same plot; although, the revised edition is slightly different from the original.  While returning from a carnival, Nancy, George and Bess witness a large home suddenly burst into flames.  Thinking that there may be someone trapped inside, the girls rush to the house to help.  They are unable to enter the home because of the heat, but Nancy spots a man running away from the house and later finds a diary, written in Swedish, which contains numerous technical drawings.  Did the man start the fire?  Does the diary belong to him?  And what became of Felix Raybolt, the owner if the home, who apparently has gone missing?  Clues lead Nancy to suspect that the diary belongs to the husband of a poor woman that Nancy met at the carnival along with her little girl.  Nancy becomes determined to prove that Joe Swenson didn't start the fire, but all of the clues she uncovers seem to suggest that he is guilty.  Personally, I didn't find this book very good; there isn't much action, the mystery isn't very exciting and the book really lacks a true criminal.  Thankfully, the writing style used in the book is rather enjoyable, so it keeps the book from being a complete waste of time.  One thing to note about this book is that this is the volume where Nancy meets Ned Nickerson and oddly enough her first thought of him is that he is trying to steal her car!  This book is worth reading for the writing, but its not likely that many fans of Nancy Drew will find this book to be one of their favorites 
 This is a terrible product. It is too big for your BlackBerry. They send it with another door for the backside because your current door won't fit over this huge battery!!  It is frankly unbelievable that BlackBerry, and Amazon, would foist this product on us.  The battery is so big that the device will no longer fit into your BlackBerry holster.  DO NOT BUY THIS IDIOTIC PRODUCT 
 Dick Staub makes some very good points and conections to the training of a Jedi in the ways of the Force in Star Wars and the walk of a Christian following God in life today.  However, he does misquote and misinterpret many quotes from the Star Wars movies, and I even found a misquotation from the Bible.  He makes good points, but these details were distracting to me as I read.   I am not yet finished and will leave more once I am done.  After finishing this book it occured to me that Dick Staub needs to take some time to do a couple of things. First he needs to re-read the Bible and get facts correct (He quoted Moses as saying something to Joshua, but Moses was dead at the time and God told it to Joshua). Second, he needs a simple commentary for the passages he misinterprets (He says David had Uriah killed to be the only one Bathsheba loved, He had Uriah killed to cover up his sin). Third he needs to re-watch the Star Wars movies and not bend the quotes of the characters to fit his book (He talks about Obi-Wan asking Yoda for help in Episode II and portrays the event differently than it happens, as well as bends Yoda's reaction to fit what he is trying to show). This book is not what I thought it was, and any Christian who is young in their walk should not read this. 
 The multifunction center worked correctly for exactly one week.  Then it developed a loud grinding sound.  So much for buying remanufactured equipment.  Spend a little more and buy something new 
 Typical left wing "vast right wing conspiracy" nonsense.  Only the most paranoid Americans looking through the peepholes of triple locked  doors would recognize the place this book is about and apparently from  where it was written 
 For a 2-disc, director's cut, my expectations were perhaps too high for this DVD.  Nevertheless, I was appalled at the poor quality of the transfer.  The colors were dull throughout, and focus was frequently not at the beginning of scenes.    For the movie itself, I don't agree that it is holding up well over time.  At 25 years old, the movie just has limited entertainment value for people who aren't waiting for their beloved canceled TV series to be on the big screen.  There's no question that II and IV are the best of the series, but comparing it to other Star Trek original cast movies isn't putting the bar very high.  My interest in watching this again was just having finished Melville's Moby Dick, the final scenes of which Khan repeats liberally during the final space battle.  That said, I think Montalban was fantastic as the revenged-obsessed Khan and very evocative of Ahab.  However, Shatner's pretentious Kirk just becomes more grating as time goes on.  The original cast schtick just doesn't make for a compelling drama 
 The only book I've ever read that I tore up and threw in the trash when I was finished. If this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there's something seriously wrong with the world.This is a tragic, sad, grotesque, disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world. When a child is damaged it is never uplifting, whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes. This book is sickening. Don't buy it!!! There are no animals only pain and death 
 This book is absolutely useless other than for academic interest. If you read the bios of the authors carefully they have never started or run a restaurant and that reflects the writing. The whole book is about marketing, planning, spreadsheets; something that would be taught in a college classroom. I really wasted my money on this book 
 I happen to be a voracious reader and especially like books with an air of history about them.   I was very keen on reading this book, I liked its reviews and liked its name - found it quite intriguing. But reading it, was quite unlike my expectations. I found it utterly dry and uninteresting. The book seemed drier than the deserts it talks about. I did manage to finish it, though.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 While the book contains tried-and-true tactics that will always work, it is outdated and not thorough enough.  No mention, for example, on dropshot, splitshot, or swimbait techniques.  Very brief mention of casting techniques, and nothing about pitching.  All of the B&W photos look like the fishermen were going to a screening of "Saturday Night Fever" once they got off the lake.  The book was "updated" by Mark Hicks, who never hesitates to include photos and stories of himself, a no-no in the unwritten rules of authors.  I should have spent my money on Roland Martin's or Van Dam's books.  
 written way above the laymens level(this layman, anyway).found it hard to follow and confusing.does not address 'the big question' of divine inspiration of scripture to my satisfaction 
 I did laugh and was mildly entertained and never bored with this one.   The DVD commentary also includes some other stories that are also pretty funny and explain some of the pitfalls of an underfunded movie, which explains some of the end product here, I would think.  Of course, I had seen the Ebert&Roeper review of this movie beforehand so I was not expecting much.  In fact, I was curious about a movie they found so terrible.  And "Dirty Love" is not all that great, it was not as bad as I expected either.  My wife hated...HATED...this film, so I would not call it a "chick flick". 
 Sorry...it's not what I expected. I kept thinking, "where is this going???" It just wasn't funny. It reminded me of something written 100 years ago. But that's not to say someone familiar with Portuguese linguistics (maybe a German academist or an up-in-coming Dr. Dr. Longname, etc. etc. hrumph, cough), could not read between the lines and find this humorous...it was just a little dry and boring to me. After the first couple jabs at these pompous doctors, it got tiring. I read every single book in the Ladies Detective series and couldn't wait to sink my teeth into the next Precious Ramotswe story. This, however, was a disappointment. I'm only sorry I bought all 3 in the series, sight unseen, based on the other books I'd read by Alexander McCall Smith 
 Ben Franklin is my hero, I have 12 biographies on him, this was the worst. I first started collecting Franklin biographies forty years ago, Van Doren, Fay, Issacson, Brands, Wood and a half a dozen others. At first glance, and after reading the rave reviews it looked like here was something new and different... a new take that concentrated on France. Well it was new, and very different - it put me to sleep in my chair several times. I eventually gave up and shelved it with the others. What a shame. Boring.   
 I expected alot more from Richard Harris. He was very stiff and it was hard to warm to his portrayal of Abraham. Also, there wasn't enough vocal input from God, expecially since his promises to Abraham and indeed the world should be center stage and offer the viewer a wholistic picture of the first covenant. There were some omissions and scenes out of order from the bible. I was somewhat annoyed that the movie had God saying that Sarai's name means Princess and that he would change it to Sarah which means Queen. This is not true!! In Hebrew Sarah means princess. Such apparently small mistakes really withdraw the films credability 
 There is no shortage of Islam apologists who use perfumed pleasantries to cover the ugly truth of the world's most intolerant religion, but they aren't as intelligent, affable and widely read as Aslan.  On pages 64-65 he makes the wild and totally unsubstantiated claim that Muhammad was only betrothed to his child bride, Aisha, when she was nine, but consummated with her after she hit puberty.  Unfortunately for Aslan, every Muslim source says clearly that they were married when she was six and consummated when she was nine.  Either Aslan has not read Sahih Bukhari or Sahih Muslim, or he's baldly lying.  Since he doesn't cite his sources, we must assume the latter.  Likewise he soft peddles life in the dhimma on pages 94-95.  He gives the definition of dhimmi as "protected" but conveniently leaves out that it simultaneously means "guilty," then goes on to suggest that dhimmitude is not an example of Islamic subjugation of other faiths, but is in fact an example of Islam's high degree of tolerance!  He excuses out of hand the wholesale slaughter and mass beheading of the Jewish Banu Qurayza tribe by saying it was not at all unusual for the time and offers as proof the fact that no other local Jewish tribes complained about it.  This is a terrible book, with no citations for wild and fictional claims.  But look at the reviews from the NY Times, LA Times, London Independent, and so on: "wise, passionate, insightful" -- with vetting like that, readers would be forgiven for not knowing they are being lied to.  Beware 
 While the book contains very interesting material regarding the roots of western outlaws in the years after the Civil War, some individual facts leave a bit to be desired.  All in all a good read, but I would encourage further reading on some subjects, or at least double-checking some of the facts used in the book 
 I love a dark comedy more than the next person, and laugh at things that I probably really shouldn't.  So I thought this movie, hyped as a very dark comedy, would be right up my alley.  Sadly, apart from a few moments here and there, "Very Bad Things" simply fails as a comedy.  And it fails as a drama, because every single character is unlikeable and unsympathetic.  That's too bad, because the actors are fantastic and do their best with the material given to them.  I fault the script, which has problems at best, and the direction and editing, which give the movie a strangely languid character at inopportune times.  You could do worse, but this is strictly a rental at best.  
 If you're looking for a book to convince you or remind you that the left is evil/pathetic/wrong/or whatever look elsewhere.  Flynn does a poor job of fact finding or arguing his point.  He relies on, for example, what are apparently random people he interviewed at protests to create a blanket view of liberal beliefs.  Look at the footnotes in Chapter 4.  I'm sorry but this is like looking for a Leno's Jaywalking segment to find spokespeople for a movement.  Also in Chapter 4, Flynn lays out the 5 myths of the left.  Does the left actually believe them?  As a bleeding heart liberal who knows mostly other bleeding heart liberals I'll give my response:  1)	American Women Live Under a Patriarchy - his point is that women in America are better off than just about anywhere else.  True, but that doesn't mean they don't live under a patriarchy. 2)	America is the World's Leading Threat to the Environment - his point is that places like Russia and China are far worse.  No one I know disagrees with his point.  3)	America is a Racist Nation - His point is that we are not.  I don't know any liberals who think America is a Racist nation 4)	The United States is an Imperial Power - as this was published in 2002 I'll abstain from commenting other than to say that he says the left believes that the international growth of Starbucks, McDonalds and such is cultural imperialism.  I think many liberals would agree with that.  He says most of the countries embrace these companies opening stores in them.  I say that doesn't mean its not cultural imperialism. 5)	The Rich Get Richer, the Poor Get Poorer.  His argument is apparently that individuals who were in the lowest 20% of the income bracket in 1979 were mostly not in 1988.  He cites and article in the National Review where these numbers came from.  That article sites a Treasury Department survey.  So he's relying on secondary sources for his information?  Looks like shoddy research to me.    The book is riddled with problems.  For example, On pg. 31 he quotes Robert Altman as saying that we were in a way for Afghani oil interests.  Flynn then says that its not clear who Altman was referring to or why he would say that about a country without major oil reserves.  Here Flynn misses a perfect opportunity to attack a widely held liberal belief that Bush attacked Afghanistan for a potential pipeline that could be used to get oil out of Central Asian countries.  He doesn't though.  He lets it lie.  This is the nature of my problem with him.  Again and again his attacks are inept or simply untrue.    Reading his summary of why the Left hates America is just tripe.  No one I know thinks like this.  He says we believe capitalism is a failed economic system.  I don't know anyone who believes this.  Personally, I believe in universal healthcare but that's primarily because I've dealt with HMO's before.  He also says the Left condemn Christianity as intolerant.  Once again, no one I know believes this.  This book is full on nonsense.   
 I am on my second Zadro LED Lighted Fogless Mirror - Yes, customer service was decent and they sent me a new one. However, the initial problem was repeated plus some -- it fogs up despite following directions, using their spray, and using words I shouln't repeat here. Additionally, the clock runs slow and one of the two lights is out after only a few months. One good thing is that  suction cups still hold it up as long as I press them in every week. This product has problems which make a mockery of its "ZFogless" claim. Save yourself the trouble -- don't buy it 
 I think irridium said it most articulately, but I just wanted to add to the hate for this book.  I have never experienced such a strong visceral negative reaction to any work of literature.  Save yourself some time and read Nabokov's Ada instead 
 I purchased this book thinking I was going to read a spine-chilling, true ghost story.  Instead, what I got was a rambling story told by a narrator who seems to be able to remember whole conversations as though they occurred yesterday.  I also find it very hard to believe this book is not fiction.  Although the supposed incidents are frightful in themselves, as the book began to decend into yet another diatribe about slavery (a subject that I am personally tired hearing about), I quickly lost interest.  Having grown up in a haunted house, I do believe that something is going on as far as a lot of ghostly occurrences are concerned.  Maybe it's the way this book is written--more like a novel then anything else--that makes me think this is a story composed to be read on Halloween night.  Sure it's scary, but is it real?  That this book won any award is beyond my understanding.  Again, I believe this is a nod to the slavery aspect of it rather then the story as a whole.  It seems this gives people a way to fit anything into the Politically Correct nonsense that permeates our society.  I could barely finish it.  Sorry, this is one ghost book I simply can't recommend 
 I thought I was going to get a thriller when I first heard of this.  Instead I got a pseudo-sequel to COLD MOUNTAIN set in 1980 Texas, and I have rather low opinions of COLD MOUNTAIN.  It was difficult to follow the story due to McCarthy's decision to not only avoid using quotation marks to identify dialogue (a move I've always considered to be a pretentious affectation), but also commas, apostrophes, and proper spelling, such as not capitalizing "English" or using "livingroom" instead of "living room" and "mam" instead of "ma'am."  I don't know if this is something McCarthy does in all his books or this was a one-time deal, but it was a major turnoff and made the experience grueling rather than enjoyable.  I also didn't see the relevance of the italicized monologues of Sheriff Bell at the beginning of each chapter/section, as he tended to ramble on about life after  World War Two and how it wasn't uncommon to see 22-year-olds as ordained ministers or 25-year-olds as sheriffs of counties the size of Delaware.  Hopefully its movie adaptation (which I legitimately pity the Coen Brothers for having to wade through) is more accessible 
 I usually really like Anne Tyler (and I do like her consistency in telling stories about characters that are real, but not necessarily likeable) but this was my least favorite book I've read by her.  I could understand how the main character felt marginalized in her life, and to some extent how she could make the decisions she made, but she just seemed to lack depth.  In a story that was mostly about stepping out of her life and creating a new one, this character seemed to shrink and lose depth when it seemed she should be growing.  To me the main character was difficult to identify with, and I found her choices often disappointing.  I've found Anne Tyler's other novels to have odd characters that were often nothing like me, but I could still identify with them on some level.  There are many other Anne Tyler books that should be read before (or instead of) reading this one 
 I bought this DVD based on the excellent reviews.  As both an afficionado, and practitioner of kink, I am always looking for a good film in that genre.  Not only is "Maitresse" poorly acted but the story line is completely unbelievable.    I also found the film "quality" leaving a lot to be desired. (Poor lighting) I found myself falling asleep about a third of the way through and just could not get into it.    The relationship and communication between the Domme and her clients was cold and unfeeling, and left me with the impression that I had just watched two robots doing physical things with each other.  There was just no chemistry between the players.  Save your money 
 Don't buy this book.  Unfortunately I did.  This book is at best an       amateurish attempt at writing.  It is simplistic in plot with little to no character development.  Poe is probably turning over in his grave at the cheap references to his literature to promote blood and gore without complementing his ability to develop and build suspense into his works.  I bought this book based on the rating and review published in the Denver, CO "Rocky Mountain News."   Mystery readers--stay with P.D.James or Dan Brown 
 I didn't know you were supposed to peel that waxy rubbery black stuff off the soap...I normally get store-bought olive oil soap but it smelled so good, I had to try it.  I ended up COVERED with black, waxy streaks all over my body when I got out of the shower!  They didn't rinse off, either.  The only thing that seemed to work was to rub really vigorously with a towel...I still had black smudges and a wax residue.  Once I figured out how to take a knife to the coating, I had a better opinion of the soap, except that it pretty much cut the soap in half.  It smelled really nice, but I don't think I would get this again.    
 I ordered this version after reading reviews of it and Badder Santa, thinking maybe I was getting something more than the movie I'd already seen and loved.  I didn't care for this version.  It is lacking a couple of scenes that I think help to tie the story together, and in apparently seeking a more "noir" theme includes scenes that are probably more than I needed to know...like the van backing over the security guy.  They killed him, okay, I get it.  I also didn't like the ending as much (although I won't give it away for those of you just dying to see it).  I will donate this to the Friends of the Library sale and buy myself a copy of the "vanilla" version 
 I have an ancient Lancome facial brush that I was attempting to replace.  I bought this brush, tried it, and went back to my old one.  In my opinion, this brush is far too soft and doesn't feel like it is cleaning at all.  A wash cloth would be better 
 While this book is generally on with its observations of general human behavior, it should in the relationship section, not psychology. Its pop-psych style of unsubstantiated examples doesn't provide much valuable  information for you to learn from. It's an entertaining read, but when all  is said and done, it's difficult for a reader with any knowledge of the  MBTI to feel like they've learned anything worthwhile. If you want a book  about relationship quirks, this is the one. Otherwise, look for something  else 
 I was not impressed with the quality of this book.  The instructions are informative and easy to follow but the headpiece designes are out of date.  The pictures are hand drawn and do not capture the instructions they are depicting.  I have learned about the steps and general techniques of veil making after reading this book. However, I think  color photos and updated designes would be helpful 
 I just didn't like this book.  I think that the racial overtones were over played. I've always thought that the human race would unite against a common enemy, especially a human killing ET.  Dietz did do a good job with the action sequences, but there were not enough of them.  The book waffled between an action book and a political book and did a poor job at both.  Pro- good action sequences, different plot and take on humanity  Con- too many alien names, personally, I just didn't like the plot. Story seemed very sterile with really no emotion.  It's a short book if you want to read, but i would take a pass on it 
 steph believes her husband leaves her after thirteen years of marriage because of her boring flannel night gowns and unshaved legs. in the meantime, she meets peter and quickly falls in love.  peter is into bionics and while he goes away on business trips, he leaves behind his clone, paul to keep his girlfriend company.  steph is torn because she finds herself in love with both peter and paul.  when she's not having sex with peter, she's doing sexual acrobatics with paul.  the whole story line is utterly ridiculous.  the only reason i finished the book was because i was hoping it would get better.  i kept thinking this would make some kind of comedy.  unfortunately, i don't think danielle steel had comedy in mind when she wrote it.  i do believe the reader was supposed to get sucked into a romantic love triangle.  that didn't happen!  instead, i continued to dislike steph's insecure, sex crazed character less and less.  
 Adam Sandler plays a painfully shy man who has extreme fits of violent anger and has to deal with 7 sisters constantly interferring with his life. He calls a phone sex line one evening and is then hounded by the man running the service. This takes place the same time he meets a woman who likes him despite his oddities.  The sad thing is I think there is probably a sweet, poignant love story in this film but it's buried in a morass of pointless scenes and a discordant soundtrack that is sometimes so loud it nearly drowns out the dialog. There is no reason shown why Emily Watson would fall in love with Sandler. It's really just one strange scene after another that in the end is dull and left me wishing I'd rented another movie. 
 A dull tome, uninteresting and overpriced.  Might make a good doorstop perhaps, or be excellent for starting fires, but I wouldn't suggest the book to anyone I might run into again.    The author seems to have only a slight grasp of the subject.  Important concepts are overlooked, and it seems to have been written for ego gratification or to drum up business, rather than to explain the concepts of asset protection.  Take a pass on this one.   
 If you add up all of the interview footage of Hendrix, there's not much here. Dick Cavett did not interview Hendrix, he just made comments about how he liked his shirt and and threw in a few funny remarks. The Cavett people had to release this for it's historic value to Rock music, but Mr. Cavett and crew must regret not having more in depth content to offer us 35 years later.     Cavet did not convey to the viewers the importance of the times. There were no in depth questions at all about Woodstock which is hindsight is almost criminal, given that the story lead the evening news with Walter Cronkite. When Hendrix mentions that he he has had three nervous breakdowns, Cavett fails to make a folow up question. The most amazing part of the DVD is when Cavett breaks for a commercial, and Hendrix has left the studio. Cavett explains to his audience that Jimmi is too tired to complete the interview.   The conclusion of the DVD offers a series of present day interviews from Cavvet, to Jimmi's original drummer and Bass guitar player. All of these interviews are interupted every 30 seconds by replays of the interview we just watched.      Borrow this from a friend, or rent it. Don't buy it. This DVD has thirty minutes of content in it, including the music performed by Jimmi on the show 
 West is without a doubt a superb writer, however I found The Shoes of The Fisherman to be a great dissapointment.  In spite of the fact that most of the reviews I have read higly praise the book, it never really got to me.  The concept seems quite interesting at first:  an unknown russian, cardinal Kiril Lakota is elected pope.  After being held prisioner for quite a few years, he steps up to lead millions of people around the globe in a new world which he basically has knowledge of only from his years in captivity.  At the same time, Kamanev, the man who had been Lakota's prision guard in Russia, and who tortured him beyond belief, has become the head of the russian government.  The fact that both men now need each other provides for a very interesting plot, which in my opinion is never fully developed.  The main issue I have with the novel is that it is plotless...nothing really happens.  A large portion of the book consists of  a series of endless, and a bit boring, thoughts  from Lakota.  On the other hand, the reader is exposed to the way the catholic church funtions and thinks, which is an interesting way to humanize religion in he eyes of the reader.  There are also a series of sub-plots dealing with what Lakota has to face as a pope, regading human cruelty, poverty, and most of all politics, which could have proven to be enough for a good novel.  Unfortunatelly, the narration goes astray in many parts, which lessens one's interest in the book. Quite frankly, I had to make a great effort to finish the book, hoping that at some time it would pick up, which it never did.  As I mentioned before, West is a very good writer, but this book is in my opinion, highly overrated.  I can honestly say it never got my full atention. 
 This book attempts to cover the amount of theory that would require a shelf of books to cover adequately.  As a result, it basically only gives the definitions and results (theorems without proofs) in each topic, something that one could get for free from online encyclopedias.  There are problems with partial solutions, but they are not problems that a student who is exposed to the topics for the first time can solve.  Since there are no proofs of theorems or examples, one cannot solve those problems from studying from this book alone, so why even put those problems in?  To me this seems like a book that the author wrote to summarize the author's knowledge (if the author has really indeed memorized this plethora of information???), while there is no way of understanding what the topics are about if you are reading the topics for the very first time.  To master all the topics in this book would require years of serious studying, so you are better off buy books that specialize in these topics 
 Goldman has been accused of stealing dozens of ideas for his shirts and art from other artists.  The accusations are that many of these images are copied almost directly from the originating piece, sometimes even traced, and in some cases, taken directly from Google Image Search and Microsoft Clip Art.  Goldman has profited upwards of 100 million dollars from selling these images.  Anyone thinking of buying this book and giving him more money should do a search for "Todd Goldman plagiarism" to decide for yourself if it's worth it to give your money to this guy 
 I always try to keep my reviews short and sweet.  Laymon is definitely not for everyone.  LAymon always lived in his own world where common human psychology does not apply to his characters. (Example: a girl gets raped and an hour later she is ready to get it on with another character; or someone's boyfriend gets killed and later she is off having fun.) However, Laymon is usually an easy read that does not go very in-depth.  This book was not as enjoyable as other books I have read by him.  It was rather boring and very preposterous with too simple of an ending - even for Laymon.  My recommendation: start with something different by Laymon 
 There are plenty of excellent Play Therapy books out there, this is not one of them.  Maybe it's just me, but a play therapy book should be way more user friendly.  I need quick access, color and... ART 
 The book has beautiful pictures, but that is it.  The book was written for someone living in the UK, so if you do, you might like this book.  The descriptions of each of the rides and attractions were vague and basically  useless.  If you want an excellent book on Orlando, spend you money on the  Unoffical Guide or the Econoguide books.  Those are worth their weight in  gold 
 Okay, now, for all of you who are expecting a book that teaches interesting morals and cool things in it, put this book away right now!!! Put it into a dusty corner and whenever you may catch a glimpse of it, laugh in a malicious tone because you haven't feasted your eyes on the most stupid book ever written!! This book ends with such a melancholy abruption that I thought I might be witnessing the severe chopping of a movie gone over far too many minutes. This book...is horrendous. -ANGRY READER 
 This is likely the single worst statistics book that I have ever had the misfortune to lay eyes on. This is definitely on of those "look how smart I am" books and lacks any real practical use. It's full of contradictions, vague information, and generally stinks to high heavan 
 Once again Gary Null "Phd" recycles information into another GN book with his one size fits all vegeterian diet and vits and supplements. Gary Null is probably the only author that carries a Phd and fails to reveal where he got his BA, MA and Phd. A quick reading of Quakwatch.com shows that Gary Null has  "nontraditional" credentials and owns a multi-million dollar supplement company. He also sells everything from magnets to water and air filters.   The confusing thing is why someone consuming a nutrient dense diet of organic vegetables, fruit and legumes would need supplements at all. The only reason I could think of is it is a bait and switch technique since most people unable to continue any diet that is restrictive, time consuming and costly give up. So GN conveniently has dozens of vits, supplements, and food replacement products to fill in the gap. I estimate the cost of following GN recommendations in full it would cost about $600 per person a month. To prove my point GN for decades has been against chocolate but recently he has added a GN "healthy" chocolate bar to his portfolio. Gary hooks people in by promising the fountain of youth and eternal life. Interestingly this 60 plus year old finds it necessary to put a old stock photo of himself in his books. 
 ...it is the reason the Grateful Dead are so well regarded nowadays and the Jefferson Airplane is a footnote in the history of the late '60s. The Jack Cassady excursion (on bass, no less) IS embarrassing. As a musician, I know exactly what Jack was doing and it is something anyone who has learned bass for a year or two (and done some experimentation) would do if they were really "getting into it" and going on some ego trip that is fascinating for the musician playing it and perhaps some simplistic (and non-musician) people hearing it, but it is a very basic jam that doesn't really make much musical sense, in terms of harmony or complexity. I bet Jack is embarrassed by this when he listens to it now. The Grateful Dead  had a bass player who studied classical music with one of the greats of the 20th century (Luciano Berio) and KNEW what he was doing rhythmically and harmonically. The Dead played songs in odd time signatures (7/8, 11/8, and so on) and not only sounded competent, THEY FREAKIN' COOKED! Not so with the Jefferson Airplane. Too much experimenation and not enough knowledge. If you want to hear "psychedelic" music, try the Grateful Dead's "Anthem of the Sun" (very experimental, lots of jams), "Aoxomoxoa" (shorter songs, but still strange, even humorous at times), or their masterpiece of psychedelic experimentation and just plain absolutely beautiful and riveting music, "Live/Dead". THEN compare "Live/Dead" to "...Baxters'", no contest. Even Quicksilver Messenger Service's "Happy Trails" leaves this one in the dust. Pass unless you thought 1910 Fruitgum Company was a "really exciting" group (and they are compared to this CD!) I'm giving it 1 star to bring it down to its rightful place 
 The combination of sex and violence presented here isn't anything new, and it fails to shock or disturb, clearly its intention. This is basically supermarket horror, made to be picked up off the rack on impulse. Just like an impromptu Twinkie purchase, this is easy to devour, but hardly satisfying, and certainly not good for you.  In the edition I have, as well, the text sports one glaring error per chapter, something that certainly draws you out of the already wafer-thin plot. The responsibility for this sloppiness falls on the editor, to be sure, but it doesn't help matters any.  If you're dying for a quick gore fix... still pass on this one 
 Some of these chapters are out of date and not useful for the radiologist in general practice. I especially disprove of the Charboneau chapters. Rumack and Wilson are excellent 
 Did not enjoy the book format of the book. Why? It tries to achieve too much. Combining Self-help Content on Pop Finance, and a Novel inside on Wealth Hunting.  The point sizes of the words inside the book are terribly small (paperback!). I found the reading experience filled with ideas jumping around.  Read " Learn to Earn" is much much better 
 Although I normally enjoy Kate Atkinson's books, I didn't like this one.  It goes back and forth between dreams and reality and it is hard to tell which is which.  I didn't even finish reading the book, although, I must admit, I did read the last chapter 
 I read other review, and decided to give it a try. As soon as I recieve it in the mail, and opened the box, I realized this was a mistake. CHEAP quality Binocular with "high power" being a selling point. It came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart. you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place! It is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation. You will be CONSTANTLY ajdusting the focus. Your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it. Indeed Strap, Case, Lense protectors are all cheap crap, and annoying to have it all ON~! I am taking this back, and buying MADE IN JAPAN "NIKON EAGLE VIEW" 100 times BETTER. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR~!!!!! 
 I bought this book to use in a class, but I only read four pages before giving up because it was just too much to read. Get a magnifying glass people. This book is written in fine print. You'd think they would publish it in a font that would comfortable to read. For that reason alone I returned it in favor of another 
 This is the longest textbook I have in my collection and it is also a bad investment book at that. I know some readers really enjoyed the detailed explanations, but the book was too detailed and wordy for me. Many of the explanations are unnecessary and examples can be simplified to get to the core of the problem/concept and drive at a much stronger intuitive understanding. But this book doesn't do that. It is cluttered with definitions and wordiness that kill the intuition one could get by reading a more concise, straightforward text. A really good book is Investment Science, by David Luenberger. Although his text assumes you have some background in calc/stat/probability theory, the writing, examples, and organization is far superior. You'll actually begin to understand how investment really works, without getting bogged down by the numbers, terminology, and jargon 
 Imagine a textbook without a glossary of terms. A book thatseems to use fancy nomenclature only as a tool to boostthe authors egos. Having strained through this text only by shear interest in Remote, I would advise any academic to look towards the piles of other more appropriatly constructed textbooks concerned with remote. As to the publishers claim that it also concerns itself with GIS applications, yes, but in an obscure and unfriendly manner. Do not consider this book as a textbook choice. It only serves to discredit the  noble and forthright advances of a vital technology 
 This is a 'lets make fun of the French' book.  In reality, a similar book can be written by many expatriates in every country, including foreigners living in the US and New York.  Mr. Gupnik refuses to accept the differences between the different cultures and seemingly expects the French to behave as if they are funny speaking Americans.    This is a useless book, fake and pompous.  Don't waste your time and money with it 
 My impression was that this tape contained the most basic ideas that author's in this subject matter have ever presented. For eg., "People crossing hands in front of their chest means that they aren't accepting what you are telling them." That is the most typical statement I have ever heard, and this tape is full of them. There is nothing enlightening, nothing that makes you glad that you bought and listened to the tape. I felt it was not good use of time or money.  Fo 
 This is not a book I can recommend.  There was no depth of character, or plot.  I expected some twists and turns, but it was all predictable.  The characters are indelibly flat.  Of greatest dissapointment were the heresies, for the author just seems to pass by them as unimportant.  There are some major Pelagian defects in the thoughts of one of the protagonists, and the magnitude of the defects is swept aside by the characters we are meant to bond with, who decide in favor of the heresy through simple platitudes!  The primary character, Cadfael, seems to contribute but little to the book or the mystery, and I found great difficulty in caring for any of these characters at all 
 I did get one soundbite that I hope I can use in my life from this book, "Be yourself, unless you're a jerk".  However, I got so tired of: be nice, have integrity, be an example, on page after page I was only able to make it through half of the book.  All of that is important, but they covered that quite well in kindergarten.  If you pick it up to read on the plane bring a backup book; you will need it 
 What I found most confusing about this book was its lack of compassion for mothers and their experiences.  The authors were relentless in criticism of popular culture for its idealised portrayal of motherhood (though I found most of their targets were much too easy).  I question the premise that popular culture has as much power to undermine women as the authors suggest (or assume), and would have liked a bit more argument on that.  But the authors were not supportive of women as mothers.  I got the impression that they assume all women who choose to stay at home as mothers are overworked, stressed, taken for granted, resentful, and jealous of their husbands lives outside the home.  There didn't seem to be room in the book for a working model of motherhood, one in which the woman is both a mother and satisfied with her life.  I appreciated the reminder that we need to be critical of our culture, but I found this criticism overly negative.  The authors' attitude was so sarcastic that it put me off their argument, and at times it seemed almost gleefully cruel.  But if you share their sense of humour, you might enjoy this book more than I did 
 I have loved every Le Creuset product I have purchased with the big exception of the Whistling Teakettle!  I did away with it a couple of months ago and bought the Brittany model to replace it.  The Whistling kettle burned my hand on several occasions, as the design of the spout allowed the hot water to spit and jump right out of the pot!  The whistle is removable and you must put your hand near the spout to remove it for pouring.  Even after waiting a minute after taking the water off the heat, the water would still jump from the spout.  While a little larger than I would have liked, the Brittany does not have the same problem and the whistle can be safely flipped up before pouring.  I have been very pleased with my new kettle and would recommend the Brittany by far over the Whistling 
 I bought this and felt let down.  The instuctions are confusing, have too many cross references, and assume a certain amount of skill.  This is definitely not what I would call straight forward.  I would absolutely not recommend this to a beginner as it can be overwhelming.  I ended up not using one bit of information from this book.  I also found the ideas to be either too stuffy or relaxed, I couldn't find a middle ground.  I found Window Style to be much more informativ 
 Shawn reveals (indirectly) that he is a disloyal Catholic. Now before you rate this review as unhelpful I'll explain why that is relevant: It shows he is a hypocrite and that his book is therefore hypocritical. Now although a hypocrite can get things right, when it comes to morality they usually get things wrong, which Shawn certainly did do in his teachings in this book. For example:  He promotes (and worships) democracy and "liberty" over God. I'm sure some of you Catholics will be like "what? He advocates the Bible in school and school prayer" but that doesn't mean he is advocating it for the right reasons, just as the Pharisees didn't advocate religion and the Old Testament for, ultimately, the right reasons. Now perhaps some of you will think, "Well who cares as long as he is advocating what is right, who cares about his motives." Well he says what his motives are and they go contrary to the Bible, so in the end he is promoting something which is just as self-defeating as liberalism, etc.. He reveals in his book that his motives are to maintain the (publically known) Republican agenda (plus getting the bible and prayer in public schools, etc.), promoting and upholding democracy throughout the world, and indirectly promotes the whitewashed historical teachings and books in public schools (although I'm sure he wouldn't if he really knew more accurately the history of the U.S.)  So, what's wrong with promoting liberty, democracy, and the white wash in schools? Obviously no one wants white wash and most American's know the usual history text books in school are something the inquisitions might have had success using, so I'll move on to liberty and democracy. Liberty in Shawn's eyes INCLUDES the right to promote Catholocism and not just the  traditional religions. For us who are saved and many atheists know that the Catholic religion is a cult, and promoting it is treason (among other things) in our eyes. Now for democracy. The U.S. has a rigged democracy, and it is really an Aristocratic Democracy, everyone knows that, even Shawn, it just slips his mind because he lets himself get majorly distracted.  As an example of Shawn's ignorance of the more complicated parts of U.S. history, and his gullibility, he says in his book that F.D.R. was a democratic leader. Yet many teens in high school know that isn't true having heard his "New Deal". Even wiki acknowledges that that was communistic. He also perpetuates the myth that Islamic terrorists were responsible for twin tower DEMOLITION. Anyone with the net and who knows to double check facts, and who knows the evil side of America's history knows what I mean by "demolition" in reference to 9/11.  He also perpetuates this illogical goal: unity (under democracy) for the sake of it (like just supporting Bush, Jr. regardless of what he says). He doesn't say it but implies it. Unity for the sake of allowing Bush Jr. and the troops in Iraq to have a nice day is stupidity.  And check out this self-centered attitude: "some sick cell of terrorists just attacked my world." Well what happened to the people they attacked, their world, the one that ended that day?  He also picks on Clinton for reasons you can probably guess, as if he was the ONLY bad president. This book is childish, and I don't mean that in a mean way, I mean it's as if it were written by an angry, poorly educated, arrogant preteen who had a good editor.  One thing he does imply, and rightly so, is that the "Koran" is evil. But, big surprise, didn't come out and say that outright, I WONDER WHY?! So much for courage 
 The just-war position has often been misunderstood and wrongly applied to try justify conflict that has already begun.  This book does a good job of returning to a classic understanding of the theory of a just war.  However, the author makes some large assumptions about the state of humanity and forgets that we are incapable of perceiving justice in a manner that is in a state of grace without the flaws of sin and subjective judgment 
 The story was slow, predictable and boring. I am still amazed I hung in there and finished reading it.  It's a dud in my opinion 
 I READ MOST OF WHAT THE OTHER REVIEWERS WROTE AND I AGREED WITH THEM. THERE REALLY WAS NO DEPTH, BARELY ANY EMOTIONS, THE HERO IS SO VERY DULL. WHAT I DIDN'T GET WAS THE FACT THAT HE WENT AND KISSED THE HEROINE'S SISTER AND RESPONDED, WHAT'S WORSE WAS THAT, THAT PART WAS ONLY 67 PAGES TO THE END. HE DIDN'T REALLY ADMIT HE LOVE HIS WIFE UNTIL SHE ASKED HIM! AND HE REPLIED,   "AYE. I LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE. I AM YOUR HUSBAND. HOW CAN YOU DOUBT IT?"  THERE WASN'T EVEN ANY EMOTION AS HE TALKED! BORING! I STILL CAN'T IMAGINE HE WENT AND KISSED SOMEONE ELSE AND FELT NO REMORSE OR GUILT. NO FEELINGS, PRATICALLY FOR WHAT HE DID!  ANOTHER PROBLEM, IS THAT HE SEEMED TO TAKE A LIKING TO THE HEROINE'S LITTLE BROTHER WAY TOO MUCH! IT'S ALMOST DISTURBING!  THE FACT THAT IN THE SEQUEL, CLEVE MENTIONED OF THE HERO'S LOVE FOR THE BOY MORE THAN THE WORLD AND PERHAPS HIS WIFE TOO. PREHAPS? I MEAN THAT IS EXTREMELY MESSED UP! '&'  I'M NOT GIVING THIS BOOK A TOTAL ZERO BECAUSE IT IS COULTER AFTER ALL. I STILL HAVE HOPE, HER OTHER BOOKS ARE BETTER.  
 I am rating this program just one star because I found out AFTER ordering that it is not compatible with digital voice recorders.  I did go to the nuance website before ordering.  They didn't have a little chart to tell what the difference was between preferred and standard.  Anyway, if you want naturally speaking to do transcribing, you need the Preferred version, not this one. 
 The recent disappearance of Spalding Gray has made me realize what I don't like about this film: its narcissism.  It's Gray's defining characteristic.  After a while, despite Jonathan Demme's fabulous direction (he makes the  best of a limited repertoire) it just gets boring 
 I've read all 6 of the books, I think they're great!  But why would you spend $100 on a 6 book box set... when there are 7 books in the series?  Better to hold off on buying the box set until is a... complete set.  But maybe that's just me.    2 Stars because the books are incredible 
 At least some of the discs containing The Beyond are defective. I have returned one set and recieved another and it also has its problems. It doesnt like to load or read once loaded. If you monkey with it enough it will play. As for the movies themselves i cannot seem to get enough of them. The music as well as visual is very captivating. Hopefully Anchor Bay will do a recall on the defective product. Perhaps buying the movies seperatly would be a better option 
 Bought this as a Christmas gift for a cousin who is mentally handicapped.  Thought I could program it and have him enjoy the ease of reading the hands and the glow in the dark feature.  However it is now January 18th and I still cannot program the watch.  Frustrate 
 "Checken Soup for the Soul" contains a series of short stories where horrible and depressing things happen. And then the story ends.  Each story contains an act of kindness, but the main focus is a sad, depressing, or horrible situation.  For example, a crippled boy chooses a crippled puppy to be his pet; and a young boy dies of cancer surrounded by friends.  Look, if you love watching Dramas on TV, you'll adore this book.  Ditto if you like crying.  For myself, I just don't understand how this is supposed to be uplifting 
 This is a well written book that will probably help if you have a child that is mildly challenging. If you know or suspect your child has oppositional defiant disorder, get professional help 
 I have read other books by Gabriel COusens (Conscious Eating and Depression-Free for Life). This book disappointed me very much. It is full of traps and actually does more harm than any good; The worst thing about it is the utopian-perfectionist-idealistic lookout this book sets out. Basically what he is saying is, "Live like me otherwise you're on your way to enthropy". His advice is sometime in place, but at times it is about either using HIS tree of life products or simply going to the tree of life centre. Where else would you have live-food panchakarma, rebounding while breathing 100% oxygen etc? On one hand the author talks about the destruction of self, ego etc. but on the other he boasts about his abilities as to fast, stay off anesthetics or do push ups.  The author is ANYTHING but humble and I find that disturbing. Also the terminology he uses is very confusing. His use of Indian words seems to be in place, as he explains their meaning, but the use of Hebrew words seems to be useless. It seems he likes to use exotic-sounding words just to make his teachings exotic. It is not straight to the point. Another frustrating part is the frequent reference to his other books. Instead of putting a chart from his other books, he just says to go and look it up, yet goes on discussing the implication of what's in the chart. This is highly unprofessional.  The authors poetry is of questionable quality but that's to each one's taste. It seems he tries hard to be artistic, tries too hard. His concepts of IAM and I AM THAT are very foreign to me. To be honest from reading his text I did not understand what he is on about. AGain it seems that instead of talking to the point, he goes on to ramble half-thoughts in the air. His frequent mention of himself as a model of the perfection he speaks about is nothing short of disgusting. Not recommended - a trap for those who are blinded by idealism 
 Like "Jurassic Park", this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters. My reasons for such an accusation: 1. Crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts. And while these can be quite interesting, they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline (Dan Brown, for instance, is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity). As a result, the book comes off as slow and stumbling. 2. The plot isn't all that interesting to begin with. (Vengeful gorillas? Talking gorillas? Misanthropic gorillas? Come on.) 3. The book's ending is utterly terrible. 4. Cricton's writing is weak, and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing.  Sorry, Michael, but this book just didn't do it for me 
 `The Anglo-American Establishment" is a book by Carroll Quigley, a man whom former president Clinton called his "favorite professor."    Quigley documents the work of a secret Group of influential conspirators, alleging that the Group was one of the most important historical facts of the 20th century, due to its influence on British foreign policy. The book covers the period from 1919-1945.   The author nearly bores us to death, and presents a lot of information that is contradicted by other sources.  There is some worthwhile information here, but it will be hard to find if your eyes glaze over.  Cecil Rhodes of South African fame formed this unnamed Group and perpetuated it after his death, by way of a trust fund.     Many who were associated with the Group imagined that they were endeavoring to extend British rule throughout the world, along with the great moral ideals of "freedom and democracy."    This Group was self-deluded.  They imagined that they were moral, civilized, and even Christian, but they were the antithesis of all that.  Their methods were those of tyrants, despots, warmongers, and conspirators.  Quigley makes a fundamental error in supposing that this Group was at the apex of power. More likely, this Group was manipulated to further the interests of international finance, without the idealists in the ranks having any suspicion of being used.      The name Robert Henry Brand (Baron Brand, Lord Brand) is repeatedly mentioned as a supremely influential member.  He was a partner and managing director of Lazard Brothers Bank.  "In all of his activities Brand has remained one of the most central figures in the core of the Group."     The Group was responsible for an unbroken series of British policy disasters.  Like they say, the big money is made in wars and depressions.     The Group's idea of expanding the British Empire mutated into the idea of placing the Commonwealth within a League of Nations, which is just another name for world government 
 I'm a new AutoCAD user.  This was one of two books I purchased.  This wasn't a good to use to get started learning AutoCAD but may come of use in the future.  
 This is truly a "one hit wonder" and that's what it will ever be. Musically limited, not to mention Pauly Fuemana's lousy voice, this cd is just a filler for "How bizarre", a mediocre song with a huge worldwide marketing that saved it from obscurity. Fifteen years later, Gnarls Barkley's Crazy reminds me of OMC for some reason. Anyways, buy it for a penny, download the song and put it back in sale for the same money. That way it's for free, which is probably the right price for this item. 
 I enjoyed the book very much until I read the letter in Chap. VIII. It mentions an amulet. An amulet is of the occult.This disturbed me very much 
 Look for it used, or rent it if possible.  
 Seriously, I didn't even think that this was a comedy until I came here and saw people saying "it wasn't funny."  I got it as part of a boxed set of Cary Grant films (purchased here), and it's the only dud of the lot.  There was one scene that, I will grant you, was light and entertaining.  Not laugh out loud, but funny enough (I won't spoil it by saying which one).  Aside from that, the film struck me as a rather unbelievable farce about infidelity.    Most of all, you could almost feel the very talented cast trying to keep this elephant airborne.  Grant and Simmons, in particular, are strong - but their efforts are ultimately squandered.  Bob Mitchum is OK, but generally miscast, and Kerr's beauty and talent are basically wasted.  No amount of acting would allow you to believe that anyone could act as impetuously and stupidly as she does here.  She goes from happily married to tramp in about 5 minutes, for no discernible reason.    Overall acting: C (Grant/Simmons: B) Directing: F Writing: D-  I understand that this film caters more to English tastes, and that's fine, but I found it most un-satisfying 
 When I saw the movie, it had a score by Tangerine Dream.   I have a copy of that soundtrack on cassette.  I wanted to replace it with CD.  I purchased this cd and was completely bummed.  It's a great CD.  But not what I was looking for.  I loved legend when it came out.  Love the Tangerine Dream score.  I really liked the Brian Ferry song, Is your love strong enough.  Also missing is the "theme" song by Jon Anderson from Yes 
 Ill conceived and silly. Really a waste of time - I actually felt that the novel was very depressing. I will not be reading any of Ms. Berg's other novels.  Too unrealistic to believe that a gay man would become the love of someone's life and that a person could not move on from this relationship 
 If you have an older 3 year old or young 4 year old who needs potty training this is a good sticker pack.  The stickers have phrases on them, like; wiped by myself, remembered to wash hands, was dry, etc.  If you have a younger potty trainer, save your money and buy some smiley face stickers, or character themed stickers your child will enjoy placing on a potty chart. Toys-R-Us carries cartoon character sticker packs. Good luck shopping! 
 I know a lot of people liked this book, but it didn't work for me. The main character and his buddies run around like chickens with their heads cut off, acting as if they have committed a huge crime. The problem is, they didn't. There is no crime. I talked to several cops and a prominent defense attorney about this plot, and it makes no sense. It would make sense if someone comes after the McGuffin, early on, but no one does, not until very late in the book. So most of the story has no foundation. 
 i had it it lated awile(1-2months)enough to last till it wouldn't open! other things happened i didn't like                 DON'T GET IT PEASE IT'S A WASTE!!! 
 They need to remake this movie where the parents remember five minutes into being locked up that they have a cell phone.  When they get out, they ought to smack the skin off their children's rear ends 
 This otherwise awful book is important to read as an historical document so that we know how we got into the current mess in Iraq (and at home in America, with our mass deficit and debt). This book shows us the  Neoconservative fantasy of creating a new century of pax Americana and benevolent  imperialism, which was then put into operation after 9/11 and has since led us into the catastrophic disaster that is Iraq. Read this book and then never believe or listen to another word that these deluded Neocon ideologues say. Even Francis Fukuyama has  now abandoned this crazed utopian fantasty. Read his new book after you've finished this piece of pure fictio 
 Man, can she get anymore stupid and talentless. She needs to spend some of that undeserved bling bling on some singing lessons than her skimpy outfits. All the songs on this album are totally unlistenable! She completely lacks power, vocal range and versatility. Jennifer Lopez represents everything that is wrong with music today. She gets a recording contract because her good looks and success with her acting career. Just because your a great actor/actress doesn't necessarily mean you can sing, too. Some actors/actresses were able to achieve it, but not Jennifer Lopez. She needs to quit the music business while she still can. Please stick to acting...OH, WAIT! I forgot, she can't do that either! 
 If you are a real hard core Sonny Chiba Collector, then this is not worth your time, because he doesn't do really anything in this flick! Why is it not in widescreen? Why is there no original language track? This is DVD right? If you still want this movie to fill the gap in your Chiba collection try to find it in its original format & quality 
 I like Steve Vai. I love Devin Townsend.  I, however, don't especially like this album. Their are some great parts, and some humourus parts, but overall there is about the same amount of bad as good... which is really not what I look for in music.  If you like great guitarwork and screams taht sound like someone is ripping their throat out with air, then you'll like about half of this album, while  the other half is odd little "SHAKAZULU" chants and weird stuff like this 
 Think of the most pretentious thing you can, please. But think carefully. Think along the lines of that red haired woman who appears and talks rubbish occasionally on Critical Mass, or of Geraldine Doogue (sic) discussing the afterlife on Compass with some vicars (sorry, non Australian readers!). Then double that level of pretension and you'll be approaching the near toxic amounts  of utter codswallop to be seen on this, Maynard James Keenan's latest excursion into the world of pointless obscurism. Look, matey, like it or not, this is Heavy Metal. Therefore I want, no I need, explosions, lots of lights, walls of Marshalls and some gratuitous blood. This has none of those things. Just a short little whiny man in a wig boring the pants off of everyone who comes into contact with him. Of course, if you're a fan, you'll lap up every second. But you'll get what you deserve. I promise 
 These guys had a couple good ideas, but their arrogance ruined the movie for me.  They have a few modestly intellectual observations, but they are so proud of themselves for speaking up about them the movie is unpleasant to watch.  Nothing deep or terribly cleaver here...  Only mildly entertaining, you can see the best parts in the trailer/promo.  My copy ended up at the landfill 
 This straight-to-video's modest budget is attested to by the fact that while most of the action is supposed to take place at a large state prison, this prison only seems to house about 12 inmates. The plot is that old but reliable one about a man posing as a prisoner so he can go "undercover" and solve a crime. The crime in this case is not especially interesting and it's resolved in much too pat a fashion. However, leading man Tommy Lee Thomas looks good with his shirt off, (though he seems too small to be throwing his weight around), and there's a torture scene, (modeled on the one in "Lethal Weapon"), in which he's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electric shocks. Mr. Thomas' performance may not be of Oscar caliber but he does know how to yell.  
 Perhaps I'm missing something, but it seems that while this book might provide a nice skeleton for managers straddling the line between development (techitecture) and business strategy (marketecture), the meat is simply not present.  So many opportunities for REAL examples went either unaddressed completely, or worse, were answered with meaningless little 2-paragraph sidebars filled with sentences like, "then we sat down to talk about things and we decided to approach things from a different angle, blah, blah, blah."  Thanks.  I can't say this book was a complete waste of time but it certainly wasn't the best use of my time, either, sadly.  And the coining of these ridiculous terms like "techitecture" were truly hard to take 
 Pass on this book.   If you do buy it you'll read through it in no time and will  be no better at problem solving. Mostly common sense.   Without the chatty style and illustrations this book could have been reduced to a thin pamphlet.  If you really need a good problem solving text and are mathematically oriented opt for the classic "How to Solve It" by Polya or "How to solve mathematical problems" by Wayne Wickelgren. Not the easiest reading but definitely more worthwhile 
 Woolf's style of writing (changing between several characters' thoughts) causes difficulty for one to follow this novel on audio. The paperback proved to be easier for me. 
 I liked this book all the way through the trial, but the post-trial revelation was, at the very least, ridiculous.  It did not come across as a "Sixth Sense" shocker but a cheap shot out of left field.  It was stupid and didn't fit with the story, at all.  The author didn't need it and should have tied up the loose ends a different way.  I can't even look back on the book and see how it all it.  It didn't.  Throughout the book, even alone with his own thoughts, Tom didn't reveal his true character.   This book was a huge disappointment!  I would not recommend that anyone waste their time.  In the end, when all is "revealed" nothing makes sense.  No matter how hard you might try - it doesn't fit, at all!  
 If James K. Polk hadn't very unexpectedly become president of the United States in 1845, nobody today would have heard of him.  The accomplishments he is remembered for -- the annexation of Texas, the acquiring of Oregon Territory from Britain, the War with Mexico and resultant annexation of New Mexico and California -- he was able to accomplish only BECAUSE he became president.  So why does John Seigenthaler devote less than forty of 156 pages of text to Polk's presidency in his book, JAMES K. POLK?  JAMES K. POLK is one of "The American Presidents" series which are supposed to concentrate on the PRESIDENCIES of the chief executives, not the whole lives of the men themselves.  Admitted, exploring the biographical and historical background and the process by which particular individuals are able to win the White House over the opposition of many other contenders is essential to understanding the presidencies they spawn -- doubly so in Polk's case as America's first "dark horse" president.  But the other equally short contributions to this series are quite capable of covering such material in the first thirty or forty pages of text, leaving the remaining one hundred plus to discuss the presidency itself.  Given the constraints of this series and the incredible presidency that was to be Polk's, it is Seigenthaler's DUTY to do the same.  I bought this book to learn how a president, whom I knew very little about, was able in four short years to create, for better or worse, a United States that finally spread "from sea to shinning sea".  Thirty some pages is nowhere near enough text to discuss the complications that Polk had to deal with in his War with Mexico alone, particularly when Polk thought he could annex California WITHOUT going to war.  Seigenthaler hardly mentions the problems that the obstinate Democrat Polk had with his two equally headstrong Whig generals, Taylor and Scott, or the increasingly fierce opposition he faced as the war dragged on and on.  Ditto for the Oregon Territory dispute with the British.  He devotes more text to Polk's establishing an independent Treasury and lowering the import tariffs, but these achievements pale in comparison to the previous two   Seigenthaler wastes far more text telling the story of how the washed-up ex-governor from Tennessee hoping for the vice-presidential candidacy, won the 1844 Democratic Party's presidential nomination instead when neither of the two top contenders could secure a majority.  Then Seigenthaler proceeds with an almost equally long description of the campaign itself -- during which Polk did NOT make public campaign promises to annex California and gain the Oregon border treaty with England, but merely promised to accept the annexation of Texas and serve only one term.  The "four goals" that he had for his presidency he first confided to his secretary of the navy AFTER becoming president (check out pp. 102, 3).  Imagine a book of some one hundred fifty pages about another rather obscure ex-congressman from Illinois named Abraham Lincoln that devotes less than forty to his presidency and barely mentions the Civil War.  Change the main character and you've got John Seigenthaler's JAMES K. POLK.     
 FALSEHOODS. Spong's most important falsehood is the book's nominal premise--its title. Christianity won't die if it doesn't change. Religions can remain static, or change minimally, and remain viable for millennia. Islam in particular comes to mind.  Relatedly, the theistic God has not been "cast aside" because human beings have "evolved" (p 54). Positing that humans can/do/will evolve either physically or mentally in the space of a few years is an error made by many, including Marx, Lenin, Lysenko and Hegel. Theism developed due to human nature (pp 51-52), and Spong shows no evidence that the mere acquisition of knowledge changes our nature.  INTOLERANCE. For a guy who seeking to "love wastefully and abundantly," (p 68) Spong has a hell of a long way to go. He commits an unpardonable hypocrisy when he calls his critics peddlers of "premodern literalizations that so frequently masquerade as Christianity" (p xvi). Besides being intolerance bordering on bigotry, wouldn't you agree that Spong calling others' Christian credentials into question is a little ironic?  SOPHISTRY. Why does Spong resist being called a pantheist or even a "panentheist" (p 62)? Is there really any difference between "God is in, but not necessarily the sum of, all things" (panenetheism) and "God is the inescapable depth and center of all that is" (Spongism) (p 70)?  And...Christianity without Christ. Think about that. Sam Kinison would have correctly pointed out that Christianity without Christ is like rock 'n roll without drugs. Spong's Jesus is not Christ. He is a "spirit person" (ch 7). He doesn't save (pp 179-180). He didn't atone (p 84). He will not resurrect us (p 116). I could believe an oak tree is Christ; does that make me a Christian?   CASUISTRY. Spong's phony reasoning is obvious when contrasting his religious and political views. Take a look at his view of Jesus and his favorable view of abortion (p 6). In chapter 8 Spong sets forth Jesus as the alpha-exemplar of selflessness and defender of the defenseless and excluded (pp 128-9). Contrast that ideal with abortion. Abortion is almost always selfish; actually, it's difficult to think of something more selfish. It also is an act that by definition rejects (kills) the defenseless.  TRUTH. Let's be honest. Spong breaks wide open some of Christianity's most glaring problems and fallacies. Among the best explained are: how the Enlightenment and modern science attack God (pp 31-40); how the need for religion comes from our nature instead of an external source (pp 51-52); the illogic of "religious truth" (p 52); the function of guilt as part of religious control (p 95); the inherent injustice of prayer (p 142); the immorality of the law of Moses (p 153); and the contemporary selective obedience to biblical laws (pp 156-158) 
 My girlfriend had this CD and played it for me.  I really like country music and I like some of Reba's music for this CD was way too "far out" for me!!  Some reviews here have mentioned that its too loud and overdone.  I have to agree.  I don't think much of the songs on this collection.  If you're going to buy a Reba CD I would buy her first greatest hits collection.  That's a good example of country music without Reba overdoing the vowels and syllables to her words.  Give me a break!! 
 A bunch of great guitarists dealing with John Coltrane's complex harmonies. Quite every jazz player considers Coltrane as one of the most rappresentative and influential musician in the world; I love all the musicians playing in this album, they all have the harmony knowledge to play on the intricate Coltrane's chord changes, BUT...it seems they never listened to his songs, to his sounds, to the magic athmosphere he was able to create on his albums. That dreamy sensation is the main thing lacking here in my opinion. Playing in a Coltrane tribute is NOT ONLY playing over Coltrane chords! Here it's like  some good guitar players practising...where's the Tribute?? Besides, in Giant Steps (soloist: Greh Howe) why mix a kind of Hendrix's Foxy Lady in the main theme??? I would have expected something more, considering skill of such guitarsits.  Maybe a too commercial project 
 I remember this movie being really, really fun and great when I was 9. My wife wanted this for our video collection and I hate myself for buying this movie. All I need to know is why she wanted this today! If you have kids, which we do, they'll enjoy this for the first time, but after words they'll be as bored with it as I am. If you are looking for nostalgia, this is the movie, but if you are looking for a good dust collector, buy it quickly 
 ...SI's first album was sheer beginners' luck ? It made me wonder. Whilst I found Dicknity somewhat charming,and mildly entertaining (i'd give it 3 out of 5 stars), their new effort lacks all that I hoped it to be. After many listening sessions, I still don't connect with it and, quite frankly, find myself skipping all the songs a few seconds after they begin 
 Polemicists seeking to slander Chomsky regardless of facts might take pleasure in this work.  But, knowing Chomsky personally and having read his works thoroughly, this book misrepresents his arguments to create a pastiche bearing no resemblance to the man or his ideas.  Chomsky never relished 9/11.  The scion of Hebrew scholars, he hardly hates Israel.  Indeed, he briefly lived on a kibbutz there in the 1950s.  He does see Israel possessing significant freedoms and a press more vibrant than America's, but is also very critical of Israeli policy toward Palestinians and presents arguments to that end in the tradition of Avi Shlaim.   While one can certainly disagree with Professor Chomsky's ideas, this book is hardly the place to familiarize oneself with them.  It is more in the tradition of tabloid than scholarship.  For those seeking intellectually honest critiques I suggest looking elsewhere... 
 The book had a long review of the historical and artistical developments related to the pinhole camera.  I was hoping that it would have more information on building a camera and solving many of the problems that pinhole photographers struggle with, such as changing the film.  I wanted more ideas or different plans for building your own camera, not just pictures of cameras that others had built.  There is a nice chapter on zone plates 
 The magic of the first 2 seasons of Happy Days was the opening of "Rock Around The Clock" and all the great rock and roll songs of the fifties. Season 2 has been totally altered and the excitement is lost. Shame on Paramount for dumping the great music in favor of generic instrumentals. What an injustice to a great TV show. The video quality for the first episode of the season is awful and the fact that it's out of sequence just makes it even worse. Granted, it may have aired this way, but why not correct the sequence on the DVD? This DVD set is truly a disappointment, especially after the excellent job they did with Season 1. Don't waste your money. Maybe Paramount will pull all these inferior DVD sets and re-release Season 2 the way it really was 
 ﻿In the end, it appears that by "anti-Catholic prejudice", Jenkins means a failure to regard what he considers to be the core of the Roman Catholic church with sufficient reverence.   He would probably characterize most of the practicing Catholics I know as near-heretical.  Jenkins uses related but distinct words like "bigotry" and "prejudice" interchangeably. It is clear by the end that a great deal of what he is terming "prejudice", which is usually applied to hostility from outsiders, is in fact internal dissent and dissatisfaction from current and former Catholics.  I refuse to be embarrassed on behalf of my society at large if the hierarchy of any organization is having problems keeping the flock in line.  The book is quite interesting, containing a vast amount of information, including a lot which seems to argue against Jenkin's point.  I don't know whether to congratulate him to have the honesty to include it or to suppose that he has completely failed to understand how others might see it.  Jenkins is attempting to gain momentum from the various "liberation" movements that have arisen in the wake of the Civil Rights movement that became prominent in the 1950s.   To this end, he employs the tried and true propaganda technique of beginning history at a point where one's own side can be made to look like an injured innocent, i.e., the anti-Catholicism of nativists and Know-Nothings.  If he really wants to trace the history of Protestant/Catholic conflict, he needs to go back to the Reformation at least.  It would also be appropriate to mention the Vatican's anti-Americanism during the same period; many churches were offended that Americans considered the people, rather than God,to be the legitimate source of political power.   In any case, it is irrelevant, since the book largely ignores the unfortunately still extant strains of real anti-Catholic prejudice, such as the fundamentalist Protestant groups who regard the Pope as the anti-Christ. Jenkins's real foe is people whose argument with the Catholic Church is not really religious but social.  Representatives of the Church have often argued that it is their duty to enter into debates of public legislation and morality and I can't disapprove of the participation of any citizen in public debates.   They all enter at the same level, however, and those who participate in the brawl of public debate (excuse me, the marketplace of ideas) must expect sometimes very harsh criticism, although I shall always hope, often in vain, for a level of civility and honest consideration of differing viewpoints.  Jenkins feels that the Church should be accorded special reverence by all; he seems to suggest that any criticism borders on bigotry.  The Church should be permitted to make strongly worded pronouncements without risking strongly worded retorts.   To Jenkins, any dispute between the Church and any other group, including dissenting Catholics, is proof of anti-Catholic prejudice.  He would probably deny this and attempts at several points to explain the difference between prejudice/bigotry and acceptable dissent, but the main difference seems to be that acceptable dissent is removed in time and place.  Jenkins mentions that the Masons were originally welcoming to Catholics, but after what he admits to be a campaign of slander and libel by the Church hierarchs, became decidely less friendly.  Jenkins blames the Masons for the ill-will, even though he admits that the Church threw the first rhetorical punch.   In many ways, Jenkins does as much as any "No-Nothing" to argue that "real" Catholics are unable to live in a secular, multireligious society.  It is in his discussion of homosexual issues that this becomes most clear.   I share Jenkins' outrage at the invasion of St. Patrick's Cathedral by Act-Up, but for the most part he discusses the incident as if the police refused their assistance and society at large applauded; he does eventually admit that even many gay activists were appalled.  I have enough sympathy for the points that Jenkins raises about the problems of expecting rapid change with regard to a long-standing and widespread condemnation of homosexually that I would expect to be charged with homophobia.  As an outsider, I would not presume to tell the Church how to regard homosexuality or insist that they sanctify gay marriages.   At the same time, if the church is going to condemn gays as hell-bound and attempt to frustrate their efforts to reach an accomodation with the larger society, it is ridiculous for him to take umbrage at non-violent complaints.     Jenkins completely misses the point in his discussion on pedophilia.   The issue for most people is less that some priests are pedophiles than the apparent inability of the Church to deal with the issue.  People being what they are, this has presumably been an organizational problem for more than 1500 years, yet the Church seems baffled.   Some people do see this as an opportunity to beat the Church and its policy of celibacy over the head, but in fact civil authorities have in the past tried to spare the Church embarrassment by declining to prosecute and trusting the Church to deal with erring priests.   Jenkins ignores this and complains that the organizational strength of the church makes it a tempting target for grandstanding prosecutors, forgetting that this is the very reason that the problems were concealed for so long.  The Church is paying more for its own failure to deal with the problem than for the individual transgressions of certain priests 
 this book wastes alot of pages just for margin. not an easy to read book. the whole semester, we only covered 5 chaps, alot of material is not useful for undergraduates. 
 This movie seemed to vacillate between funny ha ha office bullsh*t and then really freaky stuff that made me cringe and want to retch. I don't like that; going back and forth and not knowing what they "want" from me. And I REALLY didn't 'get' the ending. I didn't buy the romance. The only thing I enjoyed about this whole movie was Kevin Spacey; that's it. Just skip through the rest of the crap 
 Really this satirical take on Orwells 1984 is nothing more than a messy arthouse flick. I first saw this movie back in the 80s, my ex-brotherlinlwa was raving about it,to be honest I thought it wasa load of crap back. Acouple of weeks ago, I picked it up for ten bucks at movie warehouse, and thought I would give it another go, well I really struggled to stay awake when I watched it last sunday, and my verdict is the same as it was back in the 80s, "a load of old toss". Don't waste your money 
 I have read many books on WWII from many perspectives and have been to visit the D-Day beaches four times. I cannot visit the American graves in Normandy without being moved. Twice I have had the experience of hearing taps played near Omaha Beach. I have the utmost respect for all those who fought and died. I had high expectations for the book. My problem is that the book never finds its voice. At times it is the four star general writing with his perspective of high and at other times it is the young colonel leading his men. I wanted to hear more from this man. Just as he starts to share, the general leaps in and throws off the narrative. Let the colonel talk about his artillery missions and show me more of how his experience was different. (A few photos and maps would be nice). If the general needs to talk, give him a separate chapter at the end of the book. We hear from the privates and generals but not the majors and colonels. Their voices could add to the history. I wish the colonel would have spoken for them 
 After purchasing the Jive Bunny The Album I thought this would be a great addition to my collection, however I was sorely mistaken.  It does carry a lot of good 70's tunes, but it just doesn't mix like "The Album".   Stick to the "The Album", which scores big at clubs, party's,  anywhere and forget this mix 
 This book stinks, the plot is trivial, the characters suck, and the chapters go on and on and on and on and on about nothing, nothing at all.   Here is my favorite passage from the book "There was nothing for him to do but roll over and try to sleep.  Somewhere, sometime, he had even forgotten how to cry."  Yeah the entire book is like that.   
 I just listened to the whole record on AOL Listening Party. There's no doubt this record will be heralded as the best McCartney record since Band On The Run, but what's really up with Paul is every record is worse than the last.    As far as I can tell every tune had a fragmant of an idea behind it, which was then turned into a tune in the studio.  By the time the bridge arrives, McCartney is hacking out uninspired chord progessions layered with horrible, clumsy lyrics.   I feel sorry for the guy from Radiohead.  He must be dreading the diplomatic reviews he is sure to recieve from artists he has done good work with 
 I would have given this book *five* stars, had it not been for the shoddy - literal translation from Italian to English.  Being an Italian speaker, I sometimes had to re-read certain sentences with my "Italian" hat on to discern the meaning.  This would have been an excellent book if the translation had been both literary and cultural but it is neiter.  This, unfortunatly, detracts from the book a great deal as some references are not explained to the english-reading audiance who may not be familiar with Italian history.  Since Italians use a great many words to describe something that would only take a few in English- the literal translation makes them read like run-ons and often leaves the reader lost at the end.  If you are able to overcome all these obstacles, the content of the book is enlightning and educational.  I learned that industrial olive-growing in Greece was implemented when they were under Venitian rule and that the fork, was originally a small spear that eventually became the four-pronged utensil that we now know with the development of newer, longer, slippery pasta shapes 
 Ms.Steel is truly the Queen of repition. She needs to get some new editors and listen to them or unplug her word processeor. I see that is the ongoing critism of her books. I swore I was never going to read another of her soaps(I can't stand those either) but this given to me by friends that said it was sooo good.  I'll stick with the authours I know I like from now on. And I hope she finds some new descriptions to use besides impeccably and exquisite/exquisitely, she has worn these out. BUT she's laughing all the way to her banks and investment brokers 
 Is the Internet the last, best hope for the Democratic Party? The authors, who are the  founders and moderators of two popular leftist websites, would argue a most resounding yes. However, I'm not quite convinced that theirs is the best solution, even though they gave a rousing lecture on behalf of their book a few months ago before a friendly audience at a noted New York City-based progressive think tank. And much to their credit, both in their lecture and book, they  have offered at times a thoughtful, occasionally profound, analysis of what is wrong with the Democratic Party. But frankly, I think they've missed the Democratic Party's ongoing woes, which more thoughtful, conservative authors like Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter have noted in their books.  With much regret, I also think that both authors have become part of the problem, since they have ignored the significance of ongoing battles in the global War on (Islamofascist) Terrorism, acting as if these battles had no relevance to current American politics (Daily Kos founder - and co-author of this book - Markos Moulitsas Zuniga has taken a hypocritical stance by opposing Connecticut Democratic Senator Joseph Lieberman's reelection due to Lieberman's unwavering support of both Israel and our participation in the War on (Islamofascist) Terrorism, since he and his co-author, Jerome Armstrong, have argued persuasively in their book that Democratic party activists must move beyond single issue politics.). Instead, for example, I have found a more thoughtful analysis of current partisan Democratic Party views on Israel's bloody, but necessary, war against Hezbollah stated eloquently in political pundit - and commentator - Dick Morris' recent column (http://www.thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/Comment/DickMorris/072606.html) co-authored with his wife Eileen McGann, than I have seen from those posting at either www.MyDD.com or www.dailykos.com. Since some of the comments on Israel's current war against both Hamas and Hezbollah  that I have seen posted at www.dailykos.com could be described as rabidly anti-Semitic, then I have to wonder whether potential buyers should purchase this book. My own answer is no, recommending instead, more profound works written by the likes of Dick Morris, Bernard Goldberg, Kevin Phillips, Peter Beinart and Joe Conason, to name but a few, who are more thoughtful scribes across the political spectrum than the authors of "Crashing the Gate: Netroots, Grassroots, and the Rise of People-Powered Politics" 
 Robert Kennedy was my very first hero as a child.  Although I enjoyed to some degree the psychological portrait of the man, I was very perturbed by the author's contention that the Attorney General in any way engineered his  brother's death.  To suggest such a thing is to suggest pure madness as RFK  was absolutely devoted to his brother and often sublimated his own identity  during his Attorney General years so as to better serve his brother.  I  found that concept preposterous and completely without merit.   Robert  Kennedy was the only one of the brothers that I liked and I believed he had  a lot of personal integrity, moral conviction and certainly a brave one.   He met personal goals and was an extremely hard worker who had a lot to  show for his efforts.  In some way I feel this book trivialized his  political career. Robert Kennedy is an interesting man in his own right and  I think much more interesting than any of his brothers.  I really felt  somewhat disappointed in this book 
 This film is evocative of the quirky, madcap Robert Altman at his best and worst.  We got it because we have a Bud Cort fan in the family, and just to see him makes it worth it.  But the story is strange, resolution less than satisfying.  If you're really a big Altman or Cort fan, then you must see it.  Just be aware that THIS IS NOT A WESTERN!  (I had it confused with John Wayne's "Rooster Cogburn" and the Dennis Weaver's "McCloud" and kept waiting for it to start, thinking I was seeing more previews.)  The storyline combines an oddball who lives in unauthorized apartment in the basement of the Astrodome who is trying to fly, with a murder mystery and detective story.  This is one of Shelly Duvall's early roles -- don't miss her upside-down false eyelashes 
 I picked this book up in the library expecting because it seemed to have similar elements to a book I am writing. Hopefully my book won't come out this way. Cambell spends far too much time showing us the inner workings of a family we don't particularly care about and not enough time building our interest in what is in the woods. I didn't even stick around to find out. 
 This book is rediculously boring. How a person can actually put their name on a piece of writing that so bad leaves me dumb founded. If anyone can find me anything similar to Cliff's Notes for this book, I'd love you forever, because in 1 month I've read 100 pages, and I'm 1 of those that actually enjoys reading. It had facts, but that's about it. Wow a summer well wasted.. 
 You will first encounter one of the biggest lines of BS when you read Elvis Costello's foreword where he describes Mr. Emerick at the end of the second paragraph: "You could not meet a more modest and self-effacing man". If Geoff Emerick truly has such qualities you'll be hard pressed to find it in this book because the journeyman hack he hired in writing this piece of rubbish does too well of a job in presenting him as completely the opposite. Other reviewers have mentioned the constant fawning over Paul McCartney at every opportunity, the absurd trashing of George Harrison and Ringo Starr at every other opportunity, and the insensitive denouncing of John Lennon in between those opportunities. The put-downs he throws towards George Martin are just childish. This is such an annoying book that halfway through, this long-time Beatles aficionado who was greatly looking forward to reading it had to stop. To paraphrase George Harrison, "it's a drag, a well-known drag... 
 I reviewed this book for an Adult ADD group I belonged to, and after reading it found that this text was painfully basic.  If you are very green to ADD, pick this book up at the local library as a very light supplement  to other resource materials, but do not buy it 
 As one of the Co-Founders and former Director of Guatemalan Operations for PlanetOutreach, I discovered this book was published after leaving PlanetOutreach in 2002. The author was misinformed about how our internet cafe / telecenter was actually launched and who was involved in making it happen. In fact, the author made it seem that PlanetOutreach was a project of eBay and it certainly was not, although we did receive a grant from their foundation to make it happen. Persons mentioned as being a significant part of this project came down to San Pedro to visit only; from a few days (Meg W.and Henry G.- to take a tour of the village and project) to three weeks (Griffin - who helped with painting bookshelves only). Naturally, I was stunned to see credit given to people when they played a very small role (if any!) versus the four us who founded it (Karina, Ron, Debbie and me). Naturally, I was disappointed to see how the author chose to innacurately profile this innovative enterprise.  Two of the first employees I hired and trained, Mary and Otto,  continue to stay in touch with me through email. In fact, Otto, the first employee of PlanetOutreach, and Cata, his wife, gave birth to their first daughter in 2005 and named her after me; I saw her in Sept 2005 and she's beautiful! 
 In the early 1990s, when he first gained acclaim, Joshua Redman was one of the bright hopes of jazz. He played with a fresh energy and fire, yet maintained touch with the jazz tradition in a way that all music fans could appreciate. In the last five years, however, he seems to have lost his moorings, and this latest overhyped album is merely another sad example of his musical drifting -- and our loss. I'm astonished by the rave reviews other reviewers here and elsewhere have given Redman's latest. This record is little more than rehashed funk, with a saxophone overlay that is miles short of the ability and inventiveness Redman displayed when he was playing so-called "old-fashioned" acoustic jazz. The tunes are nothing special, the thumping electronic rhythmic accompaniment is boring and heavy-handed, and Redman seems to have nothing interesting to say. Here's one (former) fan who hopes Redman will find his way back, if not to mainstream jazz, at least to credibility. 
 These people have stumbled upon the truth (carbs make you fat and contribute to poor health), but they cannot wean themselves from years and years of mainstream dietary misinformation.  So, for instance, they still publish the "food pyramid" with a base of six servings of carbohydrates.  They state that a food with a glycemic index of 70 or more is "high."  That is really high!  Yet they recommend graham crackers as a snack for children (G.I. of 74). This book is confusing and poorly written 
 Wasn't quite sure what to think from this earlier film from Ruggero Deodata, who brought us the universally "infamous" CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. I figured it wouldn't be nearly as rough or "controversial", and I was right. But JUNGLE HOLOCAUST is decent film in its own right... But seriously after watching this it wasn't all that great..... it was a bit ridiculous if you ask me.   The reason is this, there are only two good cannibal scenes, and there are some unnecessary animal deaths through out this film. I'm not saying that the animal deaths bother me. I just think that it should have a reason. If you are going to kill an animal for a film have it have a purpose. For example in CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST when the turtle died they ate it afterwards. They actually used it! In this trash of a film a huge snake dies for no reason at all! An the scene when the crocodile gets slit open while its still alive, has a point, but I found that it still wasn't vary necessary. This film was not worth taking a life for! Its pure trash! there are really only three actual gore scenes. A tribal man gets his hand eaten by ants (which looks extremely fake!) The only good scene in this movie is when the girl that is helping our lead character gets eaten! That scene was awesome! that was the only thing that I found to be rewording in this film. This film basically drags out for a long time and has random pointless acts that go on for no reason. The one scene that annoyed me the most was when the tribal girl that is helping our main character escape from the cannibals is raped. An she is not raped by some one from the tribe, or some one fallowing them, she is raped by the person that she is trying to help! An for no reason at that! He just chases her down and has his way with her! It is pointless! An for some reason after this whole ordeal she finds respect for her rapist!   This film doesn't make sense! If you want to see a cheap cannibal movie that is enjoyable then go see Mondo Cannibal or Cannibal Terror. This film is worth watching out of curiosity, but don't waste your money. It's not that good. Rent it first if you can I'm glad that I did. 
 The author attempts to confront her rape, beating, and abuse by men in her life but she avoids her own anger and rage about the male violence perpetrated onto her.  She remains the "good girl" and subsumes  her anger into a semantic term "fierce" compassion.  The title of  the book is rather "nice girl forgives once again".  Except now  she learned from her male roshies that growing up to womanhood means we no  longer need to be silent provided we forgive.  And since we are not  compassionate enough to kill all violent males, we cannot do much more than  laugh at our own anger.  What's so fierce or compassionate about that 
 Whenever you want find something from the book, chances are you can't find it. Moreover, some chapter go to too details while others not enough. Would not recommend to buy if you do want learn Verilog 
 This book is awful. There is just no excuse for it. This collection of short memoirs are banal, tedious and utterly witless. Peck's only qualifications as a writer is the fact that she is female, over fifty, overweight and gay. Her memoirs are so insipid that finishing this book was incredibly difficult. Reading her memories about her grandparent's cows and how she is unable to pee in the woods made me roll my eyes. When she wrote about her cat, Babycakes, she made it sound as if her cat is ingenious and inovative to do all of these things which cats do naturally (her cat likes string? Really? Wow. . .).  I kept waiting for this book to become the fascinating, utterly hilarious, insightful, witty literary achievement that all the other reviews claimed that it was. Needless to say, that never happened. I plan on giving this book to someone that I don't like very much 
 I love Linda Howard, but I didn't even finish reading this book because it was so boring and annoying!  The heroine was a whiny martyr--she drove me crazy!  And where was the suspense?  I truly can't believe that people liked this book!  If you want to read a good Linda Howard book, read "Mr. Perfect" or "Dying to Please" 
 TTHHOOWWNNKK!! That is the sound when an arrow hits you, or at least that is what A.J. heard "Hi my name is A.J. and this is my story about when a cupid was brought into my life. I know you probably think, wow, cool, your own cupid, well it's not all that, and let me tell you. It is tons more and also tons less. It can ruin your life like in my case. I was a nice girl all into journaling and photography and then one second later I had to make a decision on weather or not to choose to make one of my wishes come true. I had the choice of enhancing my love life, becoming a professional photographer, or doing well with my studies. If you knew me, I choose "Love Life." Big mistake turns out only some of the victims of a cupid's arrow get effected. The guy I liked was too strong to give into the power of a cupid's arrow.  	Well, I'll let you talk to Lexie now and you can hear what she thinks.......... I thought the book was ok not the best, but if you're into all of that stuff about cupid then you would love this book, seeing how that is what it is about. I would give this book a chance you may find yourself giving into the power of cupid's arrow.  
 This compass handles very poorly compared to other manufacturers.  The pin for the lid is cheap and the hing will likely break.  The card (actual compass part that spins) wobbles a lot so it's difficult to get an exact bearing.  It is like the oil in the compass is very thin.  Also, the direction line lid spins easily, making it possible to take a bad reading.  Ironically, this is the Silva weakness as well.   If you need an inexpensive engineer style compass, consider the Silva.  For a two more dollars, you get an aluminum case, a hinge that won't break and a card that doesn't wobble with the slightest hand movement 
 If you are a Patterson fan and feel you must read this book, save yourself some time and anguish and read the first 3 chapters and the last 3 chapters.  You really don't need the rest 
 I was disappointed with this book. It promises "Quick meals for busy couples" but only has a few of those. First off they include alot of meals that serve more than 2. A good portion of the meals take 40 minutes or more to cook. Alot of the recipes were not very appetizing from just their names. It was also kind of bothersome that they did not separate the sections from one another. I was able to scrape 1 recipe I would like to try from this book so that is why I gave it a rating of 1 
 This book is so far from Krentz's best romantic novels (Grand Passion, Absolutely Positively), that I would have believed it written by some other romantic novelist because it was so predictable and boring.  The heroine has this "amazing" ability to tell where people have been murdered, but there is no way for her to use this ability to try to solve crimes & contribute to her husband's detective business.  Her husband is a private investigator who somehow manages to stay afloat financially, since he spends most of the book picking out color schemes for his home (Ochre or gold, ooh, the mystery!).  There are a couple of romantic subplots where friends of the couple who have previously been unlucky in love suddenly discover each other & decide that they're perfect for each other.  At the end of the book, you end up with a clumsily-plotted attempt to kill one character, a bunch of references to some nutty mental institution where two of the characters were held captive, three soppily happy couples dancing in the sunlight and one majorly bored reader who wishes she had picked another book for her weekend read 
 This book, above all others, reveals the breakdown of classical (libertarian) liberalism into the statist liberalism of today.  Although the first part of the work, being a refutation of Edmund Burke's silly  nonsense, is stellar, and is well worth reading.  Regardless, the second  part, the chapter on "Ways and Means" in particular, is composed  of the most despicable, anti-liberty doctrines that one can find.  What  Paine basically proposed was a late 18th century form of the welfare state,  replete with progressive taxation, subsidies for child birth, and other  fine statist amenities.  Thus, as all of these things are, in his words, to  be claimed as rights, the title of this book comes to mean nothing  whatsoever.  It is indeed sad that Thomas Paine has gained such an enduring  legacy as a friend to liberty.  In truth, he is actually one of its worst  enemies, as he combines a just zeal for resistance to oppression,  revolution, and reason, he sabotages his entire political philosophy 
 If something seems too good to be true, it usually is.  That's the case with this book as well.  It seems that all of these authors in this book are continualy trying to sell each others products.  No real practical advice is given.  They suggest making money by building a huge mailing list and selling products to the reciepient through emails.  First of all, how do we build this magical list, and secondly, who enjoys receiving spam of any kind these days.  Let's call a spade a spade.  The only ones getting rich off this book are the authors 
 This is the first Patterson novel I have ever read, and it is certain to be the last.  Most good authors draw the reader into a story by offering vivid descriptions and in-depth characters, but Patterson does none of that.  The author's writing style is akin to that of a small child's, as he uncermoniously plunks the reader in the middle of boring locales populated with one-dimensional characters.  Patterson then holds the reader's hand as he matter-of-factly recounts the explosion or gunshot du jour and then moves on without explanation, presenting a book written by a Ralph Wiggums-like child for immature children to enjoy.  How does the reader know Alex was scared? The reader knows because Patterson clumsily beats him about the head and shoulders with writing similar to the style: "The man pulled out a gun, Alex was scared, Alex shot the man and he was happy, and the man was dead."  Don't believe me? Simply graze through the book and find where the hero handily dispatches an arch-nemesis in a scene so brief and without fanfare I had to read it twice to make sure the protagonist killed who I thought he killed, or skip to the end if you prefer and painstakingly wind your way through a series of forgettable characters each deadpanning that he or she is responsible for the antagonist's evil deeds.  Quite simply, this author shows a complete lack of imagination and creativity and this book should be avoided at all costs 
 I read this book after being enchanted by the Accidental Tourist and other  of Anne Tyler's books.  This book deals with the life of a depressed  teenage girl and unless that kind of thing interest you, I would not  recommend reading it.  On the up side, it's really short so you can get  through it rather quickly.  I was hoping to read a good book, but only felt  worse after finishing this one 
 I was really looking forward to movie.  My goal was to expand my understanding of this historical period.  Many of the scenes looked like they used old sets from the 50's Westerns and the lighting technique was disappointing, these alone did not turn me off from watching.  My real gripe about the movie was the dialogue and the acting.  Within the first 10 minutes of the movie, a stage coach is robbed, my attention was drawn to the portrayals by the actors.  They were not believable and the dialogue just sounded like something that came out of book for young readers.  Later, when alerted that the posse is nearly upon them, the other rider responds with such uncharacterist language for a male ruffian that I laughed.  As the movie plodded forward, scene after scene left me wondering, how quickly was this thrown together and how come they didn't rehearse more.  I felt my patience to endure several more hours an unfair punishment.  I generally try to watch a movie entirely but frankly, I think it was an embarrassment and waste of time.  Maybe it got better (that is why I gave it two stars) but I find that doubtful.  I am wondering if both Tom Berrenger and the other author missed to many classes of Script Writing 101. 
 Don't bother reading this one - bought it, read it, regret I wasted time and money. Forget this guy. 
 Yeah, that's how I felt when I noticed the lack of gore and the lack of development in the characters.  Even the zombies are the same thoughout the picture.  How can a zombie go from one part of town to the next in what would take a serious muscle car at least an hour?    Regardless, it's worth owning to have the scene where they rise out of the cemetery.  The kid is downright annoying but, when I was a kid I liked him!  Suppose it's not time to have kids yet, aye?  Regardless it could have been better.  Flawed  but, if you viewed this before the first one... don't let it stop you from getting the first!  The first one rocked.  I thought the 3rd one was produced much better than this as well... but they just keep killing this series as part 4 and 5 I once again heard were terrible 
 Bad camera work Bad quality Girls Don't look anything like the cover, and crapy workout to boo 
 It's very true that Bennett's prose is full of wonderful, vivid and often ironic commentary.  This book gives you a great sense of place to the "five towns" (based on the six towns that would become Stoke-on-Trent) from the mid-nineteenth century to the early twentieth.  Detail is exactly right for time and place.  That makes it a rather interesting read.  However, there's next to no forward motion to this book. Two sisters lead divergent lives-- the beautiful one runs off with a hapless commercial traveler to Paris.  The dutiful one stays home, manages the shop, and marries the clerk.  But that's about it for drama.  Both sisters grow older, have some not very interesting stuff happen to them, then meet up again after a long time and end their lives together.  OK, Sophia, the beautiful one, does survive the siege of Paris, and become a manager/proprietress of a well-run pension. But somehow even this lacks drama.  Bennett is often praised for how well he wrote his women characters.  I disagree.  They are well observed it's true, and some of his projections about what they might feel-- when Constance, the dutiful one, faces "empty nest syndrome" so mournfull, for example-- are accurate.  But he imagines no real complexity for them.  Both women are extraordinarily passive in most ways.  The men in the book occupy far less time but manage to seem more human.  Compare and contrast JANE EYRE:  on the surface a rather prim, direct governess-- but as Bronte writes her, she has a passionate, vibrant beating heart.  In Bennett's world, women don't particularly long for sex nor care about it, nor think much about attachment at all.   I think it's very telling that Bennett was inspired by the sight of an older woman in a restaurant.  It was not a woman he knew, but a woman he saw.  He imagined everything else about her.  If the time and place is enough to draw you in, then this book certainly does have that, as the 600-something pages sprawl about 50 years.  But if you like a good narrative, apart from "people get older," look elsewhere.  The writing is very good, but although Bennett's often compared to Balzac and Zola, he lacks their punch-- and I also think, essentially lacks their heart 
 I was pretty disappointed with this book. Aimed at the complete novice looking to venture in to portraits for the first time, the information and is basic and uninspiring. 
 I wish I could give Ms. Anderson a more favorable review as I am an avid long time student of metaphysical principles and was really looking forward to reading this book - I liked the catchy title.  However, I must admit that I really didn't find any new breakthroughs here or new suggestions to improve my 'field playing' skills.  I also didn't particularly care for the constant references to Ms. Anderson's career - I would have liked to hear more examples of other 'players'.  Although this is simply my personal perception, Ms. Anderson's style makes her come across as rather self-absorbed when it comes to her 'abilities'.  This book will most likely not become part of my permanent collection on quantum physiscs and the art of manifestation.  I will stick with the classics instead - James Allan, Neville, Abraham-Hicks, Grabhorn, Goldsmith, Dyer, Hawkins, F.A. Wolf.      
 Sure, it's steamy, and the leads are sexy, but we never really get a chance to know or care about them, so their bad choices and struggle to get together just never seems to matter.  In fact it was a little boring.  Plus, what language are these folks speaking?  I know it's English, but it might as well be French.  The supporting cast is universally nasty, selfish, uninteresting, and unlovable.    Not much to like here.  Avoid this unless you have a thing for bloody fights, of which there are a couple 
 Ruby and the Rails framework (Ruby on Rails) have gotten major attention in the past year, primarily as an alternative to the complexities of using Java and J2EE APIs for typical N-tiered web applications using a Model / View / Controller framework.  "Programming Ruby" is supposed to be a combination of primer and reference for the Ruby language.  Compared to some of the "classics" in programming such as "Programming PERL" (Larry Wall), "The C Programming Language" (Kernigan & Ritchie) or "The C++ Programming Languate" (Stroustrup), this book falls way short as both a primer or reference.  First of all, if you're interested in Ruby at this point, you're probably interested in using the Rails framework built using Ruby.  This book provides NO information about Rails at all.  This isn't a fault of this book, it's just something you need to know because many code examples you'll find on the web aren't "Ruby" examples per se, they are examples of using APIs within the Rails framework.  Another book by this author is due out shortly covering Rails but based on the organization of this book, I would browse it in a bookstore before buying.  I've learned multiple programming langues over the years (Pascal, C, C++, a bit of Assembler, UNIX shell, PERL, Java) and I think most programmers expect any book on a programming language to tackle the material in the following order:  * installing the language * running or compiling a basic program * data types for the language * variables, assignment and data structures / objects * conditional expressions / control structures * unit / module organization for source code * advanced class / object concepts * standard libraries for DB, network, security functions, etc.  As another reviewer stated, this book doesn't explain the Ruby language's use of symbols (:somesymbol) until page 323, even though it would be logical to explain symbols at the same time Ruby's hash type is explained.  The difference between thisvariable, @thisvariable and @@thisvariable is explained very early but seems out of context because the scope of these variable types isn't clarified until the reference section.  I think most experienced programmers will find the sequencing of chapters in this book confusing.  You can definitely learn key aspects of Ruby from this book but this will definitely not be the only book you'll want or need if you are learning Ruby to use Rails.  Rails itself definitely shows some promise for simplifying some aspects of web development but I presume it will take another 2 years or so for the framework to stabilize and useful documentation to emerge.  It definitely isn't clear from this book how Ruby as an underlying language for the Rails framework was a better or needed choice over implementing something like Rails with PHP or PERL that have already achieved wide familiarity 
 I found this book to bring up some potentially interesting points, but it failed overall by overlooking other major counter-arguments. It is certainly controversial and will evoke strong opinions either way. I happened to be on the annoyed side 
 I may not be an expert on steel drums, but I do listen to Jimmy Buffett a lot! He has a great steel drum drummer. After listening to this cd, I gave it away in a white elephant gift exchange this past Xmas 
 OK, 72 pages of cliff notes for a 144 page book?  That is absurd!  Night is a classic work, filled with vivid metaphor and intensely emotional characters.  You could get a third of the way through it in the time it would take to BUY the cliff notes 
 First I got this book because it was suggest that I buy it because I brought "Heavy Weather" and I thought okay I bite for it. Boy, I was wrong with this novel, totally borring and so borring that I couldn't get past the first 20 pages of the novel.   Another thing that I didn't like about how John Barnes writes is the fact that his chapters are extremely long, he dose not break up like the rest of other authors do. 
 Frequent with biographies, the subjects by nature or design overshadow their conveyance, the lives greater than the telling. With Alex Kershaw's handling of London, the disjunctive telling of the life seems to overshadow the greatness of the subject. Kershaw provides documented anecdotal events in London's life, but these episodes are weakly connected, seemingly the paragraphs lack smooth continuity, making the reading of some sections an effort to connect the sequence of events a muddled mess. In a section of Chapter 4, "The Boy Socialist," Kershaw describes London's burn-out from cramming for entrance-exams for Berkeley, his passing with distinction, his fleeing the world by setting sail, his re-course to moor, his impulse to get drunk on shore, and then his arrival "at Berkeley in autumn 1896, in high spirits" (46-47). THEN, we're offered an ancedote about London's comeuppance in a boxing ring, a recollection by a contemporary about his attire, followed by the philosophical influence of Herbert Spencer's book (48).  Kershaw's neglect of the biographer's role (and duty) to segue events, providing coherence and significance in the synthesizing of complex elemental parts to a life whole, distracts me from the subject. Yet I expect all biographies to be as great in the telling as their subjects, like Johnson's Boswell or Wolfe's Donald or Joyce and Wilde's Ellman or Genet's White. Kershaw does indeed emerge as a singular teller of a great life, and his telling is marked by fleeting absurdities involving subtly recurring images of human mastication and digestion: "Bite as he did, Jack did not fully digest the philosophies.  He chose only that which tasted good, and then wolfed [sic] it down.  The tastiest morsel . . . ." (48).  Unfortunately, I was stuck with the tab, and here's my tip 
 This book reads like a graduate thesis. It manages to bury interesting ideas with overly drawn out explanations and arguments. Each chapter should be pared down to a third of its length, but I recommend not finding out for yourself; spend your money elsewhere 
 The alternate title for the film Bolero (1984) is Bolero: An Adventure in Ecstasy...after watching the film last night a better one might have been Bolero:  An Adventure in Stupidity...written and directed by the late John Derek (Tarzan, the Ape Man), the film starred his most current wife at the time Bo Derek (10, Tarzan, the Ape Man).  Also appearing is George `Anything for a Buck' Kennedy (The Dirty Dozen, Cool Hand Luke), Andrea Occhipinti (Conquest), Ana Obregón (Monster Island), and Olivia d'Abo (Conan the Destroyer, "The Wonder Years"), in one of her first roles.  Bo Derek plays Ayre `Mac' MacGillivery, a woman who (get this) is preparing to graduate from an English college and once she does, she'll trade in her diploma for a vast inheritance.  Once that happens she plans to travel the world and learn the ways of love because, as you see, she's still a virgin.  Okay, wait a minute...Bo's pushing thirty and she's just graduating from college?  I can buy off on that, but I'm having a much harder time with the notion she's untouched, I mean seriously...anyway, after seeing one too many Valentino films (the film is supposed to be a period piece, set in the early 20th century I guess), Mac hits the road with her trusty chauffeur Cotton (Kennedy) and college friend Catalina aka `Cat' (Obregón), the trio heading towards the Middle East as Mac thinks it would be the ginchiest to get bagged by a real, honest to goodness sheik.  After a failed attempt (the sheik got stoned on magic smoke and passed out, but not before covering a nekkid Derek in warm honey), Mac, with entourage in tow, makes her way to Spain with the intent on hooking up with a handsome matador, and she finds one named Angel (Occhipinti), who, when not faux fighting bulls or shagging fourteen year old gypsy girls produces wine, and lots of it.  With the help of Angel's tagalong gypsy girl named Paloma, played by Ms. d'Abo sporting a ridiculous Spanish accent, Mac worms her way into Angel's bed after agreeing to use her vast fortunes to buy his wine, the deal sealed with a good shagging (I find Spanish business negotiations quite agreeable).  Following this there's some more idiocy, capped off by Angel getting his doodle gored by a bull, and now unable to perform, much to Mac's dismay (no more zoom zoom in the boom boom).  So anyway, while Cat's getting friendly with Mac's kilted Scottish lawyer and Cotton gets his groove on with Angel's sassy cook, Mac tries to draw Angel from his depressed funk in the hopes she'll be able to cure his condition by prancing around his room nekkid.  When not sadistically teasing a man who can't perform, Mac begins taking up bullfighting for some odd reason or another.    Okay, I first saw this film back in the mid 1980s on cable I was in the hormonally charged state of a teenager coming into his own, so my main focus was obviously on Derek's nekkidness, of which there's quite a bit.  After watching this film again some twenty years later, I find I still enjoy the nekkidness, but I have to say the rest is probably one of the more ridiculous efforts I've seen in a long time.  I think the intent was to create a rich, erotic drama, but the film fails miserably mainly for the fact Bo Derek cannot act, at least not enough to carry a film.  She's certainly attractive, but her ditz factor is incredibly high, not helped any by her husband's completely rotten and moronic scripting (the film comes off like a poorly written Harlequin romance novel).  Speaking of her husband, how creepy is that, knowing he wrote and directed the film, especially given the sequences where his wife is getting it on with other guys (he filmed her in some equally steamy sequences in the 1981 moron-a-thon Tarzan, the Ape Man)?  The man was pushing sixty at the time (while Bo wasn't quite yet thirty), so the maybe wedding tackle didn't function the way it used to which resulted in his willingness to let his wife dally about on screen with other men (a couple of the intimate sequences looked pretty realistic)...I don't know, but whatever...a good part of the story has Bo's character talking about her virginity like it was some sort of gift she was willing to impart, which, after awhile, got really old (at least she didn't refer to it as her `flower, but she did refer to it as `her fruit' at one point), which ends, mercifully, after she gets her shag on with Angel.  As far as the rest of the cast they didn't fare much better.  George Kennedy seemed kind of lost, hanging about to pick up a check and see some nekkid broads I suppose, and Olivia d'Abo appeared simple-minded as the young gypsy girl stuck on Angel (eventually she gives way to Mac as she realized she couldn't compete).  One of the biggest mysteries for me, besides the actual point of the film, is why it ran an hour and forty-five minutes.  Once you get by the juicy stuff (the attractive people being a nekkid), the rest just drags under the unbearable weight of its' own harebrained idiocy.  Perhaps the funniest scene in the film comes near the end, as Mac and Angel are getting it on (seems Mac's desirability is such that it can cure a broken doodle) and they're transported to, get this, a smoke-filled plane of reality.  Right in the middle of their routine a large, purple neon sign appears behind them spelling out the word EXTASY, as if to really bring it home (yeah, I know it's spelled wrong but that's how it was in the film, intentionally so).  All in all if you're looking to see Ms. Derek in the raw, then this film is right up you alley as she's got about five or six scenes, but if you're looking for anything remotely resembling an actual movie (plot, interesting and engaging characters, etc.), best to keep on looking.    The picture on this DVD, presented in widescreen (1.85:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, does looks clean and clear, and the Dolby Digital Stereo Surround audio comes through well.  As far as extras there isn't much except for a theatrical trailer and subtitles in English, French, and Spanish.  Cookieman108  By the way, did I mention how creepy (and skeevy) I found it for a man to write and direct a film featuring his really hot wife enjoying the pleasures of other men?  Maybe he took some weird sense of pride in showing the world how, even at his age, he could still get with really attractive women... 
 After reading Chris Gore's disappointing and disheveled The 50 Greatest Movies Never Made (see CdC #10), I had nothing but high hopes that David Hughes would be able to overcome the hurdles which tripped up Gore's earlier work, especially by limiting his scope to one genre rather than all of cinema. Alas, while Hughes's work is head and shoulders above Gore's, it remains lacking.  Fans of Cashiers du Cinemart's articles such as "The Metamorphoses of ALIEN III" (CdC #12), or "They Tried and Failed" (CdC #13), might be tempted to pick up a copy of Hughes's book as he covers similar ground in two of his nineteen chapters. Too often, however, I found myself consternated by Hughes's muddled writing. Additionally, the more I read, the more I doubted the validity of Hughes's research.  Several devilish details stuck in my craw and wouldn't let me appreciate Hughes's work. In the first chapter Hughes states that the protagonist of Richard Stark's novels is Walker, not Parker, mixing up the Stark novels with the Boorman film, POINT BLANK. An innocent mistake, yes, but an easily avoidable one. Meanwhile, I'm no expert at science fiction but even I know that the title for the unproduced WATCH THE SKIES is a nod to Howard Howard Hawks's THE THING rather than Don Siegel's INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS.  Oddly, several of the films that Hughes covers have been made, albeit not in their original form. Perhaps the originals may have ranked among the "greatest" sci-fi films never made, I remain unconvinced. Too often Hughes merely reports on the back story to the production of films such as ALIEN III, ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU, SUPERNOVA, et cetera rather than demonstrating how great their initial incarnations might have been.   Here's hoping that the next project someone does about unmade movies will either focus on truly great works or that they'll rethink their title 
 This book has some truth to it, however the reasoning for the truth is poor.  Debi Pearl takes scripture out of context! (ex. pg 110)  When she inserts her opinion, which is often, she is harsh, unloving and often just gives bad advice.  It is unfortunate because there is truth to biblical submission and  I would reccommed books from Susan Hunt, Martha Peace, Leslie Vernick, Douglas Wilson, John Piper, Wayne Grudem and Bryan Chappell instead.  Avoid this one.  
 I too had this book for a college 19th century art course. Most of the movements were not new to me and I dearly love most art of the period. But for anyone new to it this will be an incredibly boring read, too much bogged down in marxism and political correctness. Eisenman; a self-professed "Marxist-Art Historian" seems unable to speak of any movement without making it into classs warfare or accusing artists of being sexist or rascist, while completely ingnoring the historical context. As with many art history surveys Eisenman also suffers the delusion that there is something inherently wrong with academic art and that the only worthwhile art of the 19th century was made in France 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
  This book was a gift for a friend who reported "Good writing style. Rough content. Sometimes hard to take. Depressing." so I decided not to read it 
 I found this book disgusting in more ways than one. Is Ms. Klum really targeting women who feel they need to re-vamp their bodies, images, sex lives, etc? In other words, the average, moderately insecure woman? Wow, it really makes me feel special to see PAGES AND PAGES--even the inside of the front and back sections--filled with images of an airbrushed, overworked Heidi Klum. How can anyone aspire to that virtually unreachable level (as if Ms. Klum is anyone special without her makeup artist and hair colorist)? Certainly not someone who is taking the time to read this book. If you're in the mood for getting your ego stomped on or for seeing Ms. Klum in a book riddled with soft porn, shovel up the eighteen bucks and ENJOY 
 I did not read the prior reviews, I bought this item & loaded the software that came with it in the sealed box from Target.com.   The MFG SOFTWARE disc contains TWO VIRUSES one in Quicktime & the other in Totally Hip files.  Target has been notified that the software is CORUPT with viruses & that the MFG has gone out of business.  This item is only useful as a drawing tablet thru other software programs like paint shop pro as there is no WEB SITE ACCESS or tech support available for this item 
 This book was immensly boring. I feel utterly stupid for having wasted my time reading this blithering mass of mindless jargon. This mystery did NOT keep me on the edge of my seat like it should have. The characters were poorly described and muh! What a waste! I'm just sorry that I couldn't choose to give negative stars 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 Jerry, si estas leyendo esto: Creo que todos estamos de acuerdo en decir que eres un cantante excepcional. Te queremos mucho!!!  Pero queremos que vuelvas a cantar salsa, como la del tiempo de "Cuenta Conmigo", "Cara de Nino", y "Magia"...  No te dejes influenciar por la musica que esta de moda hoy, el reggaeton no te va!!! No me malinterpretes: hasta tu disco "Vuela muy alto" me encanto, pero creo que ahora es tiempo de volver a la musica que mejor te queda. Seguire escuchando tus discos de salsa anteriores hasta que vuelvas a sacar uno nuevo.  Vamos, por favor, te lo rogamos!!! Te quiere tu fan DJ LOLA, desde Montreal, Canada 
 Sean Hannity's rise to fame proves that an ignorant illiterate can rise well beyond the level of incompetence in this country, especially when their audience consists of like-minded organ banks.  Hannity is stupid, hypocritical and loud.  His sole redeeming quality is as a mechanism for carbon-oxygen exchange.  Hannity is well-coiffed, well dressed  and well short of thorazine on his overhyped comedy duo called the Hannity and Combs report.  This bozo is so uptight he must wear a chastity belt 2 sizes too small.  Get a real job, you poser 
 This book was not covered in details for almost very subject in import and export.  Some examples are complete mismatched with the text.  It is over rated by other reviewer.  I learned about import/export from the US custom web site and the internet more than the content of this book.  It is not worth the money or time to read.   
 I usually like Tami Hoag's books, she is a story teller with a surprising twist. The twist was there this time also. However,the characters were way too predictable. They all seemed on the dark side, even the "heroes." Surely there has got to be a non-divorced person in this world. Not in her book. Well, unless you are the guy who kills people because they're in the way. Then you can be single and never married.  The bad guys had no redemptive features -- too cartoon-like.   And the unnecessarily bad language was a turn-off. Surely even in cop land not every one uses the f... word in every sentence.  The plot was somewhat interesting but felt undeveloped, kind of like the characters.  Of course tastes differ. I like a bit more psychological depth with my murders than Tami Hoag offers in this story. Maybe next time 
 I've bought all the fertility books because my husband and I have struggled with infertility for three years. This book may have a different title but its just as academic and techy as all his others.  The best IVF book I've found so far is "What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant" by Daniel Potter and Jennifer Hanin.   Potter is an RE like Silber but has a way with words and his book conveys all the human emotions and trials and tribulations that infertile couples experience and even offers sound advice dealing with them. Silber's book falls short.  If you need to get pregnant and want a book that has ALL the answers don't waste your time on this medical mumbo jumbo. Silber may be a good surgeon but he's not a writer 
 What the hell is this??? Why does Paris Hilton have her picture covered on DVD??? She only been played in the movie for a very short time I would say within like 10 to 15 minutes tops and that was it!!! I am very very disappointed with Paris Hilton!!! This movie isnt real I mean I like to watch horror movies that has some real actions and real killers and such ok what I mean is when Paris Hilton lay her front on the bathroom floor and there was NO blood on her back but just in front of her body but we can't see what it looks like... come on lets be real here!!! I am into horror movies and this movie is like "fake horror" movie I have ever seen!!! House Of Wax that Paris Hilton played in it has some REAL action the wax guy threw a long brown wood stick right through to Paris Hilton's head and it looks real but still I know it was just a movie but my point is fake and real horror movies!! But this one isnt real at all!! I want to see some real actions. I know theres something wrong and I see what reall wrong with this movie they are hiding something and there are alot of missing from this movie!! I honestly think Paris Hilton wanted to play in the movie for a very short time just because she really doesnt want to play the whole time movie so she could make ALOT of money or what??? I just dont know but all I know this movie is not right and something is missing and it's not making sense to me at all honestly. And someone took a picture of Paris Hilton on DVD cover??? OMG!!! What the hell is this??? I thought Paris Hilton would be able to play the whole time in the movie but I thought W-R-O-N-G!!! This is not worth it honestly!!! If you want something real get House Of Wax instead of this one!! 
 I dunno, just don't get the hype about this band. Yea, they sound a bit like Zeppelin and Purple mixed with the White Stripes, but the songs are boring and repetitive and the lyrices are terrible! It just sounds like obvious 'hipster' ironic plundering to me. If you want to hear this stuff done right, then listen to Zep or the White Stripes. If you want to hear some new bands doing 'retro' type stuff, try The Sword or Priestess, both of whom blow Wolfmother away. Way overrated, don't believe the hype 
 Well iv read through a few reviews now, some good, some totaly wierd and none understanding, some dont know what they'v even on about but i read the review by G FUNKINN which i think is 3rd down. im a huge tupac fan and will defend his reputation if anyone dare try portray him as something other then a true hip-hop legend.  i was realy looking forward to writing this review about this great album as it's easly one of my best if not my best, but i was so shocked to see some write such a detailed review on this album (someone love's this album as much as me) G FUNKINN you'v done a brilliant job on reviewing this album and made me want to buy another copy incase anything happened to the one iv got.. .. ..   i'd just like to add what the story line of the best song on the album "tear drops and closed caskets"   the song is so well writen when listening to it your mind fallows the song and make you feel like your reading a book due to the way the songs writen, after its finished it makes you feel like after you have just watched a realy good film and you get that feeling inside that make you feel like what you'v just watch is actualy one of your own memories ( not mean that you have had happen to you what the songs lyrics are about but more that it's such a graphic song) the rhyming of the word is nearly unbelievable. you do tend to hear the same thing been rhymed alot in songs ie: im a G from CPT and other things that ryhme with G or E, but not in this song  the song start's by intruducing the 3 mean characters which are two friends called little moe and little trigga and a woman called little precious. it tells you how prcious is a getto girl and wont even bother with you unless you have a nice car and money, litle trigga's heart broken by the fact he's got no money and he want precious to be with him. so he meets up with his best friend little moe and plot to kill the two neibourgh hood deals and steal there drugs and money. they complete there mission and little trigga is seen as a big time man of the getto.  in the second vurse it goes on to tell you how precious and trigga are together and have a baby on the way but little known to trigga but his best friend lil moe has been seeing precious and it would apear that them two are togeher, after people see both precious and moe together start talking and trigga finds out.   3rd vurse goes on to say that now moe and trig are now enemys and precious is to doped up on drugs not to notice, the song ends with the lyrics. " small time dealing to selling keys, i cant believe the sh** there telling me, they opened fire 3 bodys dropped so call the cops, precious little moe and trig, tear drops and closed caskets".   the way the stories is told  is as if tupac and the outlaws are rapping to each other about the stories as if it happened and they had heard about it.      In the other views people have said that the outlawz have spoiled this album but i strongly disacree with these comment. the outlawz when i first heard this album i felt the same way and thought the outlawz maded this album not as good as it could of been but after a few years of owning the album you start too realise what the outlawz are saying, too the commen listener poeple do tend to get hook up in the beat and with tupac been on the album alot of people only start properly listening when pac starts speaking.      after owning the album for some time i started to notice the outlawz and although there lyrics can be spitted out in a fast and sometimes non-understandible style people dont actualy hear the words, if you do buy this album please dont just listen to pacs word but also listen to the outlawz because true listeners with a good ear for proper hiphop will notice the talent and lyricial skill of the outlawz and infact in a few song i find that they are very much on the same level as pac.  what more can i say. if you dont buy the album please down load the song tear dropz and close caskets  i actualy rate this 5 stars im not sure why it's only put a 1 star rating? ? ?   
 I have read this book more than halfway now and have seen MANY inaccuracies in it.  People who think this book is informative are so uninformed.  There is so much proof of what did and didn't happen on 9-11 there should be no question now and this book does not have the facts 
 To begin, I am relieved that neither Spike nor Joie are in front of the camera like usual. I will give him one star for his creativity. He always brings that to the movie. I will give him the other star for tackling such strong content. Another character in his favor. However, he  loses me with the whole flow of the  movie. It seemed to be "cut and pasted" . It doesn't settle down into a story line. The editing is chaotic, the thought pattern is muddled. So there's no chance to really indentify with or connect with the character as with the other movies. As a result, it made the film hard to follow and just a screen full of Spike Lee going wild. This was far below of that he is capable of.  This seemed to be a rushed project with issues that could have made two good projects versus one confusing one.The only redeeming quality comes from the alluding in my opening statement, the fact that Spike himself wasn't in front of the camera 
 I could only read an hour of this. I always hate doing this to my own brethren but I can't recomend this book 
 OK, I'm a SciFi fan.  I read the SciFi reviews and thought this was really a movie for me, and it really was good right up to the end.  Just one problem, they forgot to write the end.  What happened?  Did they run out of money?  Did the writer write himself into a corner?  There was no climax, conclusion, or resolution.  You can argue till you are blue in the face about "pan & scan."  I prefer movies with an ending.  If you are looking for a great unfinished story, this one is for you 
 This book was as much the author's opinion and imagination as anything else. He makes claims that are not substiantiated by facts, biblical or otherwise. I will not purchase further books by this author 
 This book is an example of an anti-intellectual propaganda movement born inside Israel that aims to disprove the existance of palestinians.  The idea behind works of this sort is that if the claims of Palestinians to the land they live on can be weakened, unthinkable measures such as mass deportations will become possible.  The book starts with an argument that what is now Israel was empty land before european jews started to arrive in the mid 1800s.  That every census and every bit of historical data invalidates that absurd idea does not bother the author in the least.  The same old story is repeated:  There were no palestinians.  Almost all arabs in what is now Israel are claimed to be savage migrants from surrounding countries who were drawn to the great european civilization brought into palestine by the early zionists.  He draws greatly on the universally discredited work "from time Immemorial" by peters in support of his case.  As usual, anti-arab european sources are quoted to show how what is today Israel was a wasteland.  The problem with how those sources are used is that they could be used to draw the same conclusion about every other country in the middle east.  Europeans saw every country outside europe as savage uneconomic wastelands in that colonial era.  The writer fails to make the case that Palestine was especially different.  The worst problem the book faces is that none of the census data validates its claims.  The census data shows a consistantly increasing native palestinian population.  Peters' work was demolished years ago.  Neither the British Archives nor any other source confirms any of the outragous claims made.  The book then moves on to the 1948 war.  It makes the rather incredible claim that the all the palestinian refugees were not refugees at all.  They all voluntarily decided to leave their towns!  The war didn't matter.  Civilian massacres didn't matter.  They all just decided to leave.  When looking for a reason, the best Avneri can come up with is that they all deserted their homes as part of the sinister arab conspiracy(tm).  They left their homes and became refugees so the arab armies could better destroy Israel.  Further, they were all expecting to share in some sort of loot after the war was won so their homes didn't matter to them.  It makes no sense to anyone outside the close world of the Israeli right.   The book might find use as a doorstop, but aside from that its of no value to anyone.  Those who agree with its ideas will learn nothing new, at best it can provide reinforcement to a closed mind.    Anyone else is going to see through to the political agenda of the author and the false nature of the work.  Beyond that, the reality in Israel today is a palestinian population in the occupied territories mostly born long after 1948.  The so-called right of return can be solved easily.....the solution is called American Cash.  The irony is that the so-called right of return for Palestinians could have been settled by the americans for an amount of money far less than what they have spent so far civilizing Iraq.  
 Contrary to popular opinion on this website, I found this book to be boring, repetitive and badly written. It was so boring I struggled to finish it during a journey where I had little else to do. This book summarizes a few events that were significant to Intel and offers advice on how similar business changes should be handled. Being an engineer, and not a manager, I found this to be vague and rambling. However I do agree with the book's title - Only the Paranoid survive. I think this outlook is useful for everyone, and not just business types 
 As a PhD student studying the sociology of science I found Merton's work  to be awful.  He takes for granted the stated the ideology of science  without delving into how actual practice differs from that ideology. He  leaves scientific knowledge outside the realm of sociological understanding  and treats those who approach science with a critical eye as  anti-intellectual.  For those interested in the historical development of  the sociology of science, probably a must read.  For those who actually  want to investigate that field, a book to avoid 
  From a guy's perspective it was boring but from a reader's perspective it was an Ok book. Im not that much of a fan about the Newberry books i just read all kinds of books. i really don't care what kinds of books I read. 
 The first sentence in the book is "People who aren't autistic always ask me about the moment I realized I could understand the way animals think."  It should have been "People who aren't autistic always ask me about the moment I SOMEHOW GOT THE NOTON THAT I could understand the way animals think." There's no proof in this book, no good evidence, just Ms. Grandin's anecdotes and speculations.   Noticing a lot of detail because you have autism and being able to use this ability to design humane slaughterhouses does not translate into thinking like animals think.  The book does offer many clear, simple descriptions of scientists' research. So if you don't know anything about animal research, these descriptions could be a good place to start. 
 Pros: the book does contain some useful information.  Cons: authors are dishonest. They intentionally hide some of the side effects of the drugs. Examples: fipexide has been linked to liver damage - the book says nothing, piracetam does have withdrawal symptoms - the book says the opposite, caffeine improves short term memory - the books says that there were "studies" that showed the opposite. I see the message: buy our "safe" drugs and stop drinking "very dangerous" coffee.  BEFORE YOU BUY ANYTHING IN THIS BOOK, THOROUGHLY RESEARCH THE DRUG ON YOUR OWN.  No wonder Ward Dean is now spending 7 year jail term for taxes evasion 
 The first album was very good. 2nd album ripped my heart out. One of the best bands of the last couple of decades. Drops of Jupiter got me thru some rough times. 3rd album was pretty good also but I could tell some changes were coming. In the meantime some very key and important members left the band and with them some of the things that defined the Train I had grown to love...left with them. This fourth album is a sore dissappointment. Pat's ego clearly isn't enough to carry this formation of Train. He is  very talented but IMHO he was only one piece of the puzzle. Now , thanks to him..the  other pieces are gone. They should form a new band and leave the name Train to live on  in our memories of what it used to be 
 I really wish I had listened to the reviews before I had bought this, I thought it was the most unhelpful piece of absolute junk I have ever bought in my life. It was uninformative and had nothing I needed, I need to find a dropshipper for computer hardware, can anyone recommend anywhere,  and if anyone is looking for such a drop-shipper, don't buy this boo 
 I bought this game for my 11.5 year old daughter and she was not thrilled with it.  She played it once or twice and was bored with it.  It is not a good game if you want a toy your child will love 
 The package arrived 12 days after placing the order and the tamper was tossed loose in the box without any packaging.  There is no way to track the package.  In fairness to the company, the tamper is of high quality and was not damaged in transit.  Overall, while I am very pleased with my purchase, I tend to expect more from an on line merchant than what was delivered 
 I agree this is not up to par with Joe's best stuff from the 60s and early 70s, but given that, they even left off his best song from this period, "Love Is Alive."  That song really ROCKS and it is not here.  Shame 
 I DONT WONT TO DOWNLOAD IT I WONT IT ALL ON DVD THIS IS WASTE MONE 
 As an experienced knitter (35 years+) this book should be just right for me but I was very disappointed. The graphics and print are very hard to read. Schematics are very tiny. I'm not interested in a life philosophy of knitting, but in cables. Yarns are mainly Canadian so lack of more information on yarns needed and gauge is critical and lacking.Gauge is given over the cable pattern instead.  If I knit anything here, I would have to redesign each one first. Why knit the scarf in two halves? No explanation given. One sweater uses I-cord at the bottom but no advice on how to knit without those i-cords. Best projects are for little kids. Not recommended. Buy the new Szabo book instead. 
 The ESV is a generally a decent translation. However, when it comes to the physical product, it falls to the bottom of the heap. Perhaps it can take a lesson in the printing and binding area from all its "rivals".    Crossway claims to seek a decent pricing strategy but is it when you survey the entire field... it is another story.  This is not an isolated incident because I had purchased 4 variants of its offerings -   the premium leather, the hardcover pew edition, its bonded leather and  its Classic Thinline Editions  Each one of them far short of the competition in the generalized categories in binding, print quality and paper quality.  On a side note, I have not physically handled the ones printed over in the UK by HarperCollins noting from the scanned samples I received from a couple of friends, they are using the same printing plates for the EU market.   HarperCollins (which owns Zondervan) perhaps may deliver differently in the paper and binding quality but then, this is a let down for the folks out here in the US unless we pursue the Anglicized version of the ESV with a higher imported price.   Because of this, I rank it 2 stars for its dismal print/paper/binding quality. (Harsh but honest observation - It reminded me of the special edition low priced textbook program by the large publishing houses to help low income folks (Indian Edition is one such example). This is not a disparaging comment on the low price book program - that program is is a wonderful effort by some nicer publishing houses to help the needy students in the realm of education! 
 If Bell left out any cliches I would be surprised. From terrible dialog, laughable stereotyping of characters, ridiculous plot with an unlikely (to say the least) coincidence, to one of the most (unintentionally) comic finales this book has it all.    
 It's difficult to understand how Ms. McEwan, who so perfectly personified Lucia in the Mapp & Lucia series, could be so mis-directed as Jane Marple. It would help if her prevelent expression were not a simpering smile with always a twinkle in her eye. Miss Marple believed in Evil, and as portrayed by Joan Hickson in the 1980s BBC series this was never in doubt, and that series stands head and shoulders above the new offering. Take a comparative look at the old and new versions of 'The 4:50 From Paddington' and note the new version's salient characterstics are glitz, a dumbed-down story line, and modern actors in historical drag. It's ENTERTAINMENT but it isn't Miss Marple. Go for the gold, buy the old 
 I'm amazed that this book is for MBA level students!  I am currently an undergraduate student and have the opportunity to use this textbook for a finance class and find this book very vague on termology and not very helpful when it comes to difficult concepts.  Anyone with basic knowledge of business can understand the book so that's why it amazes me that this book is used for MBA's 
  Well.... I'm less than impressed.I expected a reader's journey through a year of books and instead got an unwanted journey through a random collection of personal anecdotes about the author's husband, child, mother, baseball, writer friends, etc.  The fact that she made some glaring mistakes in the book was also fairly annoying. Specifically, she says Emma Donoghue's first novel was Slammerkin.... it wasn't. On the same page she says that Margaret Atwood's Alias Grace was based on the same crime.... it wasn't. I almost stopped at that point but the one reedeeming feature of the book is that it's short. 
 Ya. it had a pretty naked chick in it. but man it was booooring. definitely one for a very specialised marke 
 she is one of the great portrait photographers.  her work is intelligent and her images approach iconic in status.  that said, this book is not what you want to see.  it is primarily about her private life and the photos just are not interesting unless perhaps you're her cousin or something.  any of her other books blow this one away and wll contain the amazing work you associate with her name.  this should have been entitled: "300 boring pictures of susan sontag".  should be remaindered in a couple of months.  save your money 
 I'm a great fan of all kinds of comedy, but this is incredibly amateurish and boring. Unfunny sketches that go on and on, completely unfunny. If you pay the postage, you can have my VHS copy for no extra charge. Otherwise I'll just throw it away.  Awful 
 I would like to clear up some confusion regarding the use of the terms "illusion" and "delusion," which Freud himself distinguishes early in this book.  A "delusion" is something that is believed that is not true.  An "illusion" is something that might be true or false, but that is believed because we want to believe it. Religion is then regarded as the fullfillment of infantile wishes, implying that it is something we outgrow.  But Freud has admitted by his choice of terminology that religion might be true.  As to the question of Freud's atheism, the book cites, as I recall, evidence of both a Protestant pastor, and admirer of Freud, who considered him an atheist and a relative who said whatever else he was, he was not an atheist.  Freud does not attempt to resolve that difference, as he so easily could have. I know of no evidence anywhere in Freud's writings that he ever committed himself to atheism, at least, if "atheism" is defined as denying the existence of God.  (Broader definitions are possible.)  I conclude that Freud's underlying disposition is not so much atheistic as irreligious.  I say "underlying disposition," but I could just as well say  "bias" or "prejudice."  Now let us consider what that disposition, which never is proven, but which is clearly manifested, implies.  Since no justification is offered in any rational manner, we must look for a pattern in what is said.  A rubric that covers not only everything in this book, but perhaps everything he wrote, is "illusion."  Perhaps that was Freud's Freudian sloppy slip.  For his irrational bias against religion can easily be explained as an infantile wish that religion, by which he would have probably thought of the Jewish faith and the Christian faith as they were represented in Vienna at the time, were not true.  He didn't want them to be true.    A further consideration is that in this book Freud gives no evidence whatsoever of having investigated,  or even being familiar with, the evidence and the reasoning of those who defend their own religious belief or the demonstrable proclivity of the human race to believe and practice or feel guilty about their failure to practice, some religion.  In this he is just an intellectual of his time, a time dominated by materialistic determinism in the name of science.  I agree with those who regard Freud as a great writer.  His prose carries the reader right along, until the absurdity of the ideas makes you want to throw up.  I first read Freud at the age of 22, ploughing my way through "The Interpretation of Dreams."  Even then I could see that he was subjecting all his empirical, i.e. clinical, evidence into the framework of a system of subjective categories, which at the very least were dubious.    Freud's scientific pretensions were an attempt, unconscious perhaps, to give prestige to his new ideas.  At the time science was riding high.  Marx, also, for instance, regarded his ideas as scientific.  And I do not mean to imply that Freud was not a good observer, nor that he was dishonest, just deluded by his illusions.  He founded a very influential cult, that has lasted until our own day, although it has never gained anything resembling general scientific acceptance.  Several of his earliest colleagues broke with him, the most important being Jung and Adler.  That is typical of cults, which cannot bear the weight of more than one dominant personality 
 this cd sucks. they have turned more and more commercial as time goes by. don't get me wrong, i love the unseen, but this album and anything after it sucks by them. get their early stuff. they sound like anti-flag here except different vocals. it sucks 
 First published in 1941, Arthur Hobson Quinn's critically acclaimed Edgar Allan Poe: A Critical Biography is a dry, strictly academic work which presents its readership with over 700 dense pages containing thousands of thoroughly researched 'hard' facts concerning the life of one of America's greatest literary figures, but which completely neglects to create a vibrant, three-dimensional, shadow-casting portrait of the writer himself.   Throughout the volume, its human subject remains little more than a blank, three-letter sieve endlessly referred to as "Poe": "Poe lived up to his standard...", "Poe signalized his departure from the editorial staff of...", "Poe wrote the critical notices for October and November...", "Poe did not lecture, however....", "Poe was still hearing echoes of his visits to Mrs. Whitman's home..."   The problem, of course, is that, despite the avalanche of facts, many of which are utterly superfluous, the reader comes no closer to gaining an understanding of the man behind them. "Who was Edgar Allan Poe?" is a fundamental question the text never comes close to providing a genuine answer to.     As Quinn's evaluation of Poe's prose and poetry is routinely perfunctory and unexceptional, Edgar Allan Poe: A Critical Biography is a work that few readers, with the exception of committed Poe scholars, are likely to find worthwhile or engrossing.   
 I didn't feel that this was his best work.  I liked the characters and the story line was great, but lacked in suspense until the 6th of 8 tapes.  Too much detail on mundane stuff.  Suspense picked up on Tape 6, but wasn't the same type of suspense like "PREY".  Enjoyed it, but would've liked more suspense 
 I aLso received the antenna with the brown plug that wouldn't fit my Sirius model. The ad was misleading and appears everyone is having the same issue 
 I'm a big fan of many conservative political books, and found this one lacking in both readability and humor.  I recommend instead any Ann Coulter book or especially "Useful Idiots&quot 
 I purchased this book in an attempt to improve my hill climbing, and endurance while riding.  I was highly disappointed when this book arrived on my doorstep when I started reading through it.  Don't be fooled by the exceprts you can read on Amazon, this book is meant for people who NEVER in their lives have seen the inside of a gym, or guys who have been on the Varisty Band Squad throughout High School and College, and were trying to get in shape for the prom because they were trying to bang the Football Captain's girlfriend while he was away winning the State Championships for their school.  The first few tips on the "Basics of Weight Training" chapter (consists of 30 pages) starts out with really insightful tips such as : Choosing a Facility, (Is it in a convenient location?), Is the facility clean and well laid out?,  Does it have a knowledgeable, educated staff?, What are the hours of operation?.  Well thank God the authors added these questions to my list, because I was looking for a public gym in the least convenient location, with dirty machines and idiotic employees which isn't open when I am available to work out. (Can you smell my sarcasm?, good, because I'm laying it on pretty thick)  It gets better when they show pictures of things that are very hard to figure out such as a bench, a rack of free weights, and a Weight Tree (USed to store barbell plates...I actually thought they were pedal trees, to hang my old Shimanos on))  Seriously, save your money, buy The Cyclists Traing Bible, and you will learn more about cycling fitness in the first few sentences than you will in this book... I am under the assumption that people who have taken an interest in cycling, are not the 800 pound people you see on the news ready to die of morbid obestity, who need to get the walls in their apartment buildings ripped down, and lifted off their couch by a crane with ten empty bags of Doritos resting on their bloated stomachs.  Buy another book, or just buy a Cycle Ops trainer, throw it in your basement and buy a CTS Training video.  You'll get much more out of it 
 Another mewling conservative decrying the present state of American education and calling for a return of the Greek and Latin classics. All the usual suspects are included: Bill Clinton, multiculturalism, etc. It's less a call for a return to the basics than a whining political screed and written with all the Asiatic tinsel of a Bill Buckley, who wrote the foreword and gave the book his blessing. There is much good being done in public education, and the classics are not being ignored. It's just that education--and a classical education at that--is no longer the exclusive right of a privileged caste, which is what really bothers these people 
 I purchased this cable and the pins were weak and clumsy.  I could not even plug it in and one of the pins broke.  I threw it away.  It is a piece of junk 
 This Video is VERY misleading !! I was hoping to have some fun and impress my husband with some new moves, what I got was a Cheesy Video showing me how to walk "sexy" per say and had a cheesy Porn Scene at the end! My husband watched it later on and Laughed his ass off ! If you a tomboy trying to be FeminineONLY THEN would I reccomend it for you. 
 It's quite amazing that this book is a business best-seller.  The book contains nothing new and, in fact, the 17 so-called "laws" are just overblown statements of the obvious. For example, in the Law of Significance, the author "explodes" the myth of the lone ranger by stating that "the belief that one person can do something great is a myth."  Really? In the Law of the Big Picture he says, "people who build successful teams never forget that every person on the team has a role to play and every role plays its part in contributing to the big picture."  Another insight?  I could go on. However, equally important, the book does not contain any new research or even interviews with key team leaders. The conclusions, such as they are, come from secondary sources such as the popular press and the author's personal examples, none of which seem to be based on any real business experiences.  I returned the book to Amazon 
 At best Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is just a mediocre modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones. The characterization seems like it came straight out of a 70's made for TV movies. If you have read any mysteries before the plot is paper thin, the first time the true villain makes an appearance, it is basically a "well isn't that contrite" moment. But it is a fast EASY reading novel. This book is just fine for lounging on the beach or passing the time on a cross country airline flight.   Some people take the conspiracy overtones to being anti-catholic. I think this is just nonsense but if you are sensitive to this sort of thing you might be offended by this book. Althogh, there are some kooks that think this book is about reality, instead of fiction,   A much more interesting book, in a similar venue (modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones), is Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco. Be forewarned, Eco's novel is a MUCH more challenging read but in the end is a more enjoyable novel. It is analogous to comparing cotton candy (Da Vinci Code) to a 12 course gourmet dinner (Foucault's Pendulum). Both will satisfy hunger, both are a type of food, but the popular one is something which can be consumed casually and in the end leaves you wondering if you should have made an effort to consume something that would have been more fulfilling.  
 O.K., so I'm paying $300 for a set-top box with a 40Gb hard drive, but I can't use it as a DVR? Why not? Also, the only content I can play on this set-top box is content that comes through iTunes? That's right. if it isn't in your iTunes library, you can play it on the Apple TV. This means you caqn play your DVD's, you cant't play saved DVD, iMovie, or other movie files, you can't play anything unless it has been successfully;y added to your iTunes library. Also, make sure you see the fine print about having to have a widescreen TV. they aren't joking about this. If you don't have one, you can still use this item but it will show up as a frame about half the size of your screen (it won't go to the edges and be borderless) so you have a tiny window to view inside a large black box.   Any pros? It has to be the easiest setup I have ever experienced with an electronic item. I mean less than 5 minutes and I was set. also, I thought it was really coll that with zero configuring on my part, it was able to communicate perfectly with iTunes  just because I plugged the Apple TV into my Airport Extreme router that my computer was also plugged into. basically, Apple TV saw this is a direct link. I didn't think it would be that easy without having to configure something, but it was. Also the menus are very helpful and attractive. This will be a good product down the line when this will have a larger hard drive and DVR capability. Right now it's time to sell this one on ebay and wait a few years for something better. if this had only cost me $100 or $150 I would probably keep it, however. $300 is too much for too little 
 Don't spend the extra money for this translation. Buy the Dover Thrift edition. You get the same story for a buck or two, and this translation is nothing spectacular 
 I liked this book in the end but it took me awhile to warm up to the two people in the story.  The girl was a bit of a witch at times and the guy could be a real jerk.  I thought she was kind of pushy and demanding.  He was kind of shallow.  But by the end, I did start to warm to them, but he did still continue to be a jerk.  I think it was an ok book to read, but in the end I never fully came to like either one of them.  I have read better chicklit 
 I hate writing reviews. I also hate the consumer as much as the producers of goods for the most part but right now I'm feeling sprendthrift towards humanity due to all the Yuletide cheer. This book is rubbish. Nearly all of the posthumous books released by Black Sparrow/Ecco of Buk's work are fifth-rate, fragments of his glory days of skid-row bum-dom. It's as if they scraped his cancerous boils and produced enough DNA to put his soul back to life in a maggot's body with a Frankenstein's aptitude for producing works of art. The result is echoes of echoes of a former greatness. The rawness of the famed writer is lost in complete drunkenness and scraps of poems that were never published in books because they were leftover material. Maybe that's why John Martin sold off the rights because he couldn't continue to publish a dead man's best of works for obscene sums of money. If they retitled it WORST OF THE WORST: AFTERMATHS OF GLORY Vol. 5 I might feel better about the whole thing. But as is this is vainglorious puke. 
 I bought this book not realizing it was just a condensed version of the author's book Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming.  There is nothing new here except a CD you don't need.  If you are new to ludid dreaming you want to stick to Laberge's previous work.  If you have already read that, you won't need to spend your money on this.  It's like the cliffnotes version with pretty packaging and a CD thrown in to make it sound worth the money.  It's simply not 
 she was dancing and singing her brand new song "dirrty" in a exclusive London club very badly. After she drank eight glasses of russian Vodka, then she ran away to the stage & started to stand on the table and started to sing and dance.  the alcohol impact was unfortunately too strong for Tina, that's why she laid down on stage, cause she was unable to finish her song. Her husband Jordan had slipped her away & brought her on his shoulder.....  Dirrty and Dirrty !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    
 As an avid reader of Anne Tyler's works, I found The Tin Can Tree to be a surprising letdown. Over the past year I've read eight of the fourteen books Tyler's written and had greatly enjoyed every other one.  However, I  had to force myself to finish The Tin Can Tree and was sadly disappointed  as to how much I didn't love it.  If you are a fan of Anne Tyler, read it;  maybe you will enjoy it more than I did.  If you have yet to read Anne  Tyler, don't form your opinion on this book.  I suggest reading Celestial  Navigation or Ladder of Years, two of my favorite novels of Anne Tyler's  mastery 
 It is a well-known saying that "the victors are the ones who write the history books." Starting with this book, Eduardo Galeano recounts on behalf of the vanquished. He tells the stories of the New World's conquered and downtrodden in a series of short, sheering vignettes that blaze with depth and poetic fire. But unfortunately, his version of history is extremely one-sided. His book, as well as the entire trilogy, is in short, plagued by a bad case of politically correct guilt. Unfortunately in Mr. Galeano's book, all Spaniard's are corrupt, ruthless, gold-seeking conquerers and all native inhabitants are reduced to victim status. There were a significant amount of Spanish colonial voices who were the first ones in the New World to denounce slavery and mistreatment of the natives. Regretfully, this is a very skewed version of history. History is too complex to be this one-sided. When the historian, as well as the poet,loses this complexity, his retellings lose much of their force and persuasion 
 Never received this item have inquired several times about a credit to my card and have not received a response yet 
 Somewhere along the line I realized that Weezer was actually part of the radio that I hate, instead of how they were once one of the few shining spots in the desolate wasteland otherwise known as today's FM radio stations.  The other day I was listening to the radio and a My Chemical Romance song came on and I actually suffered through it and kept it on but when Beverly Hills came on their was no such luck, I turned that radio knob to off.  Maybe it is just nostalgia for the Weezer of old that makes me find Weezer's new stuff better than some of the dregs of modern rock radio today, but seriously Weezer are pretty damn bad now.  For a long time I was in denial and looking for excuses for why Weezer turned into what they are.  In a sense I am still in denial, I pretty firmly believe that this level of suckitude displayed on Maladroit and now Make Believe is due to his decision to be celibate.  Once Rivers was a hip nerd, sexually frustrated, occassionally sad and angry, just like the majority of youth and young adults.  Now he's turned into some present day mainstream rock Gandhi, instead of not eating to save and free the people of a repressed country, Rivers chooses to give up sex in the name of something.....probably just for a few more articles in the music magazines every year.  Anyway, River's indifference towards intimate acts is not the problem, but his apparent indifference towards two mainstays of good music, decent lyrics and catchy melodies.  It's as if his attitude towards romance has carried on through the rest of his life.  That, or Rivers finally stopped being turned down by asian girls due to his overwhelming popularity and his now just ready to coast on his reputation.  Weezer have finally probably achieved what they've always wanted to, popularity and acclaim, and they've done absolutely nothing with it.  Since no obstacles exist anymore, no effort is put in and here we have the result, Make Believe.  Make Believe hints at Rivers Cuomo being very self-aware and hopes that the great deal of Weezer apologists currently circling around dozens of message boards today will just `make believe' that this isn't a big pile of.....really bland and cliched music.  There really anything of any positive value on this album.  One plus I can say is that none of this sounds like rehashed Cheap Trick like on Maladroit, but then again a few of these songs sound like rehased Cars.  One would wonder how Rivers ever gets through Harvard U with some of the insipid poetry thrown across Make Believe, the chief violator being the single Beverly Hills, which sounds a bit like a b-side of a b-side of Pinkerton that has been thoroughly ravaged through a cover by a local band consisting of thirteen year old girls.  Yep, this album is pretty terrible.  Maybe it's a good idea Cuomo chooses not to reproduce 
 I was really excited about getting this book, after reading all the reviews. It appeared as if there was something new out there. Then I read it and I am truly disappointed. It really is more of the same. I have read these concepts over and over, time and time again in various books and in the varying schools of metaphysical teachings. Yes sometimes they work, yes sometimes they don't, even here with Bob's concepts, they still don't work some of the time, so what's new??? The concepts seem to have been honed from varying resources, some which were very recognizeable,..especially the give me this or something better.  I also was bothered by the author pointing one to watch the truman show and other outside materials for a better concept of what his book was supposed to be aimed at explaining to you. His grasp of the inner ceo also was very one dimentional, and I never did get a good feel for that. One would think if the book is based on working with your inner  "ceo", (better known to most who have been around the block, your higher self, or subconscious) and working the network,(better known as Jung's collective unconscious) you would first need a good feel for the inner "ceo" to begin with, I felt the author fell really flat there. I gave it one star for one reason, I had no other choice, and I suppose it is worthy of one star as there are some people, obviously from the reviews, that just haven't been exposed to the metaphysical concepts of life. All in all I suppose it is just another book, with another secret method, that if followed diligently step by step, you will succeed at manifesting your desires.....SOME of the time!! 
 O.K., our P.E. teacher made us sit through this hour-and-fifteen minute load of junk one day during class one day. Let me say I only enjoyed the movie slightly because it beat being fried in the boiling heat outside. First of all, the plot has so many holes in it I seriously think that someone held the script up to the wall and shot twenty rounds at it. Secondly, I believe I watched an episode of Teletubbies once and laughed more then than I did during this movie. Finally, the movie is more bland than a block of tofu. No action, no drama, not the slightest trace of good humor. 
 I recieved this book as a gift from a "born again" friend who thought it would convince me that the universe was created by the Christian god.  My friend had not read the book previously - if he had he would have been too embarrased to let anyone else read it.  There is no science in this book, the authors merely mock science as they attempt to convince the reader that the words of Bronze Age, tent dwelling, nomadic, goat herders have more authority in the subject of scientific inquiry than all the scientists who have contributed to the knowledge and understanding that we have accumulated up to the present.  At one point while attacking a statement about gods made by the late Carl Sagan, the authors write: "we believe Dr. Sagan is aware of his error now".  This superstitious drivel is reminiscent of the commonly repeated Evangelical saying: "Darwin is now a creationist in hell".  The book is a joke.  Far from convincing the reader that any credibility exists in Creationism it shows how far removed from reality the ideas of Creationism are.  If you have some time to kill, reading this book will open your eyes to the self deception and dishonesty that are required for believers to swallow this garbage.  You will be amazed 
 When you first see this book you figure, well the content has to be better than the cover.  As amazing as it might sound, the content is even worse.  The amount of errors really baffled me and stressed me out.  Trying to look up things and the entire layout is just awful.  How awful books like this get published is beyond my knowledge.  Perhaps someone lost a bet or Schiller owns their soul.  Maybe if your a 900 player this would help you break 1000.  If your getting this book thinking your gonna be able to defend d4.  I guess your gonna have to find out the hard way how shoddy this book is.  A bad chess player that writes awful books is a scary thing.  I think Ken Smith and Schiller should start their own club.  Donate your money to a good charity or buy yourself something worth having.  The only use this book has is the hope of being burned when no logs are left 
 BE ADVISED THAT THE CLOCK IS PRONE TO MECHANICAL FAILURE!!!  I have returned a "sister" version of this coffee pot THREE times.  The first time was just a broken carafe, but the 2nd and 3rd times were mechanical failures.  After the 1st return, I repurchased the same pot.  Within one month, the entire clock faded to black and would not work, which meant NO timer functioning.  I thought that this was a fluke, so I returned the pot (again!) and got another one.  After 3 months, the clock still worked, but the option to set the clock or turn on the timer just STOPPED working.  Out of the blue!  So, it too was returned.  I don't think I'll be buying any Mr. Coffee products again.  BE ADVISED THAT THE CLOCK IS PRONE TO MECHANICAL FAILURE!!!  *By the way, I have had the same problems as everyone else (overflowing at filter, dripping onto the burner, etc.), but I could deal with them as long as my morning coffee was actually made in the morning 
 I was extremely excited when I discovered this book.  I wanted it for my ten-year-old-daughter.  From reading other reviews, the book was suppose to be about girls becoming wowen (getting their periods).  I was disappointed to find that the book contained too much information about sex and a picture of male genitals.  I wanted my daughter to learn about her own genitals--not a male's genitals.    The book does cover a lot of what girls need to know about getting their periods.  If you are not concerned about your young daughter learning about sex--get the book, but if you wanted information only about menstruation, this is not the book for you 
 More fish recipes than your normal cook-in-advance books. I didn't want to buy the book, but my cat spilled iced tea on the borrowed copy (helpful kitty). There were a few interesting recipes, but everything was way too complicated and expensive. I have since given my copy to a thrift store. If you enjoy cooking and eating gourmet recipes, but don't have the time, this might be for you. If you can borrow it at the library (via interlibrary loan if your branch doesn't have it) you can better judge it. I can't recommend it, because I found almost nothing appealing. But tastes are personal, and YMMV. Just keep the book away from iced tea and cats 
 This book flows along nicely but never actually goes anywhere. The book simply ends with no action, and no questions answered. It left me very very annoyed 
 My daughter really wanted the Cloud Kingdom for Christmas.  As soon as I saw the quality of it, I should have returned it but I knew it would break her heart.  It takes up a lot of room and does not fold for storage like most Barbie houses.  My daughter is very frustrated with it because the pieces do not stay together, so she hardly plays with it.  This toy is definately not worth the money.  I wish had read the reviews on this toy so could have bought her something that she could actually enjoy 
 I can't fathom why this book is beloved.  It's just awful.  Alright, that's a little strong.  The first third-to-half of the book is just awful:  tedious, depressing, tiresome, plotless.  Indeed, Lawrence put a sentence in that, amazingly, perfectly summarizes the first half of the book:    "The days seemed to grind by, with curious painfulness, yet nothing happened."  That really does say it all.  The protagonist plods through her dreary, depressing life, and nothing happens.  At times during this book, I got the feeling that Lawrence really wanted to be a botonist rather than a novelist, because he spends more time talking about every last plant in the woods than he does talking about any of the people in the story.  For a while I had to keep going to the dictionary to look up every plant I'd never heard of, until I finally just gave up.  Eventually, in the last third or so of the book, it starts getting a little more interesting.  But sadly, while it starts to appear that something resembling a plot is finally developing, in the end nothing very much comes of any of it.  But we DO get long, windy, insufferably self-righteous political nattering, of a Rousseau-ian nature:  all industrialism and capitalism is bad and we should go back to some idylic state of nature thing that never in reality existed (in reality, life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish, and short).  This is at its most ludicrous when the title character makes all these chicken-little doomsday predictions about how mankind is going to be basically wiped out in 100 years unless we give up industrialism/capitalism and all.  Well, the book came out in 1928, so he's still got some 20 years to not look like an utter nincompoop.  But I could tolerate the misguided ranting if the rest of the book were good.  It is not.  The biggest problem is the oppressive dreariness of it.  This stems largely from the fact that Lawrence only ever seems interested in writing about emotionally crippled people (so much so that I strongly suspect  that he was emotionally crippled himself).  Every character is decidely neurotic, each in their own special flavor.  The closest thing we have to a representative of mental health would be Mrs. Bolton.  The central character Connie does eventually get her head screwed on straight by the end of the book, but it sure takes her long enough.  I just could not identify with these people one tiny iota.  Repeatedly I just wanted to hit them for their behavior and emotional attitudes.  To its credit, the book does advocate an unabashed, unashamed joyous love of sex, something with which I am totally on board.  But that's about the only good thing I could find to say 
 This is just another attack by organized medicine on Alternative treatments and therapies, in particular chiropractic. Dr. Rosenfeld comes across as biased, ignorant and at times completely malicious in the information he provides. His assertion that he "loves chiropractors is disingenous at best." He prefers non-specific manipulation by a doctor who can also prescribe (toxic) drugs. He lists warnings about chiropractic that are extremely rare, occuring one in many millions, and suggests that these are common occurances. He fails to mention that the practice of (Allopathic) medicine is the third leading cause of preventable death in The United States, which is the very reason we need more practitioners of the so called "Alternatives". If you want good advice, start by avoiding books on alternative medicine written by medical doctors, especially this one!! 
   This is bring to your notice that the product that i have orderd has not reached me yet. I request you to do the needful. Thanking you Prince Georg 
 Considering the reputation of this book, I was quite shocked to read some of the errors it contains with regard to Australia and New Zealand to the extent I cannot take for granted anything else within its pages.  A short list:   1. Anzacs, pie floaters and lamingtons are not "food traditions" bought from Britain by migrants and convicts.  All of them originated in Australia in the 20th century.  2. The swagman boiling potatoes in his billy can is a new one to me. Billies were generally used for making tea. Most swaggies did not get more than bully beef, flour, sugar and tea.  3. Anzacs are biscuits, not cakes.  4. The "pie floater" is a meat pie in a bowl of pea soup, not tomato sauce, and is not our national dish unless a national dish by definition is something almost universally derided and never eaten.  5. In what appears to be an attempt to cater for different terminology in different countries, the authors have put corn syrup in brackets after golden syrup. However, these are not the same thing, golden syrup being derived from sugar cane and having an entirely different flavour.  6. As above, icing and frosting are not the same thing.  Any attempt to make lamingtons with frosting will result in total failure.  7. In New Zealand, food is not "simple" meat and veg, but rather a reflection of the diversity of the country's population due to immigration.  In particular, food from Thailand, Malaysia and India is common and modern New Zealand cuisine strongly reflects its influences. The book's information may have been accurate 20-30 years ago, but certainly not now.  8. In New Zealand, kiwifruit is most certainly not eaten with every meal!  This is just a sample from the information regarding Australia and New Zealand and clearly demonstrates extremely poor research. The sort of nonsense you might expect from people who still believe Australians ride kangaroos to work.  I suppose for people who don't know any better, it's great, though to me it smacks of the Emperor's new clothes. I shudder to think that anyone has 100% faith in this book. Given Larousse's reputation (not to mention price) I expect a lot more. 
 My main beef with this book is how quickly it goes...  For example, in the first week you perform Paschimottanasana (seated forward bend), which is crazy!  In Iyengar's Light on Yoga, this is not presented until week 14; the reason is that it requires A LOT of preparation, or else (and I write this from experience) you can really mess up your lower back if you do it improperly.  Secondly, all the pranayama is done while doing the asanas instead of separately; I'm sure Patanjali is rolling in his urn.  Thirdly, it mentions (forgive me if I'm wrong, I've shelved this book a long time ago) nothing of the Yamas and Niyamas, which is a prerequisite for asanas.  And last but not least, the meditation portion of this book is just all wrong, and I'll leave it at that...  Leave this book, go with Iyengar's Light on Yoga.  It's more difficult and moves at a snail's pace, but it's as authentic as you can get without a guru.      I hated the book but I put two stars...  If you go to Baron Baptiste's website, and email one of his employees a quesion, they answer it, gratis.  Don't get me wrong, from what I've seen, Baptiste seems a little money hungry, but the world is not yet perfect.  Namaste 
 I liked the pace, flow ,and language of this novel. My problems stemmed from character behavior, having grown up in Texas I could not relate to these boys. I can not imagine any scenario where a groupsof teenage boys would get together to go have sex witha calf. I'm not naive to think this has never happened, it muight even happen on a regular basis, but not as a group activity with half the high school there to watch. Like ise there is no great homophobic group than teenage boys and for the author to say they made a habit of grabbing for each other's privates came across as unbelievable. Once I can't beleive a books characters, I no longer care about the story.   
 Julia Glass buried her finely designed characters in excessive, useless words.  A discard.  Not National Book Award Material 
 Dude his horrible. Almost every song he has ever done should go on the worst songs ever list... He has no melody, and his lyrics are mediocre.  Worst of all, he looks like Private Pyle from Full Metal Jacket.  LOSER 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 I was disappointed with this book.  The events described are an almost an hour by hour passage of time, during the short lives of these two antagonists. We really don't care what Clyde did at 2am on the morning of the 15th of the month if it really has nothing to do with the outcome of the event!  It seems as if this author wrote these pages directly from a courtroom transcript or a witness' testimony. Furthermore, there are entirely too few pictures (we want to see more of Bonnie & Clyde - duh!!).  Pass on this book and buy one of the others out there.  
 This book is full of editorial errors and the Boston Globe should be embarrassed that they ever printed it.  We waited 86 years for a championship. The Boston Globe could have spent a few more days to get the book out without these glaring mistakes.  Here are a few that I found in less than 10 minutes.  1. Box score for game 1 of World Series is incorrect.  RBI category is wrong.  2. Line score at top of page shows St. Louis scoring 4 runs in top of 9th inning.  (Good thing that did not really happen)  3. Page 22:  Text on left of page that describes picture is incomplete sentence.  4. Box score for game 2 of World Series is wrong.  They actually printed the box score for game 3.  Box score from game 2 is missing.  (Game 3 box score is listed twice in the book)  It's like Curt Schilling never pitched!  5. Box score for game 4 shows Arroyo giving up an earned run.  Hard to give up an earned run in a game that was 3-0.  6. Box score for game 5 of ALCS shows New York against Anaheim.  How bad is that?  Can't even get the teams right.  Pretty sure the Red Sox played in that game.  (I went to it!)  I contacted the Boston Globe and the editor (James Reid Laymance) directly to inform them of the errors.   It has been nearly a month now and I have not been contacted.  Do not buy this book!!  As a historical keepsake these errors greatly diminish its value. 
  This is a complex and detailed history chiefly of Cuban exiles in South Florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various U.S. administrations. In that sense, it is the story of two cities - Miami and Washington - and two peoples - Americans and Cubans.    I have an objection, though, with the stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously, even gorgeously at times, written. Didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and, worse, the result is a cold, humorless, colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup.   The author, in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose, apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end - readers. It is, in that sense, a boring little disaster of a book.  
 The only thought in my mind throughout this whole movie was the Natalie Holloway case, about the girl last summer that went on that school trip, went off with a boy and disappeared. In this movie, Hilary Duff's character is on a school trip to Rome, meets a guy there and then fakes sick to get away from the school group to follow this guy around Rome. I felt so bad that Disney had made this movie showing a young girl going off on her own with a boy she did not know on a school trip because it rang so close to home from that tragic dissappearance of Natalie Holloway. In this movie the only repurcussions the character gets for doing such completely unsafe acts was that she was grounded..and they didn't even show that part. Young girls are very impressionable and will jsut see the glamour in the movie. Hopefully they will be brough up by good parents that will teach them right to know better than to go off with a stranger in a strange place 
 was worthless...was not the correct match for my class book requirement.  Never used it...if someone wants it you can have it for free   
 I have not ordered this item. It may be as nice as the great awards the Playmobil Rock Castle have received for this item. However, while it looks identical to the Rock Castle on the Playmobile website, I would be interested to know why the manufacturer/distributer of this item is Kids Line, Inc. and not Playmobile as are other actual Playmobile items. 
 (2.5 Stars) When I first began reading WH, I was turned around a bit on the chracters as well some language styles, so I decided to cheat and check out the list of characters that was in the back. I soon realized how unhelpful it was and very disappointed by its lack of contributing nothing more than the obvious. What I mean is, instead of helping me deciphor who was who and in relation to one antoher, in which a geneology would have been better, they merely gave very short snippets of description that was actually in the text itself. I got through all the relations by my friend who supplied me with a genology chart.  There were also endnotes that state the obvious as well and it was very tedious to have to keep flipping back to see if they would clarify anything. One character speaks in special Englilsh dialect that was difficult to read and understand. The author suggests that you just need to read it aloud and you'll understand it. Granted, that's true, but a translation in the endnotes would have been nice too.   There is a timeline at the beginning, which is nice but I'm not sure what the point of it was and it seemed randomly placed. At the back again, there is a short discussion on the motifs/themes of the book. It was somewhat enlightening but they point out things the reader would have picked up anyway. But, one thing that was really interesting was that there was a short essay on how the book was received from Bronte's time as well into modern times. The short bio at the beginning was done well though.  The overall language of the book was modernized while still keeping certain dialec and stylistic elements of Bronte that didn't really work well. It was very awkward at times but nevertheless, very readable.   Someone who wants a less intimidating introduction to Bronte or any classical works will find this book helpful (& others in this series). But for those of you who are used to a more strict classical interpretation with a more academic flavor, this is NOT the book for you. You will find it somewhat dull, unchallenging and tedious. The language is not very sophisticated nor reminiscent of the linguistic era (which I enjoy, you may not, so...)  The STORY of WH was fascinating. I both hated it and loved it. There were times when I just wanted to chuck the book across the room because I found it SO vile, the charcters so enraged and violent, selfish and horrible. I haven't feld that way since I read Ann Rice's 'Memnoch the Devil'. I've never read a more passionate and fierceer book; and while I read, I was both dreading it yet couldn't wait to see what happened.   I read this several days ago and I'm still buzzing from it. The confusion of the names is a very interesting device, clever and sly. Bronte was ahead of her time, fusing both the gothic novel with supernatural, dramatic and tragic styles. The evolution of 3 generations was so complex yet the progression of each was so vivid and stand out on their own. I haven't decided if I hate or love Heathcliff and Catherine, if even I can forgive them for their nature. And the wonderful way that Bronte wrote was not just the language of words but in the way she used the wilderness of the moors as a description of their wild selves.  
 I purchased this toy for a friend's dog a while back. The dog loved it, he played with it non-stop (quack! quack!). When he finally destroyed it though we were shocked. Inside of this toy in addition to the stuffing we found a rubber band and parts of a plastic bag. My friend was fortunate enough to get the toy away from the dog before he could consume these items. We did complain to the manufacturer who said they'd look into it, but I would still be wary of this toy.  I think this would be a great toy for a dog that loves it's toys, but doesn't rip them to shreds! There is no guarantee that what you find inside will be safe! 
 This DVD was made after baby one more time exploded onto the scene. it contains no performances or music by britney, and only has a few pictures of her. It's just a bunch of interviews with people from her hometown in louisianna...all of which have hair straight out of the 80s and don't work well in front of cameras. It's been recorded on a home video camcorder obviously.  my advice is to skip this...save your money, it's a snoozefest. Even if you area  huge britney fan, you'll end up regretting buying this 
 McDonough's stated purpose is to illustrate explanatory political models taken from the political sciences with specific illustrations lifted from his political career.  Unfortunately, his analysis of the models is superficial and disorganized and his personal anecdotes are excruciatingly long and unnecessarily detailed. As a result, he is like the wise uncle who repeatedly masks his wisdom behind voluminous, forgettable chatter. For those interested in government and health care, this book is likely to be a complete waste of time. This is one volume it would help to look through at a bookstore before purchase 
 Well I purchased this bike because I previously had a Schwinn recumbent bike that I was pretty happy with but had to sell it because I moved. I'm very disappointed with this upright bike though. I think the seat is very very uncomfortable, so uncomfortable that I don't want to use the product. The seat design in itself it horrible. The way it bolts on is a little strange, and it appears all the Schwinn upright models are like this. Even though I have the seat bolted down all the way, it still wiggles. As others have mentioned, my box came trashed all ripped and with holes in it. In fact, the UPS driver actually told me that I might want to refuse the product, but I took it anyways. I think I'm going to attempt to return this if possible. Although the entire process is a huge hassle since I work everyday, the box is trashed, and how heavy the product is. I also had to help the UPS driver carry it up to my 3rd floor apt. I don't recommend any Schwinn upright bikes, although I likes their recumbent series. I hope Amazon will help me come up with a solution to return this 
 I undertook to read this book because an introduction to Mary Barton, the first novel of Mrs. Glaskell, mentioned this book as the first novel of Charles Kingsley and suggested it was worth reading.  I cannot see how anyone could enjoy reading this awful book.  The story it tells is really inane, I thought, tho I know one should make allowances for the period in which it was written.  But we all know Dickens wrote in the same time period and his works still enthrall readers.  I cannot imagine anyone being enthralled by this work.  It does not help that Kingsley for entirely gratuituous reasons periodically snarls at what he calls "papists" with obvious bigotry. Towards the end there is a long chapter devoted to telling of a dream Alton Locke had, which I only was able to keep reading because I was determined to finish the book, since I seldom quit reading a book once I have decided, wisely or unwisely, to read it.  Unless you are going to write a thesis or something on Kingsley you will be glad you did not decide to read this book 
 This book, which was first published 1871 in German, is one of the most important works in the history of economics. In one single book Menger dismissed the labor theory of value to replace it by the theory of marginal utility. Some of his basic concepts had before been expressed by Hermann Heinrich Gossen (1854) and Stanley Jevons (1866), but their views were not widely adopted and Menger did not know their works. Menger's contribution goes far beyond the "Marginal Revolution": In one relatively small volume he developed a complete economic theory, which explains the nature of rent, wages, exchange value and money much more coherently than the classical economics of Smith and Ricardo did. Together with Leon Walras (both of them unaware of each others works) Menger layed the foundations of modern mainstream economics. Menger's work is far more accessible than Walras', also because Menger did nor regard Maths as relevant for economics. Adherents of the Austrian School of economics venerate Menger as the founder of their sect. Like Marx Menger was extremely literate, well versed in Aristotelian logic and able to read German, English, French, Italian, Latin an Old Greek, but his writing style (in German) is by far inferior to that of Marx.  There is one thing, that Marx, Menger and mainstream economics have in common: They mistake their models, which are abstractions of reality, for reality itself. Also Mengers theory, stringent as it otherwise is, has some obvious flaws: Menger can not convincingly explain entrepreneurial profit; he reduces it to a kind of wage, that the entrepreneur receives for organizing production. Menger ardently rejected the method of the contemporaneous German Historical School, but when it comes to explaining the nature of money, he amply uses historical facts in his argument. As he dismisses the notion, that money is based on convention, he gets into difficulty to explain, how worthless little pieces of copper can effectively act as secondary coins. On a close look Menger's whole theory is based on an incomplete axiom: Economy is not driven by people's needs, but by the needs of the people who can afford. Inequality of income distribution is a set fact before people begin to articulate their needs.  Where does this inequality of income distribution stem from? You can not sensibly exclude history from economics, if you want to answer this question. A clear hint to the answer lies in the fact, that serfdom had been abolished in Austria only 24 years before Menger wrote his "Principles". Of cause the former serfs were obliged to make high payments to their former feudal lords to recompense them for their loss - private property is sacred, you know. These recompensation payments were still under way in Menger's times. Though Menger frequently quotes examples of archaic handcraft in Eastern Europe, feudalism is not mentioned with one single word in his "Principles". Was it all by chance that Von Böhm-Bawerk, Von Hayek and Von Mises, the most prominent economists of the Austrian School that followed Menger, were all members of the (former feudal) aristocracy? 
 The author had a great idea for a book.  He collected enough 'meat' for about 30-50 pages and then exploded it into almost 500 pages of boring talk, so typical of many historians.    There are a few gems in this book and those few who manage to persevere through the boredom of the text may find it somewhat rewarding.  Had the author written a 50-page book that covers the essence of what he has to offer, this would have been a four or five star book.    
 I've read this book with my third graders for the past several years.  They love it.  They enjoy having a candy corn contest of their own while reading the book 
 IDEA REVOLUTION is a great title, this book is not...  This book should have been called LITTLE UNDEEP THOUGHTS ABOUT DESIGN, casue that's what it is.   Nothing usefull and mediocre design.  Just try not to buy it 
 This movie is one of cinema history's seminal examples of a soundtrack carrying a movie to success. "Saturday Night Fever" from a few years before is another example, but that movie could actually stand on its own. Jennifer Beales' torn neck sweater and table dancing routine aside, I don't think this one could.  I understand this movie is near and dear to the hearts of a lot of 80's children, and I will agree this is one of the all-time great soundtracks of cinema. The problem is, the movie's plot is a slow-moving, wasted opportunity.  Physically, Beales is sexy enough to keep your attention, and her portrayal of working-class girl in a man's job striving to express herself was a pretty novel idea when this movie was made. But her unsympathetic personality and mediocre acting undermine her character. Come to think of it, the acting all around is a bit weak.  But that's not the problem. The movie suffers from two fatal let-downs. The first is the plot itself. Feminism-affirming depictions aside, it's pretty simplistic, unimaginative stuff, even for a dance movie. What's worse is how slow it all moves. The drama sequences in-between dances drag on, straining your patience and sympathy for the character's plights.  The other more tragic flaw, since it is a movie about dance, is the cinematography. While it's certainly not the worst cinematography ever, (check out "the Limey" next time you want a headache.) the dance sequences look like they've been salvaged from scraps on the cutting room floor. We're supposed to be moved by Beales' character's natural talent, but for most of the movie we never get to see her do much except walk and pose in a crazy mashup of bad edits. By the time the final dance scene finally comes along, the drama of her audition performance is ruined by drawn-out, bad editing. It almost seems the judges let her into Juliard simply because she was able to stay in the air for longer than a minute.  Perhaps I'm a purist for asking for good dancing onscreen to consist of more than rapid-fire editing. But if it's a movie about dancing, one would think the least they could do is show dancing. Many movies before and after Flashdance managed to get this right ("Saturday Night Fever" certainly did, to its great success), but maybe nobody told this movie's director. It's a shame 
 This is my first review and i thought it was worth my time to write this one so here you go.I only picked up this book to add to my library because  i heard Tom  Flowers was a good author on the subject.This might be alright for a NOVICE grower but even then you might as well start with a GOOD alround book.Im new at hydro and i would never recommend this book, critical info is not there as far as (ph,tds,ec,meter details and functions,mediums and differences,qaulity of the h20 specs,) even the equipment that is listed is terrible and theres ALOT better options now.It really seems just like any book from the 80s and now its WAY out dated,George Cervantes updated version of indoor cultivators chapters on meters,ph,h20,and hydro is a way better choice for the novice or expert with all the new equipment and setups+lots of great pics.One more thing Tom Flowers book is about 85 pages buts seems like 50and very poor info seems to by a BIG rip off !!! MEL FRANK..ED ROSENTHAL...GEORGE CERVANTES... the 3kings on the subject Connel Clarke ok too. 
 I waited ages to get this Fulci classic and now I wished I did not. It is probably Fulci's most confusing work to date and lacks all known production standards considering this is film #33 from him. I can buy GIALLO being a bit spaced out and highly far-fetched, but this one is just plain bad from start to finish, it is only really remembered for the infamous woman chain whipping sequence (chain whipping also appeared in "The Beyond"; Fulci loved cashing in on all this stuff), "Don't Torture a Duckling" is completely void of substance, mystery or crime and instead is replaced by everything that is camp about film making, from the obvious papermashy heads to the "shall I stand here and act now" type blemish on everyone's face, considering this is Fulci's 33rd film or thereabouts, it really looks like his first and it would be another 8 years before he made horror, I was expecting a somewhat smart GIALLO and got drawn out rubbish instead. Like I said - Watch "The Bird with the Crystal Plummage" GIALLO instead. It was made by Argento two years before this and is where you should be at instead. I would recommend that Argento 'primative slasher' over Fulci's cash crop schlock "Don't Torture a Duckling" any day of the week 
    If you are looking for something shocking, don't bother with this movie.      rape scene:  why doesn't she run???? why doesn't she fight??? how come there's all this blood on her all of a sudden??? where did that come from???? stupid.                                                            revenge scenes:  first of all, i wasn't upset enough to thirst for revenge.  second of all, the murder scenes were even weaker than the rape scene.      what you've basically got here is a movie hollywood could remake, scene for scene, including every gratuitous moment. and it would get made.  it would show in theaters.  and lots of annoying people would think it was horrifying.  go rent "irreversible" it's much better at this sort of thing.               
 Interesting book, and filled with some interesting information, but the author has some strong beliefs and prejudices that flaw the book.  For one thing, for someone who is writing on a fairly controversial subject to begin with, and evidences a belief in ghosts and the paranormal, he rejects out of hand psychics and mediums, and confuses their use in paranormal investigation with magic and witchcraft.  Since the presigious Rhine Institute and the British Society for Psychical Research are investigating mediumship (and E.S.P) scientifically for decades this is a strange attitude for someone presenting themselves as a professional to have.  Also, Mr. Brandon seems to be either unaware, or lacks knowledge, of the differences between types of hauntings and methods to get rid of some of them since he expresses the opinion that there is "no way to get rid of a ghost."  I'd recommend one of Troy Taylor's books, or Joshua Warren's How To Hunt Ghosts as better, more knowledgeable, and more balanced in presentation 
 ...this work originally appeared in the German magazine "Der Landser" under the pen-name of Altmann and is one of Kurowski's more indifferent offerings..the writing style well fits the original 'comic' format. Kurowski is an extremely prolific author but his huge output leaves question-marks over the veracity of much of what he writes here, the rest of it is just sheer hyperbole..eg the lengthy scene wherein Heinz Bär receives a dressing down from Göring...some two pages of dialogue - yet the only two participants died long before Kurowski wrote this....there are no sources, no references, no bibliography...as far as I'm concerned this is pure 'novelisation' ..no other word for it I also have big issues with the translation ..its a little too over the top.. 
 Do a search on the true story.  Find out what really happened and how her "therapist" actually created and named the personalities.  Also, you will discover that this author KNEW the TRUTH about this case and simply hid it away in an effort to sell more books 
 It is not user freindly and very complicated. I am not happy with it. I even had help trying to decifer it. Bad investment. By the way I am 74 and  computer literate, learned computers begining in 1970"s 
 This book stinks.  If you want to understand Plath, read the "Bell Jar" - it's easier reading and the book is actually fiction yet autobiographical of the summer before her break down.  The prose in this  book is deep and sent chills down my spine.  In her journal she just whines  and over describes the scenery around her 
 The Sacred Romance is rambling and incoherent.  The author's nearly irrelevant personal reflections litter the chapters and do nothing but complicate extremely simple concepts.  If you read this book, you will spend 25% of your time reading and 75% struggling to make sense of what you read 
 The first time I used it, I hit it about 20 times before the ball broke off and went flying into nearby woods.  My Mom had ordered it from Sharper Image.  She called them and they said the would replace the ball.  They never did.   I have not found a place to order replacement parts.     
 This book is a literary work of art and its depth conveys a sense of accomplishment from its gifted author.  Had ya there didnt I!!?  Isla Fisher is an attention seeking second rate actress who will sell her soul to the devil for fourteen and a half minutes of fame.    This book is not worth the paper it's printed on. 
 all i want to say is that if you want to interprete gita in its fullest then don't go for any translations.first study sanskrit and then read gita in its original form.that would be the right path for knowing the truth 
 I admit that Chalmers presents some interesting ideas, but the conclusions based on his premises just don't make sense. He's forced to conclude both the untenable: (1) dualist framework and (2) functional framework, hypostazed, that, while being true to his logic, results in absurd conclusions (like panpsychism and inanimate objects are information processing things, including a consciousness). But the most troubling aspect of his argument is that it explains nothing. Obviously, there must be a causal relationship between neurobiology and various states of consciousness. That's been the problem since the problem of the mind resurfaced some twenty years ago, and Chalmers offers nothing but illogical premises that lead to valid, if not preposterous, conclusions. He explains nothing of how the biological-physical account of the brain causes consciousness, or vice versa. In fact, there is no causality explained at all, just descriptions of various hypotheses that seem to suggest functional organization "gives rise" to consciousness. But, it simply doesn't. And what about his "dualism?" I thought most philosophers were on the same page with scientific materialists in rejecting the mind/body distinction and all other dualisms. I admit that sometimes we have "deep-level" and "shallow-level" explanations, that differ epistemically, from one another, but they are ontologically at least consistent in a monist explanation of how things on the micro- and macro-level work. There's no discussion of this at all! All Chalmers does is marry computational functionalism with property dualism, and this is supposed to be a theory of consciousness? Is the mind really nothing more than identical to computers and how they function? If so, why can we have "pain," whereas they don't. And, how come we can be "depressed," "elated," "conceptualize," etc., and they cannot? Is the computer paradigm really suitable for "grounding" human consciousness? I think not.  I won't detail all the problems I had with Chalmers account, other than reiterate that there is something important missing (consult Searle's "The Mystery of Consciousness" for elaboration). But beyond his strange ideas (implied panpsychism, "conscious" inanimate objects, etc.), he really is not a very good expositor of his own ideas. It takes him 40 pages to explain "supervenience," which another author did in a paragraph. I think this convoluted prose occurs anytime an author follows the logical rigor that Chalmers does to the absurd conclusions he reaches. He's definitely logical, but the absurd conclusions based on faulty premises HAD to lead him into this corner. Sorry, there's nothing about this book that I can recommend. An excellent alternative based on neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and neurochemistry is Edleman's "Universe of Consciousness. 
 This book really isn't necessary. I found this book to be too dense or too superficial for what I needed. I bought this during my first semester of law school and thought after perusing it in the bookstore that it could be useful. The reality is that I used it only a couple of times, and have only opened twice since. The book has a ton of information if you have never had civil procedure, but what I have found is that it's not useful on the job and there are much better study aides. I have repeatedly touted the benefit of the Emmanuel, but I want to doublely do so hear. The charts alone makes the Emmanuel far superior, but the presentation also helps as well. I don't think anything was more helpful for any class than the Emmanuel's flow chart for personal jurisdiction. This nutshell also when you're studying just becomes more of the same-old, same-old. In practice, there are better and more respected books like Wright & Miller that prove to be better sources and are respectable enough to site in a brief. In essence, do not buy this unless you haven't been going to class. It is too dense and won't help for exam. In practice, it doesn't have the resources you need.  Also, it is very expensive if you are a student, and need exam help 
 This book is quite a simple (and sometimes unusefull) introduction to design/build Speaker System. Design principles are old and it does not cover new trends such as implementation of spice models and simulation. Maybe only source code (written in BASIC for DOS!) can be interesting for an absolute beginner, ... eventhough it's cheap, save your money 
 This book is a self-indulgent wallow in the mire of despair.  Wolfe starts with the supposition that "our earliest ancestors. . . crawled out of the primeval slime," that God is "an unwitting spirit" in "remote eternity," and consequently that prayer is useless and the earth is forgotten, and then whines when he is left with the natural conclusions of a godless world view: that life is accidental, without meaning and without hope.  The characters fumble around, looking for salvation in "a stone, a leaf, an unfound door," (tragically rejecting the Way, the Truth, and the Life) only to find at last that there is no point in looking for salvation at all, since "There is no happy land. There is no end to hunger," "YOU are your world."  This book is unorthodox, unwholesome, and unhealthy.  Avoid it for your own good 
 The 2 biggest mistakes made by government in my lifetime are Congress giving away war powers in 1965 and 2002.  The constitution holds that declaring war is the responsibility of the Congress.  If the Executive has grounds for war let him/her present them and Ccongress vote.  Twice I have seen Congress abdicate this important power with disasterous results.  This is just one of many examples why Yoo has no clue 
 O please. This is totally yin view on business. Light house example, which they use through the book, shows clearly that author is out of the touch. Light house for boats is only usable in clear nights, it is switched of at day (50% of time) and you can not charge for it. I would rather use GPS navigation example because you must get the device. Light gives you only an information (what can you expect other from consultant). GPS navigates you in all weather conditions and ALSO on the land.   Their view is a romantic one. You fill that you must almost fell in love with each customer to be good to work with. Real life is a little more complicated, so my non reaction to my ego suggestions on the not so perfect customer will make much better results. Still better if I can remove these responses for good and in same time acquire some wisdom.  In the first part they always point you to the second one, where you will finally here about it - us stay with us because we must make same thickness for the book. In the second part after a few pages I have taken away electricity from their light house. In the third part you have 20 pages of their contacts to other light houses. Can I return the book? 
 "In Good Company" goes on and on at the end a little bit, and the ending especially is not fulfilling character/plot-wise.  If it had ended 15-20 minutes before it actually did, I would give it three stars instead of two.  I admit there were quite a few times when I laughed a bit to myself, but it didn't make me fall off the couch or anything. There were other times when I thought the actions of some characters were weird or forced.  Overall it isn't an entirely bad movie, but, like I said, the ending is unfulfilling.  Overall not strong performances coming from Scarlett Johansson or Topher Grace 
 To paraphrase Douglas Adams, it is very easy to be blinded to the essential uselessness of the HLA by the sense of achievement you get from getting the RTI to work at all.  In other words -- and this is the rock solid principal on which the whole of the DMSO's DoD-wide success is founded -- their fundamental design flaws are hidden by their superficial design flaws.  This book covers in detail all of the HLA's superficial design flaws while omitting coverage of the fundamental design flaws.  Thus, give it a miss 
 Simon Winchester's journey up the Yangtze river is often poetic and overruns with historical detail every eddie of the way up the river. If anything, this is an incredible historical text of China. The author's research is impeccable and undeniable. However, every word of the way through this book I couldn't help but feel a profound disappointment in what could have been, but clearly is not, one of the the most epic journeys of our time. Mr. Winchester's timing was perfect, a trip up the Yangtze before the Three Gorges dam would change it forever and as the country is experiencing a rebirth that will soon make it the largest economic superpower in the world where it is destined to stay for the next century.  Yet with all his research, all the planning, and all the help he received along the way, we're left with only a few hundred pages of text. Where are the thousands of pictures? Where are the video clips of his journey? Where is the interactive website? He mentions in the opening pages that he packed a Leica M6 camera but, at least in the paperback edition, there is not a single picture in the book. From a man who successfully sued the Defense Department over the Freedom of Information Action in order to get the Pentagon's most detailed maps of the river, I expected more. Instead, we are left with a very long-winded account of the author's journey, but not a deserving account of China's journey 
 We waited too long to try this out after it came.  We would return it if it wasn't so late.  It takes forever to warm up and forever to cook!  Then the waffle is not hot!  Not happy at all with it 
 I am a fan of Michael Crichton's.  Having said that, I felt that the writing style of this particular book was incredibly choppy, and that certain characters were not well developed at all (e.g. the wife!)    The basic premise was very interesting and the book was suspenseful; it moved along at a fast pace.  However, Crichton added too many characters, and made the book too dense.  I had to skim the last several chapters because I wanted to know what happened at the end, but I was getting extremely bored.  Obviously, he has come a long way since this book :-) Sigrid 
 This CD is a wormhole back in time to a much simpler era. Sal's vocals are clear and folksey.  John was always my favorite drummer and he could drive a song with his beat alone.  Add the other members and you have a group that answered the British invasion with American mop-tops that had a first rate sound.  I still think "Laugh, Laugh", "Still In Love With You Baby" and "Don't Talk To Strangers" are some of the best songs to come out of the sixties. Put on your bell bottoms,Beatle boots, and Neru jackets then goove with the Beau Brummels.          
 I would agree with most of the negative reviews this book has received so far, and history has indeed been re-written. While Mick Taylor's role in the Stones' career could not be overstated, it is Bill Wyman's virtual absence that is the most shocking.  Most of the band's shots from the 70's, but especially the 80's and 90's seem to deliberately leave him out.  This is insulting to any self-respecting Stones fan and quite a disappointment (although not a complete surprise).  As everyone knows, Bill was an original member of the band and his career as a Stone lasted almost 40 years.  The Mick'n'Keef show could never have existed without the steadfast rythm section that anchored the band throughout most of its history.  Shame on the other Stones for going out their way to practically eliminate Bill Wyman from this biography.  And who exactly does Mick Jagger think he is fooling when he sings about neo-cons, then proceeds to pick Ameriquest, one of the worst predatory lenders in America, as a tour sponsor?  Who said the Stones aged gracefully?  Get Bill's book instead.   
 Watch the movie first for the breathtaking special effects.  Only then if you're interested, should you buy the book, because it has a few more details in it.  I pity those who bought the hardcover 
 I found this book very confusing and hard to read. There weren't enough  pictures of antennas. Also, I like dirty words, not enough swear words to  describe the subject properly. Maybe some nudey pictures would help 
 The solutions provided are chock full of errors (estimate at least 25% are dead wrong).  Erroneous solutions are worse than no solutions for students trying to learn such difficult material.  How this sorry saga can continue with the Third Edition can only be attributed to extreme incompetence and/or extreme indifference by the recipient of the $$$ royalties 
 I was interested in finding more techniques.  The bulk of the book was about Atlantis, if I wanted to read about Atlantis I wouldn't have bought this book. Atlantis has more to deal with crystals then angels and it is mostly an autobiography with some thoughts in the back on how to do things.  Some of the correspondences to the angels aren't what I'm used to and feels distinctly off.  If your interested in Atlantis I'd say go for it, otherwise don't bother, there are other resources out there 
 you people don't actually STill think this thing is a "hero" do you?  oink, oink...he's ganna teach anyone about morals...what a joke...and all of you that still fall prey to his falasies...and fantacies.  one star because zero seems to be missing here. BIG zero 
 This book had so much useless information I could barely get through it.  What a waste of paper!  I have loved watching the Mertzes on I Love Lucy, so I bought this book to learn a bit more about them.  Well, with the info that is in the book, that task could have been accomplished in 10 pages.  Instead there is a lot of useless, BORING, information that no one cares about.  Furthermore, It paints such ugly pictures of both of those people.  I am sorry I every bought this rag.  If you love Lucy & the Mertzes, you will honor them by NOT purchasing this book 
 I will preface the review that I believe most of the tenets of "Peak Oil" and related arguments.  I picked up this book after seeing it in a side-bar banner add on a popular peak oil forum.  I was disappointed as soon as I started reading.  my main comments on the book are 1)  The book doesn't offer any new data on the topic, but instead gives a rehash of peak oil along with some alarmist consequences 2)  The book doesn't offer any tenable strategies to survive the author's "power down" scenario.  Kunstler in his book "Long Emergency" gives more meat here (though still not too much). 3)  The author gets sidetracked in a conspiracy theory discussion on Bush, the Iraq war, and various other ills of the military-industrial complex.  Generally I think these types of theories don't add a lot to the discourse, and was annoyed to see "Bush is Bad" references sprinkled throughout.  Bottom line is: not terrible, but not worth $10 
 This book is, at best, an intro to ADHD.I bought it hoping that there would be some specific "how to study" tips for highschool and college students with AD/HD, but there is nothing of the sort.  In fact, there is very little in this book that isn't found in other books written for children or adults.  The chapter, "Legal rights of students with ADD" is useful and relevant, but that is 10 pages out of a 150.    There are two other annoying things about this book.  First, Quinn uses the term 'ADD', which has been scientifically obsolete since the 1980s.  Second, Quinn's writing style is somewhat condescending.  I would recommend that a person new to their diagnosis, or even somebody who is old hand, read "You Mean I'm not Lazy, Stupid, or Crazy?"  as opposed to this book.  
 My Life With the Saints is Fr. Martin's memoir of his relationship with some of his favorite saints. In each chapter he tells about an event in his life and gives a short biography on the saint whom connected with him at the time.   About half of the people mentioned such as Thomas Merton, whom the author seems to most admire, Fr. Arupe, Dorothy Day and Mother Theresa have not been cannonized and except for Mother Theresa it's not likely that they will be.   The book pretty much falls down when the author talks about the cannonized saints. He completely fails to capture St. Therese but does better with the Jesuit saints. The chapters on St. Bernadette and the Ugandan martyrs were very good but two chapters don't justify buying the whole book.  I was actually surprised with how theologically slight this book is. Coming from a Jesuit I was expecting something with more depth and it really feels like it was written for kids or older teens. I was not satisfied at all. 
 The scale does not come with a battery, even though there is a distinct place for it in the internal packaging.  Scale had a 2002 manufacture date on it.  All of this I can live with, the bigger problem was that the scale would not zero itself.  When turned on, it would drift dramatically after a couple of seconds.  I timed it -40g for one minute (and after hours... just keep on going...).  The box had no signs of damage, so I'm guessing the load cell was bad.  Very disappointing.  
 Died after 6 months, could not configure.  Would only reset to default config which gave no security.  Worthless.  Support was BAD!! Never again for Netgear products! 
 The author's approach is natural and meditative but lacks a step-by-step strategy.  For those looking for steps to recovery, I suggest reading the book, Alcoholics Anonymous.  This is THE founding text from which all other  12-step recovery programs began.  Believe me, a recovering alcoholic, I  found the SOLUTION in the 12-steps and with other recovering people.  It  saved millions of lives as well as my own 
 I'm having difficulty understanding all of the hype about this novel.  The writing style is not engaging.  The main character is not credible.  Even though he makes his living as a thief-taker, basically a free lance bounty hunter for the city of London, he naively throws guineas and shillings at any suspect rogue who requests money.  This, even though he was supposedly just scraping by, financially.  I read just over 300 pages, then gave up 
 It does leave mineral deposit on the bottles even if you use distilled water. It is worse if you use tap water. It doesn't help if you clean it with vinegar after each use as is directed. When you lift the cap all the water drip. You will need a lot of towels to clean the water after each use. The plastic lid of this product is not appropiate because it gets soft from the heat. You wonder if it is going to melt.  I am a fan of Gerber products, but this one does not work 
 This book will appeal greatly to psuedointellectuals, who will invariably write mealymouthed reviews on Amazon with the word "Timely" in the title. But for a book ostensibly about our relation to the suffering of others, this is an incredibly dispassionate and overanalytical book which, despite the title, is really just a book about photography. In fact, as far as I can tell, Sontag just retreads her ideas on photography that have been published elsewhere. I have great respect for her, but this isn't her best work, especially given the subject she claims to be addressing. Only a hardened intellectual could write a book consisting of a series of disconnected, clever observations on the nature of photography and call it "Regarding the Pain of Others." This is exactly why people accuse modern academia as being so devoid of relevence and meaning.  In the end, I found the individual arguments interesting, and she is clearly very smart, but the book ultimately adds up to very little more than a souless disappointment 
 EVER CAUTIOUS, I GOT THIS BOOK AND CARPENDER'S EVERY CALORIE COUNTS COOKBOOK FROM THE LIBRARY.  I TRIED OUT ONE RECIPE FROM EACH, AND IN EACH CASE THE DOGS WILL HAVE TO GET RID OF THEM.  THE RECIPES, FROM 500 LOW-CARB RECIPES, TUNA MELT CASSEROLE, P. 282.  THE SECOND, FROM THE SECOND BOOK, HIGHLY VEGETABLEFEROUS MEAT LOAF, P. 321.  HERE, I DIDN'T EVEN ADD THE SPINACH INSERT WHICH SOUNDED TERRIBLE.  EQUALLY INEDIBLE.  WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM LOSING WEIGHT ON THIS KIND OF FOOD.  FROM A PREVIOUS READER'S REMARKS, AM NOT TEMPTED TO TRY ANY OF THE DESSERTS.  HOW DO SUCH BOOKS GET PUBLISHED?  
 I am proud of the fact that I hold two degrees like many women. Do I work? No. I have chosen a different path. I have no children, married later in life, and gave up a wonderful job of two decades to care for my ill husband. Do I feel that I have no confidence nor respect? No. And from whom or what is this respect supposed to come from?   Caring for your family has nothing to do with any of this. I admire women who stay home to care for their families. When you have love, who gives a hoot what anyone else thinks. Personally, I find this book a little depressing, and I won't read it 
 I was excited to find a crockpot cookbook that didn't have lots of recipes with cream of mushroom soup in them.  Some recipes are written more clearly than others.  Some have a range for how long you should cook stuff instead of a particular number.    I tried 3 recipes.  First was a Rosemary Chicken recipe which cooked the chicken too long and dried it out.  Then I tried a macaroni and cheese recipe which burnt.  Finally I tried a recipe for chicken with soy sauce and honey which once again was dried out.  The seasonings were good and some of the recipes were pretty unique, hence the 2 star rating.  I followed the directions to the letter and even had the same size crockpot which they mentioned in the recipe!  So if you choose to use this book, watch the food VERY CLOSELY 
 Daniel Pipes said about this book:  "With uncommon skill, Shlaim has managed-in the confines of a very small volume with very large margins-to pack misjudgments, arrogance, and lack of sense into 1994's worst book on the Middle East."  Well, is that true?  Probably.  But just to show everyone that I am not only tolerant and soft-hearted, but generous, I'll give this book not just one, but two stars!    You see, there are plenty of facts in this small book.  In addition to the misjudgments, arrogance, and lack of sense which it does indeed abound with.  Shlaim claims that the 1973 Yom Kippur War broke the diplomatic stalemate in the region and led to peace.  He's not the only one to have said this.  But I wouldn't consider saying something like this on a dare.  I'd be laughed out of town!   Could I say with a straight face that the way to start negotiations towards peace is to launch a war of aggression against a neighbor?  No.  And just how strong is the peace between Egypt and Israel anyway?  Not very.  It is more a cease-fire than a peace, with a constant barrage of anti-Israeli propaganda from the Egyptian side.  After that, we see Shlaim explain that land-poor Israel can have territory or peace.  Really?  I think it is more reasonable for those who want peace to permit land-poor nations to buy or keep something closer to their fair share of land.  In my opinion, Israel is more likely to have both territory and peace or neither of them than one or the other.  And the author says that Israel can have territory or American support.  Again, this could well be a false choice.  Even if Israel, for some reason, can not have both American support and territory, why ought one expect it to have American support if it does not have territory?  Shlaim sums up the problem of the Arabs versus the Jews.  Security pleases the Jews.  Fairness pleases the Arabs.  I wish this were true.  Let's see.  Fairness.  Does that mean letting everyone, including Jews and Arabs, buy land throughout the region and keep it?  Does that mean a Truth and Reconciliation session or two where the Arabs can apologize for their violence and aggression against Levantine Jews?  Sounds fair to me!  Shlaim is totally out of line to pretend that it is unfair to not steal Jewish land, or that it is unfair to allow Israel to stay on the map.  As for the Oslo peace accords, Shlaim praises them as the beginning of a new era.  Plenty of people were extremely suspicious of Oslo.  Shlaim was wrong here.  And those who were suspicious of Oslo generally had the right reasons to be suspicious.  I think that ought to make us more than a little suspicious of Shlaim.  Now, what does Shlaim recommend?  It is simple.  America is simply too much in favor of Israel!  Shlaim thinks we need a more "even-handed" approach.  And that (this was written before 9/11) America ought not "bolster Israel as a strategic partner in an unwinnable war against an imaginary Islamic threat."  Wow.  Imaginary.  But unbeatable.  Shlaim really took a strong view here.  I think 9/11 showed that we're dealing with a real, not an imaginary threat.  And in the long run, why shouldn't a war in favor of truth, justice, and human rights be winnable?  I see no reason to give up without even trying.  If you want to learn about war and peace in the Middle East, try some other book 
 This book disappoints severely. Usually Levinson is well on target, but in this book he clearly misses the mark. His examples are massively out of date - in Israel the cellphone penetration was not 75% in 2004, back in 2003 it was 105%, etc etc etc. Levinson has taken a considerable knowledge of change in technology and then applied sloppy research and bad examples to the world of cellphones. Here in Singapore we are also in the over 100% penetration rates for cellphones, and several excellent books about the real impact of cellphones - such as Rheingold's Smart Mobs, Ahonen's m-Profits and Kopomaa's City in the Pocket will give you much more than this. What is most annoying, is that the book is mostly so badly off its topic.   I do not recommend this to anyone, not even fans of Levinson. Reading this book will guide you wrong. Luckily there are ample better books about the real world of cellphones. Don't buy it 
 It's tempting to spoil the end of this novel in order to describe how BAD it truly is, but Ms. Grafton has somehow earned a following, and as I've said before, there is something for everyone out there. After all, some people (not a majority) actually voted for George W. Bush, on purpose! I think this level of mystery fluff is for them.  Rather than spoil the nutty climax (I have worked in hospitals for years, so I ain't buying it) I will mention that the second paragraph of this schlock novel closes with the words: "...life is one big, savage joke; not funny ha-ha, but cruel like those gags sixth graders have been telling since the world began."  I became so distracted thinking about people who were already in sixth grade when the world began (where did they go to kindergarten?) that I almost missed the rest of the chapter 
 Not only are the other comments on the printing quality correct, but the EXACT SAME BOOK EXISTS in a 2006 EDITION!!  The "Science of Sex" is the original(?) 1996 edition.  The 2006 edition of the VERY SAME BOOK is titled, "Sperm Wars: Infidelity, Sexual Conflict, and Other Bedroom Battles".  Explain to me why the author would reprint his original book under a new title?  Anyway, I'm returning this one, since I bought both books at the same time, thinking they had entirely different content. Furthermore the new edition is of much better printed quality, with none of the problems mentioned about this edition.  One more thing of note...the new edition is HALF THE PRICE of this crappy version!!!  Can't wait to actually read it 
 In a another patheic performance, Keaton plays a plyawright whose fate seems tied to wither the Red Sox win the 1986 world series.  Ebert and Roper liked this movie, but most preview audiences did not and there for it is only getting a limited release.  It also boasts a rather lame performance by Robert Domey (who does the worst Christopher Walken take-off ever).  This shows how out of touch movie critics are with the movie going public 
 I do not wish to be as strident as the previous reviewer, but I generally agree with those conclusions. The book is very attractive but is filled with factual errors. It is a collection of very many (too many) short (just a page or a few pages) discussions of very disparate topics. There is no connection made. More disturbing than the factual errors is the overall lack of understanding of historiography that comes through. There are scenes described that could only have happened in an Errol Flynn movie. Great emphasis is given trivial issues whereas germinal events in carto-history are ignored.My overall impression is that the author is not knowledgeable in this field and has produced an error-ridden potboiler. I do not recommend this book to anyone, even rank beginners 
 i pulled the book off the "new purchases" shelf of my local library hoping for some good stuff.  cover was inticing.  but a story about the life and loves of a penis clouded over the impressions of alaska during gold rush days, kite-building and weather reporting included.  women depicted as voiceless hunks of meat do not make for a good read 
 I purchased this DVD a while ago - FYI - A documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie.  I went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found.  Here, years later, when I'm finally placing another through Amazon They found my account and noted that I purchased Meet John Doe.  I guess it's a little late to complain now 
 Hello,  I recently bought this blood pressure monitor.....it functions all well......BUT it gives incorrect readings.......i mean the readings vary significantly........not once , twice...but many many times......I was and am never sure about the validity of the readings..... Purchase this at your own risk.....my recommnedation would be to get a manual blood pressure monitor like the one with the doctors.....atleast u will know that the readings r genuine...and u can ALWAYS find someone who can spare 5 minutes and help u get the readings...... Take care and stay healthy...... 
 This review is for the audio edition. No stars is the true rating of a silly conversation with an old guy who cannot talk. The level of the meanings and ideas it is less than of a child in the first classes of elementary school. I feel very stupid i paid money for this garbage 
 I bought Hogarth's "Dynamic Anatomy" because I was impressed with his drawing style. Unfortunately, there is too much flash and not enough in-depth exploration of the body. Muscles follow the bones so it is critical to know the bones. Hogarth gives no attention to this. This would be a decent supplement to learning new ways to draw the human form. I might recommend it to someone that had firm knowledge of the body already 
 I should have listened to the reviews.  This is not a good product and will not buy again 
 In the USSR, the state would havew a training class to teach children there is no God.  All the children (roughly the same age as would be reading this book) would have to put their heads down and pray for a cookie.  Then they were to lift their heads.  No cookie would be there of course.  Then they were told to ask the state for a cookie and then put their heads down.  When they did, someone would go around and put a cookie on everyone's desk.  This book uses the same sort of logic to make the reverse argument.  If it wasn't right the first time, it isn't right now, and what is terrifying is that truth and fact no longer have the weight they once did.    There is NO argument in the scientific community about evolution as others would have you believe.  There is an argument AGAINST the scientific community by people who no nothing about science, but know plenty about politics and law.  So your child may be reading this horror story in the near future so we can make our way back to burning women at the stake if they float when thrown bound and gagged into the river 
 Hesitation over the title of this review was purely for consideration of people who might have taken offense at the use of homosexuality in the traditional role as a comedic device for dehumanizing people.  In this Fantasy Fashion Designer Barbie role play kit, we are presented with two suspect homosexuals, the flamboyant  Black assistant fashion designer, and the quarry closet  homosexual who has to have his disorder pointed out to him, preferably in an embarrassing public denunciation.  Barbie  has to  learn  the  need for her to  script  and  typecast sexuality around  her because she is the sensation (fem fatal) for persuasion predominant in the sphere of people around her.  A Countrified Fantasy Fashion Designer Barbie Killer Instinct--role play kit.   And it is perhaps an interesting microcosm of analysis to vaguely note the teddy bear appeal assigned to the openly gay Black character, artistic, talented and unflinching.  It is the idea that for women, gay men make the best friends, that I won't quote yet I seem to have heard it somewhere in the cultural media stream at some time in the past.  Thus a possible depolarizing of "sexual prowess" is covertly used to adjust traditional racial stereotypes, (and that term is taken straight from multicultural theory).   Further complicating the plight of the Black male character in the film, is the Civil War reinactment-buffooning in the presumably lingering prejudicial South, where no doubt the image of African Americans as sexually iconoclastic, bandages wounded  White male libido traditionally injured by jibes of phallic innuendo.  Surely considerate people everywhere are tired of this dredging up of unpleasant or bawdy associations; circumcision is perhaps the original anthrospecific-insult (precursor to sexual dysfunction then marital dysfunction and the whole syndrom of social ills that erode social fabric from its core) but anthropologically the film is enriched elsewhere.    Irving's character Jenny Garp, feminist author, cites being made a "sexual suspect", clearly there are procedural tolls long since put in place to accustom these suspicions of men and women.  Half asleep through the whole movie, I forget the Witherspoon character's name, but she essentially indicts a suspect homosexual male at one point, out of an urge perhaps, to solidify a group cathartic that had pleasantly gone on over the life of the individual in that community as a dissatisfactory standard of humane and non-discriminatory practice.  Barbie's tantrum must be a blood letting, her role is too prominent for softer and tactful, retiring or inhibited social display...she must be the "bell of the ball", the "queen bee" with attendant phalanxes of maidens, a sort of warrior aspect appreciated and encouraged in the feminine; whereas dominant female politicians  must stride more carefully to avoid becoming vilified on a masculine playing field.  There are no masculine defenders of the imasculine, no Garps to befriend gay football players.  Historic Southern  racism is lampooned, only to be replaced with the sexism of preferential or select social stereotyping and discrimination based on repression spawned feminine outlets of gay labeling, a favorite innocuous quarry for young girls influenced by such movies.   It's a man's world, so go kick the "queers", it's perfectly safe.--is the message.  Really it is just a comprehensive green light for offensive young women to go around tarring everybody with the gay label they don't particularly approve of--such sweethearts, somebody slap them.  The gay prompt has grown to such dimensions in the mass medias adverse stimulus conditioning we had to endure the whole "Brokeback Mountain" odyssey and cultural crisis.  Something just keeps wanting to load it into everybody's heads.  Murphy Brown is the elder role model for Fashion  Barbie, what its like to grow up, become a crochety, semi-retired blonde who has scaled political obstacles, become Mayor, wear a suit, and combat the depreciation of appearing older than a plastic toy fresh from the hot injection  mold, while she dotes over the marital selection of her son. Bergen is what happens to Barbies when they grow old, a question that any would be Barbie surely asks, once the question has been loaded for her through symbolism, because just as surely, the pretense of a "Barbie" precludes higher order thinking skills, any anticipatory or empathic reflection--Barbie being the conceited thing it is.  That conceit is no more abundantly clear when the quarry queer, a meek and unassuming character is viciously stereotyped, "Why don't you just admit you're a homosexual!?"  Why don't the movies just admit they're [....] mind control, written by apprentice flunkies who basically jerk-off the emotional susceptibility of innocent victims who paid money for maybe something more enlightening?  Barbie has the decidedly impertinent and socially devastating master stroke saved for when after tremendous wedding preparation, long distance coordination with the big city, hundreds of people, relatives, costumes, food, etc. (a large diamond of course, conspicuously selected in a macabre scene with jewelry store ghouls (...full staff after midnight on overtime...right...only the very best for princess)--night of the living dead materialists in their empty catacombs of display cases), she changes her flighty little mind in the nick of time, and before a well timed downpour that punctuates her contempt for the wedding and the wedding party.  Rese Witherspoon needs these infant terrible outlets, her puckish and perky hypercriticality is what this [....] cesspool of a culture thrives on...or so it would be pawned off on us.  You won't like this next paragraph, oh great ones, but never assume All the munchkins where you pop in to do your do-do (make films)  are salivating and wringing their hands to come to greet you, kiss your shoes, or get your damn autograph.  Salt Lake City must be summoned, like the great unwashed suddenly up for review by some nether world superiors alighting, to appear as extras  in the upcoming romp Legally Blonde II, (radio ads November 22, 2002 call for the comely and college aged, dark suited political types, and young children).  Sounds like the mothership giving instruction for disembarking, all who remain behind are condemned.   And don't you dare walk your walks where you live and cross paths with the film industry's eminent domain, the larger than life have minions of hounds carrying clipboards to accost all who stray into where the "magic is made", Ogden Utah's 25th Street and set for the tv drama 'Hardwood', or 'Viagrawood' or whatever its name was.  The perception is: We are a needed, but despised adjunct to opulence, a rancid and rabble public chattel for them to cull and elect from our insignificance (they pretend to entertain and in fact constantly insult) one or two anointed surfs to stardom.   Who wants to be the next American Idol?  Or, `The One'.  `..or thinks they can dance?'... `...or cook?'    I think its now a rancid (mostly citrus) entertainment media too.  
 I bought this book while researching the Logarithmic Spiral.  There were only a few references to the Logarithmic Spiral, so it wasn't spot on with what I was looking for.  However, I stayed away from this as a source because the text was difficult to read 
 After advent of "Orientalism" by Edward Said, the playing field is even. This Book by Romila Thapar is an Outdated Marxist Rhetoric 
 I ordered this antenna to enhance the reception of the UHF channels. I live in a big city and I thought I shouldn't have a problem with any indoor antenna. it seems I was mistaken. this antenna is useless. it is almost no better than my previous 99 cents store antenna 
 Pipes has written this account for one sole reason - certainly not to present a review or interpretation of the historry of the Bolshevik party and the Russian Revolution, but rather as an attempt to destroy Lenin and Bolshevism.  While this one-sided attempt may be fine for some, it certainly does not help those readers who would actually like to make up their minds for themselves.  But then again, can one possibly expect a right-wing historian who worked under the Reagan administration to give a fair account of the Russian Revolution?  With that being said, Pipes is really no different then many leftist historians who attempt to glorify the USSR and the Revolution (Communist writers of the 30's and 40's come to mind).  In my experience I have found that the book that carries the least biased account (of course, complete objectivity is impossible) of the Russian Revolution is E.H. Carr's History of the Bolshevik Revolution.  If you are interested in the facts of the Revolution and not merely a book-long effort to demonize Lenin et al., then I suggest you pick up Carr's book 
 The Wisdom of Menopause provides an accurate description of what happens to a woman's body during and after ovarian failure (menopause). This book describes in detail the negative effects of menopause (ovarian failure) while still describing it as a natural and normal process to embrace. I don't believe we should be so willing to allow our ovaries to fail, instead we should look for ways to help them work better and for longer. 
 Lets get 1 fact out: IRON MAIDEN DOESNT CARE ANYMORE!!!  How can they be SO brilliant with # of the beast, Piece of Mind & PowerSlave & then put out 5 terrible records in a row starting with X-factor?  This record is soooo boring! I bought it based on Wickerman which I found to be OK, reminiscent of  the old Iron Maiden & then they just ran completely out of material. Track 2 on sounds exactly the same, long boring slow tunes that never end.. going track after track, album after album. Does "Dream of Mirrors" ever end? I cant ever tell.. I just lose my attention due to its such a GD drag. Then they hit me with "Thin Line" which is even less interesting than the most boring professor I had in the most boring class in my entire college career.   You cant listen to the original "Iron Maiden" release & then seriously listen to this new crap & release it, unless you just dont care. Obviously they dont CARE!! This record is TERRIBLE!  If they did care they would relisten to the first 6 or so & rethink thier efforts & either improve the sound or just end Iron Maiden & come out with a new band named "Too old, too tired!" & quit defiling the great name of "IRON MAIDEN" 
 I expected this book to be about the freshman year experience, based on the title and the way that the book began.  However, the book ended up being more about broad strokes describing student life.  The author did not live in a freshman residence hall and I am unsure if she primarily enrolled in gateway classes or not.  Memorable aspects include her depiction of the student community being comprised of independent networks and the way students learn to manage college (cut corners) as a stragegy to manage their time 
 "Chopping Mall" is styled like an 80s slasher, but is in fact, not a horror movie.  In actuality, what you get with this movie is more science fiction/action with some cheesey comedy as well.  Simply put, "Chopping Mall" doesn't work as a horror movie because the killers are machines and therefore the element of evil is completely lacking which is not conduicive to a pure horror movie.  In fact, one could argue that this movie is more or less like "Maximum Overdrive" or maybe even "Runaway" (in a sense), only not as good because those movies, while technically implausible, actually made some sense theoretically speaking, unlike this most unfortunate piece of rubbish known as "Chopping Mall".  I do not recommend "Chopping Mall" if you are looking for a horror movie or an 80s slasher flick as the movie is in all fairness a dark yet "total farce".  Instead, I would recommend "He Knows You're Alone" as probably the best of the relatively unknown 80s slasher/horror movies 
 Unfortunatly, for many of us who are searching for insights into Chinese Astrology, this book offers very little understanding about Chinese Astrology in its true form.  The subjective material in White's books only  foster more confusion and further divide readers from the true application  of Chinese Astrology.  This book can contribute to 5% of an individual's  astrological profile at the most.  Suzanne White's books in general are  poor attempts of self-discovery through the art of Astrology 
 Berenstain bear books are usually great reads, with a good lesson within the fun and enjoyable text.  This story had a good message, but wasn't a fun book to read.  I lost attention, and attentiveness.  My voice as i read it became slowly more monotone.  If you want a strickly educational book, its better to read them the dictionary 
 ... is the fact that this book is often listed under the "occult" section. PLEASE! Satan is a CHRISTIAN figurehead, don't confuse Christian beliefs with Wiccan or Pagan. Wiccans do not believe in Satan, he belongs to the Christians, not us 
 Somebody from Florida asked about the missing song.  It's "Them Changes" by Buddy Miles, one of the all-time great funk-rock artists of the 60's.  He played with Hendrix, Pickett, Ruby and the Romantics, etc.  "Them Changes" is the best song in the movie, and it's missing from this soundtrack!  How could they exclude it?!!!  Without "Them Changes," this soundtrack is a 2 (same tired old songs we've heard a 1000 times).  With "Them Changes," this soundtrack would have been a 5.  Here's my advice:  forget this soundtrack and order the CD "Them Changes" by Buddy Miles 
 With such a beautiful cover and such a career to discuss, I was very exicted about reading this book.  But OH MY GOD it was painful.  I'm sorry Mr Burns, but I don't care what your personal feelings are about Curtis.. I wanted to read about Curtis' life.. what he went through, how he came to write such beautiful music - but instead you give track by track detail of every album - and thats it.  Here's hoping someone can write an interesting book about such an inspirational man 
 Sometimes she raves and sometimes she rants, the really interesting parts are when she tries to do both at the same time.    This book is better then "Treason" because it stays away from a topic that Ann knows nothing about (the history of the Cold War) and stays more towards current events.    And that's fine everyone is entitled to an a point of view the problem with Ann's arguments in all of her books are threefold   1.  I'm right and you're wrong 2.  I don't have to listen to you  3.  I don't even have to acknowledge that you exist (look at the title)   So what it all boils down to are examples that are as idiotic as the premise. Maybe in Ann's world of rich people we can all ignore each other if we have differing political views but in the real world where we have to work for a living it isn't like that.     Overall-Don't waste the energy or the time.   
 This awful book receives two stars from me only because of the serious paucity of other study guides for this exam. I won't say that it was completely useless--going through all the practice tests did alert me to some areas that I needed to review, and prepared me well in advance for the stress of the 230-questions-in-170-minutes format--however, as other reviewers point out, this was accomplished with the maximum pain and minimum impartation of useful information possible. The explanations to the (hair-splitting, uninformed) questions were generally more frustrating than the questions themselves, and were often amibiguous when not downright incorrect.  I did poorly on all three practice tests, and while this may have been helpful in that it spurred me to more and more panicked last-minute study, I can't say that unnecessary fear and rage are particularly desirable additions to my GRE experience. If you are knowledgeable about literature, skip this book or be prepared to throw it down and gnash your teeth on a regular basis. If you are already using the book, don't despair: I scored a good 220 points higher on the real test than on any of the practice tests in this book (the Princeton review practice test and the one that ETS sends with registration were much better predictors of my actual score). You are probably much smarter than this poorly written book will make you feel. My advice is to stick with the Princeton Review book, which is much friendlier and more accurate (though it needs a few more practice tests and some updating in the contemporary lit. and criticism sections) and to read, read, read those Nortons. If you do decide to use this book for the reasons mentioned above, just remember that it REALLY does not reflect the difficulty or quality of the actual test questions 
 John Irving remains one of my most favorite and respected authors, in spite of, not because of this book.  After reading Garp, Cider House, and a few others, perhaps it is my own lofty expectations for consistent greatness that led to my genuine disengagement with this particular text.   Many of the classic `Irving' traits (sub-plots, interior dialogue, overt sexuality) encompassed the novel but the most important aspect was missing.  Even at the conclusion of the story I could not make myself care for or truly understand Dr. Daruwalla (protagonist).  After 700-something odd pages, (usually an aspect of Irving's style that I appreciate and embrace), I was ready for the novel to end.  And it did, rather expectedly and unceremoniously.  This is not to say that the novel should not be read, it was mildly enjoyable (perhaps because I read the majority of it on the beach), but as for John Irving's potential, it pales in comparison to `his greats'.  Hesitantly recommended for the veteran Irving reader is the best rating I can give this book.  
 I really had a lot of fun for the first month I owned it. Two AA batteries lasted almost one month. Compared with other rechargeable models, this one was fairly cheap. But after 5 months, now, it's so annoying that I have to change batteries every 3 days! How come a toothbrush eats up power so crazy?! I'm thinking of buying a rechargeable toothbrush. 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 The best thing about this book are the repro photos of Hemingway and his contemporaries.  Sadly, the author's own photos, scavenged from his previous trip files, are mostly poor stock.  The same can be said of his writing.  There are no new nor creditable insights into Hemingway here, in fact you will mainly learn about author Ondaarje's own quirks and predelictions, ad nauseum.  Ondaatje is not a hunter, knows nothing of hunting, and yet presupposes his ability to dissect "Hemingway in Africa" when in fact hunting was the sole motivator for Ernest's 1933 trip to the dark continent.  It's like a medical biography penned by a chimney sweep.  You will get very little insight into Ernest Hemingway as the book wanders hither and yon.  Even worse, the book is full of factual errors and shaky assumptions as Ondaatje waddles over the landscape searching Hemingway's trail.  Ondaatje had previously been in Africa for a book on British explorers Speke and Burton.  It is apparent he decided to capitalize on that experience and become a literary critic.  He has failed miserably.  Buy the book for the pictures, nothing else... 
 This is a typical plane book. Boring and it seems he wrote a book for just the money. I am stopping readingParker's books as stories made for TV are better. Don't waste your tim 
 I had purchased this book because I was looking for basic techniques on telling short stories.  The majority of the book is stories with tips on telling those specific stories.  I returned this book within 10 minutes of receiving it in the mail 
 I loved the original movie, and I love Johnny Depp so I thought this movie would be awesome.Wrong wrong wrong!! First of all, the child actors were horrible, well the Charlie and Mike characters were ok, but the two girl actors were the worst I've seen in a long time. And what did they do to Johnny Depp? He was so creepy and weird. I took my nine year old to see it in the theater, and even she almost fell asleep. If you really want a treat watch the original with Gene Wilder 
 Take advice from somebody who is able to easily win over others easily.  The advice and beliefs shown in this book are just wrong.  If you want to do really well.  Do what others that are doing well are doing.  Adopt the beliefs, mannerisms, attitude,  techniques, ideas  of who you wish to be like  and you'll get the same results.  in other words.  Don't copy John Gray.  
 The movie was ok, but kind of confusing at times and too long. The time travel was interesting, especially when the Bandits ended up on a sinking Titanic 
 never before has a movie had such an apt title as this mess. the plot is as thin as the main person in the movie gets. just really a waste of time and money for me,i thought! skip this mess!! 
    This book is not really a commentary but an explanation of Tim LaHaye's view of the end times which is not thorough and leaves tons of holes. The whole Rapture movement is based on almost no Biblical grounds but is popular just because it makes for exciting books. For a thorough, well-researched, understandable, and Biblically sound commentary on Revelation, pick up Herman Hoeksema's outstanding work, Behold, He Cometh! 
 In this book, Gladwell reaches the astounding conclusion that EXPERTS know more than other people. That if you spend YEARS doing something, or researching it, or training, you will be able to spot more details than others. A real eye-opener. 
 I have not had a good pillow in a long time.  I wouldn't pay upwards of fifty dollars for a pillow.  But I gave in after reading the reviews and got this one.  It's way overpriced in my opinion but they are onto a very good idea.  First, I have had it for a couple of weeks and it's pretty flat now.  The coils are only in the very center of the pillow, and at times you do notice them there, but not in a bad way, just noticable.  The problem is the fluff they add to the pillow must be the cheapest possible nothing.  I imagine I will have a really strange looking square blob surrounded by a moat of flat fabric pretty soon.  At first, it was really comfy. I think that if they either put high quality fluff around it, or better yet put coils through the entire thing, with higher ones in the center, this would be outstanding, beyond all other pillows!  But as it is, it's not worth the price yet.  If you have tons of money to burn, go ahead and try it.  I wouldn't recommend anyone get two to sleep on at once, they would be awkward and they would be falling off the sides of eachother.  You could use a regular pillow below this one, but then you are back into the same pillow finding - switching game we all want to avoid.  I would have given three stars if it were a lot cheaper, but after going flat after only a few weeks, and the price, I had to give it two 
 I tried inventing a character by answering the questions in this book, but got overwhelmed by the dozens (hundreds?) of questions. I wonder whether it's necessary to compile so much information to create a character. I would guess that a few key traits as well as some information about profession, appearance, and backstory are probably what's needed. I sensed Mr. Lukeman's concern and intelligence throughout, but I notice that he's an agent, not a fiction writer. Is it possible that he's mistaken about how writers really create characters 
 for the price of the rebate, it is a good deal. Though don't expect you get an easy use of the case, especially all 96 discs are in case. With a big force to squeeze the case together, finally able to zip it, and you will get probably all the disc bent especially the outer sleeve ones It is a bad design by having the same dimesion sleeves sew together in the center. Probably having 48 discs case would be more proper instead of 96 disc 
 I received this book as a gift. I read in this genre from time to time and usually the pace of the books is riveting. Here I was very restless and not interested in the characters. So many things happened that seemed far-fetched that I couldn't give the author much confidence. In the end I was happy to finish the book to just be done with it and disappointed at the ending 
 Book four in the series featuring Temperance Brennan finds her working on a plane crash in North Carolina that has attracted media attention from across the country.  The plane was transporting mostly college athletes on their way to a competition, but also carried a Canadian police officer escorting a criminal back to Canada.  Speculation runs wild during the search for how and what caused the plane to explode and crash.  However, Tempe finds a foot in the woods not far from the crash site that she believes was not a part of the crash or the remains of anyone on the plane.  This discovery leads her to investigate what she believes to be a complicated set of murders that appear to be linked, but do not seem to make sense.  As she gets closer to the truth Tempe finds that she is up against much more than she ever suspected, including high ranking political officials that will stop at nothing to keep their secrets from the public.    The problem with this installment is that it never gets particularly exciting.  There is some mystery and intrigue, but Tempe continues to be a weak heroine and so it is not easy to get behind her and excited in her super sleuthing.  Additionally, it is hard to believe that an anthropologist would find herself given so much high level access and status related to crime scenes and investigation.    Overall, this series is on the dull side and so there is not enough excitement to overcome the unbelievable aspects of the plot.  There just is not enough "hook" to keep me loyal or to continue reading 
 Hammerfall is one of the bigger names out there in the power metal world, and this cd sounds pretty much like the previous 5 albums. The only dofference is that they have gotten worse. I write this review to the two groups of people out there: The exisiting Hammerfall fans, and those trying them out for the first time. For already existing Hammerfall fans such as myslef, I strongly urge that you do not buy this cd, unless it goes below 3-4 dollars on amazon. For those looking to try Hammerfall out and get into the power metal genre for the first time, go ahead and get this one, because Hammerfall are by no means bad musicians. They can all play very well, but this cd lacks refinement and creativity. Start here and work your way up to the better Hammerfall, which you will no doubt appreciate more. Hammerfall keeps putting out the same album over and over and over, if you know what I mean. All of their songs sound relatively similar, but this cd marks one of the lowerest points in their career 
 This book was incredably boring. Reading it felt like a miserable task. I almost feel like the author wrote in such a way to make themselves sound smarter. To be fair I only read half of it. It felt like such a chore to read I would have actually prefered to read transcripts from C-Span instead. 
 I don't have academic training on philosophy argument and thus the book becomes a long and winding essay that is difficult to grasp.  You can read the first chapter from http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/titles/7749.html and see if this is the kind of books you would like 
 Manfred B. Steger fails at providing an introduction to the topic known as globalization. This book starts out looking like a basic explanation of what globlization is and why it is happening. However it quickly turns into a tirade about how "bad" globalization is and how it is a U.S. plot of some sort. I am disapointed with this book becuase I was looking for easy to read basic pro vs con explanation. Steger also discusses some advanced topics which he may not explain correctly or completely. All of his arguments or either anti-globlization or extreme anti-globlization. Steger goes as far to say what Bin Laden does is good becuase is slows the globilization process 
 This is a ho-hum buddy picture about a bunch of guys driving aimlessly around the west for "one last fandango" before they get drafted. Most of their time is spent ragging on one guy, "pheelyp," to the point where one wonders why he is friends with the other three. The peril of Vietnam hangs in the background while these dopes carry on with their fake Texas accents. Passable popcorn fun if you've got nothing better to do.  
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 The late Julian L. Simon who decimated (and won a bet) with Paul Ehrlich summed up Mr. Gore's effort quite nicely: "The book is as ignorant a collection of cliches as anything ever published on the subject."  And, "Just about every assertion  in the book points in the wrong direction - suggesting that  conditions are getting worse rather than better, which they are."  Mr. Simon then discusses the following subjects on which Mr. Gore was WRONG:  soil erosion; hardwood trees; DDT; Agent Orange; Love Canal.  Finally, Mr. Simon states:  "And the entire book is filled with this sort of environmental gossip, backed by no sources, and contradicted by solid data."     These quotes are from Mr. Simon's "Hoodwinking the Nation" which has some excellent chapters on "media shaped opinion" and the mis-use of statistics, sampling techniques and data which every citizen should read 
 If you like the "women make a mess of their lives but survive it anyway" type of book, you might like this.  Personally, I'm tired of that same old sad song of women choosing to let themselves become whiney victim love songs 
 What if I had made a horror movie in high school? It would have gone something like this..  My best friend Tara, an aspiring thespian who can fake cry really well, would be my star.  Before filming, we'd make sure to touch up Tara's delicious golden locks.  Oooops, A little bit too much bleach!   My story would revolve around a group of teenagers trapped in a strange house where they'd stumble upon an eerie, comatatose man wearing a bathing suit (Tom from the swim team would be a perfect fit...of course we'd have to shave his head...I wonder if he'd be willing?). The strange house will be dark and water will be dripping from everywhere, maybe in slow motion.  Tara and my other friends/actors will be extremely dim witted, and mostly deaf so that they can't hear each other very well.  My characters will then die one by one in entirely standard an unoriginal death sequences.  I'll think of some totally absurd story to tie everything together later, but it is sure to be absolutely terrifying. I'll save money by using a lot of stock footage, staging the car accident just "after" the accident occurs, and  scoring the music myself on my Casio at home.   Genius.  I'm going to be the most popular guy in school 
 Philip Slater puts forth with vehemence and passion his opinions on the trends of hyperconsumerism and overindependence that are driving rifts between the people of our nation and diverting much-needed resources from  instituations designed to create health and well-being. His observations  about how middle-class Americans are alienating themselves by placing far  too much emphasis on material possessions, individualistic thought ("I  am different from all of you"), and an economy that is powerfully  rooted in the need to simply consume and produce goods rather than increase  the quality of life are interesting, though a bit dated, and still hold  much relevance to the current situation today.    Still, the phenomena he  rages against are nothing new to the conscientious among us, and there are  many other views on the problems of loneliness and hyperconsumerism that  prey on us. Slater makes powerful points, and he clearly has a deep desire  to see change and the end of the injustices that characterize our century,  but I found his writing style and thought process to be scattered and far  too extremist to inspire me. His book seemed less of an empirical analysis  of the problems facing our nation and what we can do to solve them and more  of an emotional rant about what he personally feels is wrong and where he  feels we all went wrong. Nothing bad about that, it's just he seems so  angry and hurt about it all that he didn't come close to capturing me  (though the chapter about Vietnam and the last chapter were coming close).      It was a good book, but there are far better books written by far more  inspirational people. Carl Rogers ("On Becoming a Person") was a  psychologist who spoke beautifully and wisely for the healing of the  isolation and misunderstandings in our relationships with each other.  Barbara Marx Hubbard ("Conscious Evolution: Awakening the Power of Our  Social Potential") writes convincingly and with an uplifting sense of  hope about the problems we face as a people and a culture and what we can  do in the coming decades to move in the direction that Philip Slater longed  for. Both these authors, and many others, rationally describe problems we  all face, then offer warm and well though-out advice about what we can all  do. Slater seems like something of a ranter, and reading his book only  depressed me. But hey, read the book, then move on. Good luck 
 Only", the second single from "With Teeth", has something in common with its predecessor-- its of limited value. I picked it up and was pretty disappointed.  The single itself, "Only", isn't one of the ones I particularly enjoy on the album-- its got a nice enough funky bass line and drum beat, but Reznor's sing-speak "Down In It" styled vocal grates and the piece doesn't particularly hold my interest. Certainly it lacks the immediacy of "Down In It", and I'm generally inclined to want Reznor to look forward, not backward.  The b-sides aren't much better-- the DFA mix of "The Hand That Feeds" is yet another remix, this one pretty much a full techno mix. It's quite different, replete with an odd panting sample that gets somewhat irritating as the piece never ends (it rambles on for well over seven minutes). The live version of "Love is Not Enough" is the only saving grace on the single-- while its not one of the better songs on the record, its decent enough, and live it got bigger. The arrangement is the same, but its more direct and in your face.  For the casual listener, skip this one. The fan will be buying it regardless of what I say, but it's in line with the recent singles, not the older (and superior) ones 
 I had to read this book in high school and this book is a sure way to turn off students from so-called literature.  It's just page after page of agonizing self-analysis and reflection.  The more I read, the less I cared, and the more I cheered for Hagar to end the flow of pretentious garbage by killing herself, thus putting both of us out of our misery 
 Under no circumstances will I recommend this book for first time learners of the German language. Its poorly structured and fails to thoroughly introduce nerw learners to german grammar. If one has a background in German, then the book will be good for them but if one desires to learn for translation purposes, then this book is not for you. Furthermore, i was alarmed at the inclusion of very many imperialistic german passages....!! 
 This book does not cover many topics.   For example there is a whole section on co-existing with Exg 5.5 but no where in the book does it tell you how to remove your dependence on exchange 5.5.   Also does not cover the installtion of EXG2000 in the Backoffice 2000 package 
 I was disappointed in what seemed like a promising book about chronic illness and coping. There are more useful books out there, like "JUST FINE: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain" ..which is also a recent release.   This one seemed like a journal, but didn't offer a great deal of practical or unique advice other than someone's personal journey 
 I got about 40% through it, but couldn't make myself finish this one, since I just couldn't care about the protagonist. Grace Archer is a control freak. That causes her to make foolish decisions. She has trouble accepting help when she's in over her head. If she were family, you'd stick by her. If she's only a character in a book, you might just close the book and say, "Enough!" I did 
 I received the wrong size originally. The company was prompt in sending me another dress, however, I received a third dress which I refused by mail and I am trying to get my credit card adjusted.  The dress is lovely 
 I got this for my 5 year old. After a few hours, it stopped working. Even before that, it was too fast to be controllable, even for me. My kids got a laugh out of it but couldn't really play with it. We returned the first one, got the second, and it never worked. I had enough spending shipping costs each time and gave up 
 These did nothing for me. Ask your doctor about aphthasol, a prescription drug approved by the FDA -- which means it's passed rigorous government testing standards. Aphthasol changed my life 
 Wanted more scientific information.  How Cayenne works?  How to mix it?  Dosages and recipes  for its use.  Was totally disappointed!! 
 Don't buy this compass if you need to know any direction. If you know about where the sun sets, you will be more accurate than this "compass." It is impossible to use in the field. A waste of money: inaccurate to the max, impossible to maintain it level, etc. Just junk. They should give them away 
 Poor video quality, extra thrill section lame, it like one big advertisement rather then detailed clips of passes and crashes. I have 2004 dvd which is much better. Don't buy 2006 
 To let you know where I am coming from, I am out of shape and fat. I wanted a primer to increase flexibility before starting into more serious exercise. I would have thought that a video which had both stretching and flexibility in the title would have systematically and progressively worked on each major group of muscles - this one doesn't. Session one has breathing instructions while session two doesn't. As a beginner, it helps to be reminded to breathe. Rodney Yee's videos seem to be better at involving the whole body and the exercises flow together 
 I saw this movie in a trip and it is one of the worst movies I have seen during the last two years. Stupid, stupid and stupid. Ryan Reynolds becomes annoying.  If you have brain, never watch this movi 
 I did not like the book because it skip around too much between characters. I could not understand the characters. It wasn't really abour roller skating.  I just wanted to read about roller skating 
 The problem with Karajan is that late in his career, he seems to look for the inventive by doing some extreme things with the music he is well capable of conducting. Although these recordings of the 4-6 of the Tchaikovsky symphonies were done in the seventies, the greatly exaggerated tempi is one of those features of his style that will drive you mad as a Russian afficionado.  For the price this is going, I was convinced to have a good deal, only to be disappointed by the resultive playing. You wouldn't expect such a renowned conductor and orchestra slander through such well known classical pieces, but unfortunately, that's what you get here.   Therefore, I'd recommend taking either the Gergiev or Jansons for the 5th, while Pletnev for the 6th remains the best choice still. For the 4th, Jansons seems to be the best bet too.  But, please, do yourself a favour, and let this Russian master delight you in a better way than these recordings can offer you. You'll be thankful, I'm sure 
 As below, this book does not include birds in the other peterson guides.  Far better books are out there 
 This book is an excellent reference book for the serious ghost hunter / paranormal investigator. Provides good case histories as well as "ghost stories" that can be used as examples on investigations 
 I am married to a Marine officer who is currently deployed to Iraq for the second time.  As you can imagine, most of our friends are also Marine families.  Additionally, my mother-in-law was a Marine wife for 35 years.  This book is not representative of myself, my mother-in-law, or of ANY military spouse either of us know.  Do not look to this book for an accurate impression of military life.    I don't want to slam Ms Smiley.  She is entitled to her own life experiences.  HOWEVER, they are not typical "military spouse" experiences (far from it) so I am writing this review to make sure potential readers aren't duped into thinking this will give insight into the military life.  It doesn't, and it won't.  The spouses I know are the anti-Smiley.  The spouses I know are educated, capable, strong, witty, caring, giving, women.  The spouses I know would never behave this cowardly toward their military service member or be this careless with their marriages.  I shudder to think that readers would think that she represents me, or any other spouse I know.    DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK if you want to learn real, interesting things about the military.  Read "Making The Corps" instead.    Do not read this book if you like inspired, compelling story-lines.  Regardless of the military angle, the story is weak and the writing is bad.  Am I qualified to judge a good book?  Maybe.  I read about 25 books a year and I am fairly well aquainted with the best seller lists.  In the end, though, it's all about your personal taste.  Read this book if you like non-best-seller-list chic lit 
 While I really have nothing against her publishing books and sharing her recipes, it is absolutely necessary that we be subjected to a daily talk show?  I have never really seen the show, but if the commercials are any introduction, she just seems really obnoxious, dull, and just plain boring.  I don't really see where she brings anything new and exciting to the table, and her voice sounds almost like chalk screeching across a blackboard.  Please, oh please, make this woman go back to the Food Network where she belongs 
 There seemed to be no beginning or middle.  No idea if there was an end because I couldn't finish it.  I kept nodding off until one of those "cybernotes" numbers popped up, the ones us gentle readers were superciliously instructed to download early in the book, or have "a friend" download them if we didn't have internet access nor particularly cared.  I got no real sense of time and place despite all the references to clothing, food and what came over Mr. Kane's short-wave.  There was little real content and way too many bloated words. I couldn't like any of the characters at all-- the ones that had any development.  Ruby LaPointe is a self-centered, vain whiner and Jean-Luc is an insufferable know-it-all stuck parenting her.  Anne-Marie barely exists unless she's taking tap-dance lessons or Ruby gets aggravated at her for having the nerve to be sleepy at midnight because Ruby just had to drag the kids to a "dish night" movie on a school night.  Does Anne-Marie even go to school and if so, where?  I probably missed that somewhere in the cloud of bloated words that showed me little.  I glanced at the cybernotes.  I don't recommend reading them unless you want to be textually condescended to and don't mind multiple spelling errors (H.L. Menkin and the Barring Land Bridge?) 
 One day in Villeperce, Tom Ripley is followed by an American teen-aged boy of 16 who calls himself Billy Rollins. He is currently working as a gardener with Madame Jeanne Boutin and claims to have read about Tom Ripley in the newspapers in the States. But Tom soon discovers that the boy is in fact Frank Pierson, the son of an American food magnate from Maine, who detested his father so profoundly that he killed him by pushing his wheelchair over the top of a cliff. Frank's mother Lily sent a private detective to France to look for the missing son... A weak story line, unbelievable situations, characters who behave in a ridiculous fashion and plenty of clichs about Germany, Berlin and the gay scene are all aspects which contribute to the bad quality of this poorly designed suspense story. Neither "The Boy Who Followed Ripley" nor "Ripley Underground" nor "Ripley Underwater" match the original "The Talented Mr Ripley". Readers would be well advised to enjoy the latter and then forget any novel bearing the name "Ripley". 
 No doubt most Christians will be entertained by this read.  Eadie asserts that all people may not come to know Christ as the savior in this life but that they "must" accept his love in the next.  The implications of a continued denial are not addressed (along with many other things she supposedly gained insight toward).  I don't necessarily disagree with or discount Ms. Eadie's account, I simply find it to be overtly biased.  Her explanation of our ability to reconnect with past lives with the usage of hypnosis is in a word, weak.  She explains it as "cell memory."  This I've never debated but, she goes on to assert that reincarnation does not exist, which left me wondering just what are we remembering then.  She contradicts herself greatly here. I would never call Ms. Eadie a liar, I don't believe that at all.  What I do believe is that we all have our own Truths.  For Ms. Eadie, her core truth is that Jesus Christ is the "Lord and Savior" of this earth.  Perhaps this is why it was He who appeared to her on the Other Side.  Perhaps on the inverse Jews will be greeted by Abraham and Moses, and Muslims by their greatest prophet, Mohammed.  I also have a problem with Ms. Eadie's small punch at abortion, saying that it is "against natural law."  Again, I respect all opinions and don't negate any, but this theory seems contrary to her general theme that we choose our lives and the time we spend on this earth.  Nothing happens without our having pre-mortal knowledge of it she argues.  Thus, does it not make sense that the life that is given up to abortion chose that path as well?  Perhaps in its sacrifice, the mother gains some knowledge or truth?  Also, I suspect Catholics and other non-Mormon Christian churches will not like Ms. Eadie's testament that Jesus and God are not one and that there is no Trinity.  Also, I'm not so sure about her recounting of demons visiting her in the nights following her return from heaven.  There's an over-emphasis on Satan in the memoir in my opinion.  At one point she recounts seeing "huge" angels clothed in armor and head gear and she knows that they're going to fight the demons of Hell.  This to me is where her upbringing takes flight.  I myself choose to believe that God and "the Devil" cannot coexist; that there is only God and He/She/It is utterly whole and all that this world needs.  Again, I discount nothing Ms. Eadie attains, I merely believe we must all reach our own truths regarding the Other Side, which I have no doubt exists and no doubt that it, and God, are pure love.  It's a nice book that I read in about three and half hours.  It preaches love and compassion, but then, we should already know that 
 Ugh! Worst narrator ever. Strange forced affectation and laughable accents and voices. As far as the book is concerned,I read the book a long time ago and enjoyed it for what it was--a mystery/thriller--not a piece of art. I enjoyed the whole trilogy in fact. This narrator is killing it for me though. I wouldn't be able to stand another Ellroy or any author for that matter, with this guy. He might be good in a different genre but this just sounds forced and odd. I wonder how Ellroy feels about this recording. 
 ...for fifty cents, and I would say I probably got my money's worth.  Although the critic who said, "reads like a third-rate middle school book report" might be exaggerating a little, he wasn't exaggerating much.  Also, the book devotes an inordinate amount of time to obscure topics which have not proven to be worth their salt to have more than brief mention in many evolution texts: computer models, evolutionary psychology, and the Theory of Complexity.  There are far more interesting and important issues to discuss.  Morris does a good job of not taking any sides to any of the arguments he presents, as a consequence creating doldrums for over much of the book.  If you must choose between reading this book, taking the wife out shopping all day at the mall, or sawing off your hand with a miter saw, by all means read this book!  However, this is one of the worst pop-science books in this genre that I have read 
 It works great when it's charged, but keeping a charge is difficult. I experienced the same as a previous review - even with a full charge it drains very quickly when being used - no more than 5 minutes. 
 the book was ok. I thought that it would have more literacy activities than it ha 
 Very disappointing. The Harvard name and logo can be so deceiving. The first half of the book is spent endorsing the Harvard Entrepreneurs Club, it's members and the author. The actual content is rather lame. If you are absolutely new to the world of business, and you need the definition of CUSTOMER explained to you, maybe you'll learn a little from this book. There are so many good Business Start-Up books available. My advice is to give this one a miss 
 f*cking annoying. There are _NO_ controls on the radio itself, you _HAVE_ to use the remote. Your remote battery died? too bad, the radio is completely nonfunctional without the remote (can't even turn it on/off). Also, aux-in is a headphone jack instead of the standard red and white on all stereos, you you have to buy a special (headphone plug on both sides)cable to hook up a computer or ipod to it 
 Somewhere along the way a friend or well meaning fan told Rusty Zinn he should focus more on his singing and less on guitar...Bad idea...Zinn is an expert at aping blues guitar heros of yesterday but has never truely found a style of his own . His singing while well meaning and certinaly better than some of his other guitar hero peers it is not up to the material he has chosen here . As of late urban contemporary black radio is actually giving airplay to a whole new group of talented performers that sing and believe it or not play instruments . If you are really interested in  the forms of music Zinn is attempting I would suggest going to the R&B section of your favorite record store or shop Amazon for some of the incredible neosoul that is out today...I strongly suggest for reggae the band Culture and for deep soul check out KC and JOJO John Legend and Angie Stone  
 In an effort to better understand the current market in Christian publishing, I picked up a copy of _Presumed Guilty_. The story, as revealed in the book jacket, appeared to push the envelope for Christian fiction, so I bit.  At about seventy pages, I nearly put the book down. And I never give up on books, no matter how bad.  Much has been said about the state of Christian fiction today. A call has gone out to make stories "grittier"; if Bell's book is indicative, grittiness has been achieved. But writing stories that push the limits of tawdriness can't spell success in itself. Bell's story of a pastor's dalliance with a pornstar and the fallout from that indiscretion is about as sleazy as it gets without being clinical in detail or overtly titillating. Christian publishers still have a standard to meet.  What makes a story successful is strong characterization, a believability that makes it possible for the reader to identify with the characters, a well-told tale, and in Christian fiction, a greater understanding of the world God has given us. Most of all, the quality of writing--word choices, phrasing, etc.--must be high. Those elements make or break a story. Sadly, they broke _Presumed Guilty_.   Reader identification--on any level--simply vanishes in this story. We see plenty of reactions to events that swirl around Pastor Ron Hamilton, his wife Dallas, and their two adult children, but most readers will need to ignore understanding any of their motivations. The characters reacted to countless events around them, but most normal people would have gone a different direction and had better reasons for doing so.  Despite the nature of the story, the characters suffer from a generic Christianity written to appeal to the broadest swath of Christian belief. This problem plagues most Christian fiction today. Again, push too hard and readers will complain if Christian characters aren't "Christian" enough. In _Presumed Guilty_, the wife, knowing she's neglected the intimate part of her marriage, tries to woo her husband back by slipping into a pair of tight jeans and pouring a couple glasses of sparkling apple cider. No slinky lingerie? No champagne? Bell has her husband out in a motel room with a pornstar, but he can't push the boundaries on how he writes that Christian wife back home.  This is a common problem. It offers a plastic Christianity that has no place for Christians to be...well, real people. The underlying message is that you can't be a Christian and drink wine or wear lingerie, even if solidly orthodox Christians in the real world do such things. Such is the nature of the market right now.  Characterization issues aren't the only problem. The story here borders on fantasy. Deus ex machina elements abound, especially in the sub-plot about the son. Also, key bad guys soften a little too easily. As for the ending, it's about as contrived as can be. Nor was I a fan of the general writing. Bell's descriptions are simplistic, his writing chokes on repetitive "subject/verb/predicate" constructions, and he commits the unpardonable sin of loading this book with the verb "is" and all its tenses. Good writing? Hardly.  The book saves itself from a one-star review on Bell's ability to juggle a complex set of story elements. A lesser author would have struggled to keep all the plates spinning, but Bell wraps up every plot point and leaves no dangling issues. For readers who hate to see sub-plots up and blow away, that's refreshing.  A fair book. It definitely pushed the boundaries of what stories are tellable in Christian fiction, even if it fails to give us characters who are indicative of other streams of thought and action within the broader base of Christianity. I'm a bit tired of seeing the same 2-D Christian characters and their predictable moral responses to life, even when that life is spinning madly out of control as in _Presumed Guilty_. If Christian authors do better in this regard, perhaps the readership will not only get better books, but a wider perspective on the Christian life and how to live it

 By all means, use these methods.  Embrace his ideas.  (Beat your dog, too, while you're at it.)  My 'Christian' parents did. I learned fear - certainly not respect.  Haven't spoken to them in 25 years.  Good riddance 
 Go buy " Bridges ", " Steel Wheels " and avoid the God Awful " Voodoo Lounge "  and don't waste your time with this rehash of " Bridges " " Steel Wheels " and the God Awful " Voodoo Lounge  
 It all depends on who you are if you will like this book.  Republicans will like it but Democrats or people with brains won't. 
 After reading several reviews, I only read one that was negative. I concurred that perhaps one person just had different needs.  Well, as soon as I opened the package I realized just how right the negative review was.  This book stand would hold up a children's soft cover back.  Any of my school books are not stably supported.    I would actually have to hold up the sides of the book to read the pages.  Unless you have thinner hard back textbooks (the hard back will support the pages), this is not worth buying (especially not for $20.00).  Make sure you realize just how small this bookstand is. If that is with you need, then this is the one for you.  
 Is "Ladykillers" a buddy-caper movie? Is it a religious metaphor? Is it a quirky comedy with supernatural overtones? Is it "Reservoir Dogs"? Is it a star-making turn about an unforgettable character?  It apparently tries to be all these things.   What it ACTUALLY is is an unfunny, schizophrenic, mean-spirited mess.   The movie starts out with great promise. Tom Hanks stars as what appears to be a somewhat-pompous, Edgar Allan Poe-quoting, Colonel Sanders vest-wearing, over-educated, genteel Southern professor of Renaissance music. What he actually is is a (still-likable) con-man and swindler. At least, that's what he starts out as at the beginning of the film. His dialogue is supurb, his accent and portrayal spot-on.   He decides he wants to rob a casino. In order to do this he devises a scheme to tunnel into the casino's counting room from underground. To fascilitate his plan, he lets a room in an old woman's house close to the casino, and convinces his landlady that he actually needs her basement to practice with his band of musicians. He cobbles together an unlikely assemblage of partners in crime, which include a Chinese general who has a Hitler complex (he even has a Hitler mustache), a strange jack-of-all-trades and explosives expert who can't stop farting, a stupid football player to do the digging, and Marlon Wayans, who plays the beyond-stereotypical black thug who loves rap music and constantly threatens to shoot people with his gun while yelling expletives. The Chinese general has a total dialogue of four words the entire movie (I'm not kidding, I counted!) and the football player about 12. What the point of those two characters was I'm not really sure.  Now, you'd think that with such a motley crew, there would be slapstick humor galore. Well, nope. There are "incidents" which often revolve around farting, one scene where a guy blows his finger off with explosives (I THINK that was supposed to be funny---it's tough to tell) and a lot of scenes with Mr Wayans saying "F-this" and "F-that" while waving his gun around.   Still, for the first 75% of the movie, I was still fascinated--simply because Tom Hanks' character is so unique and so memorable. His genteel humor and dialogue (which seems to come directly out of PhD theses on esoteric medieval literature, Rococo music theory and Edgar Allan Poe) and his portrayal of such is fascinating. Unfortunately, even that is not enough to carry the movie, as it loses focus and becomes mean-spirited about 3/4 though the movie.  After what appears to be an attempt at a quirky buddy-caper flick, about 3/4 through the robbers decide that it is necessary to kill their landlady. They are very serious about this. Suddenly things aren't funny anymore. Marlon Wayans' character gets killed in a struggle with the farting explosives expert after he attempts to kill the landlady. This is not funny. He is not killed in a funny way--- and why is there suddenly killing anyway, when the tone of the movie up to that point had been slapstick humor? They dump his body off a bridge onto a garbage barge going down the river. Not long afterwards, the Chinese general kills the explosives expert by choking him graphically with piano wire while he is farting. Apparently this is also supposed to be funny --- but is actually extremely not funny. It is sick and disturbing. They dump his body off the bridge onto a garbage barge going down a river. Soon after the Chinese general tries to kill the landlady and kills himself by accidentally falling down the stairs. Body to garbage barge. Tom Hanks tries to convince the football player to kill the landlady. He refuses, but accidentally shoots himself in the face with the gun while on the bridge. His body falls of it's own volition onto the garbage barge. This is extremely graphic, violent and not funny. Finally, a head of a gargoyle falls off the bridge and hits Tom Hanks on the head, and his body falls into the garbarge barge, too. Everyone's dead. The landlady keeps the money.   What's the point?  If it wasn't for the quirky performance Tom Hanks gave, this would have been a one-star for me.   Avoid it unless you're stuck on an airplane or are a big Tom Hanks fan. 
 Every Lakers fan I've ever met lives in the past sadly now.  To them, the clock stopped when Kareem and Magic hung up the shoes [and we know why Magic had to leave].  Their basketball knowledge from the 60s to the 90s is rewarding.  After this, however, they don't have a clue of what has happened to this once mighty and moral organization. The Lakers have been a good team over the decades [as apparent on this DVD set], but the run of greatness is coming to a LONG slide with Kobe driving the Bus.  The Lakers were once considered the Green Bay Packers of the NFL, but now they're just lucky to even get close to a playoff spot over a majority of the teams in the Western Conference which are much better than the present Lakers. I recently attended a game last Fall at the Staples Center, and besides all of the celebs eating hummus in the stands, I could barely hear myself think over Phil Jackson's mantra "I told you so." Further illustrating how things have changed in LA, Jack Nicholson has become embarrassed to wear anything purple or yellow. So it is understandable that Laker fans would rather focus on the achievements of Magic and Kareem, than rather extol the diminishing skills of Kobe since his Colorado folly.   There are some good games on this DVD along with great moments from the Baylor, Chamberlain, West days.  I recommend any Laker fan to purchase this DVD set to relive the past. So Laker fans, keep living in the past if you so desire.  Maybe Kobe will retire and become a man of the cloth and lead the Lakers to the NBA Championship promised land once again. Long live the Forum [or the Staple Remover Center] or whatever they are calling the Lakers home now 
 I have used my venus razor since they 1st came on the market and I have always loved it, so when the breeze came out I was so excited to have the gel included.  Well the 1st use was great, not problems except a lil slippery.  The 2nd and 3rd use, gave me the worst razor burn I have ever had!!! THis razor is aweful and painful.  I have written the company to tell them this too!! Do not waste your money and the health of your legs 
 Why, oh why do you advertise the 1979 version of Crime & Punishment with John Hurt, using the pictures from the 2002 version starring the sublime John Simm. I would download the 2002 version all day, everyday but the misleading pictures are really unfair. Either offer me the version I want, or get the pictures right 
 I found the characters to be mostly caricatures; there's no sense that any of them are actual human beings. As a result, there's no change -they're static, and whatever changes they supposedly go through feel completely unbelievable. And while much of the book focuses on how different classes don't truly see each other, Forster commits that same sin himself by ignoring the poorest family in the book, the Basts. Instead of making them seem real, he reduces them to mere plot devices.  In addition, Forster, a product of his time, is given to making sweeping pronouncements about the human race. Again, if he intended some irony here (as, for example, Jane Austen, who was so good at shading her prose with those kinds of hints), I'd think better of this book. Novels typically rely on either a solid plot (i.e., the stuff that's happening) or on solid characters (i.e., the stuff that happens in people's inner lives) or both to carry the reader through. I found neither here. At the very least I would like to feel the author's genuine love of language; I can forgive a bad book if it's exceptionally written. I didn't find that kind of prose here. You can skip a good third of the pages and lose nothing 
 Didn't like this product. All of the actual "scrub" (salt) is at the top and minimal.  Felt like I would've been better off mixing some olive oil and actual sea salt to give myself a good scrub.  It did smell nice and I like the packaging 
 When I received the item the box was busted open and all the cookies in both packages were crushed up.  One of the packages was open and leaking cookies dust all over my car when I pulled it out of the mailing box.  On top of that the one or two cookies that were salvaged were stale!  Ill never order anything from this company again!!!  My entire $11.00 went down the tubes.  What a waste!!! 
 Avoid this at all costs.  This is one of the worst films ever made.  Absolute, dreadful (...).  For a slasher/horror flick their's not much killing or gore... untilt he very end.  So you have to sit through an hour and a half of hilariously confusing monologues to get to the good stuff.  The sotry doesn't make sense and the acting is ridiculously over the top (this is Children of the Corn part 6, not Schindler's List).  Watch parts 2, 3, and 7... those are fun, gory, entertaining, well made (ok 3 and 7's FX (...)) flicks.  Avoid this film like the plague 
 This may be a very essential book for hard core cooks who have a lot of money to buy the grocery's needed. I read it and made one recipe from it. The book has been sitting on my shelf ever sence. There are many other, books out there that are better then this one 
 Grant's Dissector leaves much to be desired.  The dissection instructions are not all that clear nor are the drawings that great.  It seems to skip around a lot with the dissection.  It also mentions a lot of structures to look for which aren't in the drawings.  I would recommend the authors reconsider their layout.  I would also consider looking at other dissectors if you are looking to buy one 
 Don't let this review get you down on the band. There is surely some good music here. But only on the opening of this CD. After that, its downhill. Nothing Horrible. Just not mentionable. Buy Yoshime if you want a Great CD. The newer Mystics is good, Soft B. should be a pickup (not the first one). Simple. Buy Yoshime. Its there best effort hands down. The others will follow. This one will not be played, unless you burn and take the first track off it. 
 If I am not mistaken,this is Jonathan Kellerman's third book involving a suspect religious cult.  It gets a little tiresome.  The plot was not as suspenseful as his books usually are.  But it is easy reading, and the writing is entertaining enough to read if you are a Jonathan Kellerman fan 
 This book is a disappointment.  It provides little insight into the life or personality of Robert Redford, the actor or the person.  The book is basically a chronicle of the movies RR has directed or in which he has appeared as an actor.  But even as a filmography the book fails.  The reader learns little about the creation of each movie or the relationships among the actors beyond the anecdotes that have been repeated numerous times on TV or in the press.  In addition, the authors have the annoying habit of consistently putting down Robert Redford with snide remarks.  There must have been something about the actor other than his white teeth and good looks that made him an international superstar.  For sure, it must be difficult to write a biography of such a private person as Robert Redford.  However, it is the responsibility of biographers to gather information and gain an understanding of their subject, and if they can't do so, then there is no book 
 This movie was horrible. I am sorry I purchased it. It was like watching an old B movie with a low budget and bad acting. I got the feeling it was strictly a venue for the writer/director to view and film [...]. 
 If you have large breast be prepaired to keep fixing them so they stay in. I bought this while I was pregnant to contain sore breast while sleeping. I woke several times in the middle of the night to adjust myself.Make sure you get the right size. I think I could have gone a size smaller, but I still think gravity would've won 
 A British-born Australian immigrant publishes his results about gay immigration to Australia.  Gay immigration is a very urgent issue and I'm glad the matter is being documented.  But this book left me so sad and dissatisfied.  On the one hand, activists globally can learn from Austalia's example.  This book starts with a decent chapter on the history of gay Australian immigration.  This was also a longitudinal study: something you rarely find in sexual orientation-related research.  However, the book is very sloppily-written.  It reads like a scrapbook or diary.  So many of his discussions are internal and unimportant.  There's no way an American scholar could get tenure with a book like this.  Usually, I praise gay male authors that remember to include lesbians in their research.  But the lesbians involved in the study get scant mention and thus become negligible.  Like studies of gay Asians in white-dominated countries throughout the world, this text is filled with cute, young Asian guys having no choice but to partner with size-, age-, and looks-challenged white mates.  This book will kinda rub the younger non-Eurocentric gay men of color the wrong way.  You would think that binational gay couples have risked thick and thin to be together.  In this book, the Australian officials encourage gay couples to cheat on their applications and all kinds of pairs that have no intention of staying together apply for couple status.  Most every respondent said the immigration controversy is affecting their health negatively.  Further, the author says things about his long-term partner that no spouse should say about another in print.  There's no bigamy allowed in Australia for straight citizens, yet the author is not fazed in the least to apply for immigration status for his Thai extra lover.  Worse, he gets mad when he finds that his Thai lover is cheating but never criticizes himself for cheating on his first lover with the Thai national.  Bottom line:  America is so far away from enacting gay immigration (which is a shame) and this book will do NOTHING to help that goal happen, as poor and tragic as this work is 
 I read the promising reviews and found the story's premise interesting, but what a let down. I eagerly read the first few chapters and then discovered that the author really didn't have much more to say. Oh, he kept building his characters into what should have become some sort of crescendo, but sadly there was none, and the plot simply fizzled out and died. On the last twenty pages or so, I found myself skipping over whole paragraphs in a vain search for something interesting to happen. I couldn't wait for the main character to die so I could finally understand the ultimate reality the author, no doubt, was going to reveal in the end. It seems the author simply got tired of rambling on about the characters and decided to hastily bail out 
 Terrible. I LOVE alternative music, but this trash is hardly worth listening to.  I understand this is "experimental" and "innovational" but it is a loose can of worms. None of the music is melodic. Some of the riffs are pretty neat with interesting rhythems and intruiging sounds but when Thurston Moore or Kim Gordon (who was 39 when this was recorded. Waaaay past her prime if you ask me) tries to sing, it all falls apart.   The guitarists are very, very talented and deserve recognition. But, honestly, I can't see how they can't be like the Pixies and be talented but produce GOOD and LISTENABLE music at the same time. I gave it 2 stars because "Drunken Butterfly" Is an awesome song and actually worth listening to all the way through 
 I guess I thought I was going to get an intelligent book about the subject of  extraterrestrial contact in ancient India. I began to have doubts about that as soon as I began reading the forward by Whitley  Streiber . I should have stopped there. This book is a complete waste of money and time. It's a rehash of famous UfO and close encounter reports mixed in with a few excerpts from ancient Hindu texts and some information about Hindu religion. It's strictly for people who like to use the subject of alien contact to reinforce their prevailing religious beliefs 
    You know smart kids are passed off as nerds in school and then they become unhappy losers? I know it's sad, but, do you want your little one to turn out like that? Lose all confidence, then end up at some street corner asking for money? Since I doubt it, I highly do not recommend this problem.  [NOTE: By the way, I am an adult and I do not know some of these questions. Don't know how a 8-year-old would.]    YOUR LOCAL CRAZY MONKEY, Trevor Tankia 
 I ordered this device based upon good reviews of the first model. Installation went fine and the device works almost as expected. The problem is that Slingmedia, without notifying customers or potential costomers has downgraded functionality.   The new devices (and the old models which incorporate new firmware) now utilize an encrypted stream. This breaks programs such as "At Large Recorder" which let me record my TV material for my review at a time of my choice.  Since I travel abroad a lot, I have a great need to be able to place and time shift. Sitting in a hotel in Tokyo at 6:00p.m., I'm not much interested in watching what is on in the US at 3:00a.m.!  I'd advise looking at other solutions. I think it is very irresponsible of Slingmedia to have introduced this dramatic reduction in function without telling customers they would be getting less than in the past 
 i wish i had seen that guy from swedens review before i bought that book.. i must agree with him.. from the first page i was reading incorrect information.. i will be returning this book for sure. i was all excited to get the book and when i saw incorrect information in first page, i went to the part about dahmer (about whom i have read a lot of books) and the info there was not consistant w/other books on him. i would like to know where they got some of their information for this book. it reminds me of another bad book 'cannibal killers' by moira martingale. if you want to read a really decent, accurate book... read a book by john douglas or robert ressler!! 
 The author of this book is a gynecologist that must own stock in Premarin! Through out the book he advocates the use of prescription hormones, especially estrogen, to deal with all the problems of midlife sexuality. He has a quick couple of pages on herbs and supplements, but does not really recommend them. He also "goes off" on the terms natural estrogen verses synthetic estrogen. His reasoning is that Premarin which is made from pregnant horses urine is a natural substance, afterall it is natural to horses. Well, the last time I checked I wasn't a pregnant horse! If you are looking for answers to the sexual problems that plague us all as we age and do not want to take prescription hormones, do not waste your money on this book. His answer to everthing is to take estrogen, progesterone and testosterone. In the authors own words, you must "use it or loose it" and taking estrogen and testosterone will enable you to still use it 
 The book starts out reasonably well enough, with Davidson drawing you into the overview of the life of Carl Sagan's parents.  But as the book progresses, you begin to see another side to the story of Sagan's life that you weren't expecting.  Davidson doesn't hesitate to make broad generalizations and interpretations of his interviews with people in Sagan's life, even making borderline psychoanalytical conclusions to explain his behavior when Davidson is clearly not qualified in this area.  There were several points where I read a line and found myself just staring at the book with a gaping jaw and a sense of incredulility, wondering how he could make such a strange conclusion.  For example, when he discussed Sagan's novel Contact, it quickly became apparant that Davidson hadn't even read the book or he wouldn't be making such strange interpretations of the book's plot.  Additionally, Davidson's writing is incredibly simplistic; although it may appear vivid and engaging on the surface, it is full of groan-inducing cliches and overdramatized descriptions of events.  This, in combination with his purely speculative conclusions on Sagan's personality, made me want to vomit.  Overall, although I was able to glimpse a small part of what made Carl Sagan so special and see a somewhat decent overview of the events in his life, I feel I was getting a blurry and distorted picture of who the man really was 
 On the front page The Times is quoted to have written: "Extremely funny!". I didn't have one laugh. Not even a smile. I think that says it all. Let me add that the writing is not bad, but the main theme of the book is almost stupid, sometimes disgusting and certainly boring. And the story contrived and exaggerated. The background story of the Ukrainian family having suffered through the Stalin's regime and WWII concentration camps is more interesting, but is too sporadic to improve the overall impression 
 If you think you will actually learn how to fabricate something, you will be disappointed. It is not a HOW-TO book at all. It's nothing more than a listing of monster garage projects describing things they built. Most is a self-aggrandizement description of how great they are and the wild big stuff they built. Some don't even have a picture of the project. A better title is " Some stuff we built on Monster Garage". There are no tricks of the trade, nothing new or enlightening, most stuff can't be built by the average tinkerer anyhow because of the enormous tool arsenal required. A total waste. Sorry     
 Ok, this was the last Jacksons lp and I don't understand why this was their best selling, compared to the gem Destiny and super giant Truimph.  My father bought this in 1984 and did not even get his moneys worth.  This isn't a reunion album at all.  More like a high tech compilation disaster and Jermaine is only included in 1 track and Michael, only in 3.  Although no video availbale, I love the Mick Jagger colab "State of Shock" (#3 on billboard and #4 on Hot R&B/Hip Hop Singles) which was a celebrated pop/rock celebration and leading single off of lp.  "Torture" was torture and so was the video. Although top 20 hit, it was so horrible that Jermaine and Michael did not join their brothers in the video (although they provided lead vocals) and the later was replaced by a wax dummy.  "Body" was good although Marlon can not sing and the instrumental is a remisent to Micahel's "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'.  Later for the rest of the tracks of the album and being the worst is Randy Jackson's falsetto disaster "The Hurt."  This lp (although I do not own the cd version of it) was a huge disaster as well as their ill-fated final tour promoting it. 
 I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence.  This work, however, is pure tripe.  Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas.  The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play.  In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense.  Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the "extremely difficult themes" and "brilliant artistry" of the play 
 Truly it is. I watched it once, and then just yesterday and it still was painful to watch. Not because of the acting necessarily, although I think Kidman is one lousy actress in any of her films and this one is no exception.   But the story...what happened? Seriously in the beginning it's not so bad. Yet the middle and end begin to terribly fall apart- especially since in one scene they're saying one thing and then saying a completely other thing in another scene. Basically we're pulled along it seems to either the wives being robots like the old film says- and then we're told it was just really chips in their brain making them housewives? And somehow the chips disappear in the end and they become their real selves again? Then they make a real huge twist in the end which I guess I shouldn't give away but is just real tacky I think.  Just...a mess of a film. I don't know what happened, but it really fell apart in no time. If you're interested in the story, then watch the old one- that sticks to their story all the way through very well. This remake though avoid seriously.  1/ 
 I heard him talk, this guy is an idiot. A conspiracy theory is al this is 
 Looking for a bit of sea adventure?  Fancy a run with some real life salts who face whatever the hurricane ravaged winter seas throw at them?  Well don't go looking to Redmond O'Hanlon's "Trawler".  O'Hanlon takes two potentially fascinating subjects - trawler fishing and the biology behind the creatures of the seas - and blends them into a putrid stew of nothingness.  This is a very difficult book to read. Physically difficult! Aye!  O'Hanlon's pointless, manic use of exclamation and emphasis - EMPHASIS! Aye! - lends nothing to the story but then there is so little story, it's really no loss.  "Trawler" dredges the bottom of literary technique and hauls up nothing but stream of consciousness drivel.  I found the book a total waste of time and will certainly never read another piece of work by O'Hanlon.  Aye!  I won't!  Never! 
 Heats quickly but puts out only small amount of steam.  Need to move VERY SLOWLY IF AT ALL to get out wrinkles.  Then had to wait every few seconds for it to heat up again to get more steam.  TERRIBLE!  Returned it immediately.  
 Lee Smith is my all-time favorite writer.  I have read all of her books except for her newest novel.  This is my least favorite by a long shot 
 I bought this cookbook because I liked the idea of having a week's worth of recipes.  I was disappointed when it arrived because most of the menus seemed more like 'kiddie meals" instead of family fare.  Maybe I'm in the minority, but I don't usually eat chicken nuggets for dinner.  Anyway, another complaint is that Brook Noel relies heavily on dijon mustard, which I like but don't usually use to the excess that she does.  Her mainstay dish seems to be chicken spread with mustard,  dipped in breadcrumbs, and then cooked in a skillet.  This recipe appears several times in the cookbook under different names.  She adds dijon mustard to just about any dish including pasta and sauces.  My last complaint is that I often add a vegetable to her menus, since they are not always part of the meal.  I think if you want to have dinner on the table quickly, the Rachael Ray books are better tasting, more wholesome, and a better buy for your money.  Don't waste your time with this book 
 I have a friend that her daughter has MPD  switiching into seven defferent people within their own mood changes, good and bad. Would like to know how commom is this disease?Would like to know more about the MPD. Whom to talk  to, Doctors, hypnotherist, whomever that can give some insight on MPD          Thank You Joh 
 It is so advanced that no one is able to study mathematics using this book. It's just samling of formules, not all even. I wouldn't recommend to use it. 
 Before you donate your hard-earned money yet again to Bill Gates' 'Feed the Multi-Billionaire Fund', do yourself and the world a favor and search for 'Star Office 8' on Amazon and read the reviews there.  I use MS Office Professional 2003 in the office, and just cannot believe how badly so many businesses and individuals are being ripped off by Microsoft for this BLOAT-ware.    Star Office 8 is under $50 from Amazon and is fully compatible with Microsoft Office, and includes full functionalities of MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Visio, and Access.  Let me know what MS software I can buy under $100, let alone $50.  Hopefully, this is the beginning of the end of the Microsoft Monopoly, and the dawning of the Era of Sanity in computer software 
 I am the captain of a walking team and I purchased several of these pedometers as incentives for my team members.  I wore my pedometer before giving the rest out just to test it.  On the very first day, the pedometer lost count of my steps on three occasions, and by the end of the day, one of the buttons had fallen off.  I do not feel comfortable giving these pedometers to my walkers.  I should have invested a little more money per item to get the best value for my money 
 I am just so sad to have this wonderful series end so badly.  I do not believe for a minute that Mrs. Braun is still writing these books and whoever is should STOP.  Polly gone, the barn burns and Qwill doesn't seem to care about either.  I will not accept the character of Barbara.  The worst thing of all is that I do not even like Qwill anymore! I will never read another and that is sad to me 
 try enya , or sarah brightman, yes they may be overated, but they are also THE BEST PERIOD..i hate to say it but emiliana needs to go back to iceland...try celine dion, dolores from the cranberries,italian singer laura paussini, eroz rammazotti, now thats creme!!!!!!!!! not  EMILIANA TORRINI from iceland!!! in my opinion, she doesnt hit a single note, humm thats so sad..whats up with tuna fish????  the only way i like my tuna is in a sandwich...not in a song.....lo 
 This remington razor is actually too sharp if you ask me.  I used it for a period of several weeks and it caused my face to blister and it actually gave me more cuts than a 10 cent disposable razor. Ouch. However, the shave is very close - expect to use a lot of cooling lotion with this razor.  The design of the shaver mechanically is fine and appears to be fairly reliable - although its a touch hard to clean because the blades are super sharp underneath the foils. I have owned Norelco and Braun for more than 15 years and on the whole found them to be a more agreeable shave 
 This could have been a fabulous story with interesting and compelling characters. Instead, we have another self-indulgent wallow in the world of fox-hunting and so-called gracious southern living. I gave up on Rita Mae Brown several years ago when she stopped writing inventive and intriguing novels and started writing stories about talking animals. Recently I picked up Hotspur hoping some of the old zing had come back into her writing. Sadly, it hasn't 
 Out of the past 20 burns, I have only had 10 DVD's burn successfully.  I use Roxio CD Creator version 7, which does a great job with my CD's, so I'm pretty sure it's the DVD media.  Not only am I wasting all my money, but my time as well.  I've tried to lower the burn speed, but it does not matter.  I'd try something else 
 this james patterson book sucked horribly! my stupid friend read it and thought it was good, but it wasn't.  its a about some angry Jews who will stop at nothing for revenge.... not exactly a good story. ugh i can't beleive she read this horrible peice of trash, jenny, i feel sorry for yo 
 I am not an advanced Excel user, but it is easy to find out that this book has many mistakes in coordinating the problem descriptions with the solutions, as well as typos in the book, when referring to certain cells. So, I do not know which of them should be corrected, but it is hard and time consuming, at least for a novice user, to understand what is going on. The solutions to advanced problems have no explanation, which on one hand is good because it makes you try to think...on the other hand though, it is such a disappointment to find out that the solutions you try to understand are wrong!! You can easily find it out by doublechecking with pen and paper.. 
 I am disappointed with this author. There is too much theory to wade through versus application. I wish all of these want-to-be doctor authors could use Dr. Wayne Dyer as the example. If this author would of at least had a closing summary with each chapter, filled with applications and a good review, then I would have given this author a B+, or A, which would of been four or five stars 
 Skip this one and wait for the new translation of 30 of the best tales coming out from Penguin next month, by the great Tiina Nunnally. Andersen's true voice is heard at last! All the old rewrites begone 
 I received my new shoes this afternoon and took a test run. I didn't really buy this a3 for its "functionality" but rather the look. I thought the honey comb and the color combination look kinda cool. However, I DID NOT at all feel being "propelled through every foot", and the so called a3 cushion heels felt very stiff. I even poked it with my hand, oh man it's hard. I also tried jumping up and down to try to feel the bounciness, but all I did feel was my feet stomping hard onto the cement.  BTW, if your feet are wide and flat like mine, it's going to be very uncomfortable when walking with these shoes.    *** UPdate *** November 15, 2006 It's been 2 months since I've been wearing these shoes, and I've changed my opinion them. Once you get use to the a3 sequence, they are actually quite comfortable. The honeycombs under the heels do make every step a little bouncier now. Maybe it takes time to soften up the material and make them more flexible 
 This book could have been so much better since the plot is really good. The writing here is a knockoff of Michael Crighton and really doesnt juve very well. I found myself skimming the pages after a while. The subject  of a super algorithm to translate code that has been corrupted is a good one and almost deserves to be written over again 
 If Tony Hillerman wrote this novel (novella actually), I sure can't tell. I have been a Chee/Leaphorn fan for many years, but this novel is not in the same league with Hillerman's other work. It is reminiscent of a 'B' movie. Instead of building suspense, the plot is laid out all too plainly, the characters are unreal, and the Chee/Bernie romance doesn't ring true.  I am amazed that it was published 
 PLease consider how many books there are out there before you pick up THIS one.  Though you may be a fan of suspense or romance, this has a plot that has managed to be predictable, dull, and pretentious all at once.  The story is a basic spy story, and the little romance is obscured by slang which has no place in today's literature.  The author tends to describe things in a way that could take paragraphs (if not pages) to explain.  The only reason to go near this book is for a school project or in class assignment.  Otherwise, ther is no reason to read through this "classic".  
 Janet Evanovich has become a much better writer since writing this book....I prefer her Stefanie Plum series and hope she doesn't give up on them. 
 I am a lover of ALL things Einstein, and a speech therapist so I was excited when I got this dvd.  Unfortunately the pace is so slow, and they only show the sign for each item two times about five minutes apart.  It is not nearly enough for a small child or a child with delays to pick up.  I can barely watch it, and its the ONLY ONE my 11 month old doesn't watch, and I think we have 6 dvds 
 I was excited when I first heard about this book, but when I got a copy, I was quite disappointed.  First the good... the recipes produce tasty dishes.  But they are not the recipes of Spain's Jews, secret or public.  These are recipes invented by the authors with a minimum of supporting evidence, or, in fact, most of the time, none at all.  They are based for the most part on the testimony of people who turned in Conversos for being "secrect Jews". The mere mention of, oh, say, chick peas and honey, has led the authors to invent a recipe that includes these ingredients.  If you are truly interested in the history the food eaten by Spain's Jews, you will not learn much. If you want some nice Spainish-style recipes eaten by Jews, you'll probably do better skipping the sad tales of betrayal and torture and buying a modern Sephardic cookbook 
 Despite the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on Amazon, I really cant appreciate the value, usefulness or practicality of this book. The proposed framework, that each difficult conversation is really three (The "What Happened?", The "Feelings" and The "Identity") Conversations, is complicating rather than helping to solve the problem. You may think I am a contrarian or a poor communicator. However, with my very positive experience (and reviews) on books like "How to win friends and influence people?" by Dale Calegie, "Get anyone to do anything and never feel powerless again" by David J. Lieberman , "How to talk to anyone?" by Leil Lowndes and so on, I am obliged to warn potential buyers, in particular regular readers of relevant books, of a big disappointment.  
 i tried reading it, and made it about 3-4 pages.  i'm pretty sure that's a bad sign.  i seem to recall mr. sedaris writing about his mother's bedpan or something.  the impression i instantly got was "BEEP BEEP!  PRETENTIOUS YOUNG WRITER PEDDLING SO-CALLED BAD CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES FOR FAME, MONEY AND SYMPATHY."  guess what, mr. sedaris?  i don't give a (expletive deleted) about your so-called bad childhood.  millions of people have bad childhoods and don't play the sympathy card.  check out augusten burrough's books, they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style.  
 the most significant part of this forgettable book is when the author recounts what was said in a magazine about him: 'as long as there is a village without an idiot, this guy will find a home.' that really says it all, don't waste your time or money on this pitiful book 
 I chose this book because "Awareness" is in the title.  Although I wasn't expecting a lot of nuggets, I did expect some.  Unfortunately, none were to be found.  Instead, this book reads like a session with a psychologist - and not a very good one at that.  The author begins by writing, "If you have picked up this book, then odds are that in someway you feel dissatisfied with your life."  Again, that is not why I chose this book.  Warning - this is the theme of the book.  The author's own words sometimes weigh down the pages with emotional dissatisfaction.    Much of the advice is written in generalities.  Often times, emotional issues were lumped together as if a one-off, cure-all by being "aware" will resolve any and all emotional problem.  Sure, awareness is the first step and yes, gaining control of your emotions is important.  However, if you are looking for sound emotional advice, you should see a licensed professional. 
 Several facts to ponder: 1) Frederick Douglas, upon his trip to Ireland, said that the suffering due to the Potato famine that he experienced was far worse than anything he had seen back in the United States -- look it up if you don't believe me.  Now, many of these desperately poor Irish immigrants came to the United States (including my ancestors) and clawed their own way up through anti-Irish laws, etc.  Now, I am not saying this was equal to being slaves, but there are MANY different groups that have suffered at some time in history -- are we to give them all reparations?  2) Blacks were very involved in the slave trade in Africa.  This was not well known 20 years ago, but is now very well documented.    3) Slavery was practiced all throughout the world, and we suffered terribly in this country (600,000+ dead and hundreds of thousands wounded) during a bloody civil war.  This country paid a very dear price for using slavery.  Read the late writings of Abraham Lincoln to understand how the brutality of the war was a result of the sin of slavery.  4) I live near Washington D.C. and drive a 95 Toyota Corolla, work 2 jobs and have four children.  I see many blacks on the highway flying by me in their BMW's, Mercedes, etc. and in their 3 piece suits.  My next door neighbor is Black and has a Beemer!  Please don't tell me that they need reparations.  Yes, I know there are many poor black neighborhoods -- I have volunteered and worked to help their plight -- but it is not a black thing only of course.  That's all I have to say.  I am sure Randall Robinson is sitting pretty in a house much nicer than mine, by the way...but that's ok...I have a beautiful family :)  
 The lowest setting is too dark for my taste when making toast. Enough said. 
 I needed to buy this book for my graduate level class. I thought that everything that I read was information that I already knew. I guess that this book would benefit a beginner in MI but it was very dry and boring. 
 Mick Garris created the Showtime "Masters of Horror" series, so it is quite a surprise to discover that his first contribution to the show could not be properly called "horror" at all, let alone "masterful."  Mick has made a living out of adapting Stephen King novels for the screen (and we all know how those usually turn out), so it's no wonder that this little vignette plays like a short story with all the good parts cut out.  Jamie (played by a mealy-mouthed Henry Thomas) is lonely, divorced, and living on old toast when he begins to experience all of the sensations of a beautiful Canadian woman.  He smells what she smells, sees what she sees, feels what she feels.  (In true "Masters of Horror" fashion, many of these shared sensations involve sex and nudity.)  Ever more obsessed, Jamie tracks this woman down, only to discover her HORRIFYING SECRET!  What is her horrifying secret?  I'll tell you!    [SPOILER ALERT]   She is not a very nice person.  Also, for some reason, she keeps a gun under her couch.  I'm not joking. [END OF SPOILERS]  But seriously, this is just very, very bad entertainment.  In fact, the most creative part of the entire show is little more than a lame inside joke.  At one point, we catch a glimpse of a Stephen King novel, "Desperation," on Jamie's nightstand.  Ho ho!  Garris directed the TV adaptation of "Desperation," which just so happened to star both Thomas and Matt Frewer (who, in "Chocolate," has the only interesting character: Jamie's co-worker, Wally -- scientist-by-day, mohawked rock-n-roller by night).  The story of "Chocolate" is told in flashback by Jamie, who is sitting in a dark room, under a lamp, covered in blood.  He is being questioned by a cop, and his dull, pointless story unfolds as he answers each inquiry.  At the very end, when the cop has heard every, last, mind-numbing detail, the cop gives the penultimate line of the show:  "That's a hard story to sell."  You're right, Unnamed Cop.  It's a REALLY hard story to sell, especially when the salesmanship is this bad 
 It is sad to say, loving the first part, that Starship Troopers 2 isn't the movie the fans wanted to see. It is a bad acted, dark, nothing near the original sequel. The charm that the first part had is totally gone.  The story takes place on one of the bug's planet, where a group of troopers of the federation get stuck on an abondon outpost, where nasty things happen. The entire movie is very dark. It starts out cool I must say, but that is all because in the first minute of the movie, the "would you like to know more?" part is shown, with footage of the first movie. But very soon after that, when the movie continues with a battle against the bugs, it goes downhill very fast. From those first few minutes into that battlesequence you can feel that there is totally no emotion in the acting. The fights could have been way cooler using certain cameramoves and giving the idea that they are having a hard fight: this is just a lot of screaming at each other in a bad acting way while you see a lot computer made bugs running around in some shots. Also, the film has a kind of video look that gives away that it went straight to video. That is sad, screenquality can do a lot for a film you know. A mist oppertunity.  Also, like I said, the movie is very dark. Not just dark as in story, but dark as in lighting. Of course it gives a moody and dangerous atmosphere, but a light here and there could have been just fine. Now it just feels like a wanne-be "Aliens" where the darkness actually worked, but here it just doesn't feel right at all.  So you may wonder: is there anything good about Starship Troopers 2? Yes, there actually is: The music is okay. It is music that saves some scenes here and there with nice heroic tunes and melodies. If that music wouldn't have been there, it would have been even more terrible than it already is. So good job on that part. Also some sets are well made and look professional, but sometimes it feels a bit like it has been filmed in a local gymhall.   To the fans of the original I must say this: You can watch this, but don't buy it, rent it some place. It is very dissapointing.  It has, like I said before, a kind of videolook, also none of the original characters return in this one. No cool Casper van Dien, no sexy Denise Richards: they are not in this movie in any way. The only actress that does return is Brenda Strong. The weird thing is that her character died in the first one, but she's back as a new character. But she doesn't save the movie in any way unfortunatly.  So all in all: The movie misses the direction of Paul Verhoeven, a bigger budget, good acting and the original characters from the original one.  Too bad, so sad, it really could have been something more than this.   Let's all hope that Starship Troopers 3, which is coming in some time will be a big step back in the direction of the fantastic original.  
 I'm a very spiritual person and I was expecting this CD to provide daily inspiration and help me to remember the very few things that are important in life.  Unfortunately, for me at least, the CD is rather boring and not very inspirational.  I'm about 30 minutes in to it and have decided to stop listening to it.  Fortunately I have a Christian radio station that does a lot more for me. 
 In a "letter to the Editor" published in National Review Magazine of 3/24/89, I've already pointed out the blattant errors made by Mr. Winters in his article "They Shoot Allies, Don't They?"  published by the same magazine in its 11/25/88. Factual errors that he had  to recognize like: Ho Chi Minh was born in Hue, Thich Tri Quang was a  successful lawer, The HCM Trail was started in 1962, ... This book is a  development of that article and consequently the errors are even bigger.  Let's look at the book's most important question: Why did President Kennedy  wanted to replace President Diem, an ally of 9 years? To answer this  question correctly and completly, we have to look beyond Kennedy's  political ambition, beyond the election of 1964. To fully answer to this  question, Mr. Winters must also think of other questions: Why did the U.S.  support then stop the support to the Shah of Iran, Somoza, Noriega, Marcos,  ...? Beside other factors, the most important one is "THE WILL OF THE  PEOPLE" of Iran, of Nicaragua, of the Phillippines, of Vietnam. This  factor is totally absent from Mr. Winters' book. The only shadow of the  author's interest in the "people" is in the title of his book.  And I agree with the previous comentator that even "the year of the  hare" is, unknown to Mr. Winters, unapplicable to the Vietnamese. *  A  Vietnamese in Sacramento, California

 Was very disappointed by the performance of this unit.  Not enough pressure.  Pretty useless even with new batteries 
 Being an "older" person myself, I certainly have no objections to fading action stars still trying to maintain their youthful exuberance.  Dolph Lundgren.  Harrison Ford.  Steven Segal.  Chuck Norris.  These guys all look great, but they just don't have that energetic persona they became famous for.  And now Van Damme surfaces in this by the books action film set (where else?) in Romania, the country where making films must be enormously cheaper than anywhere else.  The country is having a civilian uprising after their recent elections and good old JC is sent in to ensure the safety of the new president.  There's lots of gunfire and betrayals, etc., and the formula is so tired it doesn't really manage to thrill this viewer.  
 I am taking a Mexican History class (in Spanish and in Mexico) and have been using Fehrenbach's book to check on details of events and names of major political actors--many he does not even mention. That may be justified given that FIRE AND BLOOD is an overview rather than an in-depth analysis. Still, I noticed some glaring errors in addition to what seem like unfounded ethnocentric opinions. For example, the author claims that the Maya were living in the jungle as "savages" in the seventeenth century. He notes that "their written history carved on stone, is not readable" but does not mention the burning of the codices by Diego de Landa until 200 pages farther on in the book. Moreover, the author contends that the "Maya civilization destroyed itself without outside help," referring to squabbling between the cities that were left after the civilization had "degenerated." Mexico in the years following Independence is depicted as a society in which virtually no one had any idea of what it meant to be Mexican or how to build a nation or what the purpose of an election was. Finally, the comparisons between the United States (egalitarian, with democratic values even during colonial times) and Mexico (essentially the opposite) is a misleading oversimplification. And George Washington was not selected by Congress but by the Electoral College in the first presidential election. A book without a single footnote and only the briefest list of references, many of which are from the early twentieth century, cannot, in my view, be characterized as scholarly. 
 Intellectual garbage on the subject of intellectual garbage 
 It is really difficult to like a book where there are no likeable characters.  Morgan is a middle aged man who leaves his wife and many children for a much younger woman (that he seems to stalk for a while).  There are so many disturbing factors in this book that revolve around the main character (stalking of his new wife, impersonating a doctor, impersonating a postal worker, etc) that it made it very difficult to empathize with any of the emotions he might have had.  The book also seems to 'glaze' over the 'weirdness' of these behaviors.  
 Here's my sincere take on Savage: I think it's mostly an act. Savage understands Biology as a discipline and decided to carve out a niche for himself as the most vitriolic and angry of political commentators. There's just no way a guy could be that angry without having a blood pressure problem so extreme that the pressure he thinks he's under would violate Boyle's Law.  Having said that, how does singling out a section of the population genuinely advance the political debate in this country?  If a person wants to marginalize the political extremes the USA should then go to a parliamentary system of govt., which seems to be what the founding fathers envisioned anyway, before Alexander Hamilton got involved.  For those who doubt my veracity, please read the Articles of Confederation and articles 1 and 2 of the Constitution. Our Constitution's major flaw, IMO, is making the prez commander-in-chief, which has allowed our past and current presidents to use the military as their own private police force. Just look at that ginned-up Iraq war were stuck in now. I will say as a former Republican that I'm aghast at the Orwellian nature of the current administration, which seems to be hostile to civil liberties taken for granted in the English speaking world for 900 years. I certainly hope the Supreme Court doesn't uphold a law which makes possible the suspension of Habeas Corpus, especially at the discretion of this president.  We may never get this right back. We didn't seem to need these laws when we fought terrorists in the past.   I'm aware that the book's title is taken from a quote by a Roman senator. But Savage doesn't have a monopoly on Roman quotes. Here's 1 from the Roman historian Tacitus worth considering:   "You have made a desert, and call it Peace." 
 I'm sorry but I can't agree with the glowing reviews.  Shell is very flip and dismissive of other, better writers like Roger Fisher and William Ury, but unfortunately for him, his arguments don't carry much weight.    To be more specific, he derides the concept of win/win negotiation, claiming that ANY negotiation that is concluded is a win/win.  This is simply not true, as anyone who has ever been coerced into an agreement can tell you.  He also ridicules the BATNA concept (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement), stating that having alternatives does nothing to improve your leverage, if, for example, the potential employer knows you really, really want to work for him.  Well, when all other things are equal, I'd rather have the ability to walk away from the table - and have the opposing party know it.  It's a pity Shell felt the need to put down Fisher and Ury, who, after all, did much to further our understanding and improve methods of negotiating 
 One of the few things I applaud about this book is Borg's emphasis on the power of the Spirit and the new life it can create. I am too firmly indoctrinated, however, in the popular image of the Jesus of the gospels to enjoy reading much about modern biblical scholarship's attempts to discover the historical Jesus 
 I bought this book for my Numerical Analysis class.  It proves theorems very un-rigorously.  I've only seen the first 3 chapters so far, but a frequent phrase that comes up is "and by the results that we will show in Chapter 6, (statement) is true" 
 I had the same experience as another reviewer here, the sleeves smell very strong (I put them out in the garage till I can return them). I bought these elswhere but came here to see if others had the same experience & low & behold yes they did! To me its almost a musty odor probably has something to do with them having to be shipped from Taiwan! The sleeves I've bought in the past were made by "Ampad" here in the US, I'll go back to buying their brand 
 I have to disagree with the opinions of some of the reviews presented here and give this book two stars - mainly for its smooth narrative style and nothing more. Alex Marshall is not a professional in any urban field - he is a journalist. His take on the problems modern cities face is expressed shallowly. It is like a book on medicine written by a lawyer. Sure, he has some nice ideas but these seem childish views to me and more of a common sense matter - not really worth putting to print. In fact, it is so easy, simple and shallow I consider it a great exercise for your first speed reading class. 
 Do yourself a favor and buy a real heavy duty BBQ mitt.  This one looks nice and fits well, but it starting burning one night and I threw it out 
 This is a very clever book, as far as I could make out, but very overrated. There were a few good, suspenseful scenes, but the military action was awfully repetitious. Perhaps the action is accurate and realistic, and it could potentially make an exciting movie, but it does not make good reading.  The basic premise, that the Soviet Union starts World War III in order to get oil, was ironic, given that President Bush has repeatedly been accused of attacking Iraq for the same reason. In both cases, I found the reasoning unconvincing.  Clancy's writing is pretty odinary, and often sloppy. I was particularly annoyed by the continual use of unexplained acronyms - I tried looking them up some of them in a book containing thousands of acronyms and could only find about half of them - and the military jargon was similarly confusing. Sometimes he would use a term extensively and then 30 pages later he'd explain what it meant. I suppose it would be all right for someone with more military background than I have, but a lot of the time I had no idea what was going on. I was also put off by the continual change of scene - I counted 17 scene changes in one chapter, and there are 43 chapters.  The military strategy and tactics are fascinating, but the plot of the novel is pretty basic. The characterisation is virtually non-existent - most of the characters sound the same.  This is the first Tom Clancy book I have read, and it makes me wonder how he manages to out-sell so many superior writers 
 The Cobra Event is a jarring book, not because of the plausibility of the plot nor because it goes into excruciating pains to describe dead boies and their subsequent autopsies, but because there are so many errors on its pages. Worse, there are whole chapters devoted to nothing that advances the plot or helps me undersatand the story better; pages and pages of filler - it was like reading a doughnut.  Among the worst are:  --Changing verb tenses in the middle of a paragraph. I have no idea why a paragraph that starts with the past perfect tense suddenly switches to the present tense in the second sentence. And it didn't happen just once.  --Using "you" all the time. The book has this very condescending, accusatory tone when it directly addresses me, as though it knows what I know and don't know.  --Maxing out the filler potential. I know that detail helps to make stories seem authentic, but really, taking a paragraph to explain the history of Katz's Delicatessan is superfluous.  Argh 
 I had completely forgotten about this book until a friend mentioned it the other day in her drunken St. Patties stupor.  This book is a great for read for normal people who want to laugh at really bad ideas to find a husband.  It's good advice if you want to be a trophy wife.  Don't return a guy's call?  Good way to date only losers who have no one else to call.  Wear your hair in a pony tail, learn to play tennis, die your hair black, get a nose job, these are all pieces of advice in this book.  The idea is hide who you really are until you get married and then be yourself.  That marriage will last forever... if forever is two days.  If you want to marry a rich guy who will ignore you and eventually trade you in for a younger version of yourself, read this book.  If you want a good laugh, read this book.  If you want real advice on men, understading them, finding Mr. Right, telling the good ones apart from the jerks, knowing what they're thinking, I recommend GOD IS A WOMAN: DATING DISASTERS.  It's by a guy, what's more he's a comedian, and it's really funny with great and real advice 
 I originally picked up this book because it seemed like it had gotten some decent reviews.  I can't stay that I enjoyed the novel very much, mostly because it was slow moving, the characters were all over the place, and the ending was weak.  Don't waste your time reading this novel, pick up something better like The Kite Runner, which has a lot more substance 
 ...but I'd imagine it would be fun to psychoanalyze Simmons via his writing.  The guy really likes to do in his characters in some pretty gruesome ways.  Unfortunately, I haven't cared about a Simmons character in at least the last five novels of his that I read, so I was kind of hoping he's finish off the priest and the doctor in this one. I first read Simmons' HYPERION based on a review written by a local (Austin, Tx) critic, Patrick Beach.  I was not disappointed. I read the rest of the books in the series and grew increasingly disenchanted with Simmons' style and lack of editorial discipline (he just writes way more than he needs to, or at least more than I need to read.)  I switched to Simmons' Joe Kurtz novels because they were set in my old hometown of Buffalo, NY.  Fun and fast, but not terribly memorable.  Somewhere in there I read his excellent short story collection, WORLDS ENOUGH AND TIME, which includes lengthy personal notes by Simmons.  (Unless you like self-impressed stuffed shirts, skip them).    I guess the gist of this note is that Simmons can be very, very good and pretty bad.  Try to find the good ones and skip the rest.  CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT is definitely skippable 
 Anthropologically speaking, Raphael Patai - born Ervin Gyorgy Patai (in Budapest, Hungary, in 1910; son of well known Zionist Joszef Patai) - is not a Westerner as the book might lead us to believe. Why would a Hungarian-Jewish ethnographer compare Arabs to Westerners instead of his own tribe is a puzzle that no one could resolve - pretty much like when Bernard Lewis, and a bunch of other Orientalists, compare Islam to the Western Civilization instead of their own. To be sure, Ervin Gyorgy Patai does well sticking paragraphs one to the other and twisting them to his liking; he would have done so poorly had he tried some empirical work: cutting-edge statistical analysis with solid theorizing. Let us not forget that anthropology is not a science - it was created primarily for the purpose Ervin Gyorgy uses it: to profile people he despises in the way he wishes. To cut the story short: a Westerner would have never written a silly book of this type; after all, the Westerner is a rational living, one with a beautiful mind, and so empirically fascinating... 
 I bought this map, having read the previous reviews. And am returning it because it gives a much too limited view of Paris. It literally cuts out whole neighborhoods -- the north end of the 18th, most of the 19th and 20th, the 12th arrondissements(including Belleville, Menilmontant), most of the 13th, 14th, 15th arrondissements including Montparnasse, the Cite Universitaire, etc.   Fine if you want to get only to the hottest tourist spots, but totally inadequate if you want to visit the "tout Paris".   
 Well, she's thorough, that's for sure.  Every possible sewing technique is covered here.  But with only line drawings for relief, it's kinda tedious to get through.  Maybe if you just wanted to look up particular techniques.  Her other books are great, but this one really leaves me cold 
 This is a revolutionary book. It introduces the stage metaphor into sociology; all of social interaction is a performance on a stage. It's questionable how novel this metaphor is, but this is certianly its first explicit statement. The language used to present the ideas of the author is, like most sociological writing, unecessarily complicated. There are some problems with clarity and structure; the book just doesnt have a holistic feel for me. No sociological background is presupposed, there is extensive quoting from other sociological sources, many footnotes, and various other ways to enter sociological literature throught the book. So if you are interested in reading sociology, this is probably a good place to start (again, the language is unecessicarily thick and this may be it's bane as an introduction).  However, the book is misguided. The idea of viewing social interaction as a performance on a stage is unecessary. The authors motives for saying this will make my position clearer.  (The following is a charicature of the author's argument). There is certianly a large amount of social behavior which is directed towards other people (the audience) in order for the audience to build an impression of the actor. Well, if it can happen here we can draw a parallel with other situations, infact all situations and therfore all of social interaction is like a performance on a stage, "All the world is not, of course, a stage, but the crucial ways in which it isnt are hard to specify" (p 72). The performances can either be with individuals, or groups of people, and they can be performing conciously or unconciously. (end of charicature)  There are other arguments, obviously, and the statement "we can draw a parallel with other situations" is most of the content of the book, which i dont like to gloss over with a sentence. But the real question here is, is the view worthwhile? My answer: No. Social interaction is a complex phenomena that cant possibly be summed up with a signle metaphor. Yes, some social interaction is like a performance, where indivudals are intentionally making impressions on one another. Yes, some social behavior can arise from unconcious beliefs. However, most social interaction is exactly the way we see it, conciously controlled, meaningful, purposeful interaction with individuals; it is not some kind of performance with the purpose of creating a "reality".  I hope my view of the book is clear so that the biases on the final part of my review can be sorted out: the book is a waste of time. Where the author is right, the statement is little more than common sense. Where the author goes outside of common sense, he's wrong, sometimes plainly so. This book is part of the tradition in sociology of thinking that society pulls the wool over each individuals eyes, that reality is a social construct with no purpose other than social control (here the wool is the performance, and the control has to do with impressions ... but this quickly degenerates into an obscure mess of assertions). There is no real empirical support given for most of the claims. Where "evidence" is given, the evididence is so heavily intepreted that it fails to correspond to facts in the world but rather to facts about the views of the reporter. Where there is no correspondence to the world there is no truth. Various sources of sociology are cited, but this is more like intellectual bullying. Saying that some author, which also didnt have any empirical support for his claims, agrees with you is just to bully your reader into acepting your claims. The claims in the book have no practical application in the world, but only serve to intepret situations differently, and in personal opinion, less correctly. Nothing said here will lead to better predictions about social behavior or a better understanding of psychology. In short, this isnt a scientific study at all.   My final qualm with the book deserves its own paragraph, the use of language. The best example is the definitions given at the end of the introduction "A performance may be defined as all of the activity of a given participant on a given occasion which serves to influence in any way any of the other participants" (15). This is a curios definition. Me breathing while i work is a performance, it changes the percentages of O2 and CO2 in the atmosphere near my co-workers. Me staring into space is a performance, other people see me stare into space and are therefore influenced. Infact, me simply existing is a performance, since my existance causes a gravitational effect on the other participants, as well as influencing them to create beliefs about me existing. Its as if Goffman created a definition for performance which included all possible actions taken by any person, and then wrote a book about how all possible actions taken by any person fall under the category of performance. He didnt. He used a word that we associate with controlled behavior (performance) and defined it in a way no one is used to. Then he used alot of word play to show that behavior has no substance, its all for the purpose of maintaining social reality. I hope this very limited example shows the terrible use of language that is endemic to Goffman and sociology more generally.  So an ode to sociology is in order ... actually no it isnt. Why wont this subject go away? This book is an integral part of sociology, and it espouses the methods and style of sociological researchers and writers by being an archetypical work within the tradition. The methods are questionable; the style is obscure. Like it or hate it, sociology is a part of modern thought. Read the book to be an educated person and keep in mind its intellectual failings 
 We used a previous version of this book when my first child was applying to colleges in 2003, and found it helpful. The current edition was a disappointment because of obvious errors. In addition to the Stanford error, the Northwestern evaluation was completely illogical. After stating that Northwestern is "one of the most academically rigorous (schools)in the country,"with an "applicant pool that is easily among the best in the country," the book gives an academic rating of 77. That is the same rating given, for example, to St. Bonaventure University, which ranks high on the "lots of hard liquor" and "students almost never study" lists.  It is interesting to note that three years ago, Northwestern topped the "best overall academic experience for undergraduates list" with an academic rating in the high 90's.  It is now ranked more than 20 points lower. Since both reviews cannot possibly be correct, one is forced to conclude that the authors are either biased or careless. I was left feeling that I could not trust the data presented, and will be using a different book for reference when my second child applies to college 
 I can't believe the touch of B.B. King. I enjoy his playing immensely. I know this album gets buried in accolades. But I don't like it. The quality is poor and, differing from other's opinions, the crowd noise takes away from the music. B.B. said, in so many words, that Live at the Regal was far from his choice as his best recording. Typically, he said he wouldn't argue with success--and left it at that. There are so many good albums by B.B. You can't go wrong for $4.65 for the "Ultimate Collection". Sure it doesn't have them all--but it has quite a few of his great songs, including a few from Live at the Regal. I would steer clear of this selection. Or I'll send you mine for free 
 I just watched yet another Martin Yan show on TV.  Being a Chinese who has lived in the U.S. for 10 years, I am ever so saddened by the fact that people really think this guy is cooking the "real" stuff.  My friends and I just think that he puts on a good show.  If you enjoy his food, please do not get the wrong impression that it is Chinese.  He has substantially modified many of the dishes to fit American taste, just as many western restaurants in the Orient would make western food which have been changed to fit the Asian taste buds.  I have seen westerners making faces in western restaurants in the Orient exclaiming, is this what you called a hamburger?  (you can substitute "hamburger with the name of any other dishes)  The reaction of Chinese towards Yan's cooking is the same 
 I ordered both the cherry and black Deer Stags through Sportman's guide.com. When I recieved the shoes the cherry was polished and new looking. The black pair was dull and had no shine. Instead of returning the product,as should have done, I tried different ways to put the gloss and polish on those shoes. All attempts failed. Very unhappy with product. I have learned my lesson 
 This book is giving me a headache to read.  It is like being in an alternative reality -the reality described by the narrative character is should I say bent, warped, beyond bizarre...  Not sure why I am continuing to read this book?  I should probably skip to the back chapter so I can find out if the main character is actually suffering from a mental illness which alters her view of reality since there is nothing similar to a normal reality in this book.  I should probably have written this review after I finished this book, but I'm not sure I am going to be able to finish reading it.  It is truely bizarre - just  strange.  FYI - this is my first review - Reading the reviews for this book prompted me to write. I have to say I can't believe anyone would find anything desirable to read in this book.  It is truly a puzzling book.  My questions for the author is "What were you thinking?"  "What am I missing?"  I just don't get it.  The only reason I may continue to struggle to read it is to see not what happens in the story but if there is really a story.  It is so disjointed. . .I would love to be a fly on the wall listening to a book club discuss this book.  That is how strange this book is 
 When I borrowed a copy of this from the university library (thank God I didn't buy it), I was misled since it was the hardbound edition without the jacket, so all I saw was "Heavenly Intrigue."  If I had seen the complete title, I wouldn't have bothered.  The authors are truly of this generation, the CSI/forensic-wannabes (every cable channel has them now, very dismaying) who portray the facts from a mystery caper point of view, instead of looking at all the possible factors surrounding Brahe's death.  Having read the other reviews, I find it just as compelling that it could have been Mrs. Brahe who had to euthanize him.  And Brahe, although popular, had his own share of enemies, from religious extremists to possible other rivals.  Maybe even kindergarten enemies, who knows? -- he did have a disfigured nose, a testament to his pugnacious nature.  That should have been an obvious clue to the authors.  As much as they try to give Kepler his due, they also paint him as a villain, on account of his mental troubles, his moods, etc.  Well, I have news for the authors... most scientists have had their psychotic episodes:  Newton suffered from depression (and by some accounts, a form of dementia) in his later years; Leibniz was worse off.  Boltzmann wound up committing suicide.  But the point of all this?  Everyone, especially in those times, weren't quite right in the head.  Hey, if you were living in war-ridden, plague-infested times, would you really be morally sound and civilized, the way we like to think of ourselves now??  I don't think so!!!!!  And what is the whole point of this forensic crap??  Just to prove Brahe was murdered?  To find a culprit, at any costs??  To make Kepler the Fall Guy???    The same has been said about some who have made important contributions in culture, science, and history, like Caravaggio or George Washington (both suspected and/or accused of murder in their lifetimes).  The man lived miserably, and may not have been a saint.  Despite Kepler's being obsessive a scientist (or philosopher, depending on your point of view) as he was... which scientist isn't?... he never quite expected to see the same kind of glory as Brahe did.  Scientists then didn't enjoy the same prestige that we do now.  In closing, I will say that this book completely annoyed me, because it sought to reduce two of the most important scientific figures down to a scientific rivalry that went astray and resulted into yet another murder story.  As storied and tumultuous their relationship was, there is no denying that both Brahe and Kepler's contributions helped usher in the modern era of science.  Without them, Newton would not have had his Laws of Motion, Einstein would never have even thought of Relativity, and quantum mechanics may have never existed.  Brahe and Kepler's story is so much more than that.  Perhaps these so-called science writers (as well as those other investigative writers) should stop speculating -- like what the Da Vinci Code crowd likes to do -- and start thinking, really thinking about stuff that really matters, like the nature of everyday things and the universe.  Life is not an endless cycle of Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel but really a testament to the first seven days of Creation, and beyond, and how it works.  And that is what scientists are primarily concerned about -- not about who's right or wrong.  Ultimately, both Brahe and Kepler would have agreed as much 
 Whoever was responsible for entitling this collection of Plutarch's Lives ought to be buried alive like a naughty Vestal Virgin.  To apply the adjective "Grecian" to the men of Hellas is a travesty.  At best, they should have used the term "Greeks."  Honestly.  "Grecian" is and should ONLY be applied to things manufactured by Greeks, not to Greeks themselves.  It's like calling the people of Scotland "Scotch."  Try that one in an Edinburgh pub and see how long you last.  Unfortunately the "noble" men Hellas are not around to defend themselves, so I have to do it for them.  "Lives of the Noble Hellines and Romans" is itself more noble 
 I was very disappointed in this purchase, and eventually ended up returning it.  The actual product did not live up to my expectation.  While the cross was of average quality (not great, but OK), the chain was very cheaply made.  It did not even have a clasp on it -- you had to pull it over your head to get it on.  The price of this item did not match the quality of the product, by any means.  Even though I was disappointed with the item, I have to say that the company was extremely easy to work with as far as getting a refund.  Their customer service staff were very friendly and took the item back, no questions asked.  
 You can tell this movie was released in 1998 because you can still see New York's Twin Towers standing, and because of the groveling incantations of "Islam is a religion of peace," repeated often enough (along with casting a Good Guy Arab Cop, Tony Shalhoub) to offset any PC-incorrect image of portraying Islamofascist terrorism.     A measure of how silly this movie appears from the rearview mirror of 2006 and all the ghastly Islamofascist atrocities since 9/11 is the first terrorist scene in the movie, where Denzel Washington as FBI agent tries, via megaphone, to talk the terrorists down from a hostage situation. He succeeds in getting the terrorists to let children exit the bus. Jihadis with a conscience -- now where have we ever seen this actually happen - Beslan (186 children killed)? London? Madrid? Mumbai? Only as old people start to exit the bus on a second appeal by Denzel does the bus blow up.   After a series of bombings in New York's supermarkets, movie theaters, restaurants, etc., pressure builds to call in the U.S. Army under martial law. Bruce Willis, the Army commander who is to take on this task, warns time and again that this isn't the proper role of the Army, but then, as one of the President's advisors explains in the movie, as if this is just one of those political things, the "President wants to appear presidential." Remember, this is 1998, and though critics of the movie, such as the New Yorker, refer to Willis's character as a "fascist U.S. Army general", the decision to grant him martial law authority would have been, ahem, none other than Bill Clinton. The movie slides by that little detail, however, to make it look like Willis, all on his own, is rounding up all able-bodied men of the Muslim persuasion (less draconian, by the way, than the rounding up of all Japanese-Americans on the West Coast by FDR, where the threat was less real and imminent than in this movie, but let's not talk about that, either; we're still in 1998, after all).  Of course, the CIA comes in for its usual whipping by Hollywood, where CIA agent Annette Bening has kept crucial facts to herself because she has personal scores to settle -- you see, she is the one who trained and armed some of these terrorists who are now running amok. Oh, yeah, sure, women-hating Al-Qaeda types would allow somebody like pretty Annette to train them!   But the best nonsense comes at the end: Denzel Washington and a handful of FBI agents rush into Army combat HQ and somehow surround Bruce Willis and pull their guns, saying he is under arrest for "violating the Constitution" (hey, why aren't they arresting the guy who ordered the martial law, Bill Clinton?). The general's clueless security detail also draws its guns, and there's a Mexican standoff. Denzel, using the same powers of persuasion that freed at least the kiddies from Islamofascist murder on the bus, appears to be succeeding in talking the Army soldiers out of using their guns to protect Willis. So Willis accepts the situation, allows himself to be arrested, and as the credits roll we see all these Army vehicles leaving Brooklyn in shame -- all it took was to bust the "fascist" general. Ta-dah!  So the movie, with a heap of literary license, proves at least one point at the end: back in the 1990s, it didn't take much for Bill Clinton to wuss out and avoid taking on the terrorists.  Meanwhile, some day, sooner or later, the idea of pre-emptive internment of Jihad-age Muslim men as a defensive measure will indeed catch on, if not here, then perhaps in France, the Netherlands, Russia, Israel -- it will be interesting to see who goes first. Because it is not just the Newtonian laws of physics that decree that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. When they do the sequel to this preposterous movie in New York sans the World Trade Center, Willis will play the part of the hero, and whoever gets stuck with the FBI agent role will be the fool.   I give the movie two stars instead of one, because I would hate to discourage the making of such a sequel, and two, because any movie with Annette Bening in it automatically gets an extra star in my book 
 It seems only to have occurred to a few of these reviewers that whatever Foucault intended as the poltical upshot of Discipline and Punish (and are we even 'allowed' to ask such a question?) its practical political effect has been to allow senior academics a face-saving way to warn graduate students not to rock the boat while denying any authoritarian tendencies.  Perhpas Foucault's work has somehow had more positive political effects in gay rights work, and I would be interested in hearing that argument, but I doubt it.  I think his celebrity has done that 
 11 years later we can see more clearly that this book is bs.  thousands of end notes do not a fact make.  the only folk i see trying to scare us to gain power are the gop cons, and "cons" is a highly appropriate word for them.  i'd give it 0 stars, but the system won't let me.   
 This book has a bad habit of being weak and juvenille.  Very weak and ordinary. G 
 F this self-help industry crap. Quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst. I can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title. Humans are far more complex than the hack Man-Warrior/Female-Maiden title what's-his-name gives them. And remember, this "doctor," is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase. Your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives, so why do you? Let's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self-help industry to the torch. That's a great start to a sane life 
 i did not like this thing at all. it took too long to "shave" my legs. it didn't even remove all of the hair. it irritated my skin as well. 
 I PLACED A WRONG ORDER AND SO NOW I AM NOT ABLE TO WATCH THE DVD I PURCHASED. IT WAS  FOR AREA NO 1, BUT WE CAN'T WATCH THE NO 1 AREA MOVIES IN TURKEY. THEREFORE I DO NOT HAVE A REVIEW  
 This is truly one the most spectacular films ever made, not suffering for having been made during the silent era. However, as correctly stated by another review of the film, the DVD version runs to 139mins as oppossed to the VHS 155mins. This is not due to DVD faster frame rate, but rather because the DVD version has had a huge portion of the film cut for no obvious reason. At one point, the Hero (Fairbanks) has fulfilled the prophecy of the princess and has been the first to touch the rose-tree, the next minute he is seen explaining to her (in an intimate scene) that he is not what he seems. Having seen the VHS a number of times, I can confirm that the DVD version has been brutally cut. Do not buy the DVD version, as it is a let-down with those scenes missing; thus the reason for my one star, which would otherwise have been 4 1/5 (5 stars with the Rimsky Korsakov soundtrack). You have been warned 
 I was looking for an intructional CD to help my daughter to learn chess.  I read the reviews and endorsements and thought that this was what I was looking for.  WRONG!  First of all, the CD comes with no instruction book and you're left to try and figure out what you're supposed to do by yourself (good luck). I've spent over 2 hours on this thing so far and I still haven't seen one thing that would help my daughter to learn to play chess.  I've emailed their 'help line' hoping to get some answers and never heard back from them.  Save your money and your sanity and don't buy this CD. 
  The game sucks and so does this strategy guide, so please do not buy either!!!! I love you all!! 
 THIS SCREENSAVER IS TERRIBLE. IT PAUSES AND JERKS AROUND. VERY ANNOYING. I EMAILED THE COMPANY AND NEVER HEARD FROM THEM. I DONT USE IT AND I DONT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYBODY. THANK YO 
 This piece was not one that I ever would have chosen to read myself, but was instead introduced to it by my 11th grade English teacher.  It is not a work of literary genius, but is instead a simple story of explanation created by the ancient Sumerian people about the lives of their gods.  Similar stories exist today such as that of Santa Claus to explain the appearance of presents under the tree Christmas day.  The characters are presented as ordinary and their thoughts and actions are on the same level, if not below, that of the average person.  They make mistakes that portray them as entities to be learned from, but not mimicked.  When the god of wisdom gets drunk and gives away all of his greatest possessions it makes me wonder about the earlier definition of wisdom.  Family is another subject that seems contorted.  If this story was meant to enclose life lessons why is Inanna presented with the "gift" of prostitution by her father figure, the enlightened god of wisdom, and then murdered by her sister.  Another aspect of ancient life that was revealed by this composition is the common occurrence of infidelity.  Inanna has only recently married and slept with Dumuzi when he tells her that he would like to sleep with other people.  If Inanna, a goddess, can only entertain her husband for a short time, how long would an average woman last?  One further aspect of this story that irritated me was the constant repetition.  I understand that it was meant to stand out from the rest of the text, but there are other ways to drill important pieces of information into the mind of the reader.  This story is a good tool for looking into the past and discovering the thoughts and beliefs that were held in ancient times.  I have learned about a new style of writing, gained some insight into the Sumerian world, and enjoyed a good, if simple, stor 
 Rarely have I had the misfortune of coming across such an unmitagated biased piece of "scholarly" writing.  The book is no doubt scholarly in Traill's coverage of Schliemann's letters and diaries, unfortunately the author seeks only those passages which he can twist to suit his own often stupifying arguments.  My advice is to only read this book if you want the view of an anti-Schliemann extremist, but to instead read Heinrich Schliemann's own publications and an assessment of his contribution from a trained archaeologist instead of a historian who cannot suitably comprehend (or in this instance decides to ignore) his contribution to the development of excavation and post-excavation analysis such as the pathological study of skeletal remains.  Schliemann was far from perfect but neither were his contemporaries, nor did he ever claim to be a "scholar" although he aspired to reach scholarly status.  It appears that certain sections of the academic community continue to attack this upstart amateur in the same way as some historians of the time did.  But those in the archaeology community are aware of Schliemann's contribution and would rightfully produce a much more balanced assessment than given by Traill, which lets face it would not be difficult 
 I watched this movie, not because I am into Ms. Milano, or her breasts, but because it was shot (sadly) at my high school--Shattuck-St. Mary's School in Faribault, MN. Doesn't say much for the school, or for the faculty who had bit parts in it. 
 This series is a travesty. I understand the feeling of loss when you finish a beloved series, but let Laura, not MacBride, have the last word on her family's experience. So much in his books rings false: the clumsy historical allusions, the narrative voice, the potty humor . . . One of the greatest things about Laura Ingalls Wilder's work is the way her voice advances in maturity as she, the main character, grows: Big Woods is written for little girls and Happy Golden Years for young women. MacBride doesn't manage this and talks down to readers. There is a tiny thread of Laura in these books, but not enough to do more than frustrate her fans. Sampling is for rap, not fiction. 
 The Odyssey of Homer  Retold by Barbara Leonie Picard Illustrated by Kiddell-Monroe  	The book of Odyssey is adventure and mystical book.  It is the beginning of legends, the start of magical stories.  This book is two hundred and seventy- one words.  I picked up this Library book because I am in love with the story "Troy".  It makes the movie more put together.  I know how the story of Odyssey went yet it didn't concur with me about the end of it.  So, I got it, read it, and here I am righting a report on it!  In the story, one of my most favorite parts is when Odyssey goes in to this cave with his men.  They are there searching for food and supply when a giant comes in.  He eats 2 of Odyssey's men.  The next morning he takes a bite on another 2 men.  After that night Odyssey kills the monster and they go free.  That is one of the many legends and myths that happen!    I think this book is great. Any on e who likes to learn about legends and myths should read this book!  You can find it at your nearest library. 
 I wonder whether Terry Goodkind has fallen into the Anne Rice and JK Rowling trap of selling so many books that editors don't dare to interfere with them anymore. Any sane editor would have told Terry Goodkind to cut about 200 pages of this novel. Cutting the endless speeches and repetition of the same points over and over again might have helped make this book somewhat up to the standards Mr. Goodkind has set by the previous books of the series (except Pillars of Creation, which, frankly, I skipped). The narrative is long-winded, the endless exposition is tiring and the repetition of Richard's - questionable - moral lesson at every given chance sinks the book in a quagmire of all talk and no action. The plot is ridiculous, and the final resolution cheap and lazy.  I must confess I'm growing tired of the way Goodkind writes Richard and Kahlan. He underuses the latter and makes the former into a terribly boring stiff. Where's the spark?  Somehow the air's gone out of Sword of Truth somewhere in the second half of Faith of the Fallen, and I only hope Goodkind will get it back to finish off the series as strongly as it's started. 
 if you have fond memories of ms steele, or no memory at all because you're new to her, please... don't read this book.  liam looks like a child with his long blond hair; he acts up because no one can control him since that's what his parents tried to do to him; he sees any "no" as a slap in the face because once again, that's what his parents did to him.  sasha looks like a cold woman with her pale skin and dark hair always pulled back; she is totally concerned about her reputation: "but what will they think of me?" and can't stand up for her needs; she refuses to lower her standards, but when liam leaves, she falls into a "morbid depression" and goes back to him.  repeat for 300 pages...   "careless," "self-indulgent," "filler" are three words i'd use to describe it 
 Admittedly, the reason I read The Bourne Identity had everything to do with how much I enjoyed the recent film of the same name.  However, the book bears very little resemblance to the movie.  So little in fact that I wonder if the writers of the movie recognized the same weaknesses in the book as I did: shoddy writing, a confused and over-complicated plot, and a ridiculously juvenile, untenable love story.  I kept expecting the story to pick up and sweep me away as most great novels do, and I tried to gloss over my own revulsion at the soap opera dialog, and blaze undaunted through the remainder of the book...sort of like sitting through a movie you know you don't like much, but sticking around because you've already spent your money to see it.  The premise of the story is also hampered by a sort of cowboys and indians, good versus evil, over-simplified rationale on the part of Ludlum's characters.  Their motives are described plainly enough throughout the book, yet those motives are difficult to understand because they seem so casually overwrought.  Both Bourne and his nemesis, Carlos are laughably thin characterizations.  So much so that I found myself reminded time and time again of The Young and the Restless...especially when the story involved Marie.  Too often, her character came across as wooden and forced.  I don't buy her devotion to Bourne for a minute.  I was actually hoping that she would turn out to be an undercover agent or a psycho or something...anything to make her character more interesting or believable.  I have heard that the second and third books in this series are better, but The Bourne Identity doesn't give me enough reasons to find out for myself.  This is the only instance I've found where the movie is better than the book.  So, rather than waste four or five days slogging away at another Ludlum "best-seller," I'll just stick to the films, thanks 
 I bought my light timer from Target. when I got it I thought "Hey, this oughtta be a good one..." seeing as it's made by Timex, I figured it would be a good buy.  I found out it was a piece of [...] I would set the time just as it said on the back instructions, I had everything set correctly. When the day ran to 5PM, I expected it to turn on, but it didn't. I pulled out my couch and looked behind it to find that the dial AM/PM buttons on the timer had went all the way around with the ticker and pulled themselves next to eachother and the time had been reset. No matter how many times I fixed it, over and over again it would repeat the same process. I was VERY annoied. so... on my 23rd attempt at setting it correctly, I CAREFULLY read the instructions on the back of the timer, set it, making sure it was correct, and pluged it in once more. five o'clock rolls around and nothing happens. When it turned to 5:30 the light timer turned on.  I had the timer set to 5PM turn on time and 2AM turn off time.  the timer turned off at 11PM. That was the one and ONLY time it ALMOST did something correctly.  Today, frustrated with the timer, I tried setting it again. Well, it's broke now. I twisted it the wrong way on purpose, putting the horrible item out of it's misery.  I wouldn't reccomend this timer to anyone. 
 Don't buy this book! The sections are too long and take a lot of time to cover. There aren't a lot of good examples or clarifications of what they are trying to make you understand. The test questions at the end of each  section are much more difficult then what you have to know for the actual  NATIONAL BOARD. There is a mock test at the end of the book, but don't  attempt it because your score will only depress you. The reading is very  dry and you'll get to the point where all you want to do is throw it in the  garbage. If I could return this book for half the price that I've already  paid I would do it gladly 
 Poorly written and not edited. It will confuse you more that help you 
 This game has StarForce copy protection, which is software that you do not want on your computer. Reportedly, it replaces your CD and/or DVD drivers, and often causes extreme hardware and software problems. I've been a victim of the software problems, it basically crippled my very expensive SCSI scanners and it was extremely difficult to figure out what was doing it. It could be the best game that's ever been produced, but anyone who's had the StarForce experience is going to steer clear 
 I agree with the reviewer who said the first few pages indicated that this book was a chore rather than a pleasure.  I stayed with it, although toward the end I skimmed faster and faster, and gleaned no satisfaction for the efforts.  Skip this one and you'll be glad you saved the time for a more enjoyable tome 
 Nothing in the on-line description of the book nor on the flaps can prepare the reader for this mishmash of 19th century prose and repetions in what is actually a series of lectures delivered ???  There are no dates, or explanations for the writing in these verbose, boring lessons 
 Though I have only become acquainted with the Lovecraft universe/Cthulhu Mythos in the past year, and though I was greatly looking forward to delving into this collection when I discovered it, I really feel that this particular collection falls short.  Devotees to the mythos that enjoy any story with any mention of the Lovecraftian place-names, characters, or phenomena will no doubt enjoy this volume for trivia-compiling purposes, but I found the stories within to be mediocre at best and occasionally downright laughable.  These stories will most likely not be enjoyable to most readers.  The few bright spots (perhaps, less dim spots) include China Mieville's "Details", though even this seems to fall rather far from the mark set by his other work.  A large portion of the others are just silly or seem to depend entirely on the final single-line zinger for horrific affect.    I would strongly suggest that those new to Lovecraft, and in search of more of this type of literature, seek out volumes such as "Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos" or any of the fine works by Thomas Ligotti.  If you are determined to read this particular collection, please do not pay more than 3 dollars for it in a used bookstore 
 A truly fine movie exploring the problems of teen peer pressure, confusion, identity and the need to belong.  Gena Rowlands does an exquisite portrayal of a fine "sage" who indirectly comes to the age of a young man in crisis.  Kevin Zegers does a marvelous job portraying the troubled teen who is caought in a lifelong struggle of being honest with those around him.  A great FAmily MOvie and a wonderful teaching tool 
 I already knew before buying this movie that I wouldnt like it, atleast it comes with Phenomena wich is alot better IMO. Inferno is not one of Argento's best at all and doesent even deserve to be known as a sequel to Suspiria. I like all of his films espesially the gallio ones but this just doesent hold up to his other work. It does have all his imagination but not his style. Pick it up with Phenomena and maybe youll like it but I doubt it 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 The contenet of this book was fine -- exactly what a Jackie Collins fan would expect.  However, the ending is so disappointing, it made me angry!  It seems more like cliffhanger than an ending.  To tell you the truth, I'm still half expecting a sequel!  Just when you're getting to the book's climax, IT ENDS!  It is absolutely unnerving!  This may be due to the facts that it was Ms. Collins' first book and was written back in 1968, I don't know.  But I do know that of all the books she's written, this has got to be the worst 
 Listening to this album is like receiving a LONG SLOW ENEMA. I still have no idea what people see in this much OVERATED band. I understand the comparisons to U2 (which, by the way, is a far superior band), but Pink Floyd?? Pink Floyd runs circles around this poor excuse for a band musically and lyrically!! Creep is their only good song.....There I said it 
 This book is now 8 years old, and we can see the 'fruit' of this kind of thinking in churches today.  Many churches who have put into action the ideas in this book have turned into 'feel good' Christian social clubs.  Don't talk about conviction of sin, the need for repentance and obedience to our Lord.  Instead talk about mistakes and how we are basically all good people.  So many churches, sadly, have become post-modern by clinging to the ways of the world, and THIS is destroying the church.   I hope the authors of this book have the courage to now deal with the 'fruits' of their recommendations.  Maybe a good follow-up to this book would be to deal with how the ideas put forth are now 'killing' the church, and how teaching the truth of Christ, the easy and the not so easy parts, are what people truly need in this dying world 
 We couldn't find ANY of the collectibles on which we needed information - and the index was the WORST I've ever seen!  I felt totally ripped off with this book but it would cost more to return than it was worth.  Maybe I can find an antique outhouse and supply it with a fresh 2007 price guide... 
 I had to read this for college.  I hated it! If it had been 100 pages it would have been much more interesting 
 For slip on slippers-no hands required-these do not pass the test. The small lip in the back does more harm than good.I ordered 1/2 size large and it was not enough. If you have high arches go 1 1/2 sizes larger or look elsewhere. The synthetic upper was more sweaty than comfortable 
 This is a horrible book that presents a lot of scattered topics but fails to bound them together. It has a lot of ultra long math formulas on every pages with very brief explainations. The little explaination is done by refering to other abstract formulas which are on other pages! It is totally unreadable and may be it is intended to be a reference book only 
 Though I am not a Vogue reader, I picked up this book out of curiosity to see what Anna W's splashes in the tabloids were all about.  While the subject is only mildly interesting to me, the author's prose reads like a 300+ page deposition against Anna Wintour from everybody who had/has a major or minor gripe with her. It's a heavy and boring read.  Gossip, if one can get over oneself and admit that it is entertaining, should remain light and diverting. In this book, it is difficult to garner much sympathy for the subject or its author, much less derive the slightest enjoyment from it. I was very happy to put it down.   Perhaps this lackluster effort will compel someone else to attempt a better job. But then again, when that time comes, Anna Wintour may be have disappeared completely from public interest 
 After hearing rave reviews from friends, I expected to be "wow'ed" by this book. And while Dylan's use of language is poetic and painterly in many instances, the vast majority of this manuscript consists of name-dropping, ramblings about superficial details, and elaborate multi-page descriptions of only mildly interesting activities. I mean, was that section about album production in New Orleans EVER going to end? And when it DID, did we actually KNOW any more about the man than what we could have learned in a few paragraphs?  I'm a singer/songwriter, a product of the folk era and a huge fan of Dylan's music. It was exciting to learn how well-read he is and how deep was his study of music genres and geniuses. Beyond that, I was left wanting. And often confused.  If you're expecting to learn about Dylan's heyday in the '60s from this book, better wait for the sequel, 'cause you won't find more than a paragraph here and there in the entire 293 pages.  Sorry, Bob. I still love your music, but next time, hire an editor 
 Well it would be laughable if it weren't for all the women who will read this book, and accept anything in the book as fact. What utter nonsense 
 This book shows how Robert has been lying all along. He talks about how he bought his dream car while being homeless. Ok then, how did Robert make the monthly payment? Why would he be stupid enough to sleep in a Porsch as a bum? This guy is such a liar and is trying to con the masses. He is a conman and a good one. Thats why hes a motivational speaker. It takes a good speaker to con you out of your hard earned money. Don't fall for this conman! This book contradicts what Robert has been preaching in previous books. Robert says pay off your debt while he says he bought his dream car while being homeless. That would be odd but it isn't odd because Robert is a professional liar 
 Personally I found the style of this book irritating. Its 100% hand written text and cartoons, which don't provide a lot of detail and the jokes were lame. The information is not incorrect - I just found it didn't have enough detail to replicate the moves. And its old... eg, the importantance of pedals with toe clips! Best left for the kid 
 Not what I was expecting. Very hard to read as it was written back in the dark ages and the english used is tough 
 Reading a book about Mohammad by Ibn Warraq is like reading a book about John Kennedy by Fidel Castro.   Take a look on the web for Ibn Warraq and his anti-Muslim bias is clear.  Whether sweet or bitter, truth is not something your likely to attain from someone with a clearcut agenda.  But....hey,  its your money   : 
 Sorry guys, I looked forward to working on recipes from this cookbook due to the very enthusiastic reception it received from the media.  The graphics of the book are truly beautiful.  The recipes however, hmmm,  try again.  I followed a simple recipe for Apple Crisp and got a bad result.  I now go to respected standard cookbooks for my Apple Crisp recipe and the old family favorite always turns out great.  Really people, the recipes are NOT the stuff of greatness.  Graphics? Great. Photography? Great?  Recipes? You have got to be kidding 
 i really like douglas coupland, but i didn't like this novel it is the only one though the rest are all 4 or 5 stars 
 Actually, I'm going to keep it really real. I know most of you reviewers  who gave this album 4-5 stars reviews are too blinded by 1980's nostalgia to see and hear that this music is utter crap. Vanity 6 was hot back in the day, but it was due to their s1utty image and not their music. Why do you think the only song you hear by them on the radio is "Nasty Girls"?  That's the only song people remember them for.  Let me tell you a secret: This CD isn't worth $29.52. In fact it shouldn't be worth anything because the music is boring- nothing 'hilarious' or 'interesting' about it. Plenty of of melodies being sung in warbly vocals over Casio go-go beats w/ no bass. I was able to download all of the tracks and after I listened to them, I thanked my lucky stars that I didn't spend one dime on it. Vanity was beautiful, but she couldn't sing or dance. Susan tried to portray herself as cute and innocent, but she couldn't really pull it off with that moustache. Brenda was just whatever. I feel sorry for anyone who buys "Vanity 6" 
 I'm really a great fan of Douglas Coupland, which is perhaps much of the reason I found this book so disappointing. I hate the fact that it has been dubbed the new Microserfs, since it totally lacks the insight, wit and 'funny because its true' apsects of the original. About the only thing it has in common with  Microserfs is the fact that its set in the same industry.   jPod is set in a landscape of unreality, with no apparent reason than to make a series of whacky adventures for eccentric, and for the most part unlikeable, characters. It certainly doesnt reflect the IT industry of today, and the members of the jPod really only seem to represent those aspects of this community which give programmers a bad reputation, as essentially dysfunctional (autistic) as they are. There doesnt even seem to be any real focus for this story. I felt like I was mostly reading about a heap of stuff that 'happened'.  Its not all bad, and there were more than a few humorous moments, and interesting plot twists. Coupland's highly approachable and fast moving writing style hasn't changed. Its really just the subject matter and whatever its trying to communicate that seems to have fallen in a heap, in this book. I normally devour all of his books within a day or two, and want to read them again soon after, but it was a real struggle just to get through this one to the end 
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 If you are looking for a book on how to live on a limited income, this is not your book.  Nina Wildorf seems to live in a world that doesn't involve student loans, car payments, or the idea of a savings account.  Her rule of thimb for budgeting is 20% of your income towards clothes.  This is not fical responsibility.   And only wash your jeans every 6 months so that they don't fade?  Really?  Am I the only one who thinks this is odd?  On the other hand, she does have some cute ideas for decorating on the cheap--I am glad to see that someone besides me goes dumpster diving! 
 Margarett Mitchell must be rolling in her grave. She wrote a masterpiece in the 1930's, then Alexandra Ripley bought the rights to her book by conning Margaret Mitchell's heirs to sell out the legacy of their relative.  Alexandra Ripley's novel was an embarrasing pile of mush, even worse than a Barbara Courtland romance novel.  Beautiful costumes and a good cast - but the script is a soap opera and very poorly written with too many cliche's.  The TV movie version is even worse than Alexandra Ripley's book. I would have given this movie zero stars - but gave it 2 stars solely for the world class acting of Sean Bean as the deliciously evil Lord Fenton.   Sean Bean heats up the screen as a sexy, feral villian along the lines of "The Man You Love to Hate" as an unsafe sex symbol.  Unless you are a Sean Bean fan, there is nothing worthwhile about this film.  The script is trite, cliche'd and very slow moving.  Sean Bean is only in Disc 1 and his character is eliminated and the movie slides downhill from there.  Disc 2 is overwrought with very boring, drawn out courtroom scenes...I was almost rooting that Scarlett would be hanged for the murder just to see an end to this movie!  I've always liked Joanna Whaley-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton. They are excellent actors wasted in this pile of mush movie. Ann-Margaret's performance as Belle Watling is so bad I wanted to slap her.  Do yourself a favor and watch the original Gone With the Wind starring Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh if you want to see a wonderful film 
 There are some good pointers that will be familiar to those who have studied strategy, but the authors' attempt to dress up existing knowledge using the "hardball" metaphor is just a gimmick.    The authors laud "hardball players" such as Dell, WalMart, and Toyota.  These are the companies that pursue competitive advantage "with a single-minded focus."  As if on cue, the "softball players" are trotted out -- those companies that "aren't intensely serious about winning."  Wouldn't it be nice if it were this simple?  The truth is that many businesses play hardball but lose anyway.  Think about it.  The "hardball" sports analogy implies that the goal is to defeat one's competitors and, by doing so, win the game.  As somebody who has built a successful business, experience tells me that this is not accurate.  Truly innovative businesses learn how to change the game, or play their own game, and thereby deliver superior value and results.  Defeating your competitor might be a by-product of success, but it is not the main objective.  After all, Toyota didn't have to defeat BMW to become the powerhouse of the auto industry.  This book is too simplistic to be useful to anybody who already has a rudimentary grasp of corporate strategy 
 I read it because some people recommended it to me as "the father of travel writing". However, it's not been a page-turner to me.. 
 (Commentary below refers to soft cover Third Edition.)  For those of us who learn by example and who need more active guidance through difficult material, this book falls short.  It appears to be a deliberate design strategy of this book, to under-explain then over-exercise.  This is tolerable until one gets to integration, where the sink-or-swim approach will result in many unnecessary drownings.  Stewart seems at least a little better in this regard, and I note that it is replacing Hughes-Hallett in my school.  One could hope some day for a text written by someone who had enough trouble learning the subject, to be able to remember the value of a patient explanation.  No, 8 pages (including the exercises) are NOT sufficient to explain algebraic identities and trigonometric substitution in integration, except to a bright student with a fresh memory of trigonometry.  The physical weight of this book is burdensome, and the price is symptomatic of the shameless shakedown racket that American textbook publishing has become.  Some Web research reveals that a typical price for a German university mathematics text is under $50 equivalent 
 If you're an Asimov junkie like me, you'll buy and read this book no matter what anybody says. But if you were thrilled with the first three books in the series, ecstatic over the addition of Prelude to Foundation, and slightly less than pleased with Foundation's Edge, then you'll be disappointed with this one.  I felt Isaac was preaching at me in some sort of new age galactic godspeak rather than entertaining me with a good story. Maybe that's the danger of writing so many good adventure books: eventually you want to advertise your beliefs. I don't know if that's true or not, but I do know that this book was a terrible letdown for me in an otherwise brilliant series.  The ending didn't gather together the threads of the story, but only seemed to serve as a steppingstone for books that were never to be written. The Foundation Series is a grand adventure, standing up for the most part over forty years after some of the volumes were written. Well, five out of six of them do, at least 
 I have been a faithful Mia fan for 5 years and have bought all the other games for my two kids. This game is a big disappointment. The language game is virtually unplayable in French. I am fluent in French and went to a French language university for nine years. I could barely understand what the characters were saying. If this program is intended to teach kids a second language, it would be more likely to turn them off the language instead. This game definitely does not cater to anyone who does not already have an understanding of French 
 This is the classic original round stick Old Spice deodorant formula and now I realize that it is really dated.  The formula hasn't changed since its inception and you will know it when the alcohol starts to burn your underarms.   If you want the great smell of Old Spice then just use the After Shave and Cologne, but stay away from the old stick deodorant. I'll continue to use the Old Spice High Endurance deodorants which have improved modern formulas & scents and work much much better. 
 I do not recommend you read this book unless you are an academic in the field and need to do so.  Although I am unsympathetic with many of the ideas in it, the primary reason for my low rating is that the book was overlong and poorly written where it matters.  I'll start with what I liked about the book.  The first chapters were on the history of evolutionary theory, and it is here where Gould's principal strength as a popularizer comes through well.  Although these chapters could have been more concise, and they were oriented towards backing Gould's ideas, I enjoyed them for the most part.    The last chapters in the modern theory section on the importance of constraint were interesting, though they suffered heavily from Gould's style of discourse.  I found the last pages of the book on the importance of contingency to be quite beautiful.  The bulk of the book consisted of the material on punctuated equilibrium and Gould's hierarchy of Darwinian individuals.   I had issues with the ideas themselves, but these are a distant second to what I felt about Gould's notion of an argument.    Evolutionary biology is not a branch of philosophy and textual analysis should not, as Gould claims, "be pursued more often in scientific discussion."  They are not done so, according to him, because of the "philistinistic culture of science."  Molecular biology and mathematics are vital components of evolutionary biology, as much and perhaps more so than the incomplete fossil record.  Gould gave lip service to molecular biology and much less respect to the now venerable and important discipline of population genetics - except of course when the results from these fields backed up his narrative.  Gould's use of lawyerly argument, where verdict is truth, is the reason why he is rightfully disdained for opening the door to creation "science" in the debate on teaching evolution in schools.   By stripping away hard science, and replacing it with metaphors, cartoons, and narratives, Gould took a rigorous theory, based firmly on empirical and deductive facts, and replaced it with a secular creation myth that is open to attack.  Although this has made him the darling of what he calls the "literati", it is also what made him a bad scientist.  The fact that he addressed modern Darwinism tangentially, chose instead to focus on Darwin's and others Victorian era writings, and rejected ideas because they didn't "feel right," didn't improve his standing with me.  Gould's writing when it came to the science under debate was a nightmare.  Intentionally or not, he constructed a complex hierarchy of nested, irrelevant tangents; tangents that were fragments within sentences, which were then tangents within paragraphs, which were in turn tangents within sections, ad nauseam.   One of the most frustrating aspects of the book was that he refused to give a clear definition of what he meant by "punctuated equilibrium" until pg 1001: "We locate any revisionary status for punctuated equilibrium in its suggestions about the nature of stasis, and particularly its implications for attributing macroevolutionary phenomena to causes operating on the differential success of species treated as Darwinian individuals.  Ordinary speciation remains fully adequate to explain the causes and phenomenology of punctuation."  Others, such as Richard Dawkins, have done much on addressing this definition of punctuated equilibrium.  My comment here is that it took so long to come to it, and up until this point Gould hinted at saltationist underpinnings to punctuated equilibrium, only to later decry and impugn the integrity of his critics for criticizing these alternative definitions.    My main intellectual criticism was of Gould's hierarchy of Darwinian individuals.  I thought this was fine as a phenomenological tool to describe macroevolutionary events, but Gould inverted cause and phenomena to claim that species selection is irreducible to gene or organism selection.  His reason why?  "Nonlinearities."  Along with not knowing what the word "fractal" means, which he used quite a bit to mean either "self-similar" or "scales up", Gould thought "nonlinear" meant "hopelessly complex."  His style of argument?  Keep repeating the word irreducible until the reader breaks down.  Gould was snidely dismissive towards the results of population genetics, but only addressed them directly in a (relatively) brief two page discussion where he claimed that they had to be invalid because population genetics models were able to explain both punctuated equilibrium (stasis followed by rapid change) and his cartoon notion of Victorian gradualism.  Since Gould himself was clear that both are evident in the fossil record, it is strength, not a weakness, of a modeling system to be able to explain both.        Although the ideas in the book did not all resonate with me, I would have recommended it if it was more clear and much, much more concise, since the ideas in it are an important part of the current discussion on evolutionary theory.  But because of the poor writing in the important scientific parts of the book, and Gould's often unprofessional comments towards critics, I don't think this behemoth of a tome is worth your time.  
 For the Wall Street Journal reading, Heineken drinking, Yuppie set this may be a fascinating journey through all the dive bars that a real beer aficionado would try to avoid. Except for a brief visit to the pacific northwest, the author manages to steer clear all of the places where a vibrant beer scene exists, opting instead to seek out every southern dive bar with an ICE COLD BEER sign. I found the self-appointed beer experts that the author rubbed elbows with, to be trite and pretentious. For the dilettantes this is an excellent rambling unorganized pilgrimage through the backdoors of the corporate beer world, as well as Graceland, Hannibal, MO, and Hooters (Where were Busch Gardens and Disney Land?). For the active or aspiring zymurgist this book will drag you kicking and screaming through swinging doors, where you will find all the opinionated drunkards and self-proclaimed homebrewing gurus you can stomach, telling banal stories about the origin of the IPA style. Take all the time you would waste reading this and cook up a batch to enjoy while reading something worthwhile. As an afterthought this edition was also riddled with typos, and word choices like "scrum" 
 Yes, these recipes can be finished in 30 mins when you are somewhat organised in your kitchen. Yes, recipes are also suitable for get togethers.  However, I was not 100% happy with this book for two reasons -   one, some of the recipes are not very creative and probably everyone who has lived with flatmates at some point in life has done them... two, photos of presentations would make all the difference in the world...   Most of us use more than our sense for taste when cooking and enjoying a meal and that also applies for getting ideas what to cook 
 mr. woods kept going down the hill but still so actively churning out bad almost barely readable novels year after year. this hollywood detective/cop turning bad story really sucks big time. very bad dialogue and storyline. guess woods simply couldn't get away from hollywood too far.now i rank him under sidney sheldon and harold robbins. give it a rest of this kind of hollywood junk, don't waste too much paper again. 
 The fact is this guy does not give the most solid advice for directing.  He rips on Spielberg, and basicly calls martin scorsese a Hack.  He tells you that a good idea is to sleep with your producers to secure you job, just a lot of things that are not that helpfull.  He does have some good things to say, but you have to dig through so much crap that it's not really worth it.  There are plenty of other good books out there, and this would be one to pass on 
 I liked this book all the way through the trial, but the post-trial revelation was, at the very least, ridiculous.  It did not come across as a "Sixth Sense" shocker but a cheap shot out of left field.  It was stupid and didn't fit with the story, at all.  The author didn't need it and should have tied up the loose ends a different way.  I can't even look back on the book and see how it all it.  It didn't.  Throughout the book, even alone with his own thoughts, Tom didn't reveal his true character.   This book was a huge disappointment!  I would not recommend that anyone waste their time.  In the end, when all is "revealed" nothing makes sense.  No matter how hard you might try - it doesn't fit, at all!  
 This collection of short essays he published in an English paper (and meant for an English audience) seem to miss the mark for American readers.  It's as if he published this because he needed money.  There was nothing original in this book, nothing really funny and what few authentically funny parts there were seemd trite and at times exaggerated.  I got tired of this book half-way through and gave up 
 I was disappointed with my purchase.   The first two tapes in the series were fine, but when I inserted the 3rd tape into my machine the tape started feeding out the front of the machine.  I checked the tape and the wheels or sprockets they were wound on were loose and free floating inside the plastic casing.  I, then examined the other remaining cassettes and 4 of the 8 had the same problem.  I wonder if these products were seconds or something?  I would not order from this vendor again because it could have ruined my machine and because it is a hassle to have to return merchandise in today's busy work world.  
 The fundamental problem with this book is, it assumes you can buy a property for 100K, and get $1000 a month in rent. That's just not possible anywhere in America. Where I live 500K gets you about $2000 a month in rent. About 400K gets $1000 a month. Because the books hinges on these numbers it's really quite useless. 
 What McLaren set out to do and what he did are different things.  What he set out to do was to tell an outline of the scriptural story in fictional dialogues through an outline of C's: creation, crisis, calling, conversation, Christ, community, and consummation.  It is essentially a long sermon or non-fiction text in the mouths of three people.  What he ended up doing was forcing the content into contrived characters and minimal settings.  The characters are cardboard cut-outs with holes where their mouths should be, and McLaren runs back and forth between the three spewing trite theological niceties from each.  To make matters worse, the characters continually stroke one another with comments like "good point" and "great insight," which becomes all the more repulsive when you realize it's just McLaren patting himself on the back.  Forced, sermonic dialogue is the worst kind of literature and McLaren does the worst job of it I've ever seen.  In fact, there are two points at which one of the characters simply says, "Here's the sermon I preached that day," and McLaren goes from droning, sermonic dialogue to just photocopied manuscripts he used in his church.  McLaren receives moderate criticism for having "weak" or liberalized theology.  I think this is probably overblown.  McLaren is just a small voice trapped in his time; there's no novel heresy here.  McLaren is reviving from traditional, theological, impersonal churches that are not shaped so much by an intentional philosophy or ecclesiology as by a generation of non-emotive Depression survivors.  His solution is a church that focuses on love and good feelings without getting caught up in the theological controversies of the day.  But there is no alternative to the controversies here, just avoidance.  He shows as much in the characters who are baptized after the confession, "I don't know about all of these doctrines" (p. 112), who replace Jesus' "kingdom" with a "revolution" (p. 116), and who prefer to refer to Jesus as "master" if it means "expert" rather than "ruler" (p. 121).  There's no explanation as to why we should hold to all the Jesus talk anyway if we get to intentionally change the plain, 1st century sense of "kurios" or change Jesus' metaphors into stuff that X-gen types will think is cool.  Ultimately, McLaren is coming out of one of these stodgy, old, legalistic traditions and saying little more than, "It can be so much more appealing than this."  But as far as I can tell from the younger generation, the intended audience, his most common response will not be "aha!" but "duh."  So, just to address all the latest buzz: stop reveling in Brian McLaren; he's doing enough of it for himself 
 Each year, I dig into the works of a classic children's writer. Eleanor Estes caught my attention because her novels, many published 60 years or more ago, have recently been reissued. This one has terrific illustrations by Louis Slobodkin, a huge talent in his own arena. The story here is simple, which may be obvious, but I'm fascinated by how something so basic becomes so beloved. The writer's style is skilled and serviceable, but there's nothing magical about the language (as with E.B. White). The dated material is occasionally offputting. The main characters are so thinly sketched as to be cliche. And the true payoff, the reality of the "hundred dresses," is almost thrown away. Is the childhood memory of a beloved book what makes it a classic 
 i gave it 2 stars as i felt that overall i would not recommend this book 
 There is no question that Ayn Rand's followers (especially their leaders) can be rather strange at times.  There is also no doubt that the Ayn Rand Institute (started by the now "retired" Leonard Piekoff) can be labeled as a dogmatic cult. In their defense, it is the only dogmatic cult I know of that preaches the use of logical arguments and personal responsibility.  Their strange hero worship of Rand notwithstanding I think their doctrines are perfectly harmless, though presented in a strangely non individualist way.  With a quick search around the web you will be able to quickly locate some of the odd characters presented in this book -- and you could easily write a book based on all of the gossip that goes on in various message boards and blogs.  That is precisely what Walker did, and his obvious distain for Ayn Rand and the Objectivist movement colors every sentence of his poorly written and poorly researched book.    Of course everyone is painted in the worst light possible.  Even Alan Greenspan, the very highly respected economist and FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN is written off as a second rate poorly educated lackey of Rand's.  Every person who ever disliked Mr. Greenspan must have been interviewed for the chapter on him.  The over the top take on Rand and her philosophy lacks any pretense of impartiality and why did the author of the book feel the need to add a chapter in the end depicting what he thinks Rand's life should have been like?  Rand's incredible life was her own to live and a lightweight (shall we say second hander) like Walker doesn't need to tell us how it should have been.  If you read some of the more reasonable biographies on Ayn Rand it will become obvious that she was a quirky genius (can't that be said of most geniuses?) with a strange, though highly intelligent group of followers. She wrote some excellent and profound literature highlighting the key American ideals and made some important contributions to philosophy and political debate. 
 I ordered and paid in full (through Amazon) for a gift subscription to Vogue Kitting last Christmas, 2005. The recipient never received a single issue and was treated very poorly when she phoned to inquire on more than on occasion.   It is a quarterly publication but no longer seems to be consistently offered on news stands in major bookstores. Read the policy regarding refunds and cancellations carefully before you give them your money!  The content of the magazine may be worthwhile but their inability to deliver as promised and poor customer service earn them one star 
 Hatred is not a good way to try to get back in the lime light.  Read your books, saw your picture, and now I understand why you took such extreme tactics to get attention.  Get some talent 
 This book is about as obvious and vague as they come. Nearly ever one of the 101 topics in the book is one of four things: 1) An aspect of starting your own business that is just too obvious to put into a book like this; 2) Someone describes a lesson they learned but gives absolutely NO specifics on exactly what they did that ended up working out for their business; 3) A situation in which a person's (so-called) mistake was the only way they really learned and they worked through it to become successful. The hindsite in these is mearly wishful thinking; or 4) Norman does an absolutely horrid job of explaining what happened or how it supports the title of the lesson. I'll be honest and say that it seems as if Norman wanted to write this "101 things" book so bad, she yanked any possible meaning from a heap of shallow and cliche-filled quotes from business owners.  There ARE a few (and I literally mean 2 or 3) bits of info that you might not think about. But really, if you're serious about starting your own business, you will get nothing from this book 
 To be honest, the most useful piece of information in the book, and the most telling comment regarding the author's attitude, is on the back cover, where he references the "unforgivably successful" book by Bernard Goldberg that inspired this tome. That's the liberal mindset after all: ANY success is unforgivable. After reading the back, I put the book back on the shelf and bought Goldberg's book 
 Sheri is great on the radio show she co-hosts however her humor did not work so well in this book of random thoughts and statements.  The idea for the book, transforming and organizing her family, is good but I found the book to be way too scattered to be considered a good read 
 While this book does dispel the image of Bob Hoffman as some sort of saint not to mention the fact that Fair dispels the notion that Hoffman was a strongman or superhealthy. In reality, Hoffman used aluminium weights for his "strongman exhibitions" and was quite unhealthy. And he was no saint.  Hoffmans main source of income was from his Oil Burner business. He saw weightlifting as a business opportunity and his primary interest was olympic weightlifting with bodybuilding as a sidethought.  Indeed, Hoffman found that by promoting bodybuilding events along with olympic weightlifting he could increase the attendance at the ole so boring olympic weightlifting contests.  Hoffman also saw an opportunity to sell weights, vitamins, protein powders and other supplements via weightlifting contests and his magazine Strength & Health which in fact was nothing more than a catalogue promoting his products.   Through the efforts of Hoffman, the AAU Mr. America was more or less a "who is the best built York BBC Man of the year." Poor Dan lurie would  win every subdivision and place second repeatedly during the early 40's and had to wonder when York would run out of employees that he had to be second to.  In 1947 Steve Stanko, a York employee would win the AAU/FIHC Mr. Universe contest in Phildelphia. In all fairness, this being the time when legends like Clancy Ross, Steve Reeves, George Eiferman, Lud Shusterick, Andre Drapp and Oscar Heidenstam not to mention York Barbells very own John Carl Grimek walked the earth, Steve Stanko Mr. Universe? C'mon!  The problems with Hoffman controlling the AAU bodybuilding movement continued through the 40's, 50's, 60's and even the 70's. Black and Puertican bodybuilders had no chance to win the coveted AAU Mr. America title and would frequently place lower than what they deserved in lower level contests as well. As a result, many of the top names just left the sport in disgust. The IFBB tried to launch in America but met with incredible opposition from Hoffman. It would be a decade later untill the IFBB would make a major impact on bodybuilding and give bodybuilders a fair alternative.   For years Hoffman was concerned about the popularity of bodybuilding and felt that too many in the Iron Game were focusing on the muscle contests in lieu of his precious olympic lifting. For the same reason, Hoffman tried to hold back powerlifting, initially referring to the sport as "Odd Lifting." I guess it was "odd" to Hoffman. The first National Powerlifting Championships were held in 1965 in York, Pa. and were incredibly successful. Hoffman even launched a new magazine called "Muscular Development" which would cover both bodybuilding and powerlifting while Strength & Health, Hoffmans flagship magazine (catalogue) would cover mostly olympic weightlifting with some health articles which were really intended to sell Hoffmans products. Sort of like an early version of informercials.   To Hoffmans dismay, powerlifting grew tremendously. Participants found that powerlifting was far easier on the body and joints that heavy squat cleans, split cleans, overhead presses, snatches and clean and jerks. Powerlifting also drew larger audiences than olympic lifting and once again Hoffman was concerned about taking away from olymic weightlifting. When it was discovered that England, Australia, Germany, Canada and many other countries had powerlifting advocates, powerlifters were after the AAU to organize a World Championships. But alas, Hoffman via the AAU claimed it could not be done.  In 1970, George Frenn who was an associate editor for Weiders magazine Muscle Builder/Power beseiged Joe Weider to organize a international powerlifting competition and Mr. Weider did. It was held along with the IFBB Mr. Western America in Los Angeles and was incredibly successful. This was despite attempts by the York group to stop the contest. According to the York magazines, "any AAU registered athlete who competes in this competition will be banned for life by the AAU." Reality was that York was just blowing smoke. The competition was extremely successfu. So successful that now Hoffman saw the possibilities (via competition with Joe Weider??) to organize the first World Powerlifting Championships in York, Pa. in 1971. Interesting how the impossible became possible. It was most obvious that the only reason that Hoffman organized the first World Powerlifting Championships was in fact to even the score with Joe Weider...but the good news is what came out of it....powerlifting surged in popularity, formed their own federation leaving the AAU which as far as most people were concerned, stood for Amateur Archiac Union, at least as far as the Iron Game was concerned.  Also during the 1970's, the IFBB gained acceptance with the General Assembly of General Sports Assembly giving the IFBB superiority over the AAU and establishing the IFBB as the official governing body for the sport of bodybuilding! Slowly, bodybulders in the USA began to switch over from the AAU to the IFBB and bodybuilders finally had a viable alternative. Today, the AAU no longer sanctions bodybuilding contests. The NPC, the american affiliate to the IFBB squelched the AAU and bodybuilders are far better off as result.  Strength & Health went the way of the stagecoach. Muscular Development was bought by Twin Labs. York Barbell still sells weights but you won't find York Barbell running any national level bodybuilding or powerlifting competitions anymore or even local events.   Getting back to my initial question, what exactly did Bobby Hoffman do for the Iron Game? I guess the best thing he did was plant the seeds for better promoters to take the sport where Hoffman couldn't or wouldn't. Bodybuilding shows are now held in large convention centers ins tead of YMCA's and High School Auditoriums and professional contests resemble rock concerts with special effects and large audiences. Olympic lifting and power lifting are both in better hands now as well.  Protein products now actually have protein rather than white sugar and white flour, the two main ingredients in Hoffmans products.   The other thing that Hoffman did was to infuriate members of the Iron Game to take the ball from Hoffman and run with it. To make The Iron Game the great sport that it is today. Hoffman may have initiated some of the things that we love about the sport today, but in fact, The Iron Game is far better off without Hoffman and York Barbell than it ever was with the York gang.  One other thing. In the early 60's, York Barbell were the first to exploit anabolic steriod use. A certain Dr. Zeigler administered them to York Olympic lifters in an attempt to compete on a world level in Olympic Weigthlifting. Soon steriod use exploded to bodybuilders and weightlifters were taking steriods like they use to take vitamin supplements and eating them like candy. Interesting too that even without steriods, the Japanese, Russians and the Germans still stayed ahead of our Drug Taking Americans! If it wasn't for York Barbell and Bob Hoffman perhaps steriod use would not be so prevelent today.  Gee--thanks Bob!  
 I started reading this book with the expectation that I would learn about women in a culture totally different than mine. Instead, I read the story of a lusty, rich, worldly woman with no sense of morality. Then it gets  incredibly dry as the author launches into a historical story from the  middle ages. Very boring, and I heartily do NOT recommend this book 
 Me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater. I ... was ... bored ... out ... of ... my ... skull. After about a half hour my friend, who tends to be more "progressive" than I, actually suggested we leave. It was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing. Ever!  Perhaps I'm biased. However I highly recommend that no one get this movie. The only reason I can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant. I tend to lean to the right, but even I was entertained by V For Vendetta, despite it being blatant liberal propaganda. If you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil, at least make it interesting 
 This is a book that tries to do too much.  Its goal of exploring religion and popular culture is a good one, but that's territory that has been covered in many texts before, and with much greater insight than you'll find here.  Check out Chidester's earlier books on colonialism and the Jim Jones suicide for better scholarship.  Look elsewhere for better books on religion and American popular culture 
 Glad I was able to borrow this rather than buy.  It his his show in a book.  By the way I have never seen such consistantly low ratings.  Could it be that the majority of his fans can't read?  I have to believe this guy makes a few bucks between his show, radio and books.  Why does he have to fall to the level of hawking factor crap on his show.  Even Hannity is above that.  I gave him 1 star above the default minimum for spelling and grammer. 0 for useful content 
 Like my topic says, be sure you know what you buy. Robinson is giving details on how the book was found, compiled, traded, stolen and so fourth around the world. He goes into why it has been covered up for so long, instead of actually getting into what is written in the Gospel of Judas. If you want to know the History of this Gospel, and why it took so long to surface into the public eye, then I highly recommend this book. However, if your looking into the Gospel of Judas itself, what it says, and it's meanings, I would advise a different book 
 I bought a paperback copy of Unexplained Mysteries of World War II, at, of all places, the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC. I am a World War II buff and it looked like an interesting and somewhat offbeat read. It was that, and in general I enjoyed the book until I became aware of numerous factual errors and numerous instances of what appear to me to be copying from other sources.  The most grievous factual error was on page 160 in the People Who Vanished section, dealing with the B-24 bomber Lady Be Good. The story says that other than a few bits and pieces of clothing, etc., nothing was ever found of the crew. This is incorrect, and could have been verified with even some casual research in the library or on the Internet. In fact, all but one of the nine crewmember's bodies have been found and recovered. This is set out in great detail in the book, The Lady Be Good - Mystery Bomber of World War II, by Dennis E. McClendon. It was published in 1962 and updated in 1982 when new information about the Lady Be Good's final mission was discovered. Diaries recovered from two of the crewmembers gave stark details of their doomed but determined trek north to try and escape the limitless desert.  On page 174 in the People Who Vanished section, the book stated that the U.S. Navy was unable to explain why Flight 19 vanished, despite an exhaustive investigation. In actual fact, the Navy's 1946 report lists a number of Facts, Opinions and Conclusions based on multiple sources of evidence.   More than a dozen specific factors were cited that led to the loss, the changing of any one of which would have resulted in a different outcome: the failure of Lt. Taylor's compass; Lt. Taylor's unfamiliarity with the area; the fact that none of the airplanes had an operable/accurate clock; bad radio reception; delays in sending out rescue airplanes; inability to obtain a prompt RDF fix on the flight to help guide it home; the onset of night, which meant the pilots were ditching at sea in the most hazardous conditions imaginable; failure of the teletype system to keep shore stations apprised of the situation, etc. A good summary of the information can be found in The Bermuda Triangle Mystery - Solved, by Larry Kusche, first printed in 1986 and updated in 1995. The Navy is not mystified about what happened to Flight 19 - they screwed up, got lost, and died.  On page 166 of the People Who Vanished section is told the discovery of the ship Rubicon adrift in the Florida Straits in 1944, her crew nowhere to be found. While newspaper stories at the time hinted that something odd, the final paragraph of the New York Times story about the incident indicates that the ship was moored in Havana and the lines may have given way during hurricane-force winds, blowing the ship out to sea sans crew. Again, see The Bermuda Triangle Mystery - Solved, by Larry Kusche. This is another non-mystery that is shown as such by examining all the facts.  On page 28 of the Puzzling Events section, the advertisement for the game The Deadly Double that ran in The New Yorker just a few weeks before the Pearl Harbor attack is discussed, and it is stated that an unknown person who did not identify himself placed the ad - and that the man later met a violent end. In fact, the couple that placed the ad, Mr. and Mrs. Roger Craig, were interviewed by the FBI and completely cleared of anything other than being involved in a rather odd coincidence. The incident was discussed in some detail in The Broken Seal, by Ladislas Farago, first published in 1967.  My final comment is in regards to pages 58-59 in the Odd Coincidences section, A Couple of Mixed-Up Britons and A Postcard with a Unique View, and page 177 of the Peculiar Premonitions section, Churchill's Sudden Impulse. While I realize that all of these incidents drew from some of the same sources, it strikes me as odd that they bear a striking resemblance to the way the same incidents are described in Mysteries of the Unexplained, Reader's Digest Association, published in 1982. 
 Save your money!!  Not even worth buying used.   If a field guide is going to be uncommon then it should be full of heart.  Lacking this it should have basic info with at least a chuckle.  I was left feeling MS Lichen never left her car and read better descriptions of Chickadees from grandma's diaries.   Do not be conned by Linda Feltner's good field sketches and the sales package.  This book is bought for the illustrations only 
 First of all, who was the spastic genius who decided that concert films had to change camera angles every five seconds? This is terribly anoying, especially when every third shot is of the same audience members. This may be fun for a home video, but not for a mass marketed commercial release. The Dance Hall Crashers are an awesome band. Much of the fun of seeing the DHC in concert is their highly kinetic stage presence. It would have been great if this DVD had concentrated on the band as a whole and not just different extreme closeups switched at a dizzying rate.  And since the DHC are supposed to be the focus, why does the director insist on featuring so many shots of the audience? It gets on your nerves.  I love the DHC. Their live CD has a permanent place on my playlist. But this horribly made DVD only made it through three songs. Perhaps if I had been at the front of the stage that night, I would appreciate it more. 
 I live in Japan and I find this book not too useful.  Whenever I hear a slang word that I don't know, I would try to look it up in this book but 95% of the time it's not there.  It's fun to read the entries on its own, but it's not very comprehensive and a bit outdated.  Also, the sections are arranged in a not so easy to use format.  I wished that I had spent my money on something else 
 I was misled,I thought I was getting a box set of thier movies and rcv'd a box set from the television series.In my excitement of recieving this I opened the package and later on learned that I could not return opened packages...So, It was a total waste for me.I did not get what I wanted at all 
 This book is laid out for the absolute novice.  Considering Sammon's long career in photography, I am really very surprised that this book does not have any inspiring photographs.  Many of the lessons are repetitive - the same photos are used for various lessons and the same techniques are mentioned over and over again (i.e., photos - Hearst castle, Amazon Indians; techniques - nik Pro filters, Photoshop curves).  And some lessons are almost unnecessarily inserted on a whim. Sammon has a well-deserved reputation as a photographer, but his take on digital photography does not do justice to this exciting field.  It is an exciting time in photography, and Sammon fails to portray that excitement in his book. I would recommend Tom Ang or the "How to Wow" series of books for better content.  I hope to see a more inspiring book from Sammon in the near future.  
 Wow!  This toy was made as cheap as possible.  Shame on crayola for not spending the extra pennies to make this more durable and a better quality product. Great concept, but poor designers!  Steps aside crayola - your name doesn't stand for much anymore! 
 I bought this camera two years ago, the pictures were always perfect, even though from the sixth month it started getting stains everywhere, but then i found out that it was normal, not good but it usually happens to this cameras. But the worst of all is tha fact that it displays the Error 18 (E18), the lens gets stock and the camera won't work at all. I searched in google about it, because the user guide says nothing about this error, and then I read many reviews that said that there was nothing to do about it and many Canon cameras have the same defect... I am really mad and dissapointed on CANON, i will never buy a camera of this brand, and I wouldn't recommend it, unless you are willing to buy a camera for 2 years or LESS and then throw your money to the trash 
 Trying to mix the positive thinking of Robert Schuller, and the faith movement theology of Paul Yonggi Cho and Kenneth Copeland, Osteen has taken the stadium seminar circuit to a new level. Augmented now by his book, "Your Best Life Now: 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential" he pushes the find the god/champion within yourself.  Here, we see he has a study guide to help point out what is not difficult to understand with his book. To his credit, there are a few more Scriptures laced into this guide. However, the main book is not making any points that a study guide will enhance, and only the lowliest of sheep will need the extra help.  People who are down on their luck, or discouraged with life will find Osteen a good read. It is a feel-good book, reducing the image of Christianity to be about us and not about God. Bigger than life is Osteen's picture on the cover, knowing that if you saw him on TV, you might want his book.  "Getting your mind off of yourself," with the goal of self-fulfillment should appeal also to readers of Wayne W. Dyer and other authors looking to reach those who feel disenfranchised.   Osteen's rambling, choppy speaking style comes through, written like he's campaigning for office. Reading like a seminar set to print, it sums as quickly as reading through its self-determinist table of contents:   1. Enlarge your vision  2. Develop a healthy self-image  3. Discover the power of your thoughts and words  4. Let go of the past  5. Find strength through adversity  6. Live to give  7. Choose to be happy   The steps sound innocuous, and, outside of their religious context, are. Within their religious context, evangelicals and charismatics will likely find offense at Osteen's assertions about controlling your own destiny as opposed to letting God control it.   Aim a little higher, and check out Charles Colson's "The Good Life." The title sounds similar, but Colson defines what makes for a good life far differently than Osteen. Save your money, and if you have Osteen's book, read it without the guide.  Anthony Trendl  editor, HungarianBookstore.co 
 Obviously any book that claims to tbe the hundred best of any genre of books is an automatic target for potshots from committed readers.  But this book is a fatter target than most.      Any children's librarian at any public library, and any bookseller at an independent bookstore, will give a parent far more help than this, and for free.  Some of the choices are so obvious that it's sad to waste space on them -- what parent really needs to be told about Pat the Bunny?  As to the overall selection of books, let's just say it's banal and uninteresting and leave it at that.   Some of the choices are  obvious sops to political correctness -- viz. Johnny Tremain.  And any book claiming to list the 100 best children's books that doesn't include a single title by Arthur Ransome does a major disservice to parents trying to buy good books for their children.  Save the price of the book and just spend a few minutes with a preschool or elementary school teacher, a librarian, or a good bookseller 
 "Midnight Warrior" is the kind of book that you read for the sex, because you would be sadly disappointed if you actually read it for the historical accuracy or the "romance".  Iris Johansen is a master at depicting heroines who, having come from less than dazzling backgrounds, find inner strength.  Amazingly, even at their angriest, these women never swear, which is more than can be said for the "heroes".  A more bull-headed lot of males I have never read about--!  Oh, well, perhaps I am being unfair because I am not a Johansen fan...but, the only way for you to find out is to read a Johansen book for yoursel 
 This book is incredibly out of date and negative.  It spends a lot of time telling you to put your foot down about how you don't want all these interventions that nobody does anymore anyway (i.e. enemas, pubic shaves, routine IVs) unless you have a 60 year old male OB in a rural hospital.  The obstetric information is behind the times.  The book is also ridiculously anti-physician.  This book would have you believe that obstetricians want nothing more than to prescribe drugs that are harmful to your fetus, over-medicate you during labor and cut episiotomies willy-nilly.  Additionally, I found a lot of the advice the book gives coaches incredibly insulting; it states over and over again that the laboring woman will ask for pain medicine but she doesn't really know what she needs and the coach should make sure she doesn't get any pain medicine under any circumstances.  How is this any better than 1950's obstetrics that knocked all women out regardless of their wishes?  The old black and white "earth mother" photographs of nude laboring women and their half naked, side burn sporting coaches had some comedic value (After reading this book my husband quipped, "You'll let me know when it's time to don my speedo, right?").  Having said all that, the actual information about the relaxation techniques and positioning of the Bradley method are quite good.  Check the book out from the library, make photocopies of the exercises or take some notes.  Then take the rest of the book with a grain of salt 
 "The Cherry Orchard" is an atrocious play.  If we hold this play in high regard, then we dramatist's need to reevaluate our standards.  Chekhov wrote a play that will make you not care an inch about the character's or their situation(s).  For him to think that this is a comedy makes you wonder if he understood the point he himself was trying to make.  The characters are pathetic and they'll make you pity them - not because of their predicaments, but because of whom they are.  I do not recommend 
 I bought this book for my Pre-K class, to go along with our weather unit on Rain. The cover looked so nice I thought it would be a great book. In fact, the illustrations are quite nice; the problem is there's really no story here. The language doesn't flow; its very choppy. The children didn't enjoy this book, and have not asked for it to be read again. Good children's literature should have a story to it: a setting, problem and solution; a definite beginning, middle and ending; and well-defined characters. This book has none of that 
 If I could I would give this book no stars. I did not find anything in this book at all helpful. I bought this when I first got married in hopes that would give me some sort of insight into marriage and my husband. Now 4 years down the line, I learned this book is nothing but rubbish. Foremost I did not care for the author Kevin Leman. He seems like just your typical egotistical male writing a book with the thoughts that all women are fragile little butterflies in a cocoon and all men are barbaric sex maniacs. I am not in anyway a feminist, but unfortunately in alot of marriages the stereotypical "You Jane, Me Tarzan" does not fit. In my case, this was so, which is why this book was of little use to me. I will give it a little credit. In a way, it made me realise how lucky I was that my husband came no where near the way this guy was describing men! Maybe it is a good book for those in "typical" relationships. But, not a good book if you or your significant other falls out of the lines of the "typical" male and female behavior 
 Kant is a genius; I give him that.  Still, his primary problem is that he presupposes in all his philosophy that there can be nothing beyond the natural and material world.  His aesthetics suffer as he tries to find a completely "objective" way of interpreting and appreciating the arts.  Not only does this not work in theory, but every human knows empirically that music, sunsets, and Monet are simply not capable of being interpreted completely void of feeling or pleasure 
 It's always nice to watch Famke Janssen, of course, but I like it better when she's either a very smart X-Person or a Bond-busting sadist.  This movie really wanted to scare me but sheesh.  And the bad guy was like an evil version of Sgt. Carter from Gomer Pyle - totally implausible.  I think the problems start in these movies when horror writers direct them 
 i actually saw this movie when i was 7 and it freaked me out abit, but i mean the brother was basically a blob with a face and the story was as bad as the acting. The ending was garbage and it had nothing to offer in todays world.Dont even rent this, i dont even know why you are considering the film.  I only give it a 2 star rating because t managed to scare a seven year old and i havent forgot how dumb the film was since. 
 When I picked up this book I had high expectations,seeing that it had received good reviews.It opened quite spectacularly as well, on a rather surreal note.But as I read on, I couldn't help wondering what the point was in this rather incoherent, rambling tale.The book seemed like a sloppy, haphazard collection of incidents that didn't make much sense or assist character development. The central character herself was unbelievable and I found it impossible to identify with her or understand her actions or even sympathise with her plights.It seems to me that the writer had tried too hard to create a hip,cutting edge story and the end product was strained and gimmicky. Some incidents were quite mirth-provoking, however,that's why I gave it two stars 
 I picked up a copy of this because of the number of people telling me that this was so much better than Conway's other poorly-done books. After reading it, I strongly disagree!!  Beginning in the introduction, when she incorrectly states that "the words Wicca, Witchcraft and the Craft are actually interchangeable", there is very little here that can't be found in dozens of other phoney McWicca-lite introductory texts.   Her history is based on the myth that there was once a peaceful matriarchy, and everyone worshipped "the Goddess" until evil patriarchy came along and spoiled everything. She would do well to actually read some of the accurate archeological works listed in her bibliography!  She then proceeds to confuse the term "Paganism". In spite of the way she misuses the word, "Paganism" is actually a large group of related, but highly dissimilar religious. It is not a single path "based on a specific pantheon of deities", and there are certainly more than "only a few differences between Wicca and Paganism, besides the difference in their ages". (And NO religion can be dated back to the Stone Age! NO ONE knows what beliefs existed then, what their 'religious' practices were, or even if they HAD any religious beliefs!) She also defines many Traditions within Wicca inaccurately, and shows little understanding of the history of Wicca, or the various practices that define it's many branches.  When speaking of Deities, she first states that Wicca is polytheistic, then proceeds to "explain" that all Gods are a reflection of a single God archetype, and even the Gods are subservient to the Goddess. (That's not polytheism.) She also speaks of Triple aspects of Goddess, saying that this is a universal concept, and that it has been recognized "from the beginning of religion". This is untrue. (She has quite a habit of stating historical "facts" that are contrary to the archeological evidence, without saying where she is obtaining her "information". She also frequently speaks of conclusions of how found items were used or what they signify that are very different from what the scholars who are trained to interpret such finds conclude. Especially when the archeologists determine that NO conclusions can be made from the evidence available.)  In my opinion, Ms Conway's version of "wicca" is a blend of New Age thought, Ceremonial Magic influence, and poor research. While I don't doubt that it could be used to create a viable and valid spiritual path, it bears little relation to actual Wicca. If one wishes to learn about Wicca, I would strongly suggest starting with A Witch Alone by Marian Green, then moving to books such as Gerald Gardner's recently republished classics. No, it won't be as easy as what Ms. Conway has written... but *real* Wicca cannot be condensed into a 400-page how-to manual 
 I just read this book and it didn't tell me anything that I didn't already know.  I am shocked, however, at the so called  reviewer named Janet.  She must either be Wendy herself or a family member.  Who else would get so angry and disgruntled because someone didn't like Wendy?  Not everyone likes everyone else.  How dare "Janet" call another reader "angry and disguntled" or a prankster just because the reader didn't like Wendy or has a poor opinion of the author.  I, myself, have gone to Wendy and have to agree with the person who thinks Wendy's book is autobiographical.  If "Janet" wants to call me angry and disgruntled or a prankster, I don't really care.  I think Janet is angry and disgruntled personally 
 Here is yet another alarmist tome by an author who can't seem to see the truth that is exploding all around him.  I suppose I can be considered a fundamentalist.  I believe that because the scripture compels me to "love my neighbor just as I love myself" that I should actually do everything in my power to do just that.  I know hundreds of other fundamentalists and I am dismayed by these books from journalists or commentators who are clearly secular if not agnostic/atheist in their world view who attempt to analyze the state of fundamentalism. How absurd.  It's alike a rich white kid from Beverly Hills writing books about the pitfalls of being a welfare mother in Compton.    Sam Harris also writes with apocalyptic alarm about the millenarianism of fundamentalist Christians.  He loves to cite studies which show that a large percentage of Christians believe in the imminent return of Jesus Christ.  The scares the pants off of people like Harris and Gorenberg because they immediately conclude that every decision made by such believers is based on their belief in the imminent return of Christ.  This is complete nonsense.  Yes fundamentalist believe that Christ will return and many think it will be in their lifetime (though very many do not believe this) but they still have retirement funds and 30 year mortgages.  They still have babies and plan for their college expenses.  This belief does not change anything about ones day-to-day life because any good Christian knows that one can never discern the day or the hour of His return. Most fundamentalists that I know do not have a unified or comprehensive understanding of Revelations and most of them clearly recognize the oblique and metaphorical nature of the book.  To suggest that people are voting for a President based on anything from the book of Revelations is total fabrication.  If that happens, it is anomalous at best and certainly would not weigh significantly on an election.  Christians vote for many reasons and the irreligionists might be surprised to find that there is a great deal of diversity of opinions in fundamentalists' circles when it comes to politics.  They speak of the religious right as if it is a monolithic body receiving its marching orders from Falwell and Dobson.     What is even stranger to me is that there exists in the world today a belief system with more than a billion adherents and by all accounts hundreds of millions of fundamentalists which plainly does advocate a doctrine which is dangerous and which is bringing death, dismemberment, slavery, inequality, and brutality to wide swaths of planet earth.  These people are commanded by their god to "make war on the unbelievers who live around you." (Sura 9:123) and they are doing that with a horrific fervor.  This doesn't alarm anyone?  Even within a stones throw of these bloodthirsty zealots who are rewarded in heaven for being psychopathic killers, journalists like Gorenberg continue to feel that the more dangerous belief is that Christians in America believe the New Testament (which has none of the incitements to violence which fill the Quran).  Christians aren't exploding buses full of innocent people, or blowing up soldiers' convoys, or cheering wildly on 9/11, or oppressing women, or beheading people and taping it to send to the adoring fans.  These horrible right wingers are not denying girls the right to be educated or committing genocide and slavery in Darfur and they aren't really killing or hurting anyone.  The Christian right wing is in fact sending millions of dollars and thousands of missionaries to the poorest nations on earth to build hospitals, provide clean water, repair schools, and give tons of food and medicine away. They live lives of self-sacrifice to be teachers, nurses, doctors, and pastors to the poorest of the poor.  I am in utter dismay to understand books like this and I wish that such authors would just say from the start: "this is an op ed piece....I am attempting to find justification for my own far left, West-hating views and as a sideline, I've never met a Palestinian I didn't like (with bombs strapped on or without).  In Palestine today, more than 80% of the school children when asked what they want to be when they grow up, say that they want to be suicide bombers.  Yes, but Christians are the real problem! 
 At first glance this is an attractive book, with a high standard of graphic design and a profusion of color illustrations. Working with it unfortunately reveals a number of annoyances. First, the organization is chaotic, with topics showing up in unexpected places. Among many examples, Chapter 1 purports to introduce PSP's features, but includes redundant and superficial sections on choosing a digital camera and computer. Chapter 3 deals with basic picture manipulation, but leaps into a discussion of scripting (which probably deserves a separate chapter). The various levels of chapter subheadings use very similar type, so it's hard to discern the structure of the book. Some topics are covered in the main body of the text, but others are only found in separate "step-by-step projects", which seem to be an attempt at exercises for the reader. Another complaint is the huge number of screen shots that are simply too small to read. And the before and after examples of image adjustments are so small that it is often impossible to see the differences. The book covers a lot of material that is obvious simply by looking at PSP's user interface, yet some important topics get short shrift. For example, the issue of color management. I couldn't find an answer to the common workflow question: "What is the best sequence to apply the many functions provided by PSP?" The authors are obviously qualified to provide some insights here. There is some good material in the book, but with some attention to organization and space priorities, it could have been much better 
 I learned long ago to ignore and laugh at the positive and negative feedback that a reviewer gets.  Obviously my one star review of this movie will get negative feedback but that doesn't make my opinion any less valid.  It is, after all, my honest opinion, and therefore it is worth something to someone, if only to me.  Sometimes I agree with Ebert, and sometimes i completely disagree with him.  I think we all believe in our hearts that "I" am the only one with the correct opinion.  I would subscribe to that myself.  This movie is PAINFULLY slow and boring.  Wim Wenders, next time maybe you will develop a story line, please, huh?  I really hate the premise that the only way an angel's life can be fulfilling is if he becomes human.  That is the moral here and also in the annoying movie City of Angels.  That's absurd.  Assuming that there is life after death, assuming that there are angels, and I in no way discount that possibility because I know how little we truly know, it is absurd to think that the angels have nothing to do but watch over us and wish they were with us.  That is offensively stupid and self centered.  It is like a child's point of view that mommy and daddy have absolutely nothing to do and are bored to tears when they are not watching the baby and coloring in the baby's coloring book.  So this conception of angels is, in my not at all humble opinion, stupid and offensive.  What makes you think that we humans are the center of the universe and the only worthwhile thing that is going on, dingbat?  Stupid premise, and boring story, if you want to call it a story at all.  I can't keep watching it.  It is still on right now, and I'm writing this review to relieve the boredom.  Later - After seeing the end of the movie, I must add that the final monologue committed by the angel's human girlfriend is probably the worst monologue I have ever seen on film.  She goes on and on, saying nothing, in a stupid and self indulgent elongated bit of nonsense that is surreal, meaningless, and stupid.  The only thing that this movie has going for it is that it makes people appreciate simple things about life, like warming your hands together on a cold day.  That's a nice and worthwhile thought, to appreciate the very little and insignificant things about life.  Aside from that bit of wisdom, this movie is poor, boring, full of itself, aimless, and overrated 
 Normally I love Rita Mae Brown's stories.  I can't wait for them to come out! But this one I found to be disappointing.  It had virtually no plot and little interesting interactions with the animals but what felt like an inordinate amount of "lecturing" about various and sundry things.  Frankly, it was dull which is something I never thought I would say about one of Ms. Brown's books. 
 A friend lent me Good In Bed when I'd run out of ideas for books to read. I read it, didn't care much for the characters, and ultimately came out of the story feeling worse about life.   A few months later, I came upon this book, and since Weiner's actual writing style wasn't so bad, I thought I'd check it out. I didn't even finish it.   It seems as if Jennifer Weiner writes to make herself feel better when she's down; exalting overweight, plain-faced girls who have a tendency to whine, writing the petite and attractive with overtones of condescencion and contempt, and failing completely to create a male character with more than one and a half dimensions.   That said, this could have been a good story. Weiner does have some talent as a writer... her prose flows easily and is unpretentious, she speaks realistically even when the characters are hardly likeable, and the general ideas of the plot following the sisters' relationship, the connection with their grandmother, and what they do after their falling-out were all fun and interesting. I did very nearly almost care about these characters.   Still, I couldn't actually bring myself to give a hoot about these whiny, one-dimensional people. It's books like this that make me hate chick-lit so much. If you want to read girly stories, I'd rather you go to Barbara Kingsolver or Amy Tan... at least they have brains to back up their talent 
 I recently read "Healing Richard Nixon", I found it to be factually flawed and written in a dull and redundant manner. The book implied on several occasions that Richard Nixon was unable to make decisions as a result of his overbearing and controlling Cheif-of-Staff,H.R.Haldeman. It should be perfectly clear to anyone who has ever researched Richard Nixon that he (Nixon) was always capeable of making his own decisions. Haldeman was not the driving force of Nixons insecurities, but was only an asset to the preexisting problem. If you are looking for an accurate portrayal of Nixon, you should look elsewhere. But if you are looking for a poorly written fictional novel, this is the book for you 
 I read this book right after Norman Maclean's A River Runs Through It.  Let us look at the substance first. I applaud the author for many things. Among them, for not trying to stretch the amazingly thin plot over any more than 130 pages, which it takes comfortably. Second, for insinuating but not conferring the name of Sherlock Holmes on the old detective. To have flirted with accident but avoided a direct/dangerous hit has, I suspect, left the driver as well as the pedestrians healthy enough. I have hope that they will each continue on their journey with very little scarring and an unimpaired memory of their favorite detective.     As for style, for all those interested, I recommend both of Norman Maclean's books for a lesson on the exact meaning of brevity. True brevity  simply reduces the vehicle which carries the power of the story. Infact, the power becomes all the more starker for it. Poorly executed brevity cuts out power proportional to the removed verbage. Such is the case here. To all authors, taught and aiming brevity, I plead, in reducing the weight of the overcoat, do not lose the wool. Keep it warm and keep it alive.   The vocabulary is solid enough but feels like pepper sprinkled over a spoonful of cold, cold pasta. The words being, individually, pretty much the only admirable things, the novel is the highbrow pulling the lowbrow into its own world rather than walking over to the latter.  
 In this book the author is trying to make a statement about the Harry Potter books and telling her negative view of the book to other people. She taking her own interpretation of the book and presenting it as fact. I give her all my respects, but try reading the books through a child's eyes, with an open mind. I quite enjoyed these books for there magical and whimsical qualities. And I think that no child should be denied the opportunity to read these books, just because their parents read this particular book and already formed a negative view in their head based on the author's interpretation of the book 
 This book is extremly hard to decipher.   I feel the book is patterned after Homer's THE ODYSSEY 
 I really think that this book spends entirely too much time on stories.  The stories were boring and I related to none of them. This book just made me feel more organized than ever and that I was totally wasting my time.   You have to weed through a lot of useless stories about unorganized people to get to any solutions.  Totally wouldn't buy again.  I'm taking it to my local half price book store.  Look for it there 
 The position by the author, TNH, in said book is one not doctrinally substantiated. The entire premise of this book is that is the "teachings of Gotama Buddha", when in fact it is the view/position of modern so-called Buddhism. Hanh's book posits the denial of the Atman as the basis "core of Buddhism", when in fact no such doctrinal citation exists.  The Buddhist term Anatman (Sanskrit), or Anatta (Pali) is an adjective in sutra used to refer to the nature of phenomena as being devoid of the Soul, the ontological and subjective Self (atman) which is the "light (dipam), and only refuge" [DN 2.100]. Of the 662 occurrences of the term Anatta in the Nikayas, its usage is restricted to referring to 22 nouns (forms, feelings, perception, experiences, consciousness, the eye, eye-consciousness, desires, mentation, mental formations, ear, nose, tongue, body, lusts, things unreal, etc.), all phenomenal, as being Selfless (anatta). Contrary to some popular books written outside the scope of Buddhist doctrine, there is no "Doctrine of anatta/anatman" mentioned anywhere in the sutras, rather anatta is used only to refer to impermanent things as other than the Soul, to be anatta.          Specifically in sutra, anatta is used to describe the nature of any and all composite, consubstantial, phenomenal, and temporal things, from the macrocosmic, to microcosmic, be it matter as pertains the physical body or the cosmos at large, including any and all mental machinations which are of the nature of arising and passing. Anatta in sutra is synonymous and interchangeable with the terms dukkha (suffering) and anicca (impermanent), and all three terms are often used in triplet in making a blanket statement as regards any and all phenomena. "All these aggregates are anicca, dukkha, and anatta."          Anatta refers only to the absence of the permanent soul as pertains any one of the psycho-physical (namo-rupa) attributes, or Khandhas (skandhas, aggregates). Anatta/Anatman in the earliest Buddhist texts, the Nikayas, is an adjective, (A is anatta, B is anatta, C is anatta). The commonly held belief to wit that: "Anatta means no-soul, therefore Buddhism taught that there was no soul" is a concept, which cannot be found or doctrinally substantiated by means of the Nikayas, the sutras, of Buddhism.          The Pali term and noun for "no soul" is natthatta (literally "there is not/no[nattha]+atta'[Soul]), not the term anatta, and is mentioned at Samyutta Nikaya 4.400, where when Gotama was asked if there "was no soul (natthatta)", equated this question to be equivalent to Nihilism (ucchedavada). Common throughout Buddhist sutra is the denial of psycho-physical attributes of the mere empirical self to be the Soul, or confused with same. The Buddhist paradigm as regards phenomena is "Na me so atta" (this/these are not my soul), nearly so the most common utterance of Gotama Buddha in the Nikayas, where "na me so atta" = Anatta/Anatman. In sutra, to hold the view that there is "no-Soul" (natthatta) is = to ucchedavada (SN 4.400) [Annihilationism] = natthika (nihilist).         Logically so, according to the philosophical premise of Gotama, the initiate to Buddhism who is to be "shown the way to Immortality (amata)" [MN 2.265, SN 5.9], wherein liberation of the mind (cittavimutta) is effectuated thru the expansion of wisdom and the meditative practices of sati and samadhi, must first be educated away from his former ignorance-based (avijja) materialistic proclivities in that he "saw any of these forms, feelings, or this body, to be my Self, to be that which I am by nature". Teaching the subject of anatta in sutra pertains solely to things phenomenal, which were: "subject to perpetual change; therefore unfit to declare of such things `these are mine, these are what I am, that these are my Soul'" [MN 1.232]         The one scriptural passage where Gotama is asked by a layperson what the meaning of anatta is as follows: [Samyutta Nikaya 3.196] At one time in Savatthi, the venerable Radha seated himself and asked of the Blessed Lord Buddha: "Anatta, anatta I hear said venerable. What pray tell does Anatta mean?" "Just this Radha, form is not the Soul (anatta), sensations are not the Soul (anatta), perceptions are not the Soul (anatta), assemblages are not the Soul (anatta), consciousness is not the Soul (anatta). Seeing thusly, this is the end of birth, the Brahman life has been fulfilled, what must be done has been done."         The anatta taught in the Nikayas has merely relative value; it is not an absolute one. It does not say simply that the Soul (atta, Atman) has no reality at all, but that certain things (5 aggregates), with which  the unlearned man identifies himself, are not the Soul (anatta) and that is why one should grow disgusted with them, become detached from them and be liberated. Since this kind of anatta does not negate the Soul as such, but denies Selfhood to those things that constitute the non-self (anatta), showing them thereby to be empty of any ultimate value and to be repudiated, instead of nullifying the Atman (Soul) doctrine, it in fact compliments it.         What has Buddhism to say of the Self? "That's not my Self" (na me so atta); this, and the term "non Self-ishness" (anatta) predicated of the world and all "things" (sabbe dhamma anatta; Identical with the Brahmanical "of those who are mortal, there is no Self/Soul", (anatma hi martyah, [SB., II. 2. 2. 3]). [KN J-1441] "The Soul is the refuge that I have gone unto". For anatta is not said of the Self/Soul but what it is not. There is never a `doctrine of no-Soul', but a doctrine of what the Soul is not (form is anatta, feelings are anatta, etc.).         It is of course true that the Buddha denied the existence of the mere empirical "self" in the very meaning of "my-self" (this person so-and-so, namo-rupa, an-atta), one might say in accordance with the command `denegat seipsum, [Mark VII.34]; but this is not what modern writers mean to say, or are understood by their readers to say; what they mean to say is that the Buddha denied the immortal(amata), the unborn (ajata) and Supreme-Self (mahatta') of the Upanishads. And that is palpably false, for he frequently speaks of this Self, or Spirit (mahapurisha), and nowhere more clearly than in the too often repeated formula 'na me so atta', "This/these are not my Soul" (na me so atta'= anatta/anatman), excluding body (rupa) and the components of empirical consciousness (vinnana/ nama), a statement to which the words of Sankhara are peculiarly apposite, "Whenever we deny something unreal, is it in reference to something real"[Br. Sutra III.2.22]. It was not for the Buddha but for the nihilist (natthika)to deny the Soul.         Outside of going into the doctrines of later schisms of Buddhism, Sarvastivada, Theravada, Vajrayana, Madhyamika, and lastly Zen, the oldest existing texts (Nikayas) of Buddhism which predate all these later schools of Buddhism, anatta is never used pejoratively in any sense in the Nikayas by Gotama the Buddha, who himself has said: [MN 1.140] "Both formerly and now, I've never been a nihilist (vinayika), never been one who teaches the annihilation of a being, rather taught only the source of suffering, and its ending" Further investigation into Negative theology is the source which should be referenced in further understanding the methodology which the term anatta illuminates.         Due to secular propagation, a general acceptance of the concept of "A Doctrine of Anatta" exists as status quo, however there exists no substantiation in sutra for Buddhism's denial of soul, or in using the term anatta in anything but a positive sense in denying Self-Nature, the Soul, to any one of a conglomeration of corporeal and empirical phenomena which were by their very transitory nature, "impermanent (anicca), suffering (dukkha), and Selfless (anatta)". The only noun in sutra which is referred to as "permanent (nicca)" is the Soul, such as Samyutta Nikaya 1.169.         In fact the phrase "Doctrine of anatta", or "Anatmavada" is a concept utterly foreign to Buddhist Sutra, existing in only non-doctrinal Theravada and Madhyamika commentaries. As the saying goes, a "lie repeated often enough over time becomes the truth". Those interested parties to Buddhism incapable of pouring through endless piles of Buddhist doctrine have defacto accepted the notion of a "Doctrine of  anatta" as key to Buddhism itself, when in fact there exists not one citation of this concept in either the Digha, Majjhima, Samyutta, Anguttara, or Khuddaka Nikayas. Unless evoking a fallacy, we must stick  strictly to sutra as reference, wherein the usage of anatta never falls outside of the parameter of merely denying Self or Soul to the profane and transitory phenomena of temporal and samsaric life which is "subject to arising and passing", and which is most certain not (AN) our Soul (ATTA). Certainly the most simple philosophical logic would lead anyone to conclude that no part of this frail body is "my Self, is That which I am", is "not my Soul", of which Gotama the Buddha was wholeheartedly in agreement that no part of it was the Soul, i.e. was in fact anatta.         The perfect contextual usage of anatta is: "Whatever form, feelings, perceptions, experiences, or consciousness there is (the five aggregates), these he sees to be without permanence, as suffering, as ill, as a plague, a boil, a sting, a pain, an affliction, as foreign, as otherness, as empty (suññato), as Selfless (anattato). So he turns his mind away from these and gathers his mind/will within the realm of Immortality (amataya dhatuya). This is tranquility; this is that which is most excellent!" [MN 1.436]         The term anatman is found not only in Buddhist sutras, but also in the Upanishads and lavishly so in the writings of Samkara, the founder of Advaita Vedanta. Anatman is a common via negativa (neti neti, not this, not that) teaching method common to Vedanta, Neoplatonism, early Christian mystics, and others, wherein nothing affirmative can be said of what is "beyond speculation, beyond words, and concepts" thereby eliminating all positive characteristics that might be thought to apply to the Soul, or be attributed to it; to wit that the Subjective ontological Self-Nature (svabhava) can never be known objectively, but only thru "the denial of all things which it (the Soul) is not"- Meister Eckhart. This doctrine is also called by the Greeks Apophasis.  
 The first thing to be said about Communities of Violence: Persecution of Minorities in the Middle Ages is that  the contents do not live up to the title. Perhaps this is an editor's decision rather than the author's, but the fact is that this is NOT anything like a comprehensive history of the subject. A better title might be A Study of a Few Incidents Involving Christians, Muslims, and Jews in Aragon and Catalonia in the First Half of the 14th Century. The buyer of this book will be disappointed on that score if he was expecting something more encompassing. Another disappointing aspect of this book is the author's disconcerting use of trendy post-modern jargon: it is full of talk of "discourses","narratives","structures", turning one's "gaze", "paradigms", and other terms which seem designed more to obtain tenure for the author than to convey real information and to constitute a satisfying work of history. The book does contain many interesting tales arising from the author's research into Catalonian and Aragonese archives, research which seems to be highly original on his part. Thus, we have vignettes of Christians, Jews, and Muslims gambling together and suing each other, incidents of interfaith sex and prostitutiuon, and intercommunal violence. (I was fascinated to learn that of Muslims applying for medical licenses in 14th century Valencia, most of them were women.) The governments of the time seem to have been largely ineffectual (a point the author does not explicitly make) with citizens resorting to assault, arson, and rioting often and refusing to obey the king or his officers, and petty nobles taking the law into their own hands. This book is not without its longeurs, but is in places very interesting; the reader who seeks a comprehensive account of the treatment of Jews and Muslims in Spain, much less in the rest of Europe, will simply have to go elsewhere. One hopes that at least the author made full professor 
 I was very excited to start feeding my son solids.  I bought this book and Super Baby Food.  This book is NO comparison to the Super Baby Food book.  This book would be a great 3rd or 4th addition to your baby food cookbooks but not a very good starter book.  It doesn't explain anything in detail.  Compared to the Super Baby Food Book this book is awful.  If you want detail and direction for feeding your baby, this is not the book to buy 
 If you were raised on Getz, "Bird", Ellington, Hampton and all the other greats, don't plan on enjoying this CD.  While the vocals are OK, none of the tracks are memorable.  I've given it several listens today, but fear that this one is destined to go to the bottom of the stack...........maybe I should have waited until tomorrow, and bought the Sunday Times, but I don't think that would get me in the mood for these Jazz Moods 
 Even though this film ends with a decent fight scene, most of it is drawn out and pointless.  Sure Trunks and Goten can be amusing, but this is too much.  Not only that, Broly comes across as a real dufuss in this one - the endless repetition of his grunted one line gets really annoying and in itself merits the whooping that he gets in the end.  Broly was a ruthless villian bent on destruction in his first appearance, but he just kind 'floats around' in this one not really doing much of anything.  I'd like to say that there is hope, but Bio Broly is even worse... 
 I couldn't read the whole thing in order to know for sure. It was dry. I didn't get the imagery - I know it's supposed to be a classic, and I really wanted to read the book, I did - but it was long and boring and I just don't get why it's so "classicly popular". Sorry, but it's how I feel. Now, that being said, I read a condensed version of it, and I discovered the story was a little bit interesting - but that's as far as I can go, even with the condensed version - it was only "a little bit" interesting 
 Two stars for what its worth. I'm dissatisfied with the way this book is written. Its not straight to the point and lacks substance. Although some chapters proved to be informative like (i.e. chapter one: foundations) they could still be found from other resources like the internet (and its free!!). (translation: i regret having spent my money on this book).  The book was a dissapointment i thought id be reading the thoughts of a real seasoned expert, i was wrong.  Now Veen will be in my "ignore the books of this writer" list 
 to start I am a very big fan of Doris Day for yeays. I had just bought the 6 DVD box set of her movies & loved that so I decided to buy this TV series. It is so awful words can't describe it. It's not because it's "dated" because I Love Lucy is alot older & sheer perfection. It's initially nice to see Doris in another genre but this first series just doesn't work for me for many reasons. The subject matters chosen are thoughtful(that's the reason I gave it TWO stars & the presence of Doris)..I'll tell you the show just bored me & I found myself fast forworded through  the last 10 episodes.the DVD extra interviews with two members of the cast are interesting. There's NO new interviews with Doris(that's an old interview they put on there).I think the only thing new is that 8x10 shot with her dog 
 Flimsy, throwaway and ultimately utterly forgetable. This "song" just reeks of novelty. It's like the bastard love child of MC Hammer and Milli Vanilli, and actually no better than either of them. If I am to believe all the hype surrounding this group they are the hottest thing going. It quite frankly makes me glad I'm not a teenager anymore. 
 This movie was only slightly better than your basic horror cliche; the nuclear testing/mutant premise seemed promising, but all the main characters were stupid/annoying.  Seemingly to make up for the lack of interesting characters, the script-writers/director threw in lots of unnecessary gore.  For the most part, though, the special effects were at least well-done; however, a few of the effects were somewhat misguided.  For instance, blood on bodies that have been sitting out for awhile in the hot desert is red; wouldn't it dry to brown very shortly in that kind of heat??  Acting was mediocre.  I've never seen the original, so I cannot say whether this is better or worse.  The movie is not for the faint-of-heart simply because of the gore, but it definitely wasn't very scary.  Two stars 
 This was my first encounter with this author, and sadly, will very likely be my last.  I could not stay with the plot, nor could the author.  It was hard to decide whether this was to be a comedy (although the humor often escaped me), historical (lots of "facts" regarding the Mennonite and Amish way of life) or a genuine mystery.  I agree with previous posters...the "vailed" innuendos with regard to her pet kitten just don't come across the way I believe they have been intended.  Fortunately, there are some very good mystery writers available to keep me reading for years to come.  I really don't like to be so critical, but I was really turned off by this book 
 This is the worst popular science book I've read. I will defer to the above reviews, by those trained in science, for specific examples of misinformation in this book, but despite that I am only trained as a diesel mechanic, I began finding statements which made me utter, "Say, whaa'?" and "I don't think so," throughout the book. By the time I reached the part where objects have "swelled" and "puffed out" as they near the speed of light, I knew I was reading buncombe, as I had been taught in high school that they instead become shorter.  The section which concerns the development of the atomic bomb is likewise botched. That it covers this topic and completely ignores Leo Szilard, the man who not only conceived of the atomic bomb but held patents on both the bomb and the nuclear reactor, shows just how worthless this book is. It is ironic that credit for America's starting work on a nuclear program is given to Einstein here, because, contrary to the book, Einstein did not write the letters that were delivered to Roosevelt. He only signed letters that Szilard had written and Szilard handed them to Alexander Sachs to be delivered to Roosevelt. Indeed, Einstein had no inkling that an atomic bomb was possible. Once Szilard explained the concept of a fission bomb to him, Einstein admitted, "Huh! That never occurred to me."  The book's account of German's progress toward a bomb is likewise distorted. On 6 August, 1945, the team of German atomic scientists, who where interned in England, were placed in a room with hidden microphones and given the news that the USA had destroyed Hiroshima with an atomic bomb. At first they were unanimous in their disbelief, but after hearing further radio reports of it, they assumed that the USA had somehow dropped an entire nuclear reactor on the city.    This, and a far more accurate account of the German nuclear program can be found in the book "Alsos" by Samuel Goudsmit (pronounced "Howd-shmid"; a fine book profiling the people who worked on the Manhattan Project is "The Uranium People" by Leona Libby; and the best overall account of the development of nuclear weapons is the magnificent "Day One" by Peter Wyden.  "E=mc2" is not only infested with misinformation, but it is hideously written. Tortured sentences, errant punctuation, dangling modifiers, and one handsome redundancy. Near the beginning of the book, Bodanis, in describing the development of the period (.) describes it as "a round circle." A round circle! You know, as opposed to some other type of circle, such as a triangular circle or a square one?   If, as he claims, David Bodanis really taught at Oxford, then all I can say is, poor ol' Oxford ain't what it usta be. 
 I generally steer clear of low-budget horror in that those films, while trying to be cutting edge, usually smack of just "trying"...too hard.  I gave "The Hamiltons" a go since it received the most hype.  Wasn't impressed.  Yes, the ending has a nice little twist, and I was intrigued by seeing Lenny--although once the twist happened it was easy to see it coming--the film lacks dramatic tension, contains mundane dialogue (victim: "help me"; predator [whining]: "I can't!), and characters are pretty much stock caricatures. 86 minutes drrrraggged by.  
 The aquamarine earrings do not look at all like aquamarine, which is supposed to be light blue. They had no color, so I ended up returning them 
 I could see how lame this book was going to be after the initial couple of chapters. I could also predict the ending with more precision than any other Patterson novel I've read. Not that there weren't some nice twists and turns in the middle, but the book was just plain nauseating. I lost track of how many times Suzanne mentioned how happy and perfect everything was in her life.   This certainly isn't your normal Patterson novel, so proceed with caution. 
 I have not had the chance to read this book.  Everytime I turn a page, it comes apart. Very poor quality Glue has been used in this book. 
 I actually read this entire book just to see if/how Beatrice would get what was coming to her. Yes, the book is about incest. The ads and cover I've seen for this book state something like "Murder, Incest, Betrayal" or something like that so it should come as no shock that it is about incest. The thing I didn't like was that about 2/3 of the book seemed to be about nothing but sex. Sex scene after sex scene. I frankly belive it's better to leave it to the imagination. We all know what happens when you have sex. But really it seemed more wrong that Beatrice and her brother acted like a couple in love. It wasn't just the incest that was gross. Gregory's descriptions of other physical things left me queasy at times. After everything, I think what Beatrice did to her husband had to be one of the vilest acts I've ever read. This book was at the most okay and I do not recommend it 
 Never got hooked on this book. Continued to read and finished the book because she is Courtney Love's grandmother and wanted some insight in that regard. I thought it was boring and all over the place. Best memoir I ever read is "The Glass Castle." 
 The title of the book was a bit misleading. The Playboy Mansion was only mentioned in about 10% of the book, and it was not the part of the book where everyone was having most of the wild parties. It was the part where she sought refuge from the crummy life she was living with her father, who was Hugh Hefner's doctor.  Her father was a mess.   The rest of the book was repetitious- how many times can you tell about parties which all sound the same-- sex, drugs, more sex, etc.  Actually, since she was so young, the whole book was pathetic and pitiful.  What a life for a teenager.  This book is very sad. 
 First off let me start off by saying that I am a very big fan of Edwin McCain, his band, and his music.  I bought this DVD thinking that there would be a good bit of live footage with him playing, but was only left with my pocket's empty, and my hopes shattered.  Edwin McCains personality is portrayed here, as all other reviewers have said, but that really is all that this DVD does well.  With only about 15 minutes of Live music I, as a viewer was left asking myself why Edwin and ATC Records decided to put this disc out.  The only notable music on this DVD is "I'll Be".  This is very easily Edwin's lowest quality item put out, lacking the passion, and originiality that so many of us know him by.  A noteworthy Story, if not the only one is the story of how he wrote I'll Be, and the only reason that it is noteworthy, is not because it is a great story, but rather I'll Be is a great track.  So if you have money to spare, and time to waste then you can buy this DVD, but unless Edwin releases a new DVD I suggest, that you stick to his CD's 
 I got this magazine for a year and a half before I had to quit my subscription recently. I liked all the fashion tips and articles on how to dress for your body size and style, and that is why I subscribed to begin with. But I was not expecting the bombardment of amoral opinions forced on me. (not to mention an overload of advertising- which you will get in most fashion magazines anyway, so that's not a complaint). Sure there was a few lines here and there that were nonbiased (telling the facts of STDs and such), but 90% of the articles on sex, were opinion and not fact. Girls today are having sex with anyone and getting hurt emotionally and physically because of magazines like Seventeen who say that sex is good if you're ready (What 15 year old girl is ready to have sex and get an STD or a baby?? Please.), and that condoms are 100% effective. They are not, but that's what most teen girls believe because of stupid magazines like this. They need to take advice from their parents and doctors, not magazine articles. I was disgusted at the opinions presented as truth to basically promote teen girls doing whatever they want without consequences. 
 This book really sucked! Save your money!  The I have tried to contact Mr. Herman about some of the problems I have encountered with the contact addresses he provided.  He has yet to respond, meanwhile, I have wasted valuable postage for addresses that are incorrect or not in existance.  One other note, many of the persons contacted were not accepting new talent, and hadn't been for quite sometime 
 I read a lot of thrillers, and this debut by Casey Moreton disappointed me.  As a previous reviewer pointed out, there is very little in this plot that is original or suspenseful.  It is instead consists of elements recycled from a lot of previous thrillers -- a corrupt President, a reformed hit-man, a father looking for his lost daughter, etc.    The most problematic aspect of this book is the lack of a central character.  The author keeps jumping around from person to person, changing narrative perspectives.  I therefore had no idea who the "hero" of this novel was supposed to be.  To me, it's hard to write a good suspense novel unless you have a sympathetic central character, and there really isn't one in this novel.  If you like suspense novels, I recommend reading Harlan Coben or CJ Box instead.     
 Too much dialogue! Every single song on this album has little snippets from the movie. I bought this album mostly for the main theme that runs right when Ocean gets out of jail and when the title rolls. It is nowhere to be found on this cd. Dont waste your money 
 This is my first time in this forum  I've seen the film of the 2nd disc and I found the copy...NOT ONLY BAD BUT UNNOTICEABLE  AS A MIRACLE the last three fellows have seen the copy in good conditions. It is possible that FOX HOME VIDEO have changed and made new copies of the 2nd disc. If this is not true it is possible that they have discovered a fantastic ophtalmologist.   I choose the first option.   Are you so kind  -via Fox- to inform us how to change the bad copies in order to have all the collection in good conditions ?  Yours  R 
 Johnny Tremain is the absolute worst book I have ever read in my entire life, hands down. No book has filled me with such a sense of dread as I opened it like Johnny Tremain has. The way this book is written is as follows; *30 Pages of Filler *One page of plot For the entire book. That's really it. This haphazardly thown together clump of ink and pulped wood is like a swirling vortex of bad writing and mediocrity. I would not wish this book on anybody. not even my worst foes. I promise you if Amazon had a way to input stars lower then one, that vote would be mine for this book. Teachers; Don't let this be used in class. Everybody else; Spare yourself the misery and torment you would otherwise bring upon yourself by so much as reading the first paragraph 
 My daughter received this for her 5th birthday.  She has some ballet experience so we thought she would pick up on this rather quickly.  Only one portion of the DVD is really instructional-And that part is FAST FAST FAST!  Did I say Fast?!  Thank goodness for the rewind feature on the DVD--             This music is redundant--but that's ok--my daughter loves it.  She so wants to follow & do the dancing but there is little to no actual step-by-step instruction.  It's basically several cute bubbly girls dancing away on a plastic numbered mat.    On the upside--she still loves her microphone headset & singing along.  This product could easily be improved by adding chapters with varying difficulty level so as to allow younger children to catch on.  The label DOES say 5 years & up 
 I thought I was buying a "family organizer"  (i.e, a family calendar).  This book just had a bunch of useless generic lists with a nice cover and fancy tabs 
 I wish I could give this Zero stars.  It is a very dark book and I can't imagine why anyone would write, publish, gift it, or read it.  There is so much good literature written why do we lower ourselves to this junk?  Garbage in garbage out!  
 It took me almost a year of off-and-on reading to finish this book. In most stories, there is at least one character that you can identify with - even if it isn't the author's intended goal. In this book, they are all pathetic losers on a fast track to Nowhere Land. To call this a monumental work is laughable. The story moves like sludge until the very end, then becomes simply forgettable. If you enjoy being abused with other people's dysfunctions, go for it. Otherwise, don't bother 
 I started this book because I love the quote about writing being but a different word for conversation.  Yes, there are moments of great wit.  However, they are lost within a mass of verbiage so dense that it makes your mortgage agreement look like a Little Golden Book.  It's not the sublime non-linearity of Joyce's writing or Ornette Coleman's playing.  It's the amplification of the self to an unbearable degree.  Certainly a unique achievement, I guess.  But so is Lou Reed's "Metal Machine Music.&quot 
 I am amazed at how many good reviews this book received.  I speak not of the translation, since I have discovered that Amazon, rather illiterately, lumps all translations together.  I will simply talk about The Metamorphoses.  While reading Ovid is sometimes enjoyable and easy, like ars amatoria, this book is both tiresome and inane.  If you intend to teach mythology, there are many other texts, including something new called An Anthology of Classical Myth by Trzaskoma, Smith and Brunet, that provide the Greek religion from the Greeks themselves.  There are also new books, like Antinomy: a union of mind by Whyte, that make good and novel use of classic motif in order to provide the reader with some form of intellectual stimulation.  This almost meaningless amalgamation of different stories was put together in order to win back favor for Ovid from the emperor Augustus.  It was a failure then as it is now.  The theme is childish with bits of gore and mayhem and murder placed inside so as to titillate.  The ending is supposed to be that of Augustus establishing an eternal empire and this too is made ridiculous.  I suppose these stories could be told to children who have an interest in literature, but who do not like the kind, soft and saccharine tales they are ordinarily given, but on the whole the metamorphoses of The Metamorphoses are maddeningly repetitive; it is like someone is smacking you in the eye with a plastic spoon.  Remember this: a work of ancient literature is not great literature simply because it is ancient.  Some of it is inane rubbish 
 I agree with one reviewer, in the fact that this book is just WAY too full of useless information.  80% of this book is filler.  I couldn't even weed through all of the needless information in order for this book to make an impact on me.  I was reading, and kept drifting off, because I simply didn't care about most of what he was saying.  I wanted to become a 'Great Communicator'.  Instead, I found my patience was being tested!  I don't recommend this book for anyone who doesn't want to know every little nit picking detail about certain things like the origins of language, and certain common sense things, which he explains in FULL detail.    No need for this book 
 It is unfortunate this book didn't come out better. Some glaring problems with it include: - has no concept of energy physics to begin with - does not understand "hydrogen economy" (hydrogen's an expensive storage, not a source of energy) - downplays geological data of oil discovery (or doesn't understand it), although Hubbert is covered briefly - believes or disseminates half-baked unproven ideas from the research sector: scientifically not valid energy sources are brought forward as alternative fuels - does not deal with the net energy concept (EROEI) or even refer to it  With these fundamental oversights it's really difficult to recommend the book.  It's not completely without merit as it does tell some of the basics right, but mostly it's pathologically impartial journalistic fluff, without looking at the hard facts as a good researcher should.   It's too much about how we are miraculously going to replace oil, gas and coal with tar sands, nuclear power, hydrogen and live happily ever after.  To those readers who want to believe this, this might be a good book. People looking for valid and scientifically solid reasoning on the subject will be sorely disappointed.  I'd recommend books by Deffeyes, Simmons, Heinberg, Campbell and many others before this (all on peak oil) 
 More predictable than an old TV Land episode of Bonanza and much less entertaining, this story of an anti-government rancher and his three sons, one the upstanding sort who seeks to work for good within the system, one an idealist, and the middle son, Tristan, played by Brad Pitt, a tormented man who seeks to find peace within nature's anger. At least that's what I think he was doing. The fact is I never was a fan of this movie, not back in the 1990's when my best friend loved it (and predicted Julia Ormond would be a superstar--sorry, Gina, if you ever read this, I just couldn't resist working that in there, ha-ha) and not upon the occasion of a recent second viewing. I don't think there's anything to really recommend this movie to anyone. It's not spectacular in its setting, it's not revolutionary in its by-the-numbers story, and I found then and still find now that it is highly melodramatic and boring. To each his own, I know some love this movie, but from where I sit, this film is a would-be epic that never rises above fluff 
 Reviewer Tad Griffin (above) presents an interesting dialogue between himself and a generic Evangelical, concluding that since they both believe in a literal, physical return of Christ to earth, they therefore should embrace each other as Christian brothers. "We understand the same Jesus differently" is the way he concludes it. The interesting thing is that a devout Muslim who's well educated in Christianity might make exactly the same argument (I should know, I'm a missionary in a Muslim country, and I've heard it before). It's not sufficient to point out a single area of agreement and conclude that all other differences are therefore irrelevant.  The fact is, yes, there are elements at which Mormons, Catholics, Muslims, and Evangelicals agree to greater or lesser extents (we all believe in angels, judgment day, heaven & hell, etc.). But it is where we disagree that defines the boundaries of our beliefs and affects the way we interrelate.  As a hospital chaplain years ago I met a Mormon who was visiting with a patient of mine. She claimed that we believed exactly the same thing - a lie I quickly, and graciously, refuted. The problem with her, and Tad, and Millet is that they focus our attention on the areas where we agree and gloss over the topics where we don't. "As man now is, god once was; as god now is, man may yet become." (B. Young) is NOT Christianity. The Mormon god's begetting Christ by assuming a male body and having sex with the Virgin Mary is NOT Christianity. Posthumous conversion into the Mormon religion is NOT Christianity. These are not trivial disagreements, and to write a book as Millet has done is a PR job, nothing more 
  On the release of "Ashanti", the artist became a major name with the release of the popular single "Foolish". Many believed Ashanti was the new major name of R&B, a more modern (and less capable) Mary J. Blige. It is because of this hype about the singer that the album is such a dissapointment. Each song on the album has a similar sound and sounds very like it was produced by Irv Gotti and the rest of Murder Inc. The constant interruptions of Irv Gotti and other Murder Inc members doesn't complement Ashanti's voice and the album would have sounded much better if it only contained her voice.    1. "Intro"- Unnecessary filler that contains samples of past songs Ashanti has featured in. Poor opening to the album.  2. "Foolish"- The best song on the album and a clear choice for the first single. Good production and good vocals by Ashanti.  3. "Happy"- A little immature but still a solid effort by Ashanti. The use of Ja Rule was unnecessary at the start of the song. Catchy chorus.  4. "Leaving (Always On Time Part 2)"- Unnecessary sequel to "Always On Time". Sounds very similar to the original only the original was much better.  5. "Narative Call (Interlude)"- Terrible interlude that was put on to fill the album.  6. "Call"- Nice beat and good enough lyrics. Does grow tiresome after a while.  7. "Scared"- Sounds very like it was produced by Irv Gotti and contains unnecessary bad language. Would have been better without Irv Gotti in it. It is still a decent track and Ashanti's voice complements it.  8. "Rescue"- A very good production and a generally good song although the music goes on for far too long at the end. Ashanti's vocals are quite similar to the tracks before.  9. "Baby"- I don't know why she released this track. It's so corny and the lyrics are awful. The production isn't great either.  10. "VooDoo"- Annoying interlude at the start and the track that follows is quite bland. The chorus isn't any way special and Ashanti's vocals become annoying at this point.  11. "Movies"- A very R&B song that works well although it isn't well made. Bad lyrics but what can you expect with such an immature R&B release.  12. "Fight (Over Skit)"- Awful use of time on a record. It is just an excuse to use as much bad language as possible in a minute. There shouldn't be a need for spoken interludes on a good record.  13. "Over"- Slightly bland. Ashanti's voice doesn't really suit the song that well.  14. "Unfoolish"- Very similar to "Foolish". Still it is a nice track to add to the album as it adds something unusual, Biggie's verse.   15. "Shi Shi (Skit)"- We don't want to hear Ashanti's sister saying nothing for a few seconds. Awful.  16. "Dreams"- A nice idea but turns out to be very cheesy.   17. "Thank You"- Ashanti doesn't manage her vocals well on this track and it is too short. Should have been left off.   Overall there is far too much filler on the album to make it decent. Ashanti would have been much better if she had been signed to another record label and taken her time with her first record instead of releasing this rushed job. The most interesting thing on the album is the images which is always a bad sign. She does show potential as a singer and could release something of significance in the future. Until then I would reccomend people to avoid this rushed job and anything she has released since (and possibly download some of the singles). There are much better comtemporary R&B singers out there.   MARK- 3/1 
     DVD had sticky substance around center of disc which was unnoticed when loading into machine. It required taking machine apart to remove 
 Bruce Cole has a well-deserved reputation for high quality scholarship and exposition. This book is an excellent synthesis of current knowledge about the role of the artist in society, his materials, and the types of work he might create.  Sadly, the illustrations accompanying the text are worse than any I've ever seen. They're of unbelievably low quality. If you took a low-quality scanner from the mid-90's, kept it on the 'text' setting instead of 'graphics', you would still get better images than the mess that's in this text. It's more like a fourth-generation mimeograph.   They are basically unusable. And that is unacceptable in an art history text. There is no grayscale - just large blurred black blobs. It's as if a creeping fungus made a home in the book, and refused to be dislodged. The fact that this book is in print as such is an insult. With even pedestrian-quality greyscale images, this would be a fantastic text 
 If your brick walls are the immigrant generation, do yourself a favor and get a book specializing in that country's research rather than this one.  Despite the 2005 copyright, the majority of the advice would have still held true a decade ago.  And the emphasis on early American record issues is a real minus for those with later arriving ancestors.  Despite the introduction's suggestion, the problem-solving techniques alone weren't worth the lack of examples in my problem areas.  However, if you've been working on your genealogy for decades, need a refresher, and are working on your DAR application... you might love this book 
 This movie does not adress art in any way, shape, or form.  Do not be fooled 
 This book is incredibly confusing.  It takes a subject that can be written about very directly and clear, one in fact that's not all that complex (programming a simple Pic micro).  Unfortunately this book was written as though by a complete beginner.  The book severely lacks an understanding of the hardware and the connection of the microcrontroller to electronics theory couldn't be more vague.  The programmer with this board called 'el cheapo' makes a racist epithet in its name.  Furthermore, the PCB for this programmer is so poorly designed and fabricated you might as well build a different programmer from scratch or based on an open-source design.  This thing was a nightmare to use and build.  This is a beginner's book -- and when you're learning you need a good teacher and you need some foundations.  This book serves the purpose of neither 
 I was disappointed by "Beautiful Evidence". It seems to me to be a medium primarily for the reproduction of many gorgeous drawings, graphs, and tables done by others and the author, and an opportunity to make a rant on PowerPoint. Yes, many bad figures have been created and Dr. Tufte has made valid points and good suggestions, but they are not as densely presented as one would expect from his own words.  One of Dr. Tufte's main theses is a good figure has high information density, yet his text descriptions do not measure up to this standard. They are regularly repetitive or shallow. He even misses an opportunity to take his own advice when he presents the cancer rate data on p. 174 and then re-presents it as a new table on p. 176 in a better format. If he had used the concept he presented through the Bumps chart on p. 56, allowing lines for the cancer types to cross according to the values of the rates so each column is correctly ordered, relationships would have been even clearer.  Although tables can be dense with information, it is the very density that makes them difficult to interpret and understand. A beautiful, but very complex, figure created from all of complex table is not necessarily better at communication even if it is interesting or pleasing to look at. This is why so often figures are made from subsets of tables. The challenge to the presenter is to find what is important in the data and clearly present it.  I often felt attempts were made to find something auspicious to say about a well executed figure when nothing more than the "beauty is apparent" is needed.  Although I don't malign PowerPoint as Dr. Tufte does, I am not enamored of it either. However, faulting the program as he does seems to me akin to faulting a hammer for the bent over nails driven into wood. A better hammer might drive nails more easily, but it is the person wielding the hammer who has the primary controlling effect. Handing out a copy of "The Table of Casualties" to an audience would certainly put more information into their hands, but it will get little into their minds. It is up to the presenter to find a means of communicating the meaningful information to those who couldn't be bothered to study such data. Whether PowerPoint slides or Word reports are used, the presenter must consider the audience and how to get important details into their heads.   Spend time enjoying the figures and know good data presentation is hard 
 "Laconic" may be a favorable description of a Western hero, but it should not apply to the book which tells that hero's story.  This is a poor effort by an otherwise talented writer.  The big gunfight is a poor rip-off of the OK Corral tale, the characters are not well developed, and the book ends with a thud.  The only good thing about the short chapters and wide spacing is that the reader has wasted less time with this hollow core of what should have been a good story.  Read "Ride the Dark Trail" to see what a Western should be 
 A Moose from California compared Audra's "Bill" with one done by Jane Monheit. I took his advise and listened to both. Audra sounds like a church choir singer making an attempt at jazz. The Moose from California has a tin ear when it comes to quality and soul.This is a sad recording as far as jazz goes. It should be in the cabaret bin. Absolutely!! 
 this crock pot has 3 settings: warm, scalding and blast furnace. warm cooks nothing, scalding evaporates liquids and drys food in less than 2 hrs, and blast furnace should be used in place of kiln. The worst feature / drawback of this not-so-fine unit is the hot water spitting that occurs after 2 or so hours that leaves your countertops wet and messy. I returned this and bought a Rival. Far better - no comparison 
 Over all, not a terrible CD, if you can get past the screams. (Not good enough to release two versions of the same CD, however, even if it did have different artwork and DVDs inside.) Personally, the screaming "thing" doesn't add to the songs because it's such an OVERUSED device in several types of music nowadays, so it makes me want to skip ahead and see what's next rather than listen to the song finish. Guys in H.H., if you ever read any of these reviews, look for a different gimmick than "Emo-Screamo". If you want to wear your hearts on your sleeves, that's fine, but when you blend in with everyone else, your music will get lost in the shuffle. That's not a good thing, right?  As far as the screaming "thing" goes, a guy sounding like his [...] are being squeezed in a bench vise WHILE an unlubricated watermelon is being slowly inserted in his [...] is NOT singing, I don't care who is doing it.. 
 A bit disappointing...  I guess I expected more, because I was told when I purchased this book that it was the best of the IN THE GARDEN trilogy. And that stands to reason when you expect the last to be the best.  After all, isn't that when it's supposed to all come together? Not to mention that I did enjoy Black Rose-5-star and thought Blue Dahlia 3-star was an average read.  Several of the novels with the NR seal have been about the supernatural and I have enjoyed most of those books.  Plus, when you see the NR seal, it's almost a given to be a good read. And you'll note I emphasized "almost", because, obviously, you can please some of the people some of the time, but not all the people all the time. And so it was with Red Lily.  The ending to this trilogy was a disappointment for me, especially after the first two novels. Hayley's character lost something in this book. Maybe I was just expecting her to mature. She didn't. Therefore, I have a hard time understanding how a guy like Harper could get hung up on such a childish person. And Roz, a very strong woman, just fizzed out. Grant it, the plot wasn't, and wasn't supposed to be, centered on her.  Regardless, she just wasn't the same as I'd expected. Overall, it was mostly the plot that didn't turn me on.  This one was just a bit too far-fetched. And to be quite honest, the ending just fell flat. Oh well, two out of three ain't bad. ;-)  
 Roger Scruton is a polemical kind of philosopher, in many ways similar in style to John Searle. When Scruton does philosophy, it's a joy to read.  But as others have complained, the philosophy in this book is a frame for Scruton to do Christian apologetics. If that's what one wants, it's not a bad book. Personally, Scruton's Christianity doesn't have much appeal for me. And the philosophical issues can get sidelined.  If you're really interested in philosophy, Scruton's "Modern Philosophy" is a better place to look. No Christian apologetics, just philosophy. It's both an introduction and survey with Scruton's usual acerbic comments. Personally, the work is directed more toward intermediate philosophy readers than naive ones. But as a general introduction and survey, Scruton does himself very well.   For a basic and broader introduction to philosophy, Robert Solomon's "Introducing Philosophy" with original texts and commentary is certainly to be preferred, but the price is outrageous 
 The tao te ching is a great book, I'm not giving that a one star review, I'm giving mitchell's interpretation of it one star.  As many other reviews have stated, he doesn't speak chinese, so this translation is comprised of his reading other peoples' translations and what he thinks it means.  He then tries to modernize it and make it accessible to 21st century americans.  I like the old world feel of this book, you don't need to change swords to nuclear warheads, I know what a sword is.  At least though, this change makes sense, some chapters Mitchell changes so much, that the entire chapter loses its meaning.  A couple chapters made no sense, so I went to the back of the book where he tells what parts he changed, and then I was able to understand exactly what Lao Tzu intended to say.  Don't buy this book.  
 It just seemed like someone opened an encyclopedia and started copying from it. The book was also too "one sided", I think it is ok to talk about the not so positive aspects of a company without making the company out to be a villain. It felt like a 329 page "feel good" ad 
 I am amazed that reviewers can characterize this book as the "gold standard." Perhaps there are just not many books on this very complex and difficult program, and readers are grateful for anything that comes along. These authors may be fabulous video artists, and apparently are, but they certainly get low marks as teachers.  The main problem with the first volume of this book is that the authors have no understanding whatsoever of a basic principle of teaching and learning. I mean GRADATION. In elementary school, I learned to read with GRADED readers. That means that the readers started with simple words and sentences and then increased in complexity as we pupils progressed.   Not so with Trish and Chris Meyers. They begin volume one with a chapter called "After Effects 101," an extremely dense and complex tutorial "that will walk beginners through the main features of After Effects." As a newcomer to After Effects, I spent several hours completing this difficult and dense "tutorial."  In Chapter Two they would surely change the pace, or so I thought. No way. They continue throughout the book to present an exhaustive review of ALL the features and nuances connected with each technique they discuss. No gradation here. A good example of how these authors overburden the hapless purchasers of this book is Chapter Three in Part One, which introduces us to the timeline and spatial and temporal keyframes. AE has differrent icons in keyframes to indicate whether the type is linear, auto bezier, continuous bezier, or just plain bezier. This is a very complex situation to begin with, and the icons are not easy to remember. BUT they go on to muddle the waters even more a few pages later by introducing another half dozen icons which indicate combinations off ingoing and outgoing interpolations. They even call their sidebar "Strange Icons." Do we really need to know all of this detail in the first 80 pages of a 400 pp. plus book?  After suffering through the first hundred pages of this rather unforgiving tome, I bought Lynda Weinman's ADOBE AFTER EFFECTS 6: HANDS-ON TRAINING, a book which--like all the HOT series from lynda.com--is a model of clarity as well as user-friendliness. Lynda's book definitely DOES understand and implement the principle of gradation and also uses less stuffy terminology (e.g., "speed graph" rather than "velocity graph"). The only plus of this book over Lynda's is that it has colored illustrations.  Finally, why are these authors still selling their books for AE 5.5 when the current  version is 6.5? Does it take almost a year for them to update their books or does the publisher just have an overstock of outdated books it wants to get rid of? At least Lynda Weinman and Peachpit have updated her book to version 6 
 Consider another receiver before buying Delorme's. Delorme's receiver works only with their software (the receiver does not conform to any standard, unlike most other receivers.) The Delorme software itself is not very accurate. Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home, I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is - but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly. Finally, with the receiver I have, even after the device as been initialized, Delorme's software sometimes is unable to find it. (I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out, but fiddling with it doesn't seem to accomplish much). Real irritating out on the road, as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages 
 This fat volume about food and cooking, packed with anecdotes and trivia and stories, is amusing but completely unreliable.  As a source of information about the history of food, it is useless.  Many of the assertions of fact here are questionable, and none of them are footnoted so you can check them out. The author seems to have taken snippets from here and there (mostly, apparently, from French sources), sorted them thematically, and uncritically assembled them into a continuous text.  No doubt a large proportion of the assertions here are true, but there is no way of telling the difference between the true ones and the others!  What's more, the translation is poor.  Not only are some gallicisms rendered word-for-word (and so only intelligible if you translate them back into French), but there are no translator's notes for topical references.  I cannot recommend this book for anyone seriously interested in the history of food 
 There's no designing here -- she has knit up a few very simple sweaters in unidentified yarns and that's about it.  There isn't anything unique or eye-catching or particularly attractive about the sweaters pictured.  Drop-shoulder sweaters aren't hard to knit, but they are hard to make flattering - and she hasn't succeeded even though she is modeling them all herself.  There are many wonderful knitting designers who know what they are doing, who know enough about design to create truly unique garments, and who are adept at the art so that they know how to write instructions.  These are the people who should be promoted as designers...not this woman.  Save your money ... or get a copy of something written by Sally Melville, Ginger Luters, Judy Pascale, Anna Zilboorg, Vivian Hoxbro, or Elsbeth Lavold...or any one of many other real designers. You can knit their patterns, or - if you are an experienced and adventurous knitter - there is always the opportunity to learn something from these women and run with your own ideas.  That's because they know what they are doing! 
 You would think things would be a paradise in S. Africa if you listened to the Danny Glovers and other Black racists in the world.   So, why is S. Africa degenerating even with all the outpouring of money and business given to them once they became Politically Correct?   Hmmmm.   Mandela was a terrorist.   He could have been a free man if only he renounced violence and he choose not to - what does that tell you?   Look at the pictures of the Church Street bombings which he signed off for.   What a whitewash of History.   Disgusting 
 It really stunk. I've read other Boxcar Children books, but this stun 
 I see all the praise for E-Man's work, and... quite frankly, I don't get it.  This is the most incredibly self-absorbed work I've ever read.  The book is a relatively dry retelling of Dr. Derman's career path.  Along the way, he's over-eager to impress the reader with the depth and breadth of his undestanding of the world.  Nothing, apparently, is "hip" until E-Man takes the plunge and does it himself.  I can't even waste any more time writing this review.  2 stars is generous 
 Unbelievable that a publisher would agree to print this nonsense.  Don't waste your tim 
 I love Dave Barry's humor columns, and I really enjoyed his first novel, "Big Trouble." But this one was too crude for me. Maybe Dave has written for the newspaper censors so long that he had a lot of dark ideas waiting to get out.   It has been some time since I read this, but I remember feeling that the cursing and sexual content were a lot stronger than they had to be to move the story along.  The writing is compelling; the story is interesting and grisly way that one of the characters dies still makes me shudder to remember. But that sort of thing isn't my cup of tea.  For me, "Big Trouble" was a lot funnier and also had a great plot. Dave's best asset is his amazing sense of humor, and his characters are more believable because of the goofy thoughts that go through their heads, even in serious situations.  I hope Dave keeps writing novels, but I wish he'd lighten up on the adult-only content 
 After reading and using "Roasting" by Kafka, I couldn't wait to get this new volume.  Soup is in my blood.  My Polish grandmother could make soup out of anything.  Upon receipt I immediately tore open this book,  looking forward to starting immediately.  I did not find one single recipe  that enticed me.  Maybe my tastes are too "country", but this  cookbook will remain closed on my shelf gathering dust rather than use 
 The reader who said this book is challenging hit the nail right on the head. It is indeed very challenging to read this book and realize that it is written under non-fiction. Like Michael Moore's "documentary" which was more fiction than fact, American Dynasty should be listed under fiction not non-fiction. Of course the left wing liberals will like this book as much as they like all of the  other mindless, factless, feelgood garbage that permeated book store shelves up untill 13 months ago and were proven to be baseless nonsense. Some people want to believe which is to say, they probably want to believe in Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and The Tooth Fairy too.  You can skip this one 
 Oh, dear.I must be missing something here, given the superlative reviews others have written. Where's the plot? Where's the character development? Where's the narrative arc? Where's the dramatic tension? I'm not quite done, but I have found this book almost impossible to follow. I can't get a handle on what's real in the story versus what is a dream or a fantasy. The story switches back between the past and the present, and the narrator's childlike voice leaves me confused as to what is actually happening. Not my cup of tea, though I recognize I'm in the minority here. 
 I've been reading this series since the 3rd or 4th book came out.  It's time to stop buying them and start checking them out from the library just to "check in" with these characters we love.  The mysteries themselves are no longer interesting or logical.  They're vague, goofy, strained.  The timeline in Jury's world is murky as well.  I think he is in his 70s now based on the WWII childhood Grimes has described for so long.  So how on earth old is CarolAnne?  And yes, it seems Grimes is trying to lower Jury's age by saying his memories of his mother are faulty memories.  All that aside, the central mystery each time should be compelling and that simply isn't the case anymore.  So I'm not buying any more of these books that are taking up so much space on my shelves.  I'll skim them at the library then decide whether or not to actually check them out in the future.  This is really disappointing.  
 I was very disappointed in this book.  Malcolm came to our family's home to interview us to try and capture what type of man my brother was.  I must say he did a very poor job.  In all the personal facts written about my brother, the only thing he got correct was the fact that he carried his daughter's ponytail ties in his pocket.  Even though he tape recorded the interviews and took notes, he did not come close to portraying the essence of my brother.  Malcom got names, facts and timelines incorrect.  With so many errors written about my brother, I can only assume he did a poor job with the other fallen soldiers as well.    As for the facts about the battle, he got some of it correct but other areas he embellished or guessed.    I believe there was only one person in my family who read the entire book.  The book was that far off, that it was not even worth finishing.  
 This book reads as if it was a term paper for a high school sophomore.  After reading Adams by McCullough and Jefferson by Ellis, this book was so bad that I ended up pulling my bookmark and leaving in on my return flight from Vegas.  Skip this poorly wirtten book and get the Washington biography by Ellis 
 This short novel tells the story of a student who gets entangled in confusing sentiments between his professor, the professor's wife and himself.  Although the different players are well characterized, the plot is too evident and the final revelation not surprising.  This is not one of Stefan Zweig's most successful stories 
 First, I can not hide the fact that the author  put a valuable effort in this book, it is a good  book but still I have some criticism. like every  book when it deals with straight forward things,  it gives u full details but when it comes to real  stuff starts summarizing stuff. I can understand  this since the book talks about so many topics  however the main disadvantage of this book is that it did not succeed in giving the reader a good understanding on how is the code provided interacts with the engine. I do not know, I can not word it well but the key point as u proceed reading the book u feel like it is easy going but when u reach the real meat you start feeling that the writer started to rush. I have no problem with just summaries but what is important is the context, when u talk about the engine and scripts, u need to explain what the hell are these classes and call back functions that are just copied to this book. 
 I bought a book from Textcellar and it said on the listing that the book was in a great condition. I paid $50 for the book and it looked like a $5 book. Very bad condition. Looks very badly handled and pages torn off on the corners. If you say it looks like new, it should look like new. I don't think I am gonna buy from you next time.  
 I just got done reading this book for school, and I must say that it was quite boring, and I don't think I would recommend it to anyone.  I thought it was pretty boring, and the story line didn't keep me interested at all 
 TO is the man!  He really stands out in the top of his game.  What an arrogant jackass, the person who downtalks TO.  He's the man!  Jake, the reviewer, makes a good point about TO's love for Nathan Lane.  Very surprising, but very true!  MC White said:  It sucked, but read it anyway 
 I've have been unable to use this item in my car since, as soon as I hit the slightest bump, it shuts off. I cannot get through a single track 
 I no longer own my previous and much finer camcorder, so I finally found myself in the market for purchasing some kind of camcorder until I could get back on my feet to get another good one. I thought this one may do, good price, looks sharp, purchased on impulse . . .big NO-NO.  I will say the camera takes decent pictures (as the previous reviews state, almost exclusively outside in broad daylight or indoors with very good lighting). Other than that, don't bother. The MP3 is a cute function (and quite possibly the most practical). The video, UHH, let's not even go there. The voice recorder, also not bad - records in WAV format and can be transferred to PC.   Jack of all trades, master of none . . .I guess that would be the best way to finally describe this item. I will say that I'll be saving up now for much better camcorder and no more "I just gotta have this right now" Save your $, find a quality product - even if you have to pay a little more for it. Trust me, it will be overall better in the long run . .  
 I found this book to be fairly useless. It provides good definitions to all the key aspects/elements/entities in the pharmaceutical space but there was little practical material. I was looking for a reference about how to put a marketing plan together and what a pharmaceutical plan would look like and did NOT find it in this book.  It was also sparse on pharma specific frameworks. It describes Porter's 5 Forces, the three C's and of course the four P's but you can get that in any marketing/strategy book. There must be something better out there that is better suited to pharma 
 The book is a polemic with carefully cherry-picked facts and contradictory evidence omitted to arrive at the author's conclusion that "... only those few resistance fighters in the Wehrmacht who protested against extermination (of the Jews) in one way or another deserve our respect." (page 296) Many conclusions are drawn from very scanty evidence, and an indictment of all 17 million men in the German Wehrmacht as criminals in the whole is certainly not scholarship.  The reader is confronted with many (untrue) editorial statements presented as fact: i.e. "They (the German military leaders) had failed to grasp the significance of the fact that the countries with democratic governments had been able to defeat Germany in World War I because they were better able to motivate and mobilize their populations." (p. 2); and "Hopes for a more democratic kind (of armed forces), once espoused by no less a figure than Friedrich Engels, proved again and again to be illusory." (p. 160) indicates both that the author looks favorably on Communism and that he understands that the German private soldier possessed little freedom for dissent (in contradiction to his arguments). The Soviet Union is presented most sympathetically, and even the massacre of 14,000 Polish officers by the Soviets in 1940 at Katyn was reduced to a mere 4,000 (obviously an editorial mistake), and noted merely in passing.  That upwards of 3 million German soldiers died in Russian captivity is not mentioned.  Yes, the war on the Eastern Front was waged in an especially brutal and merciless fashion, but this book adds nothing to the literature on the subject.  This book is not recommended for the serious historian, and Harvard should be ashamed of publishing this title except as a table book at the holocaust center alleging that all Germans in the Wehrmacht were bad and guilty of crimes against the Jews and humanity 
 Had I read the reviews more critically, I would never have bought this book. From these reviews it is clear that Ms. Devi has popularized yoga, and in so doing, has trivialized yoga. Her earthy-crunchy, anecdotal babbling throughout the book makes this an excruciating read. I have never written a negative review of a book, but this book is an abomination 
 If you are tring to practice you Faux news allegiance I guess you'll enjoy this book.  If you looking for fair honest information don't waste your time 
 I was looking for a sound more representative of Piaf in an intimate Paris nightclub performance.  Too much orchestra, and recording quality was disappointing 
 This item is advertised as boufant and oversized. It is anything but.... The shower cap is so tiny, it would fit on a grapefruit.This kind of false advertising is what discourages us from ordering on line 
 Levitas' book is well written and documented but it doesn't contain much that is new.  I've been reading about the radical right for almost 20 years now and there were no surprises here, only a rewritten version of what is in about 20 other books and reports.  The subject has been exhausted and this book proves it 
 Oh my - where did this young lady learn to sing? It's not music from an "old soul", as another reviewer put it - just bad singing. Ugg. Stay away from this one 
 This item is supposedly titled "UFOs: The First Encounters." It is, however, an episode about reincarnation. It is incorrectly labeled. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
 My title for this review says it in a nutshell. One star for being reasonably well written/edited. But, why are some of these authors so intent on trying to defame Jefferson by twisting history the way Jefferson's original slanderer, Callender, did? It is certainly not good objective history. I would not want to lead any young reader down the wrong path with this revisionist history based on weak, weak opinion and speculation 
 This book is so full of waffle and technical innacuracies, dangerous ones at that, see the chapter on wiring a battery. You either agree with his attitude or yours doesn't count. You must do this, you must do that. My way is best, no other way counts runs all through this book. He is uncompromising and dictatorial and I'd hate to crew for him. I also wonder  if his family life is as described in the book as it sounds so soap opera stereo typical, incidents pulled right from a tv show. It is not much help if you don't have money as he writes from a position of starting off with  a healthy amount. All in all there are many more interesting and accurate and helpful books on this subjec 
 This book is the Emperor's New Clothes of literature. Critics fall all over themselves to praise it for fear of not seeming sufficiently erudite. I think Morrison is secretly laughing at all of them 
 "Heist" is, well, an heist movie like so many others. This one goes completely by the book and is uninspired at all levels. Gene Hackman gives a standart, average performance as the burglar who starts having problems with his mates. This is a "who fools who?" picture, it has some required though predictable twists at the end and the character motivations remain unclear. In fact, the characters themselves remain unclear, since they don`t speak all that much and the dialogue is poor. Acclaimed director David Mamet glues scene after scene with little creativity, so most of them turn to be boring and lifeless. This just seems like a weak episode of some late-night cable b-tv series. Dull, unsurprising and shallow, one to avoid 
 The listing says "Printed on waterproof, tear-resistant, permanently folded paper." In reality it is printed on flimsy stock and is not laminated. The map itself is ok, but not exceptionally detailed. Certainly not worth the price. 
 Michael Savage is obviously a very angry man. Some of the things that make him angry are Kwanzaa ("one more gimmick to stir up racial hatred in this country"), the "wrong kind" of immigrants, perverts, the people of "Turd World" countries (many of whom wear "dirty night shirts", apparently). He thinks it's Hillary Clinton's fault that young boys are prescribed Ritalin for displaying "symptoms of masculinity."   It is difficult to imagine that the author can maintain in normal life the intensity of indignation he manifests in this book and presumably in his radio broadcasts without suffering serious medical consequences. To some degree, it has to be an act. As such, it seems to be a cynical way to make a living: praying on and inflaming his audience's insecurities in order to deliver them to his sponsors.  As I get older, I find anger to be a less and less attractive option. You don't feel good when you're angry, the consequences of the things you do while you're angry rarely turn out to be good. That's probably why most spiritual teachers advise against it. If this point of view is enough to define me as a liberal, so be it. I prefer to think things through and listen to opposing points of view. That's why I picked up this book in the first place. Unfortunately, there's not much here of any substance of interest to anyone but those true believers who prefer their invective unleavened with facts, and perhaps a clinical psychology student or two looking for a subject for their theses.  For some odd reason, the author reminds me of the character Dan Preston in Wayne's World 2.   Del Preston: Alright, ladies and gentlemen. It takes two people to run a concert: one back stage, and one out front. One man alone cannot do this. Wayne, you will run the backstage team. Milton, you are my liaison between Wayne's backstage team and Garth's front-stage team which includes myself in the booth. To the left and right of the stage are machine-gun pillboxes, M-60 Browning. Now these babies tend to heat up so shoot in 3 second bursts. In the event of capture I will personally distribute these cyanide capsules to be placed under the tongue like so.   [Places a capsule in his mouth]   Del Preston: Any questions?   Garth: Yes, I have a question. When did you turn into a nutbar? 
 Like the book but the pages were bound wrong so that they were mixed up inside. So what good is the book then?  I want to compliment Amazon for their fast customer service. I was very disappointed about this and within a day, I got a new book that was stitched right. And my son just loves it now! Thanks to Amazon and it's a good book too 
 Updike failed to hold my attention throughout the story both because of its utter lack of suspense in any dimension and the inconsistencies in his character development.  As other have stated, you know from page one that the final page will involve an Arab, a truck and a bomb.  The lack of anticpation must therefore be compensated for by something else - perhaps excellent writing, interesting character development or original insights.  Updike fails to deliver on all three counts.  One particularly slipshod literary technique Updike uses is the phrasing he gives the title character Ahmad.  When Ahmad speaks, it is in the voice of an intelligent, thoughtful foreigner.  His phrasing captures very well the cadence, vocabulary and grammar of a well spoken non-native speaker of English.  Curiously, Ahmad IS an American, raised in New Jersey by a thoroughly American mother.  So, what influences created this stilted phrasing?  Updike is trying to somehow comvince us that a Jersey teenager speaks like a Pakistani or Egyptian immigrant.  There is no need for the technique and its inconsistency with the character's life is grating.  Updike also relies heavily on ethnic/religious stereotypes.  Sterotypes often have some basis in fact but generally make for uninteresting literature.  However, in Updike's case, the stereotypes make little sense at all.  For instance, a high school counselor's entire personality is attributed to his "Jewishness" both by himself and by others who opine on his personality.  This is particularly curious given that the man was not raised as a Jew and, in fact, his family had rather adamently turned away from the religion two generations earlier.  So where does all the Jewsih influence come from?  Likewise, Ahmad's mother's personality is often linked to her Irish heritage.  Yet there is no evidence whatsoever that her Irish background (which could have been many generations ago) has influenced her one bit.  The reader is left once again to wonder what motivates the stereotype - other than simply poor writing and careless character development.  Another out of place literay technique involves the inclusion of fairly lengthy passages from the Korna in Arabic.  Obviously, few Western readers will understand Arabic and it seems meerely pretensious for Updike to include the original language rather than paraphrasing or translating the passages.  What comes across is an attempt by the autohr to show he has done his research.  If that is truly the point then the reader must wonder why the passages are reproduced in Western script rather than Arabic script.  After all, the Koran is not written with Western phonetics in mind. Ultimately, the book leaves one wondering why such a lightweight, poorly constructed piece was released by such a skilled author 
 The time travel issue(a wierd thing about a box getting smaller) is better solved in the movie. And that thing about Lady Claire?? I can't believe that an intelligent woman could only get by in those times by literally becoming a prostitute 
 The heroine Giana is an idiot who willfully falls in love with a fortune hunter.  By the end of the book she has been enlightened by a tacky summer trip to Italy with her Uncle Daniele to tour brothels, etc.  In one instance in particular, her uncle makes Giana strip in front of himself and another whore.  Giana gets home and immediately dumps fortune hunter boy because she all of a sudden recognizes his faults.  Her mother technically okays the trip.  It is hard to believe; however, that the whole fiasco could ever have happened because, regardless of her mother's business practices, a typically well bred english woman would never do this to her daughter.  The story jumps around too much.  The hero Alex practically rapes the heroine both the first time they meet (without success) and the second (with success and even though she is sick with the flu).  He then forces her to marry him after she makes it clear to us and to him that she doesn't like him.  He treats her badly and she still falls in love with him despite all she learned about him during her Italy trip.  The only  story in this book worth reading is the one about Giana's mother, Aurora.  The author should have written this as her story from the beginning instead of wasting time on the other two sorry main characters.  Giana's character really seems like two different people.  Spoiled little idiot rich girls don't change that much or that quickly.  This is a silly book.  This author does not write books that I consider be good and this one is no exception.  I won't be reading any more of her books 
 I'm so sick of Rapist Kelly. First he records himself raping a 14 year old girl and every one of his songs is about sex. All of his songs have clues that makes him pratically tell on hismself on just how much he likes 14 year old girls. It can be in his lyrics. Sometimes, the song titles say it all. 1. "Your Body's Callin'" lyric : "your body's callin me" Yeah and that 14 year old Mommy's calling her. 2. "Bump N' Grind" lyric : "I don't see nothing wrong witta liitle Bump N' Grind" I saw the tape. I BET YOU DON'T. 3. "Homie Lover Friend" LYRIC : "Homieee lover friend is what I'm looking for, Some one who can relate to what I have in store" what you have in store can cost you a prision sentence 4. "It Seems Like You're Ready" : I doubt it. She was 14. You Probably forced her 5. "Freak Dat Body" Freak a body that can legally buy cigarrates. 6. "I Like The Crotch On You" BET YOU DID 7. "summer bunnies" Lyric : "It's summertime so it's time to get a summer bunny" Again, get one that can legally buy cigarattes 8. "For You" lyric : "You need a man who's (honest) and (understanding)" I bet his wife wasn't understand when she saw that tape. I bet he was dishonest and deined it to his wife too. I hope she turned him in 9. "Back To The Hood Of Things" are those 'things' 14 year old girls? 10. "Sadie" is that the 14 old girl's name? 11. "Sex me 1 and 2" he'll get sexed alot when they lock his A$$ UP. 12. "12 Inch Play" Is her refering to a vinyl record or the legnth of his magic stick? It's hard to tell because it saw so far inside that 14 year old girl I'm suprised he was able to take it out See, this is what disgusts me about Rapist Kelly. In every one of his songs, he either tells on himself, has a sexual reference, or has clues in them. All of his songs have double meaning to them now. Even songs that he writes for other musicians have clues in them : Examples : Aaliyah (RIP) "Age ain't nothin but a number" That is exactly what Rapist kelly was thinking when he was doin that 14 year old girl. He wrote Toni Braxton's "I don't want to". He's going to be saying that when some guy tries to rape him in jail and they probably won't take no for an answer. He also wrote Syleena Johnson's "I am your woman". Once he's raped in jail, he's going to be going around singing "I am your woman". Rapist kelly disgusts m 
 Richard Lester's Cuba was rushed into production with an unfinished script and more memorable for a troubled shoot that saw Sean Connery and Richard Lester at each others' throats than for anything that made it to the screen. Set in the last few days before Battista loses power, shown with such authentic period detail that no-one seems to remember it's supposed to be Christmas (the title card even gets the year wrong!), it's a plotless mosaic disinterestedly following Connery's mercenary supposedly advising the army but in fact doing nothing much in particular before falling in with old girlfriend Brooke Adams for a love story that doesn't really happen either before the revolution sort of happens because they've got to end the movie somehow. Then he goes home alone. Hector Elizondo's aide and Chris Sarandon's cheating husband are the closest the film gets to rounded characters but everyone else just phones it in 
 Carolyn Chute is well able to evoke a sense of place in which these  Northeastern hillbillies live by describing the detritus of their yards as  well as their lives.  However, the story meanders--again, not unlike the  aimless day-to-day existence of the characters she describes. Her  characterization provides the Beans and their friends and neighbors with a  rough dignity, although not enough to keep them from seeming pitiable to a  "sophisticated" urban readership 
 reviewer PTR said it right, but i'll say it myself: this great, ingenious novel, when we cut to the chase, really s*cks, is really beyond brutal. the writing isn't bad, it's frightening, reaching new heights of convolution and impermeability. i've read Faulkner and liked some of his books. "Light in August" was powerful and hypnotic, and I did the obligatory The Sound..., As I Lay, and another of his earlier novels, the title of which, for the moment, I'm forgetting (but I swear I read it).  Absalom Absalom, assuming you're not a Faulkner cultist, will drive you to near suicide, so keep away any nearby guns. In other words, you may be tempted to take yourself out of your misery, forgetting you've got the freedom to put the book down (i finished it, aware that it was taking months, if not years, off my life). Go ahead, Faulkner fans, rip me a new one.  I can take it 
 I haven't done this in awhile, but I don't think I could review this piece any better than the other reviews I've read about it. It's pretty average, however filled with nice bits of knowledge. They didn't seem well-researched in some areas. Here are the interesting parts of reviews from the other "critics" that I agree with...  "they go into lengthy history lessons about the origins of the characters when two sentences...would be enough." - John Gallant  "Biased against superheros(sic)" - Christopher Ritter  "I found this book to be tedious, lacking in charm, badly researched and wildy inaccurate in some areas." - C.P. Halliday  "I picked up this book." - Lawrance M. Bernabo  "Their belief seems to be that Donald Duck was the best comic book ever..." - M.G. Bloedorn  "Pretty boring." - BernardZ  "...a black hole is hypothesized, lending a faint respectability to the premise behind Green Lantern's abilities." - Peter Vinton Jr.  "...this book will not satisfy full on fans..." - James N. Simpson <---gave it five stars.  "a chance to laugh about the heroes I still love and that mean so much to me." - Reviewer  "Man, there's a whole 200 pages of this pooh-poohing, cranky-old-maid kind of stuff!" - Mark Alfred  "They were even putting words into C. Darwin's mouth." - Aaron Spriggs  "Mildly entertaining but not great" - Reviewer  "When the man (Dean Koontz in this case) writing the introduction says he doesn't read comics, I began to get worried." - Ivan A. Wolfe  "I agree with an earlier poster." - Reviewer  "Almost every chapter tells you why the superhero is impossible." Plastic Larry  "the authors give us a more plausible (given what we know now) origin for the Hulk, involving steroids and fluorescent gene modification." - J. Draper Carlson  "this book is not mean spirited or nasty." Reviewer  "Superman's powers break the laws of science. Ooh. Stop the presses." - [...]  "interesting." - Rick Hunter  "The Science of Superheroes," - Reviewer 
 A shame that Mr. Garrett had absolutely no writing talent at all, because the book could be good, dealing about one of the greatest legendsof all times 
 I used to enjoy Iris Johansen.  This book is a super natural psychic thing. The book flap describes it as "psychological thriller", but it's not.  If you enjoy the super natural type of book (Stephen King, etc) then this is good.  If, like me, you dislike that type of book, STAY AWAY from this one.  The main character Kerry can get into peoples minds.  The other main character also does that.  Yes,that is the basis of this book 
 This film has been re-released as "Meltdown."  There are a few reasons for watching this movie: 1) Jet Li.  2) Chingmy Yau (the reporter).  3) Wu Ma (Frankie's dad)  4) a decent fight scene at the end.  Jacky Cheung is also not as aggravating as usual.   That's it.  Jet Li has appeared in three or four films directed by Wong Jing, and, just as Chow Yun Fat does in God of Gamblers and Jackie Chan does in City Hunter, he does what he can.  The direction of the film, however (as well as GOG and CH), stinks.  The plot copies Die Hard and Speed, with some broad satire aimed at Jackie Chan, but that is not the problem.  Put simply, Jackie Chan knows how to direct a film.  Wong Jing does not.  If you want to see Jet Li, go see Fist of Legend, Once Upon A Time in China, or just about anything else he has done.  If you want to see a good Hong Kong action movie, watch films directed by John Woo, Ringo Lam, Tsui Hark, Jackie Chan, and Sammo Hung.  Jet Li is fun to watch, but go watch everything else he has done before you get to this 
 I generally like David Sedaris; in fact he's one of my favorites. But when his stories veer off into the death of children, almost gratuitously, I can't see the humor. This is, please note, the first book of his that I haven't enjoyed. But it's got a couple of gruesome episodes that jarred the joy out of me 
 I bought with the intent on organizing my DVD collection.  They look great on a shelf, but once you load 64 DVDs into the cases they have a very hard time staying shut.  I ended up having to put an elastic around the top and bottom in order for it to stay closed, which kinda defeated the whole purpose of buying them in the first place.  I would stick to a case that zips around so you don't have this problem.  
 Poorly written and utterly unoriginal, this book gave nothing by way of practical help or even encouragment.  Honestly, I wasnt even able to finish it.  A total waste of time and money 
 This is a bad record. And the saddest aspect of this audio nightmare is that it will forever be a part of an otherwise perfect discography. Unlistenable at any volume 
 The stuff in this book might be true, but that doesn't mean I'm going to change my life just to please some man. I always have a choice and the man in my life can either accept that, or go find another woman. End of story 
 One start , for some very acurate dramatic and terrorific  facts about the Ebola, but very weak regarding origin of the virus, very unconvincing about possible "theories". sound more like that old music of desinformation, he almost blame another monkey for the Ebola like they did before with HIV.. 
 I have two issues with this book: First, the information is far too basic to be of use to anyone with even minimal restaurant and/or marketing experience. For instance, the authors use highlight boxes to define ultra-basic terms like "discount pricing" (even the definitions are obvious: "pricing ... to generate more customer traffic.") The second problem I have is that the authors and publisher misrepresent what this book is about. If you look at the chapter titles, this book is nothing more than a simplistic how-to-open-a-restaurant book - yet they are selling it as a marketing guide for owners and managers.  Here's some examples of chapter titles - Does this sound like an oversimplified start-up guide?  Chapter 1: What am I getting in to? Chapter 2: Location: Where am I going to put his place? Chapter 4: Who are my customers? Chapter 5: Menu Development Chapter 6: How much do I charge for this stuff? Unless you have zero business know-how and absolutely no restaurant experience this is DEFINITELY a book not to waste your money on. 
 As mentioned by another reviewer, this item has a critical flaw: it's just too short. It can't be used with bowls over a few inches tall, and for small plates with a small pile of food, the cover is touching the food. This is especially troublesome when the cover has been used to prevent splatters ... dried splattered food on the inside of the cover is happily mingling with the food on your plate.  Other than that, it does its job well and prevents splatters. But I simply don't have enough instances where I can use it. Ideally, to be more versatile, the cover should be at least twice it's current height, which is why I'm continuing my search 
 Why? This is a total waste of time and money on Disney's part. They just don't have that "magic" that they had in the 90's. I hope something happens because some of the animated movies are losing credibility. JMHO  
 The guided meditations are OK, but this woman's voice grates on my nerves  -  she sounds like she's whining, making it impossible for me to actually listen to what she's saying.  I might like the book better.. 
 Quit buying this junk that pseudoscientists are selling to make a quick buck.    Sharks do get cancer.  A scientific study done by researchers at the Mayo Clinc showed not only that this stuff doesn't work, but "toxicity related to shark cartilage resulted in significant trial drop out after one month. 
 My hunch is this is a cheap sequel.  Not a lot of discussion, just a lot of (regression) results reporting.  Extremely repetitive.  Moreover, given that this often verves into being fairly social science (as opposed to pop), the causal linkages seem pretty poorly established.  If you want to read this for professional reasons (social science or urban planning), most of this could be ignored; if you want to read this for personal (i.e., recreational) reasons, it's really boring 
 My wife and I started reading to our daughter before she was born, and continue to read to her every day. She's four now, and her language skills are excellent. I am hopeful that continuing to read to her will help her grow. But it won't be with this crap. I cannot understand how child-like grammar, which is worse than the actual grammar used by my four year old daughter, can possibly be a positive influence. Moreover, the behavior of this character is exactly the behavior we are trying to help our daughter grow out of, so why would I encourage it by reading this? There are plenty of silly and fun books to be had, but the Junie B. Jones line is a disservice to children 
 What is the National Enquirer, you ask?  It's a phony as hell newspaper that provides all the latest gossip about celebirties but they come up with fake stories half the time.  Avoid it like the plague 
 Two Federal Marshals are dispatched to a remote island housing a mental institution for the criminally insane to look for a missing patient named Solando.  Throw in a Hurricane that traps the Marshalls on the island, a lot of strange behavior, and you have the premise for Shutter Island.  The book does not live up to the expectations Dennis Lehane's readers expect from him (although looking at the other reviews I could be dead wrong about that).  There are glimmers of Lehane's talents, but the book feels like a rushed screen play.  There is action, there is mystery, there are menacing situation, but it is all very glossy and superficial.  The reader will also probably solve the mystery by page 150.  It is not all grim however.  The book does flow nicely, reads easily and the last 25 pages were very powerful emotionally.  I did enjoy the book, but would expect something like this from James Patterson (this would be an achievement for him) but not from a fresh talent like Dennis Lehane 
 I bought this cd because I figured it would be a fresh take on some old favoirites. Well, I'd like to say I loved it, but I didnt. This cd just comes off as flat and lifeless. Where as the original songs, the Kyle Toucher on vocals versions, had a certain edge, the remakes make great material sound very mediocre. For those of you first discovering Dr. Know,l this may be the greatest cd in the world...the material is that good-but, if you really want to experience Dr. Know, buy their Best of CD that was released on Mystic Records. This is the best version of Dr. Know. Hope this helps 
 The cd I received was scratched.  I sent it back with the return form but never received my refund 
 I ususally like Aguilera and I need a song to practice for dance so I bought this one for "No Other Man" figuring I would like the other songs as well.  I was so wrong. I hate the rest of them.  
 I liked most of Cook's books. This one I skipped to the last pages having waded through 3/4 of it. I think there MUST be a way of getting a novel along other than the "I am a maverick doctor/lawyer/cop/engineer that will investigate this case to the end even if my bosses tell me it is closed because I am so emotionally involved with every single case that I cannot rest till I see it closed as I think it should". Then this guy JUST happens to be told about rats dying. And he JUST happens to get another case of the same type. And then (and this is simply so incredible that it is funny) he has this girl he is totally hot for in a romantic dinner together and they start talking about anthrax and botulism cases and then they go together to his house to...nononoo sorry, they both go off together (after desert of course) to talk to the husband of one of the victims to tell him to be careful with botulism!!! At night!!! In a loaned car!!! I mean, one cannot trust the agencies with that, no? And who can think about s*x when one is worried about botulism? Of course the husband is the russian bad guy. Add so many cliches about white trash and hip minorities you could sink a battleship, and you have this novel. Forget it. Read "Coma" instead, this book could induce you to a coma 
 I've got to be honest, I couldn't finish this book.  I couldn't even get through the introduction because I was so angered and offended by two comments: 1) large breasts are an abnormality caused by an overactive pituitary gland and 2) small hands are a malformation.  My reaction to this was to take my overactive pituitary gland and malformed limbs and go find another book to read.  Attacking other women for the genetics that define their body types is NOT what feminism should be about 
 I had not read Danielle Steel in several years.  I found The Cottage to be shallow, implausible, and completely predictable.  I was very disappointed with this work 
 The concept was good (and it certainly worked in Bayard's Poe novel). But after a half dozen chapters, I still couldn't care less about Tim.  The prose tended towards the pedantic and the supporting characters were flat 
 The movie the Longest Yard staring Burt Reynolds is an absolute masterpiece, a movie that didn't need any remaking. This movie, the one starring Adam Sandler is a true shame to the original. The movie could have been made better with anyone but Sandler at the helm. The inclusion of Burt Reynolds was a litter different, don't know if he should have even had a role in the remake, was good for him to score the touchdown. This movie did have some laughs but overall I don't think that I see myself ever watching the travesty that is the remake of the Longest Yard, I'm off to watch the original and remind my self as to how much this Sandler garbage ruined it.   Brian Bowe 
 This is a pitifully obvious attempt to CASH in on the manga craze. The Comics Journal never covered manga until recently and mostly just scoffed at it. Now they have a huge book supposedly devoted to it. Yet the COMICS SECTION features a bunch of indy cartoonists and  TCJ regulars who don't draw manga at all!!   With the exception of Tezuka the artists covered here are not terribly noteworthy in the scene as a whole and just further the feeling that they just slapped this book together to drain some wallets and ride the trend.   This is just another crass attempt to cash in by a snobby magazine that has traded its elitism in for pure greed 
 I thought the title was interesting so I bought this book.  Wow, what a disappointment.  This is sappy and poorly written.  How does Mitch Albom keep  getting on the best sellers list 
 This phone is a total piece of junk and a waste of money. As others have described, the battery holds MAYBE 5 minutes of a charge. Forget about it if you don't set it back on the charger when you hang up. The next time you dial, it'll be dead. I'm talking within minutes. The beeps are indeed annoying, as is the ring and the overall volume. I can't get a new cordless fast enough.. 
 Fischer's attempts to analyze the influence of regional British folkways in colonial America holds much promise. Sadly, he uses, however, a simplistic and often contradictory interpretive methodology.     Much of his information on such vague topics as "freedom" ways is anctedotal. His maps of regional origins for colonists tend to contradict his findings. A case in point is his analysis of the so-called Cavalier society of Virginia. His map indicates a substantial Welsh component to the servant population. The Welsh, like the Irish and the Scots, are either ignored altogether or given cursory attention in the creation of a Tuckahoe [i.e. Virginian] identity. Admittedly, the English did dominate Virginia numerically, the contributions of the latter, however, particularly in the Northern Neck cannot be underestimated. The contribution of Northern English, the primary creators of Fischer's fourth folkway, to the Chesapeake population is also an issue that raises problems for Fischer's analysis as does the contribution of West Countrymen to New England.        In his analysis of backcountry folkways he relies heavily on McWhiney's "Cracker Culture," a particularly problematic book, and McDonald and McWhiney's Celtic theory of Southern culture and the so-called Highland zone theory of British history. Fischer ignores the contribution of low country white immigrants from Virginia and Pennsylvania Quakers to the the formation of Appalachian culture, not to mention the Germans. The Germans, in particular, may have contributed to the pastoral agricultural traditions of the Southern Appalachians. Finally, the role of African Americans in the formation of Southern society is never adequately explored.      Also, some of the information he employs in presenting his case about the so-called North Britons in the Backcountry is drawn from William Byrd's History of the Dividing Line. The individuals encountered by Byrd were infact drawn from Culture Number 2. Because Byrd's expedition through the Southside of Virginia pre-dated the later arrival of Scots-Irish and other PA settlers in places like Lunenberg or Mecklenberg county.      As a native of the Shenandoah Valley, and a product of cultures number 2 and 4, I personally found this premise fascinating. The English, because of their numbers and historical position in American culture, tend to be ignored as an ethnic group. So in this regard, Fischer's premise is sound, in the exploration of the ethno-cultural contributions of English folk cultures to American regionalism. Fischer's introductory descriptions of the environments encountered by the colonists is another example of promise not kept, when he downplays the role of creolization and adaptation to the new environment. But the broad generalizations Fischer employs detracts from the final product.      I was pleasantly surprised by Fischer's second book "Bound Away." For individuals interested in the process, in particular, by which Englishmen became Virginians I would recommend: 1. Alan Kulikoff's article "The Colonial Chesapeake: Seedbed of Antebellum Southern Culture?'"Journal of Southern History, 45 (1979), 513-40.  2. Alan Kulikoff's "Tobacco and Slaves" (1986). 3. Terry Jordon-Bychkov, "The Upland South: The Making of an American Folk Region and Landscape." I have problems with Jordan-Bychkov's Finnish contribution theory and the number of Upper Souther "mestizos" that the author posits. But the author maintains the traditional 3-part theory of John C. Campbell about Appalachian origins, namely: "Scots-Irish," Virginian/Carolinian [i.e. lowland whites] and Swiss-German.  4.Elizabeth A. Perkins and John Dabney Shane, "Border Life: Experience and Memory in the Revolutionary Ohio Valley" A fascinating account of one of the first frontiers where individuals from the different "regions," in particular cultures number 2 and 4 came together.  On the positive side I would recommend his analysis of child-rearing techniques. In particular his analysis of the so-called "will bending" as practised in Virginia. According to Fischer Virginians raised their sons to be both independent, assertive males, yet at the same time kept them economically and emotionally bound to their fathers. In this world daughters were taught to be submissive. Yet, as Fischer shows, Virginian daughters did not always conform to this social paradigm and with the sons this created an emotional paradox that had strong social implications. In this one example it is possible to see the way in which Fischer weaves together Anthropological and Historical methodology seamlessly.  In general the book is very readable and Fischer's arguments, whether you agree with them or not, are not hard to discern.   
 While this book is a decent size for a graphic novel , the scenes are rushed, just as something is heating up , it moves on. The artwork,  although color, is just average for detail, try Paris Quinn or Duvet if you're looking for something a little more exciting 
 Oh my, where to begin...  I posted some images of a few of the drawings from the pages of this book on the customer images link above. Feel free to take a look at those to see where I am coming from.  The authors of this book need a few drawing lessons themselves, though I'm not sure that would actually help, because they're beyond hopeless. The drawings in the book are beginner level, amateurish drawings and it's really sad to see that these guys are actually teaching students in an art school.  Aside from the obvious lack of personal drawing skill on the authors' parts, there is a lot of bad advice from an animation drawing point of view, like too much emphasis on measuring and copying the model and a completely misunderstood/misrepresented view of the all-important line of action.   Stay away from this book. These guys should be ashamed of themselves for putting this crap out there 
 At first I was excited about the mighty mouse. The scroll ball worked very well, freely scrolling in any direction. The side squeeze buttons were a bad idea, because they could activate by holding the mouse too tight, but they can be disabled easily. But the mighty mouse has a much more serious and annoying design problem....  The scroll ball gets dirty, and there is no way to open the mouse and clean it! The scroll ball collects dirt over time just like the trackball in older mouse. But thanks to the brilliant engineers at apple, their is no way to open and clean the inside of the mouse without potentially braking it. After a while you will loose scroll functionality and have no reasonable way of fixing it. Within three months of use, I could scroll down but not up. The apple support people instructed me to clean it by repeatedly wiping the top of the mouse with a cloth. This only sort of cleaned it, the inside of the mouse was still dirty. The scroll ball only works on and off with this method, so cleaning it this way is clearly BS.   I'm still struggling to understand apple's reasoning with making a mouse that you cannot open. Apple has made trackball mice for years, and each one let you open it to clean the inside when the ball got dirty. This is an essential feature. I don't understand why apple thinks a scroll ball on top of the mouse would not need to be periodically cleaned exactly the same way.  If you are buying a new computer from apple, I suggest getting a regular two-button optical mouse to go with it 
 Although I applauded Alan Sokal for perpetrating his hoax, there's really not enough to it to justify this 264 page book.  First you read Sokal's original essay, followed by his article exposing the piece as a hoax.  And this is followed by the published response by the editors he duped in which they make even bigger fools of themselves.  All well and good.  But these are followed by endless articles and media coverage which discuss and encapsulate what we've just read -- it's like reading the same thing over and over again, and no one has much to add.  If being a witness to academic nitpicking appeals to you, you may enjoy reading the whole thing.  If not, you can simply read one of the articles about this hoax and you'll get the big picture without boring yourself with a lot of tedium.  This should have been a 60 page chapter in a larger volume, and it would have been great.  But too much of a good thing is simply too much, and in this case, WAY too much of a good thing was more than this reader could handle 
 The title is very attractive. however the content is more common. maybe it is good for beginner. most of content is focus on Traditional. nothing or very little useful information on Adaptive and etreme. if you want to learn how to deal with the adaptive and extreme project. just buy another on 
 I was so offended with this book. I agree with Bruce in regards to the conservatives and how they shape our image. But to put blame on the activist and the more eccentric gay people is just ridiculous.  I was both an activist and eccentric and let me tell you I fought for my rights every day of my life.  I am proud of this struggle because I never compromised myself to fit in and appear normal....and I know my example has played a small part in changing this world for the better.  Those so called mainstream and normal gays are enjoying life because of people like me.  We fought the fight while they sat back and pasted judgment...how dare they.  The reason the activist and eccentric gays appear to shape the gay image is because they are the brave souls! If you want the world to know that we all aren't that way then get your normal, mainstream ass out of the closet and do your part.....how can you expect the people to know that not every one gay is eccentric and an activist if you guys are always hiding behind closed doors in fear. In my opinion you normal wannabees are the real threat to gay freedom 
 I had never read the Scarlet Pimpernel, nor seen any of the films. One day when I didn't have time to finish a chapter, I thought I'd start the Introduction. I was enjoying the mystery-style nature of the story, then, in the first three sentences of the introduction they tell you who the Scarlet Pimpernel is! I have quit reading the book because of this. I plan to start again, in hopes that their spoiler was not far off anyway, but it was a terrible let down - on par with when my sister gave away they end of "The Sixth Sense" - which I could not enjoy, knowing what the big secret was. If you get this edition - or any edition, just in case - don't read the introduction 
 I love dissecting punching physics. A book that would lead me to my own exploration of that would be a wonderful thing. Or; any teacher that would want me to make my own exploration of martial arts and stay away from politics would probably be what I need. Need I say more ? 
 I imagine this movie might be funny if you're really into dog shows.  I'm not, so I couldn't tell you.  Mediocre at best.  "This is Spinal Tap" was better 
 From the time this unit was removed from the box, it has been a nightmare. This main problem is each and every record, both 45s & lps, skips at the end on the last track. My records, friends and even neighbors. I returned the unit to Teac, and the seemed quite good about the turn around with the repair, in which they claimed to have replaced the enter turntable assy. But, it is doing the same thing again, right out of the box. I would not recommend this monste 
 It will be easier for a camel to walk through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into heaven. Well Patty Boy I hope you have been training one hell of a camel because otherwise you are going to be mighty hot for an eternity. This man is a intolerant bigot. 
 I found this book completely useless except for a paperweight or doorstop!  What I did find interesting is that Vickie Adkins-Marcum seems to review all of Matthew Lesko's books.  Of course Vickie highly exalts him using such phrases as "KUDOS to Matthew Lesko! He's making this world a better place!"  For those of you who are a little slow, let me inform you that Vickie Adkins-Marcum is really Matthew Lesko, or someone Matthew gave this review to and paid Vickie to post it.  It's strange that Vickie's reviews all start out with the same first paragraph and have many of the same phrases throughout.  It is also strange that Vickie only reviews Matthew's books.  Shame on you Matthew Lesko for writing your own review 
 Jim Goad is a phony.  He isn't a southerner, and he is obviously clueless as to what a "redneck" is. That term comes from the Ulster Scots, the single largest ethnic group in America. Finding out about the Scots-Irish would have been the first thing this poser would have done, if he actually cared about the things he is writing about in this book. But defending rednecks and white trash from "scapegoating" isn't his real agenda.  No, Goad is nothing but a typical pseudo-reformed urban liberal. This book is just a pointless rant from a guy who doesn't really believe in anything. He's trying to be shocking and ironic by stating (some of) the obvious while showing off his ability to make juvenile and scatalogical jokes every other line (the book would be a third the length without all the overworked humor it contains, but then it would just be a pamphlet and would have never been published).  His kind is a dime a dozen these days. I wouldn't call Goad an Ann Coulter wannabe, but that's the general neighborhood he inhabits. Show this guy and his ilk some REAL political incorrectness, and they will whimper, put their tails between their legs and hide behind the couch. They're simply not serious people. They're just playing at being writers and thinkers and curmudgeons and misanthropes because they think it's cool.  Goad's true nature was made quite evident by the book that followed this one, a truly rancid piece of self-justification that has even less of a point than this book.  Don't waste your time with Goad. Read James Webb's great book "Born Fighting" instead; it's a real history of real rednecks, by a serious author 
 Michel Murray shows a distinct lack of knowledge of pathophysiology (alteration of body function due to disease). He fails to present balanced reviews of the literature on herbal supplementation leaving out well conducted studies which failed to show the benefits promoted in his book. Often his conclusions are based on opinion instead of scientific evidence.  Save your money and buy some other work of fiction. - William Joppa R.Ph., B.S. Pharmacy, North Dakota State 1985, Doctor of Pharmacy University of Minnesota 200 
 This first edition is terrible, with plenty of typos.  Material is not presented clearly at all.  Maybe a future edition will show some improvement, but as of now, I'd recommend Kandel et al, 4th edition 
 I recently read this book, and it is a good story. The plot is very simple, therefore the author, Betsy Byars, has to ramble on about unneeded information and go on into different boring things. It has an interesting  twist with the different emergencies Mouse's friend had made up, but  besides that and the always exciting plot of a typical nerd being chased by  a huge, dumb bully the book is just okay 
 I think that this book carried on longer than it should. A good chuknk could've been cut out of this, and one sex scene was a little over the top and completely unrealistic. A lot of the scenes in this book seem to drag pointlessly on and on and on, like the descriptions for example. It would go from someone's hair, to their eyes, how the color of their eyes or hair contrasted with other colors. The it would go to another person's eyes and hair and how those contrasted with other colors. This book started off really well with the press conference, and finding out about the murders...but then the murders kinda get dropped for the rest of the book until the last chapter they get brought up again. I seriously think this book could've been written better. I almost considered not finishing it because the chapters carried on way too long. I did like, however how the different little things ths sithen did for Meredith helped with the story later as the book drug on and on 
 Sadly, this thrilling sea-yarn from 1897 is nearly unreadable today.  Between the seafaring jargon - which must have delighted boys of yore - and the unfathomable dialects, it can take ages to puzzle out a page.  Some of the anecdotes related by the good seamen of the schooner "We're Here," which has picked up over-privileged Harvey Cheyne when he was washed overboard from a luxury liner, I could not grasp the point or moral of.  My husband has read all the Patrick O'Brian series, so I asked him to puzzle out a representative story, that of Counahan the Navigator, and after spending 15 minutes reading me a few pages aloud and filling me in on the few terms he understood, he said, "Honey, I see what you mean."   One can get the general gist, but it's best to read through fast, then go back and see if any of it makes any more sense.    	For example, when educated Harvey says, "Why can't we always fish from the boat instead of from the dories?" his pal Dan answers, "Allus can, till we begin to dress daown.  Efter thet, the heads and offals, 'u'd scare the fish to Fundy.  Boat-fishin' ain't reckoned progressive, though, unless ye know as much as dad knows.  Guess we'll run aout aour trawl to-night.  Harder on the back, this, than frum the dory, ain't it?"  	I got my B.A. in English, and I would rather tackle Joyce's "Ulysses" than an unannotated version of this book.   	So why did I bother?  A few days ago, a friend showed us the DVD of the 1937 movie, starring Spencer Tracy and Lionel Barrymore, on his big screen home theater, and it was thrilling and very moving.  The movie is quite different from the book, though, but it may give some incentive to check out for oneself how Kipling crafted the story, as it did for me.  But dear teachers, PLEASE, do not subject students to this particular title unless you are going to spend the semester on it and are willing to turn them off classic literature forever!  (Let them read "Cannery Row" instead!)  
 This book is about the witch trials of the New England States.  Cotton Mather was one of the witch hunters who prosecuted and executed hundreds  of innocent women.  Many were hanged and few went through the ordeal  unscathed.  This book was originally written and published in the 1600s.   It was to be a guide for witch hunters and how to deal with them.  This  book symbolizes many of the mistakes that we, as a country, would like to  forget.  Check this book out of a library, its not worth the money to  spend.  Its only valuable to collectors or psychopaths 
 The fan is so weak, it makes the product useless. It may be able to cool a small flea. Perhaps an ant. Maybe a centimenter of human skin. Don't waste your money 
 Hi.  I bought this product expect a bright laser because of other reviews.  Not only was this laser bright, it hurt my eyes to look at the dot it made!  How ever, this laser ran out of batteries after 3 days of use and a week later it broke!  Some of the wiring inside it has gone faulting and I have to tilt it a direction to get it to work.  Not only that but from 6 feet away the dot is the size of an apple!!! -unhappy customer.  *Good shipping speed though  and I would be glad to buy a better product from the seller 
 Wow.  Star Trek literature is simply not what it used to be. This book lacks any of the science fiction excitement that made the series itself or the better books readable. This is a collection of subpar stories slapped together to drain Trek fans' pockets, on the logic that we will buy anything that has to do with Star Trek (true enough for me in the case). Not one of these stories is memorable or compelling; they just don't feel like Star Trek.   Avoid this one and spend your money elsewhere. 
 I have read several books on the history of Russia, like Peter the Great,  and the Romanovs, but this book frankly bored me.  The author definetly  knows his stuff about Catherine, but I got so tired of reading about all  the political stuff in this book.  I wanted to know more about her personal  life, more details about her comings and goings, not about how she ruled  her Russian cabinet officers.  Also the use of vocabulary was way over my  head, so it made it hard to enjoy reading because many times I needed to  get the dictionary, and I feel I have a fairly good vocabulary.  I would  not recommend this book unless you  want to know about Russian  administration in her time 
 The man died as he lived a loser. This uneducated thug was nothing more than a racist piece of crap. Plain and simple truth. The only praise he deserves is praise that he is dead. Thats one less racist thug off the streets. A two year old can write better music than he did. Heck calling his stuff music is an insult to music and musicians every wher 
 Antidotal stories, personal opinions, and somewhat painful to listen too.  It was a great premise, but the delivery isn't very good.  I wish I had saved my money and not purchased this boo 
 Puddle of Mudd exploded into the contemporary pop/rock scene around 2000.  This album is representative of their entire catalogue.  For those music fans who want to hear true hard rock, pick up a good copy of any early Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath.  For anyone wanting true grunge, pick up any copy of an Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, or Nirvana album.  Puddle of Mudd shamelessly (and inaccurately) self-promotes their band/sound as both hard-rock and grunge, while living up to neither.  Since most of their fans seem to be pretty young, they've been able to pull this sham off, mainly because their audience has never been exposed to any of the aforementioned bands...and honestly has no desire to listen to any older music.  The songs on this album are extremely redundant, with little variation of riffs or overall aesthetics from one track to the next.  The lyrics are horribly compiled to offer nothing more than a vocal rhythm and subpar content.  This album is a waste of both time and money for anyone interested in listening to any worthwhile rock 
 I expected great things from Cabot's books. I was let down. I did not care for her writing style, nor did I find her information moving or educational. I am genuinely surprised that so many people find Cabot to be a literary value. I just don't see it. I would not recommend Cabot's works to anyone interested in paganism or witchcraft 
 While this book had some good ideas, I thought his advise to men to sleep around after a break up was very irresponsible. He admits that many men will be prone to use sex at this time in an addictive way, to numb their feelings, so why encourage them to do so? Even worse, what about the feelings of the women that these men will be USING for their "healing" sex?? nobody deserves to be used that way 
 "Deception" is the edited version of "Ruby Cairo," which is not a great movie but which is better than this one.  It isn't just the sex scene that was edited out, but a total of about 20 minutes.  The movie makes more sense in the RC version, and the sex scene, though dark and in Andie's case a bit airbrushed, is worth seeing, especially if you are a Viggo Mortensen fan.  I don't think it was the nudity Andie objected to, though, or not entirely.  The scene ends in an act of contempt that would sting any woman.  It effectively lets you know what the man's character is really thinking, but it's brutal in a subtle way.  There is also, of course, the (apparent) age difference between the two characters. He looks about 10 years younger than she does, even with a beard 
 I blame Yoko Ono for helping split up the Beatles (I think the Beatles were on stormy seas anyway, but Yoko was definitely the iceberg and John steered the ship right for it).  "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" IS about Lennon's love for LSD, despite the same type of lying he tried to deny in the "Beatles Bigger Than Jesus" backpedaling.  (Come on: McCartney just admitted that "Got To Get You into My Life" was about weed!). Yoko Ono has hijacked the Lennon legacy all these years for her own nefarious purposes.  She's just sold Lennon's likeness as an "action-figure doll," for Pete's sake.  And we're still dealing with the talentless half of the Lennon/Ono union.  First Yoko.  Now Sean.  The Instant Karma Lennon sang about all those years ago is still tormenting us--which is a meaning I'm sure John never saw coming.  The ultimate horror of what all the hippies wished upon their enemies--the Government, the Establishment--has come back on them.  SELL OUT is what they all did.  Lennon would be horrified.  I suppose there is some form of justice that the Ono bloodline is completely devoid of talent or shame.  They can put out as many CDs as they want, they can engineer tribute shows to John without inviting any of the Beatles or the son who could sing (Julian), and they can use that unholy alliance they have with Rolling Stone magazine to put their faces out there as much as they want (the last time I saw Sean, he was on the cover under the heading, CHILDREN OF ROCK STARS).  But the same kind of status-quo and denial and propaganda they cursed back in the day...is now their standard-operating procedure. It's almost funny 
 I was truly impressed by the utter emptiness of this new novel.  But I have no one else to blame but myself, since I knew nothing about it before shelling out over $24.  I should have been more on guard, but I wasn't.  What I found when I opened the cover and turned the pages was something like a tribute to the cliche, a celebration of lame, flabby banality, a festivel of mediocrity, nicely tarted up as a "brainy cultural commentary" (an actual review quote).  The only brainy thing about this book was the slick con job pulled off by the Knopf marketing department.  They deserve five stars.    The "characters" in this brainy cultural commentary all seem to have stopped growing around the age of 12.  The dialogue is agonizingly weak and it is not resurrected by the use of punctuation oddities or tinkering with the margins.  She ain't no e.e. cummings.  I kept wondering if I had left the television on as I was reading this brainy cultural commentary.  But it was not on, that was the tinny sound of the two dimensional nonentities who populate this book yakking at each other.  This is surely on my top ten list of truly bad novels, up there with The Historian by Whatshername Kostova.  Do yourself a favor and move away from this section of the bookstore with "intelligence and velocity" (another quote from inside the dust jacket. 
 I feel bad there are so many Americans out of work. I also am optimistic that this is another phase of job retooling and functional change. Those who aren't ready to face that their career path has alerted will find this great company for their misery because they won't find a new job spending money on this book.   Think outside the box. Look at the obvious. Change and grow my friends. I want you all to find great new jobs in the global economy but this book will not move you any closer 
 I don't like that amazon has pop up of Please Read To Me series in with Pictureback Readers and other formats.  They are all very different.  See Cranky Day review.  
 After reviewing Amazon's policy for writing reviews, I am not surprised to see that my initial review was yanked due to 'foul language'.  Imagine that...I list in quotation marks several of the author's "lovely" names for vaginas, and my review is yanked.  So get a clue about the gutter language used throughout this book.  There is nothing 'sexy' in this book.  This book should not even have the word "Witch" in its title.  This book is more about alternative sexual practices than anything to do with the Craft.  We are talking alternative with a capital "A".  Write love songs and love poetry to your vagina, dye your pubes, taste your vaginal secretions, play with your menstrual blood and do it all using the most foul names that you can think of to call your vagina.  This is just a few of the 'lovely' rituals and exercises listed in this book.  And can anyone explain to me how dressing up as a man right down to 'packing' (as it is called by the author);which consists of fake male parts attached to your under-wear, will assist me in my quest for body acceptance and female sexuality?  Please....  This book has set the Craft, feminism, and body acceptance back somewhere in the middle ages.  I shudder to think that anyone would ever believe that this book is any kind of representation of witches.  Thanks FireFox...Pagan elders have spent decades trying to put the dampers on the stereotyping of witches as sexual deviants, only to have you publish your twisted take on female sexuality, and put it out to the public as part of the Craft 
 This is the worst book ever written!  It's obvious the author doesn't know what he is writing about.  Not only that, this book is poorly written and contains no real information.  The more you read, the more you wonder why you are reading.  Where is this book taking me?  What is the point of this book?  There is no point.  Absolutely no point at all.  It appears the author is merely trying to benefit from the fame of a dead Hollywood actress.  If Lucy only knew!  I spent three hours with this book and it saddens me that I'll never get those three hours back.  I also hope this book was printed on recylcled paper because it would be a real shame if a tree gave up its life for this.  Needless to say, I do not recommend this book to anyone. 
 When I bought this book I did not realize that it was written after the movie.  It is not good Graham Greene.  The book follows the movie closely but, it adds very little.  As I read the story I miss the music.  Save your money and buy the DVD 
 I love the Office.  What I don't love is Amazon listing a 3-disc boxed set of Seasons 1 and 2 and the 2 BBC specials for sale and then mailing me 2 separate discs of Seasons 1 and 2.  So be aware that Amazon is not shipping what they advertise here.  I have contacted them and have had not a reply about this 
 If the reader knew absolutely nothing about oil production and read this book, then he or she would believe his claim that global production of crude oil will decline permanently in the very near future.  Deffeyes takes his cue from price fluctuations, and I, knowing nothing about petroleum exploration and refining and hearing a lot about 'Peak Oil' (made popular by such conspiratorial tomes as The Grand Chessboard, The Party's Over and Crossing the Rubicon), keep hearing that little statistician's nagging voice in my head, saying:  Could there be some other explanation for the price fluctuations?  We have seen this sort of thing before, folks, and we have covered this terrain before.  Whether the subject is the population bomb or the direction of stock prices, the drama is always the same: someone, usually an academic, grabs the media spotlight with dire prognostications emanating from his high-tech crystal ball (typically some mathematical formula or computer model bearing the illusion of precision), and predicts doom on the horizon if we do not change course and adopt his (typically totalitarian) prescription for renewed prosperity.  Unlike the endless parade of kooks past who have predicted The Demise of Civilization (or life as we know it), the author's  claim to fame is three-fold: first, he has worked in the oil industry, and had the good (?) sense to abandon it for academia just before the first oil shock (consider the historical performance of the global petroleum industry over the last four decades to see just how sensible that decision was); second, he is a geologist, and tries to impress (or rather, bore) us with an endless recitation of arcane technical information on oil exploration; and third, the coup de grace- he actually worked with the infamous M. King Hubbert.  All of these things are supposed to make his pitch both credible and ring true, and I guess for those who do not like to think too deeply about things,  his position really does overflow with truth and credibility.  Since I (nor anyone else) can not check the data he used to generate the estimates sprinkled liberally throughout the book for their truthfullness, that alone sends up red flags in my mind.  These estimates form the basis for his dire conclusions, and the admittedly amateur scientist and statistician in me says that if those estimates are flawed, then so too are the conclusions flowing from them.  In reading this text, and others like it, I am constantly nagged by the following questions:  Did Hubbert predict that all oil production would decline, or did he really say something else?  Oddly enough, Mr. Hubbert is long dead, so much the (in)famous Malthus, we can not consult him to hear what he has to say about things.  Could there be another explanation for the U.S. decline in oil production?  Could that explanation, in fact, have little or nothing to do with the amount of oil in the ground?  Given that we have some idea of the situation with OPEC (and to some extent, the U.S.) with respect to production and consumption, what about the situation outside of these two regions- such as in the oceans or in the Arctic/Antartic?  If the oil supply trend globally is on the decline, why in the hell are we seeing the trend for fuel economy standards in automobiles on the decline?  Could there be some other explanation for the recent rising trend in oil prices- one having perhaps a little something to do with causes firmly rooted in a history of misguided economic and foreign policy?  The author contends that poor countries will suffer the most under the scenario of world oil shortage because poor countries need energy to run the irrigation pumps necessary to produce food to feed themselves.  Granted, fuels from petroleum are one possible energy source, but there are others.  Ever hear of natural gas?  Since most of the poor countries also have abundant renewable resources (Brazil for example has both hydro and solar resources, as well as biomass) why not use this?  I strongly suspect (but can not prove with any certainty) that pricing problems we see today may have something to do with the sort of oil that we could produce versus the kind of oil we would ideally like to use, which incidentally OPEC has a lock on.  I also suspect that maybe domestic oil production has declined not because of Hubbert's Peak but rather, much like the decline of US domestic forestry, it costs less to import the kind of crude we like than it would to produce it domestically.  In sum, this book runs on par with other erroneous Apocalyptic tomes that depend on numerical tricks, intellectual sleights of hand, strangely hidden sources and data sets, illusions of precision and rigid certainty, such as those produced by Bjorn Lomborg, Lester Brown and Stephen Moore.  Readers looking for a bit more insight into the crude oil pricing problem, albeit in a historical context, would do well to consult Robert Stobaugh's and Daniel Yergin's eerily prophetic book Energy Future 
 I am a fan of Michael Crichton's.  Having said that, I felt that the writing style of this particular book was incredibly choppy, and that certain characters were not well developed at all (e.g. the wife!)    The basic premise was very interesting and the book was suspenseful; it moved along at a fast pace.  However, Crichton added too many characters, and made the book too dense.  I had to skim the last several chapters because I wanted to know what happened at the end, but I was getting extremely bored.  Obviously, he has come a long way since this book :-) Sigrid 
 Someone gave me this book and told me how thrilling it was. Halfway through, I find myself still reading it mostly to laugh at the horrible writing and melodromatic style. It's a little depressing to think that millions of readers have made this guy rich and famous on such awful writing. It's good for me to pick up a book like this now and then to be reminded that by avoiding the most popular authors, I'm not missing much. 
 Meredith Ann Pierce is hands down my favorite author of all time, but I really didn't see the point to this book.  The stories were often scattered and irratic, lacking clear plot, character development and resolution.  Some stories would have made better whole novels, and others, I am sorry to say, should have been left out of print.  Still, I enjoy her writing style and the presentation of worlds in many ways similar to our own but with added elements of magic and fantasy.  I hope Ms. Pierce's next endeavor is more along the lines of the Firebringer or Darkangel trilogies.  Those were truly great works of literature 
   This book was a huge dissapointment.  Every single layout was the same. Arrange your sofa and loveseat facing each other, throw a crappy plant against the wall.  The pictures were dated looking and in black and white.    There is nothing this book has to offer that you cannot glean from watching 1  evening of HGTV 
 I don't think these Skechers are made out of leather, so I'm very disappointed.  I thought I was purchasing a quality shoe from a reputable manufacturer, but with such a low price it was "too good to be true" 
 The title character does not get much screen time in this film.  He doesn't even get any lines (most of his yells are done so that you can't see his mouth).  This is really the story of Jane.  Jane has decided to go to Africa to search for her father who left her and her mother many years before.  On the way she must defend her virtue, kill the crew of the boat she hired, and pilot the boat to her father.  There she finds a man who seems to have had his brains baked in the sun a little too long.  Eventually they all go off to search an escarpment to find the elephant's graveyard.  Once on top they find the giant inland sea and a bizarre tribe living near the graveyard (we only see one dead elephant so at the time I did not know the "graveyard" had been found).  They also run into Tarzan who has the habit of not speaking and passing out whenever he exerts himself.  I really got the feeling that the only thing any of the film's creators knew about Tarzan was what they had learned from Johnny Weissmuller films.  The escarpment seems to be about half the continent.  It is nearly impossible to climb so I don't know how dying elephants manage to get up it.  Jane's experiences with the bizarre tribe (where she gets painted white) seem to have been lifted from Ursula Andress's film Slave Of The Cannibal God.  There is very little that is right with this film (other than that it does finally end).  Jane goes from super-able to a frightened schoolgirl but eventually falls for Tarzan and reconciles with her father.  But in the end it is not really worth watching.  For viewers who are hoping to see Bo Derek nude, almost all of that is found during the closing credits so you might as well just skip right to them. 
 Buena Vista (the company that releases Disney films on DVD) chose to not release anamorphic DVDs when they first came to DVD, so none of these films are anamorphically enhanced. This means, if you have a widescreen television, you will have black bars on all four sides of the picture. Also, these discs are absolutely barebones, only featuring a Dolby 2.0 soundtrack and a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation. Where are the extras?! I don't know about you guys, but I am a Mighty Duck fan who is disappointed by the DVD release of this film 
 I'm sorry, I just can't get hot and bothered about Angela's Ashes.  No characters with any admirable qualities, endlessly wallowing in their own sense of despair.  Parents who can't be bothered to do something to provide their children with the bare essentials, but who can always find the money for booze or cigarettes.  The father, a low life, big mouthed, lazy good for nothing who drinks all the time, doesn't bother to provide for his family, but refuses to accept charity so that his children can eat.  A mother who would rather function as a prostitute to a filthy, degraded, disgusting relative than go out and do some work.  People talk in reviews here about this woman's great self-sacrifice, but I noticed that she never failed to have a cigarette hanging out of her mouth, though her kids were going hungry and having to walk through the overflow of a toilet just to get into their house.  I can't see any great self-sacrifice there - just laziness, lack of self-respect and self-indulgence.  I can't see anything funny in this film, and certainly nothing noble in any of the characters.  Can't imagine what all the hoopla is about, or how anyone could consider such a tragic and infuriating situation, brought about by adults who refuse to be adults and take responsibility, funny in any way at all 
 This is one of the best books I have ever read on the Revolutionary War.  Even though it is technically classified as a novel, it is accurately presented history. Mr. Shaara obviously did a lot of research for this book, and presented the historical events accurately, as well as presenting dialogue in such a way that it was totally believable.  The main participants in the Revolutionary War were presented not as gods, but as truly great and courageous men and women.  He also presented the details of battles, troop movements, condition of troops, and maps of battle locations in such a way that the reader is completely captivated and a vicarious participant in the events.  I have a better understanding of the Revolutionary War years than I have ever had, and would highly recommend this book to every American who would like to have a better understanding of the founding of our wonderful country.  
 Anyone who gives this book more than two stars is insane.  From beginning to end, this book is full of nothing but internal monologue, stale, cliched dialogue, and debate.  I'd gladly quote a few examples, but my copy of the book is back at the library where it belongs.  The only reason I refrain from giving it one star, is that it did keep me interested till the end.  I wanted to know who stole the blue sapphire.  But it was a long, painful slog 
 I must say, I was quite disappointed by this book.  There's way too much psychoanalysis and far too little historical info.  Personally, I'm not interested in Mr. Asher's lay-psychology.  I read the book hoping to find detailed biographical and historical info.  What I got instead was a poorly written psychological analysis written by an amateur 
 Since the end of the Cold War, writers and political commentators have suggested that we have entered a new war - a war brought on by the "clash of civilizations". The theory, as told by writers such as Samuel Huntington and Bernard Lewis, amongst others, suggests that "the west" is at war with Islam and that this global divide will replace the earlier Cold War acrimony. Not for any particular reason or circumstance is this war being waged against us, they suggest, but merely because of its violent nature and hatred of western civilization. It is the very essence of Islam, a religion that does not share core values with ours which is the problem, and the only way to contain its violence is to be merciless in our efforts to do so.     Aside from this rhetoric being advocated as "fact" by news organizations such as FOX cable news, CNN, and most newspapers, this thesis has been regularly used by the powerful to justify wars. The U.S. used it to justify the war with Iraq and Afghanistan; Serbs and Croatians used it to justify ethnic cleansing of Bosnian and Kosovar Muslims; and it is used by Israel to justify their "war" with Palestinians.    The Clash of Civilization rhetoric suggests that the world will always be at war. As opposed to the Cold War with the Soviet Union (a country only in existence for less than a century), Islam is an old religion spread  throughout the world. The framework of the Cold war between the Communist "east" and the capitalist "west" did prove useful in making this theory. The new war is between the rational, democratic, secular, and tolerant "west" and the irrational, fundamentalist, and violent "east". Orwell could have predicted this well: the new enemy created on the morning after the old enemies fell. It almost seems that for the "west"  to feel at home with itself, it needs to be at constant war with some "other". Perhaps it provides some guidance to what we are and what we are not - we are simply not the "other". Perhaps Chomsky and others who have suggested that a major reason that states fight wars is for domestic reasons and for the disciplining of a nation's own population are right.     Not according to the "clash theorists" like Bernard Lewis, who claim that the clash will continue as long as Islam exists. He believes that the radical Islamic militants are not deviants from Islam, but actually have a more correct view of it. They will therefore likely become more influential over the years. But if such a clash really existed, why then do western nations continue to support both financially and militarily such Islamic groups and nations? As Eqbal Amad noted, the U.S. has long supported this very enemy, be it with Iraq (during and after the Iraq-Iran wars), the Saudi Monarchy, or the Afghani Mujahadeen.     Perhaps this theory falls within the entire framework of colonialism. Western colonial nations conquered the world and forced its non-western inhabitants to submit to their authority. It was believed and advocated that colonialism would help these "backward" people in the long run to become just like the colonists. Beyond the arrogance of the idea, colonialism developed sophisticated systems of slavery and servitude that sought to extract valuable natural resources from these areas for the sole benefit of their the colonizers own nations.     Interestingly anti-western Islamic militants use the same kind of "absolute conflict" to frame their war with the West. They say the conflict is between the hedonistic, degenerate, repressive, soulless West and the just, truthful, and moral center of Islam. Speaking to this subject, writers Qureshi and Sells note:     "Those who proclaim such a clash of civilizations, speaking for the West or for Islam, exhibit the characteristics of fundamentalism: the assumption of a static essence, knowable immediately, of each civilization, the ability to ignore history and tradition, and the desire to lead the ideological battle on behalf of one of the clashing civilizations". 
 I read this book and it is pretty darned strict.  I think eliminating foods is all well and good, but I would rather see a book on raw foods that gives me more options, not fewer.  It's a complicated and heavy read too.  Yes, I want to know more about raw foods, but I want to know about them in layman's terms, not from the voice of one doctor speaking to another. I found the language intimidating and the recipes challenging.  Simply put, I didn't like this book.  
 "Day Dreaming" is the only decent song on this compilation of uninspired songs that were better left sung by other artists.  What a waste of time and talent-I've come to expect better from Natalie.  I sure hope her record company prevents her from recording something like this in the future.  Bring back the classy Natalie I know!  Don't waste your money on this 
 As a sewer with 30 years of experience I was able to figure out the instructions in spite of those in the book. A beginner would have great difficulty. Side bars thruought state "EASY", "FAST", "FUN"... none of which I experienced. The chinese take-out box I made is very nice, but having to zig-zag stitch around the edge of the box 2 or 3 times proved VERY tedious. After you've made one, they are relatively easy, but not FAST and certainly not FUN 
 With this volume Bryan Ward-Perkins seeks to dispel the myth that the end of the Roman Empire and the subsequent rise to prominence in Western Europe of the Barbarians was a relatively peaceful transition, without a large level of violence, or even major disruption. In this area he is successful, however this does not change my opinion that this is, overall, a weak book.  Ward-Perkins begins by discussing how recent works discussing the Fall of Rome and the Rise of the Barbarian West have dispelled the notion that this transformation was violent, or largely disruptive. IMO this is one of his weakest arguments. I have read dozens of books discussing this era and in none of these have I seen anything to support his claim that this is the current trend in the field. All works I have read speak of death, enslavement, destruction, the sack of cities, the displacement of thousands of people, etc. These works have taken differing views on whether this was a good or bad thing, or whether it was necessary, or, above all, just what it was that caused the end of the Western Empire, but in none of these have I read an argument put forward that the period was relatively painless. One text which he specifically takes exception to is Peter Brown's "The World of Late Antiquity" (1971). While I have not read this, I do have Brown's "The Rise of Western Christendom" (1996). In it, I do not see an argument for a peaceful transformation. While one may argue over his characterization of conflicts as being generally small and localized rather than large-scale in nature, Brown refers to the "end of Roman Peace" p 56 and the "grim glimpse of the human cost" p 78.  In addition, Ward-Perkins is given to over-exaggeration. Nowhere is this more evident than in his assertion that the Post-Roman West had fallen to a level of economic prosperity "back to a standard of living typical of prehistoric times." p 183 or that "It took centuries for people in the former empire to reacquire the skills and the regional networks that would take them back to these pre-Roman levels of sophistication." p 137  I certainly have no argument with anyone who says that overall standards of living, levels of trade, cultural sophistication and complexity, etc., fell and fell radically following the end of the Roman Empire in the West. But to argue that these fell to below pre-Roman levels over anything close to the entire region is beyond belief, particularly when these assertions are not supported. Ward-Perkins appears to ignore the Visigothic taxation system established by Euric in Spain and Southern Gaul immediately following its seccession from the Empire, or that evidence exists for a vigorous (if less extensive) maritime trade continuing throughout the Mediterranean. He himself states that "Once the violence was over, in large parts of the former western empire a great deal of the social structure, and much of the administrative and cultural framework of imperial times, re-emerged and flourished." p 63 I do not see how this statement can be reconciled with an argument for society to have fallen below pre-Roman standards. Certainly this may be argued for small areas, or for brief periods of time, and I would hesitate even to argue against him for the whole of Britain. But overall, this outlook is insupportable.  I will not say that this book is without worth. For much of it, I found myself agreeing with Ward-Perkins, only to revert back to the thought, "Who is arguing anything else?" In particular, his discussion of pottery and what archaeological evidence can reveal is very instructive. To his credit, Ward-Perkins admits to being "conditioned by a very 'Roman' upbringing and early experience" p 169. I believe that while much of what he says is supportable, much is overblown. If there are works extant that argue for a relatively pain-free ending to the Roman Empire (rather than simply utilizing terminology which Ward-Perkins disagrees with), these are certainly misrepresentations of the evidence, however this is no reason to provide a work which misrepresents matters in the opposite direction.  Ultimately, this reads more as a 200-page editorial than a scholarly historical work. I would not argue against someone purchasing it, but if you do, please purchase other companion volume or volumes covering the same period to help provide a more balanced view 
 I thought Tim A. Berra's "A Natural History of Australia" was a half baked research paper by a C student.  It made me doubt that the author was really an expert on the natural history of Australia or just compiling  a list of miscellaneous facts from numerous sources and presenting them in  organized text form.  There are several inexcusable holes in this list of  facts as well.  Understandably, anyone writing a book with a title like  this would be confounded by the huge subject of evolution in this isolated  continent.  But instead of attempting an expository essay on this he,  more-or-less, lists several key dates on evolution's time-line (many of  these are on a planetary scale not specific to Oz) and leaves it at that.   The two page chapter on geography explains next to nothing, historically  speaking. It tells you that Australia is the flattest, driest, most stable  continent etc etc, but never digs into the geologic past to say WHY.  By  avoiding the stories, and explanations behind WHY Australia became such a  unique place the book misses its own supposed HISTORICAL point.  That  frustrated me.  I would recommend this book only as a natural almanac full  of thousands of facts and photos, but never as a natural history 
 Paley must have been one of those kindergarten teachers who were off humming to themselves while her students were beating the tar out of their unfortunate "playmates." Children are not sweet little angels,  most of them are utter horrors who have to be taught to be good and  kind-sometimes it works, sometimes not. Paley's rose-tinted view of  childhood, straight out of Little Lord Fauntleroy and Pollyanna, reads as  amusing fiction for one who suffered at the hands of her "kind"  schoolmates 
 Brown begins this book with the thesis from his previous book, Eco-economy, which posited that the environment is not part of the economy as many believed, but instead the economy is part of the environment, and from this it follows that the economy must be designed to fit the larger ecosystem of which it is a part.  This line of thinking sets up a natural hierarchy, one that holds the environment in the highest position as all important and in high esteem, and the economy in a lower (and some would say the lowest) position.  Although it sounds reasonable- indeed, it is meant to sound not only reasonable, but also logical and rational, when one considers the support Brown marshals in defense of his thesis, intelligent and thinking individuals have no choice but to conclude that his point of view is not only flawed, but flat-out erroneous.  Brown, a long-time China Watcher, sells this latest installment of ecological peril with a blurb on the back cover that predicts impending doom for the world's most populous nation.  He supports this view by citing the ebb and flow of both grain stocks and rivers in China.  He also cites rising global temperatures and falling water tables (the latter almost exclusively focused on one area in China) in support of his dubious `China Syndrome'.  Brown would like us to believe that grain supplies are fixed because land area for cultivation is fixed and that only two countries produce grain for export- the US and Canada.  Furthermore, he would also like us to believe that `valuable farmland' is being lost at an incredible rate to urbanization- namely, that scourge of all modern, industrial civilizations, parking lots for cars.  Brown hopes that this last argument will serve as the proverbial (?) nail in the coffin, an airtight defense of his position that economically developing (not simply growing) China is headed for an Environmental Armageddon.  At first glance I look askance at such dire prognostications of Armageddon, given first the difficulty many have had in obtaining reliable statistics on command economies such as China and the USSR in the past, and second the fact that like most countries going through the process of economic development (most notably, China's historical rival, Japan), China will increasingly obtain more of its grain on the world commodity markets.  It does not necessarily follow that impending doom will befall the Middle Kingdom, unless of course, you believe that the only place China can get grain is from the US and/or Canada, and that grain harvests can not be increased.    In reality, while total land area for cultivation can be considered fixed (more or less), the proportion of this land given over to cultivation varies over time, and as long as you believe that all the available cultivable land is under the plow all the time, then barring productivity increases, it does certainly seem to follow that the supply of grain is fixed- it can't possibly go up.  Furthermore, besides the United States and Canada, several countries around the world export grain (nations like Australia, Brazil and Argentina come readily to mind).  Indeed, China will most likely migrate to the world commodity market to buy its grain not because of rising temperatures and falling water tables, but because it would be cheaper to buy it on the world market than to produce it domestically.  As for his position that valuable farmland is being lost at a rapid rate to urbanization, I respond by asking what is meant by valuable farmland and what constitutes a rapid rate.  Long experience has shown that farmland `lost' to urbanization typically has gone through a succession of agricultural use rendering it thoroughly unrecoverable as profitable farmland and exists at the rural-urban interface before it is gobbled up for suburban tract home development, malls and parking lots (for proof, just look at what is currently happening in California).  Like his previous book, Eco-economy, this book contains all of Brown's trademark ideas, beliefs and values, but this time around manages to be more hopeful and less polemical.  Plan B is also noticeably shorter than his typical rants on the environment, and Brown freely admits to recycling much of the material from his previous book, Eco-economy.  In it, the reader will find expositions long on hyperbole (and short on verifiable fact) on a diverse range of topics.  I found his treatment of tax-shifting laughable as always, especially when he invokes the rationale of taxing gasoline consumption (while neglecting to tell the reader that every volume of gasoline is already taxed at the pump; indeed, like cigarettes, the majority of the price paid for it is given over to taxes of some form or another).  Brown's statement of falling water tables worldwide, based on an illegitimate leap from a few anecdotal stories presented in the text, also gave me a few chuckles.  However, I especially enjoyed his erroneous take on China's food future by far, and eagerly await the day he is proven wrong.  If I were a betting man, I would lay odds with him, much like Julian Lincoln Simon did most famously with Paul Ehrlich many years ago.  In sum, my single biggest problem with this book and others like it (Bjorn Lomborg's The Skeptical Environmentalist comes readily to mind) is the tone of absolute certainty the author takes, that his conclusions (generally based on a disparate set of premises, factual or not) are inevitable and inescapable, without allowing any room for alternative explanations.  My only consolation is that Brown, who so often in the past has cried wolf, has a long history of being wrong, like many others who have tried their hand at prediction of outcomes dependent on many factors and agents.  I believe it was Henry Spencer who once said, "Belief is no substitute for arithmetic," and in the case of this book, blind acceptance of its contents cannot be countenanced without more than a little thought.

 This book is so horrifically flawed on so many levels.  First, there is the erroneous uncritical thinking involved in dealing with the measurement problem, which despite David's attempt to address, is completely evaded via a multi-layered philosophical detours of an almost paramastabatory nature.  Second, on a technical writing level, David is completely unable to formulate one complete, coherent, and logically cohesive sentence.  His writing style is to riddled with repeated mistakes in basic grammar that it is genuinely embarrassing to read.  I would greatly encourage those interested in real science to read The Fabric of the Cosmos or The Elegant Universe.  -B. Green 
 I have to agree fully with Alexiel's fine review of this film; there's no point in repeating what's been said so eloquently already. It's worth finding and reading. I will add, however, that after seeing this as well as her earlier stuff,it's  beyond painfully obvious that Breillat has an agenda and it doesn't include liking men. Her female character's sweeping statements about all men in general are insulting and unintelligent, and having a gay man speak for all men about how they view women is naturally, a bit skewed from the git-go. The sex isn't erotic in the least, and the shock value is so obviously there to shock, it just ends up as cinematic sludge. This is simply not an artistic film, but a dry and fairly pointless one. The ending in particular borders on inane 
 I originally saw this movie on Showtime and loved it. So of course when I found a palce that actually carried the DVD I was excited to purchase it. I recieved it only to find there was no menu and NONE of the special features that are advertised on the back cover of the DVD case were there. I was EXTREMELY dissapointed, I returned it and got a replacement and THAT DVD didn't have them either!! I was appalled. 
 I can utterly guarantee that this thing won't work. I was employed in the pest control industry for 16 years. We used to find cockroaches living in such devices all the time (it's usually nice toasty warm in there). Sanitation, exclusion, and very careful application of pesticides is what you need.  Rodents are sometimes repelled for a brief time, but quickly adapt (adapting to environmental conditions is one of the things rats do best). Again, count on sanitation, exclusion, and traps; try to avoid baits because you'd rather know where the little s.o.b. died (i.e. in a trap, rather than in a wall somewhere) 
 This otherwise excellent account of George W. Bush's appalling environmental record (strategically?) ignores, and thereby condones, the President's three most deadly anti-environment policies: never-ending mass immigration, nearly open borders, and countless stealth attempts to reengineer more amnesties. These policies are fueling a US population explosion that is outstripping that of many Third World nations.  Bush and Pope (and his Sierra Club) are something like the dazed South Asian islanders seen wading out into the sudden eerie low tide, oblivious to that high distant foaming crest, a tsunami, making its way, making its way.  
 I Purchased this product in Nov 2006. Reviews at other sites indicated this was a wonderful product, the very best, editor reviews - not user - the product is to new I guess. I looked at the specs and it had features which looked very appealing, so I thought I would try it - Bummer. Acronis 10 installs fine, sets up a file system on a seperate physical drive and appears to work, until you verify the images, all are corrupted. I have contacted Acronis several times, they have given me several test tools to find out what might be wrong.  Nothing has been resolved after 4 1/2 months. The tools and debuging has shown no errors in my hardware.  I have to keep using Ghost-2003 to do my images, it works fine. Acronis support acts like its a unheard of problem, but I now find references all over the Internet about this image corruption problem going back to version 6 
 I bought the DVD based on all the positive reviews, and I think prospective buyers should be warned that not everyone finds this a 5-star movie.  My husband and I, who love old movies, hated it.  My teenagers just found it completely uninteresting.  It was apparently made about the time Alaska became a state, although it deals with an earlier time period, and the movie has not aged well.  The story was uninteresting, the direction was uneven, the comedy (mostly bar fights) felt forced and awkward.  Stewart Granger did not seem to know what he was doing or why his character was there.  Fabian's acting was unmemorable and we felt Capucine was miscast.  We got bored and spent half the movie pointing out to each other how little the sandy beaches and desert terrain looked anything like Alaska (it was obviously shot in southern California).  I gave it two stars because I was able to sit through the entire thing, but I spent most of it asking myself "why?  Why am I wasting my time like this? 
 People buy fast food, they know its bad for them. People pay the Geek Squad 229 to do 5 minutes of work. People ALSO pay 10 bucks for words & techno beats called "pop music".  Amazing, if you had this much money: go get a gym membership. Pay off your cars. Donate it to children's hospital.  Why support some teen that in 2 years will die from the music scence and laugh in her mansion 
 Having taught the book for some years and having admired Branagh's talents as well, I was excited to see what he did with the book.  His acting talents are remarkable, again; the sets are exceptional; the liberties taken deplorable.  He ruined it.  Killing Elizabeth to make the monster lady is laughable.  The end of Justine is pointless.  Deniro does not capture the integrity or depth of the monster.  Minimal script that truncates and eviscerates. Horribly disappointed, especially by the maudlin sentimental ending...bathos supreme.  Frankly, disgusted.  Kenneth, what are you doing 
 I have been reading Jodi Picoult's books since I first came across The Pact at the library.  And from there I glommed most of her books reading back to her previous titles such as Songs of the Humpback Whale and then her books, Keeping Faith, Salem Falls, Perfect Match and Plain Truth.  Unfortunately in recent years I haven't been able to get into some of her titles, specifically Vanishing Acts and My Sister's Keeper.  The latter title was just too sad for me to finish.  It was therefore with some trepidation that I picked up the CD of The Tenth Circle while at the library. Because I was told that there was a parallel story told in comice book form, I was concerned that I might be missing something although other readers said I wouldn't be missing much.  But at this point I must add that while the reader did a fine job and I was initially intrigued with the plot and characters, this book dissolved into a listening experience of a book which went off into too many directions to be a good reading experience for me.  I won't review the details of the plot or characters since so many others have done a fine job of this, rather offer, instead my  views just as I finished this title.  I just finished listening to The Tenth Circle and found it was such a grim book.  Not that Jodi Picoult's other books were rollicking fun but this one reminded me of a line from one of her books that said, "There ought to be a moratorium on grief."  Unbelievable the imagination some writers have.  Maybe that's why they're writers and I'm not.  But there were some unanswered questions, coincidence, sheer improbability and then she wrapped up the ending a bit too quickly.  And I might add a bit too happily or hopefully from all that happened for me to consider this a book I enjoyed.  But I do have to add that there was some wonderful writing about what it means to be a parent but I just found it overall very disappointing. I do hope I'm not spoiling this for anybody with such a negative review but I used to love this author's books and wonder if I'll continue to read her which makes me sad. 
 Where's the subtitle of this very effective book?  Did the modern editors simply take it away?  Darwin titled his book: "The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection" and subtitled it: "The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life."  When Hitler came to power in 1933, he had one overarching idea in mind: his radical Nazi racial philosophy built on the Darwinian principle of natural selection.  Hilter thought the Aryans were the fittest and he wanted to help speed up the "inevitability" of natural selection.  He first started off with the sterilization of nine categories of "the unfit" which were feebleminded, schizophrenia, manic depression, Huntington's chorea, epilepsy, hereditary body deformities, deafness, hereditary blindness and alcoholism.  He then worked his way up to attempting the complete extermination of entire categories and entire races of people.  Speaking of modern day little Hitlers, the Columbine High School shooters carried out their bloody rampage on Hilter's birthday, April 20th, and had planned on causing more than 500 deaths at the high school.  Shooter Eric Harris had written on his website, "YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE??? Natural SELECTION!  It's the best thing that ever happened to the Earth.  Getting rid of all the stupid and weak organisms."  After the bloody rampage, Harris' autopsy report revealed that he was wearing a T-shirt with the words "Natural Selection" emblazoned on the front.  Beware of those who hold this book dear to their hearts.  This book is not about man descending from the apes.  The ideas in this book have caused and continue to cause more deaths than any other notion in modern history 
 I am a HUGE fan of China Mieville. I have read Perdido Street Station, The Scar and Iron Council. Those were GREAT books, but this is not in the same league.  The book was interesting at the beginning, but there was not enough going on to keep me interested. I forced myself to finish it, hoping that it would get better. I would not recommend this book to anyone, since he has written far better novels 
 Hey record labels...don't you think it's a little late to be manufacturing your own version of Avril Lavigne?  This CD is such a cliche...monotone vocals that explode into raging screams, "chunk-a-chunk-chunk" guitars, and whiney lyrics about how miserable life is.  Don't worry though, because pop culture trends die out quick.  Skye Sweetnam will be back cooking hamburgers for minimum wage before you know it 
 At best Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is just a mediocre modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones. The characterization seems like it came straight out of a 70's made for TV movies. If you have read any mysteries before the plot is paper thin, the first time the true villain makes an appearance, it is basically a "well isn't that contrite" moment. But it is a fast EASY reading novel. This book is just fine for lounging on the beach or passing the time on a cross country airline flight.   Some people take the conspiracy overtones to being anti-catholic. I think this is just nonsense but if you are sensitive to this sort of thing you might be offended by this book. Althogh, there are some kooks that think this book is about reality, instead of fiction,   A much more interesting book, in a similar venue (modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones), is Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco. Be forewarned, Eco's novel is a MUCH more challenging read but in the end is a more enjoyable novel. It is analogous to comparing cotton candy (Da Vinci Code) to a 12 course gourmet dinner (Foucault's Pendulum). Both will satisfy hunger, both are a type of food, but the popular one is something which can be consumed casually and in the end leaves you wondering if you should have made an effort to consume something that would have been more fulfilling.  
 'Chess Artist' is a mixed bag. Hallman tries to provide a history of chess, a character study of his friend Glen, and a travelogue to Chess City in Kalmykia. The result is a novel with a schizophrenic, disjointed tone that often leaps clunkily from one topic to another.  The author's writing style ranges from readable to grating. I'm of the school that believes good writing should seem effortless, and you can just feel the strain in some of the descriptions: "The buildings were all of the same black brick, an architectual surrender that would have made sense if it had been a moon colony" (Pg. 3) Occasional lapses into the passive voice, as well as other sloppy mistakes, make it difficult at times to tell who is doing what.  The author's persona isn't entirely likeable, either. In recounting a chess game against a co-worker, Hallman writes: "Even though I did not play chess very well, I could discern things about the pit boss from how he played. He was aggressive and stubborn. He appreciated creativity but prefered the thrill of winning. The scolding he gave himself when he erred suggested self-esteem problems, and the casualness with which he eventually resigned suggested he was also resigned to his life." (Pg. 27)  Apparently Hallman (a self-appointed "chess historian") missed his true calling as a private investigator or a therapist; gaining so much insight into a person's life during a quick game of chess is a rare talent indeed. Passages like this one frequently left me with the impression that Hallman is very assured of his own cleverness.  However, this is not to say the book is entirely without merit. It can be interesting at times, especially if you don't know much about the history of chess. And the book does a decent job of portraying how chess completely consumes some people's lives. Consider glancing it over at a local library if you're interested in chess, but definitely don't buy it sight-unseen 
 The main reason for buying this camera is to be able to take good pictures from far away. The quality is very poor. The unit is very bulky to carry around your neck. The SD card slot has some block in it. I was not able to even insert an SD card. All in all, not satisfied at all 
 I can't imagine how many hours of my life I wasted worrying about ego-trippin' jocks. Although, I understand how I got hooked on this bad habit.  The rich folk who own our media do a great job of marketing this endless diversion to the masses.  So, instead of worrying about economic justice, environmental destruction, the well-being of children and so forth; the passion of a large segment of the general public is frittered away on watching one city's gladiators combat another city's gladiators. On top of that, with the us vs. them pattern of thinking that is encouraged, the anthem singing, and so many pro sports figures involved with right-wing politics (Bernie Kosar, John Elway, Steve Largent), I've come to realize how poltically-charged this so called "escape" actually is.  On top of that, I just got sick of all these sports announcers barking about this or that, wagging their finger in my face.  The ads in Sports Illustrated are also a bunch of macho [...].  By the way, before he was killed by "friendly fire," Pat Tillman was reading Noam Chomsky and Howard Zinn books.  In fact, he had arranged to have a meeting with Chomsky after he returned from our war of terror.  Too bad he wasn't able to pursue that path.  My interest in sports is now limited to badminton in my backyard, and books like "What's My Name Fool?" which is about how sports figures sometimes remember issues like peace and justice 
 I bought this cd many years ago and just now feel the urge to write a review.  I was so disappointed.  I mean the original versions of these songs are good but after listened to half a disc I felt remixed out.  The remixes become boring and just left me thirsty for the original versions.  Also did not like the way the songs were broken out.  One disc is supposed to be mellow and the other is supposed to be jamming but after listening to the disc I wondered why songs appeared on the wrong disc.  There is no flow on these cds.  I am still waiting for the proper greatest hits while this one gathers dust.  Not recommended 
 This book shows how Robert has been lying all along. He talks about how he bought his dream car while being homeless. Ok then, how did Robert make the monthly payment? Why would he be stupid enough to sleep in a Porsch as a bum? This guy is such a liar and is trying to con the masses. He is a conman and a good one. Thats why hes a motivational speaker. It takes a good speaker to con you out of your hard earned money. Don't fall for this conman! This book contradicts what Robert has been preaching in previous books. Robert says pay off your debt while he says he bought his dream car while being homeless. That would be odd but it isn't odd because Robert is a professional liar 
 This book is the first one you will reach for if it is your first pregnancy. Save your cash and get it from the library. Then read something that expects you to be a thinking woman, not a child taking orders or information without question. If you want to go through pregnancy, labor and birth, and have no say at all or learn anything useful, then stick with this book; i.e., go to the hospital, have an epidural, episiotomy, then finally the c-section that 'must' have been necessary, this is it.   Beyond that, read Ina May Gaskins, Henci Goer, the Sears' books, and "Childbirth Without Fear." Read a broader selection - many of which you can also get from a library or spend a night thumbing through at a bookstore.  I am a mother of 4; have had healthier, more positive birth experiences than anyone I know. This book is misleading and negative.  Make it the joyful event you deserve 
 This is the only book I have ever given a bad rating.  This book not only has useless information on the occult but has a negative and unappealing tone throughout the reading.  Although I can agree to disagree with some of the thing he states about the Charasmatic movement, this book is poorly organized and is a hard real.  Buyer beware 
 If you think of the prime numbers as a Dr. Seuss staircase then this book's for you.  There are painfully cute analogies like throughout the book as the author shows off his faculty-lounge acculturation. It is least informed and most poorly written of the current spate of RH books.  Buy any of the others.  Avoid this one 
 Gonazlo Rubalcaba and New Cuban Quartet - Paseo.  2/5  Forty-one year-old Cuban-born Pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba has released his 23th recording with Paseo this year.  On the opening track the Latin-flavoured El Guerrillero (The Soldier), the drums beg to turn on a dime a few times, but they simply stamp out at the same pace.  The instrumentation is fine but the track doesn't stand out.  What's most striking about this CD is that Gonzalo Rubalcaba is a master technician of diverse styles.  Witness his sublime balladry on Sea Change.  This is a style he displayed when I saw Charlie Haden perform in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 2002.  The major fault with this disc, though, is that  it doesn't sound improvised enough.  There's too much structure and the compositions aren't terribly interesting.  They do have the sheen of modernity, but when you listen below that layer, there's little that qualifies as being memorable.  There's not enough tension and interplay between the otherwise capable musicians.  At times, some of the tracks sound "busy" without having an engaging groove to them.  As an interpreter of jazz, Rubalcaba is as good as anyone.  He knows how to cut loose and deftly swing.   On Paseo, regardless of the inspiration behind the compositions, he's holding back, in fact, the music gives me a stifling sensation.  If you read a lot of the reviews of his albums, they often say similar things: great chops, masterful technician, not so memorable composer.  If you really want to hear Rubalcaba doing some mind-blowing piano playing, you owe it to yourself to check out Discovery - Live At Montreau from 1991.  Listen to the fantastic first track, Monk's "Well, You Needn't" and be prepared to be bowled over by its virtuosity and electricity.     It's widely regarded as one of the best major label debuts, with drumer Paul Motian and Charlie Haden on the bass.  If Gonzalo Rubalcaba were returning to my town, I wouldn't hesitate for a second to buy tickets and I would recommed him to jazz fans.  I would only hope, though, that he would shed his shackles and do some serious swinging. 
 I own over 60 poker related books and dvd's and this is only the 2nd book I have ever sent back.  It is just a compilation of information from other books, and a bunch of useless information (how to build a poker table??  don't they sell those in several stores??).  Please save your money for one of the myraid other poker titles that will actually teach you something.  It sure has a NICE TITLE, and a review from one of his friends, but don't let either sway you 
 There is no way this man can be serious.  This book is a joke, it has to be.  It's been a while since I've read it, but while I was reading, I found myself literally marking passages with a pen that were ridiculous, absurd, sometimes bordering on insane.  I can't believe that anyone in their right mind could read this book as anything but parody.  The Enemy Within is not only asinine, but it is also an incredible waste of time - full of pointless anectodes and machismo, rife with typical conservative name calling, Michael Savage is so representative of what is wrong with America today.    Ignorant, bigoted, idiotic.  If these words fit you, you might enjoy The Enemy Within 
 This movie is just so tragically non-believable, that it irritates the viewer and you have to quit on it.   Good cast, but what stupidity in the script. Are they serious letting us believe that a serial killer is re-enacting crimes from an almost 100-year old novel.  And so Angelina Jolie goes to a decades abandoned meatpacking storehouse and can still smell the manure??????  Duhhh --- the place has been abandoned for decades. More non-believably, you mean to tell me a real estate developer hasn't snatched up the property and razed the building. That it has sat undisturbed so that even the manure is intact decades later?  I'm sorry -- when movies use plot devices so amateursishly like this, I bail on the whole project. 
 Dr. Lande has poorly researched the aspects of Civil War, preferring instead to demur to general logistics, rather than in-depth perusal of legitimate history.  His writing resembles that of a high school report, with poorly constructed sentences, run-on phrases, choppy verbosity and a verbal cadence that approaches boredom.  The true battlefield in the book is the one between the author and his lack of writing expertise.  Read it with a grain of salt, and spare your wits for much better treatises on Civil War history 
 If you are looking for a book that can inspire you, perhaps this is it. However, I just didn't find this book to be practical in the least. Every room was so over the top, you wonder how anyone could accomplish anything in these apartments. I understand the idea of a haven, but i kept thinking about all of the dust that could get stuck in all of the billows of fabric and trinkets that were were literally wall-to-wall in every room. And where to sit? Where do you eat? There was NO "virgin" space that could be considered useful. I consider myself to have a pretty open mind, but nothing in this book was worth keeping. I returned it the day I recieved it. I agree that any of Rachel Ashwell's books would be a better buy than this. Her books are great for inspiring your home, but also inspire party ideas and treasure hunts 
 I have tried again and again to appreciate Wait's songs as so many people have pushed him on me. This is the latest, and my last attempt. I have come to realize that I am no fan of shtick in music, and Waits has built an entire career out of shtick. If you like the gimmick run with it, if you're curious I would advise running in the opposite direction, with haste 
 Mr. Winchester takes an interesting subject, collects enough material to make a fine article in, say, National Geographic, and somehow pads it out to several hundred pages in length.  (Case in point, a chapter devoted to how he found an interesting fossil by the seaside while a kid, but loses it, and his journey back to the site of this failure of his to wallow in the misery of this horrible loss. Ick. Self-induldgent.  Boring.)  Worse, still, even where there is a potential for interesting and enlightening material, such as relates, say, to the subject's wife, all Mr. Winchester bothers to give us are some gossipy speculations.  I guess extensive research might have been too time consuming.  Numerous times I considered stopping reading the book because the writing was so dreadful, but the subject was just interesting enough to keep me going, hence my review of two stars.    John McPhee could have covered the actual science of geology way better than Mr. Winchester, and just about any other author could have done a better job of telling the personal story 
 I hate to say this since Philosophy is one of my favorite brands, but this is probably the worst mascara I have ever used. It clumps really badly and is very difficult to remove. It does not simply wash off, it forms little rubbery strings that end up all over your face and the bathroom sink. About half of them remain attached to your lashes, and I've pulled so many of mine out just trying to remove the mascara. Everything else I've ever tried from Philosophy was fantastic, but the best mascara out there, hands down, is from Lancome 
 At a time when the baby boomer's were yet to exist, WW2 was happening. A school of boys are stranded on an island due to a plane crash with no adult anywhere. The leader Ralph created 2 teams to survive each having a certain task. Jack becomes the hunter team, while Ralph was more of the society creation team. Ralph's second had man, Piggy, helps out in more than a few ways untill tradgity strikes. The teams divide as the socity clapes and roles are broken. WIlliam Golding has created another timeless piece, full of changes and plot twists in "lord of the Flies" 
 This is a waste of money - it broke on the second use. I took it a part to find out why and the entire locking force was applied via a sharp edge metal  lever held in place by a 1/16 in plastic pin. It simply self destructed 
 This movie creeped me out and not in a good way. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it's the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makup on him! I love Tim Burton's other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you're an adult and pales compared to the original. If you're a kid it's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking "Auntie Zoe, what does that mean?" When are screenwriters going to figure it out? EITHER WRITE A KIDS MOVIE OR WRITE A GROWNUP MOVIE!!! It's really hard to do both in the same film. It seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids, they end up appealing to nobody! Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. It's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo! 
 This was one of five books that I brought from Amazon.com and by far the worst of the lot.  This man has one idea about how the government really works.  Take it from me I have been with the IRS for five years 
 When I was 15 and first discovering guitar, I loved this album. Listening to it now, it just sounds incredibly soulless and cheesy.Vai is technically very impressive, but the man can't write a decent song to save his life. Vai's modus operandi is to get a bunch of faceless studio musicians, lay down a generic rhythm track, and go wheedily wheedily wheedily whee for an entire album.  Technique on your instrument is never a bad thing, however, technique should be just a means to an end, not the end itself. And that's what no shred guitarist seems to understand. The fact that shred guitarists like Vai aren't more popular is due to one thing: they're more concerned about playing faster and more cleanly than the next guy rather than writing songs. There's a GOOD REASON why non-guitarists hate this stuff.  Basically, once you get past the "Gee, that's neat" factor, this album, and nearly all of Vai's music, feels incredibly stiff and lifeless.To be blunt, this is what John Tesh or Yanni would sound like if they played guitar rather than keyboards. Not only that, his guitar tone is absolutely awful. Very thin, high pitched, and brittle sounding.  The best thing on here is the blatant Van Halen rip-off "The Audience is Listening": the rest is just masturbation. Vai's best work has always been as a sideman, especially the stuff he did with David Lee Roth, because then he's forced to play actual SONGS, rather than 5 minute long, tedious guitar solos. On his own, he's just unbearable. I considered giving this one star, but I gave it 2 stars due to the fact that Vai CAN play, it's just WHAT he's playing that's the problem.

 Okay, now, for all of you who are expecting a book that teaches interesting morals and cool things in it, put this book away right now!!! Put it into a dusty corner and whenever you may catch a glimpse of it, laugh in a malicious tone because you haven't feasted your eyes on the most stupid book ever written!! This book ends with such a melancholy abruption that I thought I might be witnessing the severe chopping of a movie gone over far too many minutes. This book...is horrendous. -ANGRY READER 
 "Gender in Urban Education" claims to avoid "pitting boy's needs against girl's (needs)."  Unfortunately, this claim is accomplished by simply denying that urban boys have any educational needs.  It is highly significant that the gender gap in grades, school discipline, college attendance, arrest rate, and mortality rate - the areas of primary concern for boys in general and urban boys in particular - receive little to no attention in this book.  A key insight into the philosophy of this book can be seen in the Introduction with the sentence, "The strategies described in this book either include boys or can be adapted to include boys."  The formulation of this statement indicates that the primary focus of this book is on the educational needs of girls, with boys thrown in as an after-thought.  A second telling statement, again found in the Introduction, is when reference is made to a teacher who "formed a girl's lunchtime talk group."  The authors appear to be surprisingly "gender blind" to this statement and the universal truth behind it that secondary school teachers (particularly urban secondary school teachers) put considerably more effort into teaching girls than they do boys.  Despite a claim that this book is based on "up to the minute" research, several relevant areas are not adequately addressed.  First, despite the fact that one author is a member of the National Writing Project, no real mention is made of the gender gap in language arts participation and performance.  Thus, the growing trend of teachers constructing elective language arts classes as a "Girls-Only Club" is not discussed.  Second, in the discussion on sexual harassment, boys are described exclusively as perpetrators, and girls are described exclusively as victims.  In this, the authors disregard the AAUW's own findings that the gender distribution in both categories is virtually identical.  It is again interesting to note that no discussion is made of the recent increase in the number of female teachers arrested for sexual assault of secondary school boys.  Despite new packaging, this book is simply a rehash of old material.  The authors fundamental thesis - that only girls have educational needs in today's schools and that boys are the primary cause of those needs - has been discredited.  
 I had to read this book for a women's psychology class. After finishing it I checked the internet to see what real archaeologists had to say on the topic. It turns out that this book is a (...). It is filled with conclusions that have no basis in archaeological or scientific reality. Many of Gimbutas's assertions have been discredited. Like Von Daniken, Graham Hancock, and other con artists who write about ancient astronauts, the "face" on mars, or the lost continent of Atlantis, this author has written the worst type of parapsychological and pseudohistorical bunk. If she truly wants to promote equality in the world, and not just make a fast buck, writing a bunch of garbage and trying to pass it off as history is not the way to do it 
 I got this product to help me sleep and it did NOT work for me.  I used to take some pain killer/sleep aid made by Members Mark and that worked great, but I no longer need the pain killer.  I bought this and have tried it 3 times now, and I can't quite explain it but it did not make me tired.  It made me feel relaxed and more of a false tired, plus it made my sleepless leg syndrome act up all three times I used it.  Not only did it not make me drowsy, I couldn't sleep and I woke up several times during the night.  I think I would have done better without it.  But everyone reacts to drugs differently, so try at your own risk 
 An interesting but implausible tale to say the least. The author writes about the existence of stone "platforms" on Cape Breton Island (CBI) that he stumbled across a few years back. Curious, he tries to track down the builders of said platforms with the usual suspects being the French and the English. Going through the existing historical record reveals nothing about who the builders could be.  He then makes the jump to the idea that it must have been Chinese explorers/settlers who did the work during the heyday of Ming China's voyages of discovery. (I suspect that those voyages were more about tribute gathering and trade than about discovery.) Anyone familiar with Menzies' book 1421 will know his theory of how the Chinese sent expeditions circling around the globe yet mysteriously somehow missing Europe(!).  I'm extremely skeptical about Chiasson's theory that it was the Chinese who built the platforms for a couple of reasons. First of all, there is very little reason that I could see as to why anyone would want to build a settlement on Cape Breton Island unless there was something very valuable there. As Chiasson says, there is coal and there is gold. Unfortunately for the theory, China has lots of coal so it would not be economically viable to transport it all the way back to China from CBI and the gold deposits were not enough to sustain later European ventures. Again, China has closer sources of gold at hand and, even if they were to send out fleets of gold miners, there are closer sources along the way to CBI such as South Africa, West Africa, and Central America.  Second, Chiasson's talk of the Chinese using the Gulf Stream to mosey on up the Eastern Seaboard sounds plausible but he also fails to mention that this same current will eventually land you in Ireland and Scotland too!  There are also a couple of other bothersome points I'd like to bring up. First, Breton does not refer to the English but to the region of Brittany in France. And, second, the pictures of the Minority Peoples of China that he uses to posit a possible link between China and the local Micmac (sp) tribe is laughable. It's implausible to suppose that such people would be on board important Han Chinese voyages in sufficient numbers to make a cultural difference in a tribe thousands of miles away!  Like I said, interesting but implausible. I suspect that only actual archaeological digs will dispel the mystery of the platforms, if any 
 I am studying anthropological courses in the university and bought the encyclopedia to help and guide me through the new terms I encountered. For these purposes I found this book extremely unhelpful. This is definitely not a book for students, those who start studying anthropology, but rather for those who already know a lot about the science.  For example, here is the definition of essentialism:  "Essentialism commonly appears as both a violation of anthropological relativism and one of the besetting conceptual sins of anthropology. Exemplified by such totalizing ideologies as nationalims and biological determinism, it is also frequently conflated with reification, objectivism and literalism". Etc.  For me in order to understand this definition, I need to read 3-4 page articles in the same encyclopedia about: relativism, biological determinism, objectivism, literalism. And even after that I don't think I will be able to understand what the authors wanted to say by this definition. And its the same almost about every other term or concept I was looking up.   Of course, if you are familiar with all these terms - it is easy, but then do you really need this encyclopedia.  A frustrating experience for me. This publication is collecting dust on a shelf now, and I turned to more popular publications, like "What is anthropology" (terms are explained in a much more accessible language), "Understanding social and cultural anthropology", etc. And... never underestimate wikipedia, the best for me as a student.  Would strongly not recommmend this book for students and whoever is starting to learn anthropology. Will advise it to my anthropology university professor with 20 years teaching experience, he may find it interesting.  Ma 
 I'm a business planning consultant and a client just gave me a copy of this book. Way too basic, not enough help on the most important part of any business plan: the financials. If you want to get funded, look for a better book 
 I love Dr. Rosenfield, but this is a useless book. Sorry, doc 
 I bought this stereo because of its relatively small size and stylish appearance and because it had aux inputs for me to hook up my mp3 player to it.    The first unit I received would not turn on at all.  I contacted Philips' tech support, and their solution was for me to send the brand new defective stereo back to them at my expense.  Fortunately, Amazon has a very nice return policy, and I sent it back to them instead.  Amazon was also very nice in sending a replacement right away without waiting until they received the defective unit.  The replacement stereo arrived in short order, and I was immediately disappointed in the sound quality, which didn't seem as good as the 15 year old cassette player boombox that I was replacing.  After listening to the stereo for a few days and comparing it to a Sony CMT-NE3 bookshelf stereo that I own, here are my thoughts.  1. The FM reception is not as good as the CMT-NE3.  Both units have a thin wire type of antenna, and both wires are about the same length.  The Philips stereo, however, would hiss and crackle as I moved around the room - my body interfered with the reception.  This did not happen with the Sony stereo.  2. The sound quality is not as good as the CMT-NE3.  Playing the same song side-by-side on the two stereos, I found that the Philips stereo had a flat, tinny sound when compared to the CMT-NE3.  The Sony system had a much fuller and richer sound quality.  Also, there seemed to be significant distortion in the high-frequencies on the Philips stereo, making "S" sounds sound more like "H" sounds.  I also noticed an occasional crackle of distortion in the overall sound, possibly due to a bad connector on the aux input.  3. The ergonomics of the Philips stereo are not so good.  For one thing, the stereo will easily tip over forwards if accidentally bumped.  If that happens, the CD can get wedged in the CD tray and it becomes almost impossible to remove.  The electronically actuated CD door is much more likely to break than a passive mechanical door like the top-loading CMT-NE3.  The volume goes up to 31 or so, but 5 is about as loud as you would need it for regular listening.  This means that there are only 4 quieter volume levels, which is rather limiting.  Finally, the stereo is a bit bigger than I was expecting (though I could have looked more closely at the specs when buying it).  I am in the process of returning this stereo, and I will try to find a Sony system instead.  Unfortunately, Amazon no longer sells the CMT-NE3, which I bought just about a year ago.  I don't understand why electronics manufacturers feel the need to churn their product lines so rapidly.  Is there really that much innovation in bookshelf stereos?  The only difference between the Sony I bought last year and one I bought in 1989 is the ability to play MP3 CDs.  
 This book is yet another attempt at degrading the white race.  There is nothing wrong with being white, just like there is nothing wrong with being black.  If you want to hear someones idea on whats wrong with being white instead of looking at the facts then you should read this book 
 This was not the edition I wanted, as follows: I initially found the desired edition, including a photo of the cover, followed the links for available copies, including this one which I purchased (which, BTW, did not have a photo of cover, but I assumed it was same edition as on the initial page). Was dismayed to receive this different edition. It matters because it was for a friend's college course. Professors often reference pages in the assigned edition, which do not correspond to another edition's page numbering. Please minimize such confusion by more accurate advertising (include a cover photo on every linked page, to ensure it matches the initial one) or more accurate linking--i.e. don't show a specific search result but then link to other books that are not the same one, unless again, there are cover photos or other info displayed to distinguish them 
 Having enjoyed several other "Chicken Soup" books my daughter & I were disappointed in this volume. Not all of the entries are personal anecdotes from people. The ones that are, are not that interesting. I would not recommend this particular volume to anyone. 
 I just finished reading this book, complaining the whole way how I did not like it.  I should have put it down, but I thought it had to get better at some point.  There was too much sex (graphic sometimes)and no substance.  While You Were Gone by Sue Miller was better 
 I think this book is kind of boring because I didn't enjoy it.  I wouldn't recommend this book either because again I thought it was boring. I think it was hard to concentrate on this story because I didn't enjoy it.  Science fiction stuff doesn't really catch my attention. Yes I thought this book was boring.  TEC and ESP aren't things that interest me.  I like football that's it 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 I sent it back. The price was right but the caller ID didn't function. When I got in touch with AT&T, they told me, maybe this phone is not compatible with the other phones in my home. (Stupid Response!) I then asked, why would AT&T put a phone on the market that's not compatible with my other phones, I didn't get a reply!!! They wanted to send me a replacement. I told them there is no point in doing that, if, the replacement phone was not compatible with my other phones! I guess AMAZON will be sending it back to AT&T 
 I wanted to like this series.  Oh, how I wanted to like this series.  I'm a HUGE Buffy fan and an even bigger Willow fan, so when I saw these books I bought all three immediately.  Book one is probably the most tolerable of the books.  As far as I can tell, Navarro's strength is in her descripive skills. I have both of her Willow Files books, and they keep me riveted even though I know how they end.  The beggining of Wicked Willow I (description of an episode of Buffy) was good. It goes downhill from there, however.  If you were to read this book on its own (which I wouldn't reccomend, as its a cliffhanger) it might not be so bad. Sloppy editting aside, the permise is sort of interesting. But the three books are virtually the same plot over and over, regurgiated at you a little different.   And the worst part? she doesn't even write her own ending. I won't say more than that, for risk of spoilers, but safe to say anyone who knows Buffy at all doesn't have anyhting to spoil.    Great idea,  could have been good.... but it wasn't 
 For somebody who was not alive in JFK's time, this seemed like a great way to get a feel for the politics and history of the 1960s.  This approach, though, gives only a few minutes, five at most, of each speech and so the  listener gets a famous highlight, but no depth of experience.  I am excited  about the primary exposure, but much more content and length is necessary  for this to be of much use to a serious fan of history or politics 
 The Good  9170XLCC gives an excellent shave in about 5 minutes.  It'll take about 2 weeks of daily use for your beard to adjust to the razor heads, but after that it's as close and clean as any blade shave.  The Bad:  1. It's cheaply made.  Norelco has outsourced manufacturing & it shows.  The frame holding the razor heads is plastic; every other Norelco I've owned (over 30 years) has been metal.  The frame is supported by these weird plastic-bubble "shock absorbers" that will probably go in a year or two.  The shaver has a junky, cheap feel to it.  I have always gotten 5-6 years of use out of my past Norelcos; this one feels like it'll last about two years.  2. Cleaning tank is a marketing gimmick to sell $[...]/bottle cleaning solution.  Way overkill.  It does work OK, but the shaver gets just as clean if you rinse it under hot tap water (which you will have to do anyway because the cleaning solution leaves the razor heads coated with a slimy residue).  You can pretty much throw it out after the free bottle of solution is used up.  3. I'm already on my second unit.  The chip that controls the battery level indicator, recharging, etc. is flakey.  The first one I had never could accurately display battery level even after 3 complete charge-discharge-recharge cycles.  It'd show 15-20 minutes remaining, then just die in the middle of the shave; battery tapped out.  Also, it would sometimes illuminate for no reason at all; had to turn on-off to clear it.  If it happened during the night, the battery would be fully discharged by morning.  So I returned it to Amazon.com (thx Amazon for great customer service!!!).  The second one that they sent to me recharges continuously when you use it with the cleaning tank -- it's not supposed to charge during the 55-minute cleaning cycle, but mine does.  That means that you have to catch it about 5 minutes into the cycle, after it's done it's dunking in the tank, or it'll recharge completely after every shave (which the instructions tell you not to do because it shortens battery life).  More reason to toss the cleaning unit.  Ridiculous on a shaver this expensive that they'd ship junk to their customers before fixing these problems.  4. The travel case is worthless for protecting the shaver on the road.  It's nothing but a zippered nylon sack.  You'll have to put the shaver into something else if you pack it in checked luggage or it'll be a pile of parts when you unpack.  5. They don't include a stand so when you're done shaving you lay it on the bathroom countertop.  I'm using the one from my old Norelco, but if you don't have one, storage between shaves is just setting it down somewhere.  Sad to see a fine old company like Norelco cheapening it's flagship product like this.  I've been a customer for 30+ years, but next time I'm in the market for a shaver I will definitely comparison-shop the competition.  Two stars because it does give a good shave; the rest is a mess 
 This movie is my favorite movie. Ever. I feel terrible giving it two stars. But it gets 2 stars because I am comparing it to the Rhino version, which I also own. I also own the original VHS. I have watched this movie at least once a year since I was 8 except for about 6 years in middle school/HS. I can sit in class and watch it from memory in my head.  BUY THE RHINO VERSION.  If you can't find the Rhino version, this isn't half bad. Its just that that version is much better, and since I have been growing up with older copies, the new one's flaws, minor to the newcomer, are blinding to me. I also am physically unable to watch any of the "Special Edition" Star Wars because of those changes, if that gives a clue to my movie anality.  BUY THE RHINO VERSION IF YOU CAN FIND IT.  One complaint is that the VHS had this cool "glitter" effect in a couple of scenes involving energon and Unicron internals. It is present in the VHS, It came out wrong in the Rhino version, and was totally gone in the 20th. Thanks for deleting part of my childhood.  In comparison to the Rhino version:   The remaster is terrible. Mine seems to flicker and have strange artifacts. The colors are totally off. Hot Rod is basically magenta/pink instead of red and his orange is not orange like an orange, it is orange like a cheaply made basketball.  Widescreen is fake. It is a cut fullscreen. I wish you weren't such a liar, Sony.  Cover art: D-. No detail. Looks like whoever does the new show drew it in an afternoon or two. The matrix looks like a honeydew. It would have got an F but Prime is on there.  Very few of the extras were worth it. I bought this for the remaster, hoping for some clean up and a restoration of the glitter effect, and they weren't there 
 My husband and I bought this book for our son's eleventh birthday.  He loves baseball and especially the Red Sox.  We read the reviews and found nothing objectionable written there.  We paid for gift wrap so therefore didn't have a chance to read the book before his birthday.  Luckily, in the excitement of his birthday, the book got laid to the side until we got a chance to preview it.  Imagine our shock to find a chapter with the "F" word in the title!!  Not to mention the DOZENS of other expletives in the book including the "f" and "n" words.  I took a black sharpie to the book thinking surely it must just be a few bad words in this book.  I am only halfway through and have already marked through dozens of words.  The book will barely be readable by the time I am through.  It will most likely just end up in the trash where it belongs.  Do not buy this book for a child or anyone that doesn't care for filthy language 
 Time for some excellent silliness from the kings of Power Metal! Oh wait...that was the first album. The quality has seriously gone south on this one. More Europe than Manowar, Hammerfall are treading water badly here. Prepare to hold your head in your hands for some serious cringing at some of these tracks. "Dreams Come True" is the chief culprit here. This one would not be out of place in the Eurovision song contest or maybe it's a lost addition from the Karate Kid 3 soundtrack. In fact the last 6 tracks are all duds with only one ot two redeeming moments out of the rest of them. It is a listenable album but the songs just aren't up to scratch. Since when has True Metal been about love and mercy anyway? 
 Having lost faith and taken a skeptical approach to religion I was hopeful that this book would lead me into rethink.  No way! Tired and inaccurate, not a waste of time though as I found myself constanly jumping up with "That's not true." "What a jump!" and that's a downright fabrication! 
 I really wanted the famous sea poets and authors: Masefield, Tennyson, etc.  What I got was some of that, but interspersed throughout with the anthology editor's own poetry -- which I'm sorry to say, isn't that great.  And the editor doesn't appear to know much about sailing either; for instance, he totally misses the nautical meaning of the line "when the long trick's over" (Sea Fever).  A trick is a turn at the wheel, standing watch, silly rabbit!    Serious sailor-readers should find a different book 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  First of all, too much time was spent writing about people/things that you would never hear about again after the first few chapters (i.e. Terrence, Sabrina, Rebecca, etc.).  Granted the author was setting the scene, but this book was not worth it.  I couldn't relate to the characters in any way except for Pearl and Patrick.  They seemed like the only normal and down to earth characters written.  This book is an example of how the highest people up (even African Americans) have more problems/self esteem issues than people who don't live lavish lives.  Barbara Bentley, an extremely passive woman when it came to her husband Bradford "The Rich Dog" Bentley, as I call him.  There is no way I would have allowed him to continue to do the things that he did.  Please don't say that she stayed for the money because as much dirt that she had on Bradford, she would have ended up with the house, a car, a resort/vacation home, and spousal or alimony support all at the voluntary expense of Bradford just to avoid humility.  Jolene was a straight up you know what!  This is a woman who would go to great lengths to live the life she never had, so she thought.  Let me run across a man like Patrick, and he wouldn't have even thought about looking at Pearl.  Although I did like that they hooked up, so I think.    This book was so open ended that you don't know what happened to whom.  It better be a sequel to this book, but unfortunately I not that interested in reading it.  The only reason I read this was for a book club meeting.  Being as though I live in P.G. County, it made me questions the author's motive.  To me the book was written from a condescending point of view of people who live in P.G. County a.k.a. "inside the beltway" as she would put it.  It's funny because even people who live in P.G. County don't refer to it in those terms, but then again maybe they do just not from the outside of the gated communities.  ** A note to all readers...This is a message from the avid readers association, DO NOT waste your time, unless you have time to kill and a book with no ending!** 
 I am a very happy wife and mother, with fairly conservative views.  As someone who's career is in research, I am disgusted with what others are considering "well researched".  The author has taken facts and twisted to her own advantage, and to the disservice of women.  The "supporting facts" in the book are as comical as the cover.  This author attempts to make a few good points, but then ruins her concepts with overwhelming bias 
 You can read all about the book just from what is included in the jacket. Unbelievable potrayal of a women cast off a ship by her husband. All she wants to know is did he love her when he married her? Why did he do it? I mean give me a break! I would not lay low and try to make him go insane. I would go to the police.   I read books from beginning to end to give them a chance. This was a waste of my time 
 Everyone else seems to adore this book so I guess I have lost my sense of humor because I just don't like this particular version-- at least not for the 3 and under set.    My first objection stems from the use of bug spray by the 'old lady' to get rid of the fly.  She is shown sitting on a couch surrounded by cans of depleted insecticide while spraying more in her mouth.  Rather than find this funny, it scared me to think that some child might get a notion to copy this activity.    Then second is my objection to boiling a cat and chasing a dog with the same intent.  Now most children wouldn't do this so that's not a problem but I still don't like the idea of introducing this weird concept to my little boy.  (My son asked me if we needed to keep our cat inside and safe from the neighbors - hmmm.)  The funny part of all of this is that I don't mind when the old lady just pops the animals down her throat.  Go figure.  In any case, Nadine Westcott is a good story teller and her artwork is clever, but I still have to give this book two stars because of the above reservations.          [A `Thought You Should Know' review 
 I admit I bought this book sight unseen (something I do a lot, kind of a crap shoot, I know), and while the cover and the few images I had seen were well done, overall the authors of the book, while probably excellent educators, wouldn't be qualified to give advice to industry professionals on every section of production that is addressed within. I myself have taught animation and advanced drawing at the college level, as well as worked on TV/Film animation for many years (as key animator and storyboard artist). While I don't want to trash the book, as it is a nice over view, I do regret purchasing it.  THe character designs are barely above what I would expect from my students, and while the life drawings too are nice, I would expect an industry pro to be capable of much better, should they choose to write a book dealing with the subject. Again, a nice overview book, and many students or people simply interested in animation will find it helpful, but if you have a solid background in drawing, animation, design, or are already employed within the field (and obviously possess a degree of skill), spend your money on books that focus more acutely on a smaller aspect of film making (whether animation timing/staging, drawing, or even layout/design) 
 I'm sorry I ever started reading this book.  The writing is so good that I couldn't stop -- but man . . .  Somewhat like the fictional author's fictional readers, my nose started to bleed and most of my goldfish died.  You need to be really hard up for a book to read to knowingly choose this one.  After much cursing and gnashing of teeth, I finally finished it.  Somebody owes me money 
 I was more interested in technique and tips for cooking with my new convection oven and this was a poor resource The recipes are ordinary. Personally, I wouldn't have bought it had I known how mediocre this book was 
 I like some of the other Walden Farms products -- I gave their chocolate dip 4 stars -- but this one is not very good. I tried dipping different kinds of fruit into it, tried it in combination with the chocolate dip, and finally gave up and threw the rest of it away. The cellulose gel Walden Farms uses to give its sauces body seems to have a slight spicy/sour "bite" to it; it doesn't bother me in the chocolate dip or in most of their dressings, but here it ruins the flavor 
 In reviewing this book, I am not going to get into matters of Simpson's guilt or innocence. I'm simply writing this review for those O.J. trial fans who might want to purchase it to get a different perspective on the crimes.  My opinion? You probably shouldn't bother. There are numerous books out there written by members of the Dream Team that can give you the perspective from the "he was innocent" camp. This book is merely O.J. trying to raise money for his defense (he admits it in the book). Because "I Want To Tell You" came out *before* the trial, there is really no information about the legal side of things or about the trial itself.  Also, since O.J. hadn't gone to trial yet, there was much he couldn't discuss on his lawyers' orders. So, you get watered-down protestations of innocence, but very little specific info.  Skip this book unless you want to hear O.J. protest (feebly) his innocence without any real arguments at all backing up his claims 
 She routinely misrepresents evidence and publishes hearsay along with her own distorted theories.  She generally doesn't understand the first thing about computing technology, security or the voting process.  Sadly, I agree that electronic voting is a serious problem and there are terrible security implications with how it is being conducted.  However, Bev Harris is NOT the person to get answers from.  Her conclusions are wrong and she ends up trashing the very people struggling to help the problem.  And yes, I have had the displeasure of watching her distort the facts in front of my very eyes.  She's part of the problem, not the solution 
 Based on the other reviews I must have read a different book. But seriously Payback bills itself on the ideas behind creating practical and actionable innovation, how else could you meet the promise of 'reaping the rewards of innovation.'  Unfortunately the rewards they are talking about are all in terms of cash and profits making this book a 101 finance book built around the authors notion of the Cash Curve with the following basic tenants:  - don't spend to much to create an idea because that consumes upfront cash - don't take too long to commercialize and bring the idea to market - get your idea into volume production as soon as possible - support the idea with a measured post launch investment.  Sorry but that's it. The book is heavy on the finance 101 side and extremely light on the idea of practices and ideas. Sure they say that you can play different role: innovation integrator, orchestrator, or liscensor but you pretty much know what the authors are going to say just by the role names.  The book does have an number of case studies, many that are available in the public domain, however these cases are more narrative telling you what happened without being analytical and telling you why the did this or that and the result it took.  Overall this book is very light on the ideas and actions required to deliver the rewards of innovation because it treats innovation as a financing event that is intended to generate cash. While that view is true, there is allot of insight, actions and practices that must happen before we can start thinking about how to get cash out of an innovation. I only hoped that the authors had taken the time to tell us that.   
 I read the first chapter and though this book might be enlightening. I advise anyone who buys this to stop after the first chapter or at least skip 2,3,4. The author doesnt offer much in the first several chapters of the book he simply glorifies him self and doest stop talking about himself, "I did this, i did that, i am this,.." When he does finally quit floating his own boat and start to talk, he gives the impression that all modern medical practice is a conspiracy. Oh you have cancer!, dont go to a dr. there evil, get some ginsing and meditate. Im not saying alternative medicine is bad but it has its place along side modern medicine, and should not be considered a complete replacement 
 There is very likely some information in this book that is insightful and helpful, but I couldn't find it.   The book reads as if you are attending a seminar taught by someone who was _really_ excited, and who had drank way too much coffee. I was really interested in hearing about brand and the new economy the author envisioned, but the book is just too distracting to read. I "read" about 1/2 of it, and I'm not sure if there were more than three full sentences that I had found up until that point. Text changes color, size, boldness throughout. Liberal and nonsensical use of punctuation is infuriating after the first page.  The book reads like a spoken seminar, and squanders the opportunity of actually being a book, which could have afforded a more in-depth look at the authors ideas. I would highly discourage anyone serious about this topic from buying this book. It is more of a super-happy high school cheerleader dialog than any type of meaningful discussion 
 The blurb on the back of the book states; "Cantor offers a splendid and accessible portrait of the cultures of the ancient world". Sort of. While it has a breezy style and certainly covers a lot of ground within its meager 227 pages of text ANTIQUITY also is riddled with factual errors, opinions/judgments that are questionable. Cantor's chief accomplishment here is to make a often stodgy subject interesting to the average person. That's good news. The bad is that someone will come away with the opinion that Cantor's word is gospel.  While I appreciate the effort that went into writing and editing the volume, I'm a bit surprised that some of the factual errors escaped the review of a solid editor. Certainly the subject matter and general approach is promising but applied to a book with better accuracy and less opinionated observations (and, shall we say, a certain level of objectivity)ANTIQUITY could have been a magnificent volume. As it is Cantor's book might interest someone with little knowledge on the subject to dig deeper. For that we can truly thank Mr. Cantor and his book. 
 Unfortunately this is not the best format to get up to date information on this subject. I suspected this but still bought the book. It read a lot like the owner's manual that came with my smartphone. Some the recommended links didn't work. I found a lot more useful information in current magazines or online forums 
 == quote  But, as Nansook Hong reveals in this devastating tell-all account, Sun Myung Moon does not live up to his own teachings. He has frequent affairs, which he rationalizes as "providential", that is, mandated by God.   == end quote   == quote   "My own parents saw no evidence of sexual misconduct when they were each recruited independently to join the church in Seoul."  (In the Shadow of the Moons, pp. 26-27)   == end quote    I know the UM since the mid 1970's and for a quite a long time the only accusation leveled against Rev. Moon was that he was married 4 times (while in fact he is only married 2 times) later those allegations of just being married 4 times was changed to having had sex with female followers.    Chung Hwa Pak, one of Rev. Moon's first disciples, caused considerable controversy by confirming these accusations in a text widely circulated by critics (and later published in Japanese) called The Tragedy of the Six Marys. Pak, who had left the Unification Church, claimed that Rev. Moon practiced during the church's early years sex rituals with, among others, six married female disciples ("the six Marys") who were to have prepared the way for the virgin who would marry him and become the True Mother. The church vehemently denied the allegations. Pak eventually returned to the fold and, shortly before dying, recanted all the accusations in a second text he authored in 1995, called The Apostate.   Similar accusations were discussed earlier in libel cases in Korea and not proved. In 1989, after a ten-year legal case, the Seoul District Criminal Court (79 ko dan 3372) convicted a protestant minister, Rev. Shin Sa-hun, of criminal libel after his accusations of sexual misconduct could not be proved. In another case decided by the Seoul District Civil Court (83 ga hap 3012), damages were paid by Tak Myung-hwan, a well-known critic of the Unification Church, to a woman who had been accused of having an illegitimate son with Rev. Moon and to her son.   Corrections were published by the Christian newspapers Gidok Shinbo on October 8, 1983, and Hanhook Gidok Gongbo, on October 1, 1983, after printing similar accusations of sexual misconduct in the early Unification Church. Part of the retraction stated, "The article 'The Secret Sexual Practices of the Unification Religion' was a repetition of information published during the 1950s, and we have found it to have no basis in fact."  
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 This is a product of the lazy, latter-day Leonard who knows he's a great writer who can just sit back and let it flow. The onetime master of concision now takes a hundred-odd pages just to set things up.  Even his ear for dialogue has started to fade on him. Now everybody like, y'know, talks like, uhh, some kinda boob, get what I'm sayin'? The line of self-parody is lying a little too close in these pages.  He still has a hand with the quirky minor characters, though they can't carry an entire 350-page plus novel. But this one did make it clear to me why Leonard is so popular with the pomo crowd: his characters inhabit an utterly amoral universe, one with no values or standards whatsoever. Here, e.g., the protagonist is that well-known figure drawn from life, the friendly, easygoing loan shark. In your traditional crime novel--Chandler or either MacDonald can serve as examples--the action occurs against a hard-edged moral framework that is at least given lip service. Now I won't demand that every piece of fiction act as a morality play. But this was a case where I finished the thing, and kind of enjoyed the ride, but didn't like myself for it. In Leonard's recent novels, all that matters is who gets to take home the candy. And when you get right down to it, that just ain't enough. 
 where are all of my magazine subscription first issues???????  mar 
 Black and Blue is the story of a woman who flees an abusive relationship, taking her son and attempting to disappear into residential Florida, all the while waiting for her husband, a New York cop, to find and hurt her. The book is not Quindlen's best and while it is readable, and at less than 400 pages a manageable length, it feels like little more than a Lifetime "woman's" movie in novel form. I wouldn't recommend this book, especially in comparison to Quindlen's other work, although the lessons of what abuse is, how it happens, and how difficult it can be to escape are good ones to learn about, even in a fictional context.  Anna Quindlen is also the author of One True Thing, a book-cum-film about a daughter's experience with her mother's terminal cancer. That book is good--realistic, emotional but not maudlin, and challenging. Black and Blue is merely an example of weak writing that reads like a made-for-TV movie. It made its way into Oprah's book club but would never make it on to  my must-read lists. Facing the realities of abuse is a good lesson to learn, and so the subject is worth reading about, but Quindlen's portrayal is less than realistic or compelling. All of the checklist facts are there: abuse leads to abuse, specifically carried from father to son; some women are drawn to the type of men that are/become abusers; legal protection can be inadequate; violence can lead to death. So on, so forth. The list of facts is there but the emotional context is filmsy, centers on children (rather than personal strength) and strange, powerless situations. Even when she flees her husband, things seem to be done to the protagonist rather than done by her. It's unfulfilling and disappointing to the reader and detracts from the whole text. In fact, the more interesting characters are mere foils and supporting roles like her new friends and romantic interest. They seem to have more personality and depth than the protagonist.  It will take less time and energy, and induce the same emotional responce, to watch any one of the numerous women's TV daytime movies about the same subject. Black and Blue is gripping only because you want to know if her husband will find her or not, and presents very few challenges, either in the writing or the ideas, to the reader. It's readable and I was able to get through it, but it's still a poor example of literature and even of the lesson it attempts to teach. Don't waste your time on this one 
 Now having read 7 books either written or co-written by Kevin J. Anderson,(3 Star Wars, 3 X-Files and 1 Dune) I can say that the man has good ideas, I just don't think that his writing is all that absorbing.  As with his Star Wars books, his X-Files books never quite ring true of the characters. As for the cases, they are pretty good, but it isn't Mulder and Scully who are chasing down the monsters.  Of all the new X-Files books, Charles Grant's "Whirlwind" nails the characters of Mulder and Scully, but the case isn't particularly involving 
 This is a good book for those who know how to use a PDA and are experts at reading and writing code.  It is not for beginners or those who have never seen Win CE.  But if you love computers and techie gadgets, are good with code and like to play with electronic toys, are looking for another techie's love of toys, then you might get something out of it.  But if you are inclined in that way you already know this stuff.  Don't waste your money.  There are other books that do a better job in both area 
 A fan of the Notebook, I was dissapointed to see that Sparks has hit cruise control. There we no surprises here, and the depth of the characters could be measured in centimeters - especially the doctor, who is very one dimentional. I think it wouldn't have taken him that much more time to flush out the story, but, well, he didn't.  It doesn't mean I won't keep reading him, I just hope that he gets  his bearings back. So far, the Notebook is still my favorite 
 I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, "Collapse" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK 
 While I applaud the intended message of this book (modify your current clothing and thrift-store finds to better represent your personal style), the majority of the projects suggested here are just bad.  Really, really bad.  This book merits its one star based on the directions for expanding a shrunken t-shirt (which will come in handy for extending the utility of the many no-longer-fashionable teeny-tiny t-shirts I've purchased over the past 5-10 years).  Actually, I feel a star could be deducted from the rating due to the abysmal pillow-case dress project, for an overall rating of zero stars, but I'm feeling charitable... In short: promising concept.  Rotten execution.  
 Sorry, but I think the whole book could have been written in one chapter. Most of the book was saying things like, don't buy a chair until you sit in it, or keep clutter off your desk. Advise that just takes common sense and fills up pages. I was waiting for the author to tell me not to run with a pair of scissors in my hand. I felt talked down to and unless you are very young with your very first apartment or house, you might also find the book insulting. 
 Regrettably, this book simply fails to prove its central thesis: that from earliest times, Jesus was simply included within the unique identity of God. First, Bauckham is absolutely incorrect that Jewish monotheism was in any sense "strict" in Jesus' day. As is becoming increasingly clear, the type of monotheism he thinks Jews followed in the first century does not even begin to come about till the 3rd century. Even scholars as conservative as N T Wright acknowledge this.  Second, he dismisses the Enoch literature too easily, as well as large amounts of the Pseudepigrapha. Clearly, Jews were capable of thinking of of more than one divine figure along with God. Even a simple reading of I Enoch will reveal that.  Third, he dismisses other evidence that, according to his criteria, would make other patriarchs like Moses be included in God's unique identity. As can be easily seen from Larry Hurtado's One God, One Lord, Jews could conceive of exalted figures exercising divine prerogatives--without monotheism having to be rethought! If the exercise of divine prerogatives=divinity, Jewish literature abounds with Trinities.  Fourth, he underestimates the *earliest* Christology: Jesus was a man accredited by God. Christ is clearly subordinated--both functionally and ontologically--to God; Bauckham ignores the Pauline evidence for this. Paul continually speaks of "the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ"; that God worked "through" Jesus; that there is "one God and one Lord". But this he ignores because a few passages in the NT seem to indicate otherwise. In other words, the rabbit he pulls out of the hat is one he had to put in there in the first place.  In other words, his thesis fails on every single point by making gross generalizations and by ignoring massive amounts of evidence, dismissing anything that counters his argument as irrelevant. This is not good scholarship; this is making texts say what he wants them to say.  This is hardly to deny the Trinity; nor is it to say that there is not other evidence for it (see Neil Richardson's brilliant "Paul's Language about God"). It is merely to say that THIS book proves absolutely nothing, other than the author is desperately grabbing at anything that will prove his point. 
 Unfortunately I wasnt a kid when this film first came out ,So have no nostalgic feeling for it.  I came out of the comics back when Neal Adams brought back the darker,brooding Batman from what he had become after the TV show made him more of a silly "camp" cartoon clown. I mean ,I like Adam West...in a sort of William Shatner kind of way, but the show was always about the punchline.   so when the Batman movies did come along, I was waiting for more of a Neal Adams, acrobatic and vengeful Batman ...but was pretty dissappointed when they returned with a perhaps darker , but more drawing on the TV show Batman once again. So I only saw Batman and Batman Returns once, when they initially came out.  anyway, Last night "Returns" was on TV and I decided I better give it another chance to see what all the hoopla was about. ...and I still can't see it.  Yes Michelle is very Hot in her costume and her story was a bit more complex than I remembered, in fact the movie seems to revolve around her... which I guess is a positive, but it just wasnt enough to keep it from being the campy Burton film it is.  I'm just not getting where the "Dark,Moody and brooding" stuff is coming from. The whole night time lighting of the rooftop scenes actually reminds me more of The Chimney sweep dancing scene in Mary Poppins .Dont get me wrong, I thought Mary Poppins was very well done, But for the Creature of the night Batman is supposed to be...ok maybe hes not supposed to be, but I thought he was supposed to be...  this was just a bit to crisp,clear and bright. the camera work in the fight scenes and the fights themselves,  I wanted to be more amazing aswell. not this posing,punching, hold the camera still for the running backflips then back into stiff fighting poses.  Batman should be almost faster than you can see in his movements, So should Catwoman, Not out there posing! the Penguin? geez, yeah, he's pretty grotesque.he's got penguins with rocket backpacks running around and a lot of people get killed in the movie, but I'm just dont get sucked into this movie. Its just too campy for me.   But if you want you Batman that way, then hey this is a pretty good film,I guess. But I much prefer the more recent Batman Begins. for me, That one finally got it right 
 Not sure what is in this stuff but it turns my fairly healthy hair into the texture of straw.  Even my own sylist said, whatever you are using...STOP..you hair feels very damaged.  It goes back to normal texture if I use my other shampoos.  I made sure to use it on and off to be sure it was the Jonathan shampoo..and it was.  It went into the trash.  Don't purchase this stuff...unless you're going for the scarecrow look 
 Mr. Shuman's theory was interesting, but a bit hard to swallow. Without any solid facts to back it up its just more hype. What he took 300 pages to write he could have said in 10. Most of the book was about patting hiself on the back for being such a smart guy 
 I returned this book to the store after the first few chapters, it was that bad.  The early action in the book does not make sense - you'd think that after the earth went from day to night numerous times in quick succession, the panic would last for years.  But no, after a few stampedes and deaths, people go back to their normal routines.  Most of the characters are either grotesque or poorly drawn, and there are numerous scenes of violence which seem to serve no purpose other than to disgust the reader. Don't waste your money 
 Wonderful prose -- use of language 
 As one who grew up in NYC during this era, I was excited a big Lindsay bio had finally been written. This wasn't the book I was waiting for. Lindsay made some major mistakes, certainly, but there was a lot of good to the man as well--something lost in this right-wing assault. Not surprising given that the author is a onetime aide to Bret Schundler, the arch-conservative Republican candidate for Governor of New Jersey 
 I watched both "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" and its documentary "Making of ..." and was impressed by the dancing and the dancers (particulary the incredible Tommy Rall).  Looking for a film that showcased any of the dancers in that film I came across this and after having read the reviews of the dance sequences both on this website and on imdb, I decided to purchase the film.  Then I noticed the cover.  I thought "Is this what I think it is?", and clicked on 'see larger image'.  YIKES!  It is!  I have children at home and thought that this is not an illustration that is positive or educational, to say the least (after just having placed "Hands Are Not For Hitting" on my wish list!).  If Warner Bros decides to change the illustration on the cover, then I'll consider buying it.  Until then, for those of you who are concerned with the images your children see, I suggest you view the 'see larger image' of the cover before you decide to buy 
 Does not show you techniques rather it just shows pictures!  After buying this book- I was very disappointed since I thought it will show me makeup tips and tricks, rather it just shows displays of women's faces.  You will waste your money on purchasing this book 
 This book should be avoided by young people.  My sister was given this book by her teacher and still has problems with anorexia... 
 ROBOT MONSTER is one of "those" classic Five Star One Star '50s horror movies. The problem with "C" movies is that they can't be rated by the usual standards. By its own standards its a gem.   But for the fact that this gobbler wasn't touched by Ed Wood it has all the guaranteed elements of bad moviemaking. Actually, ROBOT MONSTER was panned so severely upon release that director Phil Tucker attempted suicide afterward.  ROBOT MONSTER concerns the depredations of a fat gorilla-suited space alien in a diving helmet (Ro-Man from the planet Ro-Man which is populated by the race of Ro-Mans) who comes to earth and destroys virtually all of human life with the aid of a vacuum tube radio and a Lawrence Welk bubble machine.  Ro-Man is a grouchy, slow moving space visitor who talks with his hands and grumbles a lot. He lives in one of the more familiar Hollywood caves of Bronson Canyon, California.   The few surviving humans (a family of five) protect themselves by stringing aluminum foil around their house so that Ro-Man cannot use his death ray machine against them. Instead, he must dispose of them one at a time "by the process of strang-u-laaa-tion" if they are so foolish as to step outside of their Reynolds Wrap safety zone.    Given their current world political situation, the humans, Richard Nixon-like, are seeking "Peace---But peace with honor!" from Ro-Man. Hmmm. Seems reasonable. After all, Ro-Man has really shown restraint up until this point. Why shouldn't they trust him?    But wait! Even after atomizing everybody else (apparently including the film's scriptwriter) Ro-Man has developed a penchant for Alice, the eldest daughter of the survivors. Fortunately for us, Alice seems to have a corresponding yen for excessively hirsute and overweight men wearing fishbowls on their heads. So while Ro-Man is distracted picking a bouquet for his new girlfriend, the family figures out a way to finally finish him off.    Exactly how humanity is going to repopulate the earth with only the Father Knows Best kids around escapes me, but clearly someone involved with this film escaped from somewhere.  It's as bad and as much fun as it sounds.   
 Bottom line up front - you will not gain a top down view of the industry, the understanding of the types of businesses within it, or the nitty gritty of the components needed to do financial planning or run the business.  From the other reviews, most that liked this book didn't have much perspective in this category.  I've bought a number of books to familiarize myself with the financial planning industry before setting off on an educational track.  This book has been my only complete disappointment.  I'm sure Mr. Rattiner knows his business, but this book does not serve any particular purpose.  The scope is too broad and the depth of analysis to shallow to be helpful.  No one will "Get Started" in one book.  Many parts of the book are more like bulleted/paragraphed lists which can't possibly reveal the extent of the author's knowledge on any of the topics.  Other parts skim through the technical parts of financial planning (e.g. types of life insurance policies) which have to be learned later in official certification courses.  The aspects of running a small business he mentions don't reveal anything significant or truly specific to this type of business - you could get as much from a good article on the subject.  If you have not yet read anything on the industry, try In Search Of The Perfect Model which gives an excellent overview of very successful and inspiring corporate visions of real financial planning businesses from sole practitioners to regional firms.  An alternate bottom-up book which does not sugar coat anything and will specifically point you toward further research in a variety of areas is So You Want To Be A Financial Planner.  If you are looking for how the business should be structured for financial success under any model, Practice Makes Perfect written by industry consultants (no "this worked for me" bias) is phenomenal.  For office operations, Virtual Office Tools for a High Margin Practice will get your mind spinning with what technology can do for you as a planner.  For marketing, I recommend The Brand Called You which gets down to what weight of card stock you should have for mailings.  Sure it's better than nothing but.. 
 This book seems to have a wealth of information and includes a CD with numerous forms, the Word documents are very useful.  The PDF forms are not.  The problem is none of them are editable.  Why even include them?  Why not creat them in Word format?  This is unsatisfactory and a complete waste of time.  Why even provide the forms electronically if you can't customize them, you might as well buy a book with the paper forms and photo copy them 
 This is not a great book - pure and simple.  The author is chaotic in his exposition of the subject and time after time tries to come up with his own reinterpretation of the key concepts of Buddhism - apparently, in an attempt to look original.  Not recommended.  
 Imagine a ring around a star.  A ring shaped like a giant canal, with sides high enough to keep an earthlike atmosphere in, and a floor covered over with dirt and teeming with billions, even trillions of beings spread out over a surface area greater than all the planets in our solar system.  The very concept of Ringworld is so cool that it gives any book set there an extra star.  In spite of this, I give it only two stars, which should tell you how bad everything except the setting is.  First, there is the constant, and distracting, obsession with alien sex.  The concept of "rishathra"- sex between races- is mentioned at least once in every scene involving non-humans.  It is the focus of many conversations that do nothing to move the plot forward.  And when Niven describes it you get the distinct impression of a thirteen year old nerd trying very hard to be as blasï¿½ as James Bond.  ("Ho hum, the aliens are having sex, I've certainly seen this before, let's watch!")  Niven is thus entered onto the list of sci-fi writers who manage to make sex completely uninteresting.  Indeed, I'd say he's so bad at it that he might even dethrone Robert Heinlein from the top of that list.  Second, the plot itself is convoluted and makes very little sense.  The book jumps back and forth between a group of aliens who make a trek across the Ringworld and Louis Wu, a human trapped on the artificial construction who must battle to save it from a weird alien menace.  However, the aliens could easily have been eliminated from the book - as far as I could see there was no connection between them and the main Louis Wu storyline.  Not that the main storyline was anything to write home about.  The weird aliens were all battling each other for the privilege of saving the Ringworld, so I'm not exactly sure where the sense of menace was supposed to be coming from.  Add to that the haphazard introduction of a new character halfway through the book and the gimmicky deus ex machina resolution, and the plot entirely fails to deliver.  It should be noted that this is the third - or perhaps even fourth- book in the Ringworld series, so longstanding fans may not be as confused as the reader who is picking it up for the first time.  But whether you are a fresh reader or an old fan, my recommendation would be to stay away 
 I canceled my order after 3 shipments of the wrong color. The shipping documents stated red but you consistantly shipped white. It is hard to be happy with a product you never receive 
 WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! Info in this book is so elementary that I'm not sure whether I'm more embarrassed or angry to have paid money for it and the publisher & author should be ashamed to accept money for it. If someone has a dog & doesn't know to rub him, play ball with her, talk silly to him, then this book is needed. But, those who care about their dog are already doing what's suggested in this book. Those who don't care won't be interested in any dog books. So, the book must have been written for the very VERY young. There should have been a warning on the cover 
 This book is filled with interesting stories. It is also filled with many, many unforgiveable mistakes. Previous reviews have pointed out the mistake of Panzer means panther in German...come on! But towards the end of the book it refers to Hermann Goering as Hitler's propaganda minister. Wow, where was the editor on that one. I think Joseph Goebbels would have something to say about that. And if Goering was hard at work on propaganda, who was running the Luftwaffe? It moves on to talk about Hitler's suicide by poison in the Bunker. Except that Hitler shot himself in the temple, prefering a soldiers death. Yes Hitler did have a poison pill in his mouth, but that was only as backup in case the shot was not fatal. The book is filled with stuff like this.   I started reading this book with great excitement because the subject matter is fascinating and I have not heard about the 761st Battalion. I was hoping this book would be breaking new ground. But instead I find myself NOT trusting any of the information in this book since they obviously don't even know who Hermann Goering was.   Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and 761st Battalion should get an apology from coauther Anthony Walton and the Editor of this book 
 Although, the photography is lovely, I was hoping for a more diverse array of styles.  The styles represented a lot of "East Coast" looking window treatments that are quite lovely and "fussy" but not styles that work well in my part of the country with high ceilings and less historical architecture.

 I first read this book back in the mid-80s after watching the miniseries starring Gary Cole as Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald.  The miniseries absolutely riveted me, as did this book.  But upon repeated readings, I began to pick up inaccuracies and errors. I found that the book, rather than answering questions about this case, caused me to question more and more.  Joe McGinniss, while never a stellar writer to begin with, was eventually exposed as the worst kind of writer, twisting facts and quotes to serve his own purpose, which was to sell his theory and therefore, his book.  I have nothing against Mr. McGinniss forming his own opinion as to Dr. MacDonald's guilt or innocence, but to omit certain facts and blatantly lie about others and misquote principals and research in order to further your own propaganda is sickening.   If you want Joe McGinniss' theory on how and why the murders happened, with no regard to the cold hard facts and legal evidence, pick this book up.  If you want to read about the case, with all the facts in place both supporting and questioning Dr. MacDonald, do as other reviewers have suggested and read "Fatal Justice", a far more in-depth review of the case and evidence and form your own opinion.  
 Yeah and if you thought the review's title was ridiculous...  It's not so much that the book is confusing or that the characters could use a bit more depth, it's that from the get-go, the writing is cliche.  Pat Cadigan, who hit a home run with Mind Players, tries way too hard to be -- captial "C" -- Cyberpunk in this book.  It's possible that because I've only just read Synners while I read my first 'cyberpunk' book in the early 90s I've lost the ability to be impressed by attempts at 'hard edged' writing that tries to use slang like 'stone home' and 'hot-wire' to indicate a machine or drug centric society on the edge of destruction; but there's just so many sentences that seem oh so dutifully crafted to fit into what cyberpunk is Supposed To Be.    I give it two stars because underneath the cliche there are interesting ideas; it's just too bad one has to wade through so much over-eager writing to see them through.  If you really want to read an engaging book of speculative fiction by Pat Cadigan that bucks the cliches of cyberpunk and strikes out on its own read Mind Players 
 Well, if anything this was a decently written story, with good dialect and character detail. However, this story felt like it was going around in circles without any indication of ever ending. Grafton seems to have an idea of where she wants to go with this story but never really gets there.    The story starts off with PI Kinsey Milhone in her office at night when she hears a knock on her door. She opens it to find Janice Kepler, mother of Lorna Kepler standing before her with the tale of her daughter's mysterious death. Not only this, but she also explains to Kinsey about how no one ever solved the murder because Lorna's body was left to decompose for ten months in her isolated cabin house. They talk for a while about the strange circumstances surrounding her daughter's death until Janice tells Kinsey about a pornographic video that was sent to her house after Lorna's death. This tape leads Kinsey on a wild goose chase of suspects in the red light district and gets her nowhere when it comes to turning over the real murderer.   	Millhone dives even further and searches through the world of Lorna's day job where she uncovers a mysterious lead about an expensive, elaborate project which is angering several people a considerable amount. Kinsey also checks up on Lorna's family members, and with the exception of Janice, all seem to have a motive to murder her Lorna.  	 Not being a fan of these types of novels, I decided to at least give it a chance but this story got me nowhere. By the middle of the novel I wanted to give up and skip to the end of the story, but when I got to the end I had to go back to the middle to figure out how everything ended. I stopped caring about the whole murder after so much more emphasis was placed on so much side stories and it seemed like Grafton did too. The ending left me with a strange feeling and I didn't know if the book had actually ended. All in all, it was just not the right kind of book for me but if you're a murder mystery fan, try any other of Grafton's alphabet themed novels besides this one 
 What a piece of liberal trash!  My five year old found it useful to press flowers 
 I'm glad someone knows enough about English History to recognize the pure fiction of this film.  But in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy, I also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of Mary Tudor.  Over-zealous and fanatic (as was a common religious stance in those times - promoted by both sides of the Protestant/Catholic conflict), she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes.  And throughout the film, there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth - no objectivity whatsoever.  I was sorely disappointed!  If you want to get to know Elizabeth and the period in which she lived, I would recommend the superb BBC series, Elizabeth R with Glenda Jackson.  And if you want even further background, look to the BBC again in the Six Wives of Henry VIII with Keith Mitchell.  Tidbits can be gained as well from the movie Mary, Queen of Scots (although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it - for example, Mary Stuart and Elizabeth never met, although it was Mary's great desire) and even another title, Anne of the Thousand Days.  Those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times.  This film just doesn't cut it 
 I happen to be a voracious reader and especially like books with an air of history about them.   I was very keen on reading this book, I liked its reviews and liked its name - found it quite intriguing. But reading it, was quite unlike my expectations. I found it utterly dry and uninteresting. The book seemed drier than the deserts it talks about. I did manage to finish it, though.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 The setup instructions for this product are totally inadequate as is the online troubleshooting help. With phone support, I was able to get the product working, but after a few days the H1000 lost communication with the extender. After two hours of undocumented procedures with technical support, it was working again. After two more days the problem reoccured. The fix seems to be to reload the firmware and software in both the remote and the wireless extender. If it fails again and it is too late to get a refund, I will throw it in the trash and go back to IR communication on my H1000.  
 Sloppy writing, worse mindfulness.  What has this guy done?  All he does is critize everyone else for their efforts.  How well could he do?    The system is corrupt.  Good people will surely fail in such a system.  Why blame the people.  Follow the money stupid.    The book does not go to the heart of the matter.  If Democrats and Greens start listening to this guy they will all end up chasing their tails.    Frank's work outside this book is more of the same.  Tearing down people for not being successful enough, then suspecting their motives for it without any evidence, only hearsay and lack of success.    I'm tired of rants and complainers.  Let's see you do better, Frank.  
 There must be some movie buffs out there who like this film for whatever reason, like it enough that this movie has been classified as a "cult classic" of sorts. Obviously this is a candidate for inclusion in the Criterion Collection, they have a cross selection of everything from the works of Bergman, Antonioni, Fellini, Godard to the bottom pit of hell with Michael Bay's The Rock and oh dear god, Armageddon! The Man Who Fell to Earth is therefore prime Criterion fare, but is the film itself any good?  Nicolas Roeg is truly a pale imitation of a director. Has he ever made a satisfying film that was not deeply flawed? This David Bowie vehicle is no different with it's oh so 70's mileau. I especially love how time changes throughout the film, you see characters getting older except Bowie who is an alien. Decades pass and the characters age but we are still in the 1970's! Awesome, really!  It goes without saying that this film is another of Roeg's many exercises or rather fixations on the concept of alienation and modern malaise, capitalism, consumerist spending, etc. That these ideas are packaged so blatantly, ( the movie about alienation with an alien! ), and ineptly is shocking to connoisseurs of fine art cinema. If you want to watch great films about the concept of alienation in the modern world, there is no better director than Michaelangelo Antonioni with L'avventura, La Notte and L'eclisse for starters. Nicolas Roeg by compasion is painfully incompetent.  The best part of this film is it's sense of humor, it can be funny in a tacky, empty sort of way. Plus we get lots of nudity and sex, so that's fun, supposedly. Directors by the 1970's were over the whole censorship of the preceding decades and had as much nudity and sex in their art-house movies as possible, because lots of sex and nudity equals profound insight into the human condition! Right? Ugh...   The DVD is high-quality Criterion Collection work, but the quality of the movie is your call. I find it to be utter junk but worth a look, you may have a different opinion after this pretentious mess robs you of 2 hours and 20 minutes of your life. Nicolas Roeg is a fraud, we have to face up to it 
 Like almost everything else from Noontide press, this book is pro-Nazi propaganda, anti-semitic drivel. Unless you're a member of Aryan Nation or Combat 18, this and all their other volumes should be avoided like the intellectual plague that they are 
 I read this book while spending a few weeks in Shanghai recently, and it was torture to wade through Dong's turgid, overblown writing. What is most disappointing is that this could have been an absolutely fascinating book, but in Dong's inept hands, the history of Shanghai is rendered dull and academic. A truly dreadful book 
 I find this book good as a quick reference but not for best in design for logos. It has mix of very great to low ends. I would hope that they would do more screening of the quality of the logos 
 I remember reading "The Chamber" distinctly. Somehow, this book doesnt even near that standard. The story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns. The characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out 
 I have no idea what the folks who highly rated this book were reading/thinking. This is not a good book about the 1906 SF earthquake. All over the map with useless info, particularly the post-earthquake SF government graft trials. This last info was pointless, long, boring and was never tied in by the author to either the 1906 earthquake or the direction of SF government since then. Stilted writing. Not an enjoyable read 
 I too was misled by these reviews, and I too am puzzled by the apparently sincere expressions of enthusiasm for this movie.    Maybe you have to be Italian or Lithuanian, but I watch a lot of real Italian movies (the ones with subtitles), and they are not like this.    I think that Dreyfus's character was inconsistent.  He acted like a sleaze, and then he acted like a great guy, totally sincere, etc.  Then he acted like a sleaze, flattering people, snowing them with gifts, etc.  I simply think the screenwriter was trying for something he couldn't bring off.    Similarly with the movie as a whole.  This is not simply a feel-good family, although obviously the screenwriter was trying to paint such a family.  There needed to be more interaction than the stereotyped hugs and such.  Something was missing.    Also, the story went nowhere.  There was no plot, and very little story, and it lasted a long, long time.  And the movie had nothing else to offer a viewer.    I would say, be very, very careful before buying this movie.  I don't think it was overlooked.  I think it was looked at and turned down. 
 Book lacks detail, and content. Book is misleading and is simple over priced toilet pape 
 A lot of the people reviewing this album, both on Amazon and elsewhere, don't realize the deceit behind this release. Warp Records and Prefuse 73 try to pass it off as a "new album", but quite a few of the tracks have been previously released. Many of them are remixes Prefuse has done for other artists, simply re-appearing here as "collaborations" with new titles, but are actually completely re-hashed. (He did this at least once on his previous album too). Other tracks here marked as "featuring" someone (such as The Books) are actually just Prefuse raiding the artists' back catalog and sampling it, clearly without any input from the original artist.  To top it off, this album as a whole just isn't that great, and certainly not up to the standard's of Prefuse's previous albums. He tries to cram too many ideas into one song, and it sounds watered down, as if he's on "auto pilot" mode. If you want original, sincere, or challenging music, look elsewhere 
 This is just a romance novel with a moral 
 This book is falsified and exaggerated.  The press attempted to frighten the public at the time this was published.  The Voodoo's also were trying to scare "outsiders" who criticized them away with wild, false stories.  Don't believe everything you read in this book.  It's a hoax 
 When I first wrote a review for this movie I will confess that I was angry that it did not have any demons or evil monsters from hell, but upon further review I must take back my previous opinion, and say that though Doom the movie does not carry the spirit of doom into it it is still a pretty good movie. I believe that if the movie had been more original then I would have liked it (except for the first person part of the movie wich is why the rating is not higher aside from not being original). Overall as much as I hate to admit it this is a pretty good movie and worth watching (yes this is leaving a bad taste in my mouth) so go ahead and watch it it is by no standard the best video game based movie ever but decent overall.                                SORRY ABOUT MY FIRST REVIEW 
 My daughter received this as a gift when she turned five. Do not buy this game unless you are willing to spend an hour putting it together and figuring out how to play it. And while you're doing that, your child(ren) will be whining about it taking so long. I was doing okay until it came time to put the two stickers on the spinning wheel. The directions for this part were incredibly confusing, and the directions for how to play the game were about the same. I also couldn't believe that I had to put stickers on the die (first time for everything!). That said, once we FINALLY figured it all out, my daughter loves it. I think it's the "secret" aspect of the game she enjoys -- pick three things out of the box without peeking and look for your match to your princess w/o showing anyone else the card to win the game. Still, I had to rate this 2 stars for the poor construction of the game 
 Don't waste your money on this book. As I am about to type up a review for this book I notice an earlier comment written by David Paige which sum up my view in a more nicely put way.  I bought this book because I wish to learn about VALUE INVESTING IN REAL ESTATE as the title suggested. NOT to listen to one man personal rant and rave on how great investment in real estate is vs stocks. There are 268 pages excl footnotes etc.. and the first 100 pages is simply about property is good and stock is evil.  And is plain stupid to imply Buffet is more successful investors than Soros given that these are two great investors in their own right. Quoting the author "Buffet's net worth trumps that of soros at least 10 fold.... (page 36, 5 lines). I can easily twist this round by saying Soros has a track record of 28.6% compounded annual rate of return (1969-2002) vs Buffet's "only" 23.5% (1956-2002). It is meaningless, I die happy if my investment skill is fraction of what both these men has achieve.  At the beginning of this email, I suggested you not to waste your hard earn $$ on this book and I stand by my words. Please drop me an email and I will be happy to give you my copy for free. My email is pakawat2003@yahoo.co.uk (be prepare to include SAE, I live in Taiwan 
 Judging by the pathetic mess George W. Bush has made of the USA and  Iraq during the last five years, the masses of people he's killed through his phony wars, and the negative feelings he's engendered in so many countries around the world, one has to wonder WHAT exactly IS his "faith"?  Surely it isn't Christianity...anyone with half a brain who knows anything about Jesus' message (non-violence and tolerance, for those without a clue) can see that Bush has violated nearly every tenet of Christianity during his life and especially during his "presidency".    What IS Bush's "faith" exactly?  It's his faith in his own self-righteousness...faith in his corporate buddies to bail him out of any hole he digs for himself...faith in the ignorance of so many so-called "Christian" folk to support his ignorant, misguided leadership.  That's what Bush's "faith" is.  It sure ain't in the actions and teachings of Jesus Christ. 
 I am reviewing this book from the standpoint of military history.  With that in mind, I rate this book as a two.  While it is written in a style conducive to imparting informaton to newcomers to the field, it unfortunately concentrates far too much emphasis on the wrong areas.  I'm speaking specifically of the Second World War chapter; Canada played a vital role in three major operations in NW Europe - Normandy, the Scheldt and the Rhineland.  Normandy is mentioned in passing and the latter two are not mentioned at all.    The focus of the chapter is on Dieppe - two entire pages.  While Dieppe is of course a focus of national attention, it was not the only chapter in military history and the book is very misleading by suggesting that it was.  Canada had five divisions in the field by 1944, fighting for 22 months in Italy and 11 months in NW Europe.  Why a 9 hour battle would get two pages and some 33 months of fighting get only a brief paragraph describing the casualty rates in Italy is beyond comprehension.  A page is also devoted to Conscription - and the information presented is accurate and again, well written - but again highlights failed policy rather than successful military operations.  Another two pages are devoted to the Internment camps and the Holocaust.  Important subjects, but again done at the expense of our positive military achievements.  The Battle of Normandy destroyed the German Army in France beyond recovery.  The Battle of the Scheldt cleared the waterways to Antwerp and allowed desperately needed supplies onto the continent at a location much closer to the front (the Allies were using more gasoline trucking supplies from the Normandy beachhead than the gasoline they were using for fighting).  The Battle of the Rhineland paved the way for the final crossing of the last major obstacle to a general Allied advance into Germany itself.  These were dramatic battles in which Canadians paid a grave cost and yet acquitted itself very well.  None of this is mentioned in the book, and those truly ignorant of history - the people this book is aimed at - would have no clue what the Canadian military achieved and instead walk away with the understanding that Canada's WW II effort was largely a litany of failed political decisions, interspersed with the occasional massacre of our own men.  Disappointing, especially since other areas are covered in better detail by the same author.  Perhaps the fault lies with the editor, but either way, I recommend caution in purchasing this book, especially if interested in military history 
 "Modern" usually sounds like some outdated mid-80s new wave album by the Cars, Flock of Seagulls, or somesuch.  It is not a punk record, mostly midtempo pop.  The three songs Diggle wrote and sings on are  basically awful; Shelley's are considerably better - the usual wry lyrics  and great hooks.  I would say about 3 or 4 of the tunes are topnotch  Buzzcocks stuff; newbies should buy "Operator's Manual" or  "Going Steady."  Or dig up the amazing "Different Kind of  Tension" from a used record store somewhere!  Also, see them live if  you have a chance 
 If I was asked to give you a plot synopsis of this gorgeous film I would be hard pressed to say that OSCAR AND LUCINDA is about  anything for sure.This is positively the singlemost butchered screenplay I have ever sat through.Laura Jones has adapted Peter Carey's novel and Gillian Armstrong has turned out "something" that is so chopped up and nonsensical that, apart from from the very quick shots of New South Wales and a magnificent soundtrack by Thomas Newman,  I had to keep pausing the film to say,"WHAT???!!!" This film is about everything and it is about nothing;it is about obsession and compulsion;it is about different religions;it is about chance and faith;it is about a father and son;it is about how a grandson came to be.........but it certainly IS NOT about two connected characters named Oscar and Lucinda.Each scene of this film is SO short and abrupt that the viewer never has any time to identify/sympathize/empathize with ANY of these extremely disconnected people and events.There are SO many plots and subplots and themes and subthemes and non essential material and characters that it is positively laughable and annoying to see such squander of good source material in the wrong ,uncapable and un-understanding hands.It seems that trying to tell any of the heart and soul that is revealed in Peter Carey's novel in slightly more than two hours proved to be too much for those involved in this endeavour.What a shock to see the immense talents of A -list actors such as Ralph Fiennes,Cate Blanchett,Ciaran Hinds and Tom Wilkinson literally wasted in 20 second scenes!Even the breathtaking land of the Australian outback is shown for five seconds at the most.AND THE ENDING!!!!!.....what in Heaven's name was that???Either most of this film is still on the cutting room floor( edited by the noferious Nicholas Beauman of LITTLE WOMEN,COUNTRY LIFE,COSI) or Laura Jones and Gillian Armstrong just simply could not find any center and focus for this beautifully filmed "butchered" mess of a movie.2*'s because the Thomas Newman soundtrack is so lovely,but nay a farthing more!! 
 Having an advanced degree in Sociology and also having personal relationships with members of Old Order Groups does not make me an unbiased reviewer of this work. As it stands, I believe it takes a very conservative and functional perspective on the dynamic groups of these people and does not even begin to address the integration of change and conflict within these groups in anything ut a very superficial way. A shame, as I was hoping for a more dynamic read than a functionalist perspective of very diverse and dynamic subgroups.  As it stands, I found the work not truly willing or able to explore deviance, social control, conflict or the realism of the daily lives of these peoples as they struggle with their religious lifestyle and the world around them. As stated, it was a descriptive work from a functionalist perspective. Too bad as the subject and persons are far more interesting than the authors would have left one to believe, especially when living among those people in communities and thier true impact on the larger secular society around them as I have seen 
 I WANT THE TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK! After all the talk about what a cult classic this film is! What a waste of time! Maybe this movie was a novelty to American moviegoers in 1973. That time is past (even then, the "robots attack people" concept was hardly new). Now this is just a boring B movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action. This film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes. Unless you are doing a research paper on American Sci-fi cinema, or you are in your 40s and enjoyed this movie as a kid, or you just like boring anticlimactic B movies, AVOID THIS DULL PIECE OF DRIVEL. I FEEL CHEATED!     
 Spoilers ahead: I am not hard to please when it comes to horror movies, and totally enjoy a good B flick. But I have to say that this one was just terrible. There's really no plot and even though you expect the charaters to do some silly stuff like go into creepy houses or whatever, I just couldn't believe how stupid the main character really was!! How do you continue to hang out at that rest stop when the guy keeps coming back to mess with you? I mean come on!!! Breaking into the rangers office on site, no less, and getting drunk...all the while waiting for the phycho to come back and have another go at her? Then missing every possible opportunity to kill the psycho. Was no one else shouting at the screen "Grab the cop's gun and shoot the psycho!" as they watched him stroll by them to tow his motorbike.  And running infront of the truck, in the headlights... There was forest all around her and she never once went and hid, just hung out inside that disgusting bathroom. A sitting duck that deserved to be put out of it's misery in my opinion. No, it was simply unbelievable and I was relieved when the credits rolled. So glad I didn't actually pay the rental fee on this one 
 These are some of the most uncreative and blatantly stupid jokes I've ever heard. He has a crude gimmick and his delivery is flaccid and reminiscent of Pauly Shore, only it's somehow worse. I'm absolutely astonished that anyone could derive any sort of joy from this guy's act. I'm convinced the audience on this CD was either intensely drugged or completely edited in. Even Dane Cook can be funny at times but Mitch Fatel is reprehensibly bad 
 On this one, the lyrics take a darker, more cynical tone, ("Do you really think/that love is gonna save the world?" from "Do you Believe?" is just one example) and the music adds quite a bit of electronic elements, even dabbling at times in trip-hop. In and of itself, growth and change is what keeps a band from stagnating, and generally I'm in favour of a band shifting from its strengths and struggling to find new ones.  One thing that's non-negotiable in the search for new sounds, though, is strong hooks. The real problem with this album is there aren't enough "Wow!" moments: those songs that grab you and make you sing along.   FIRST BAND ON THE MOON had "Lovefool" and "Been It" along with their cover of "Iron Man" and "Never Recover", all of which became stuck in your head with enough play. That just isn't happening for me with this one for the most part.  HIGHLIGHTS: "My Favourite Game" is the only immediate grabber here and a fairly gritty number for the Cardies. "Erase/Rewind" grafts a drum rhythm reminiscent of Queen's "Another One Bites the Dust" onto a shimmering keyboard part. "Starter" is a midtempo trip-hop number about reinventing yourself. ("Turning the pages/I used to hang on to/I was young and I have changed my mind/and I'm leavin' everything behind")   LOWS: "Nil" is a limp instrumental coda to the CD.   BOTTOM LINE: If you loved the bubbly pop of "First Band on the Moon", you'll be disappointed in this. Even taken on its own trip-hop terms, I can't really say it compares favourably with Portishead and the like. Color me unimpressed 
 If you want to watch a bunch of the Undertakers best matches then this is a good DVD.  If you want to learn anything of the history of the Undertaker, either the man or the character you won't get any of that here.  This is bascially a bunch of matches with a little voice over in between, similar to the Ric Flair DVD (but without the great promos as Taker isn't exactly one of wrestlings great speakers, nor is Paul Bearer for that mater lol).  This DVD has no vignette with interviews with the wrestler or history of the character from McMahon and company whatsover (unlike the Bret Hart, Hogan and Warrior DVD's).  Furthermore the cover art is horrible and all of the discs are all stuffed into one side of the box (as opposed to it opening up to several DVD flaps with picture art (e.g. Flair and Hart DVD's).  If you are a wrestling purist then it is okay, else wait for the inevitable second 5 or 6 disc DVD WWE will release when he retires in a year or two.  
 This book was, without question, the worst math oriented book I have had the mispleasure of buying or reading. As mention in other reviews, the calculations are often off leading a reader who is reading for the purpose of developing concepts to waste substantial amounts of time. Since time is, among other things, money, this book is way to expensive, even if you were given your copy of it 
 The screen version of the book is nothing like the book in any manner, except for the characters and the plot. The movie lacks that serious business and glamorous edge that the book brings out. The movie summarises the story and shreds it almost to pieces. The movie rushes through the story in mock-comedy fashion as if the whole shinding was an episode of a comedy series. The book is about the power, greed, bravado and glory that emanated from Wall Street in the roaring '80s and shook the entire financial and business world in that era - globally. The movie misses that point by light years. It's a childish and vindictive parody of a great story. It's also pretends to be a "Dummy's guide to LBO's in the 1980's" when characters explain the salient points of LBO's. I hope another director/producer team will give this another bash and bring to the screen a real powerful and moving story based on this book 
 Perhaps I just misunderstood.  But this book just wasn't what I thought it was.  I was really excited when I ordered this book.  I just couldn't wait to get my hands on it.  I wanted to see how things were done, what materials I'd have to buy (and hopefully where I could find them) and generally find out how to make this magic happend...  But no such luck.  I actually don't quite understand this book - and it really doesn't contain any text to misunderstand.  It does contain a lot of nice pictures (and I mean a lot), even though some of the ideas displayed should perhaps rather have been made of plastic and varnish, glue and gypsum for people out of this world (really, some of the things displayed are really really ugly!).  Some of the ideas don't have anything to do with anything real.  These are glossy patios suitable for I don't know whom.  But perhaps that really doesn't matter - at least if the book is just intended to be a good idea bank for different groups of people.  But I found no warning signs on Amazon.  I don't like to slaughter things, but then again I never review things as I'm doing now without having a very strong point in either direction, i.e. positive or negative...  Sadly, this book had a negative impact on me, period!  You make the math:  The book has no functionality (other than ideas) for the DIY person. The book is in fact just a big "Ikea brochure" - a lot of pictures, but little or no text. Which brings me to the last point:  The little text that actually is to be found is often wrong (typical copy-and-paste (or find-and-replace) Word failures) like "Courtesy of Courtesy of Action Concrete Services".  For any serious publisher, one failure as this one should have been enough, but this particular blunder can be found evenly distributed over the entire book!  Sorry, I just can't live with that, especially since the book is in fact nothing else than what Google would have given me with a few keystrokes.  So:  If you don't have Google, buy this book!  That's my advice.  Or, if you do have Google but want a glossy paper book with a lot of pictures in it, you might still want to buy it.  Just don't expect any help with anything other than how to contact a contractor 
 There are three significant problems with this book. "Made in Detroit," is poorly written. Clemens thinks, "went over like a led balloon," is a fine simile. It is not. But Clemens begs his readers to compare him to Baldwin, Hemmingway, and others, a desperate attempt for sophistication he is unlikely to ever gain. (2) Clemens' book is racist and anti-working class to the core. Clemens clearly adopted his fathers' hatred of unions, and formed his own uncritical take on racism, expecting readers to chuckle at his portrayal of African Americans as "moolies." (3) Clemens knows nearly nothing important about Detroit. He views the city through an inverted telescope, each lens juncture narrowing his already myopic view; racism, sexism, the meanest forms of conservative Catholicism, his unexamined views of exploitation and resistance, all merge to give him a key-hole view of, not the city, but himself, his trifling family relationships, and his trembling edicts about his wife-who, I know from experience, is all aflutter about his critics. There are good books about Detroit, like "Whose Detroit?" or "American Odyssey" by Conot (openly fictional, unlike Clemens' piece), or Ewens, "Corporate Power and Urban Crisis," or Mirel's "Rise and Fall of an Urban School System." Clemens work is, flatly, too small-minded to be taken seriously. Only the fact that racism sells could lead local reviewers, and the publisher, to push this book. For those who seek my longer review of Clemens book, google "Michigan Citizen , Made In Detroit." I am the San Diego State prof critiqued in a review below. 
 ABC-CLIO STEALS FROM THEIR AUTHORS, PAYS THEM NOTHING, AND ROBS THEM BLIND. DO NOT PURCHASE BOOKS FROM THEM OR FROM THEIR SUBSIDIARIES. BOYCOTT THESE THIEVES!! 
 This one is just plain awful!!   It's a bunch of Hollywood brats being histrionic.  
 This book is appalling. It is disempowering to women, providing false and very negative information about out of hospital births (with no reference to back it up), and generally gives a "don't worry your pretty little head and do what the doctor tells you" attitude--even if what the doctor tells you will endanger you and your baby.   In spite of what this book says, there are things you can do to minimize tearing (and episiotomies don't heal better than tears, in spite of what the book says), things you can do to improve your chances of a healthy baby without a cesarean or other medical interventions, and so on. Of course there are times these things are needed, but not nearly so often as the book suggests, and it's not nearly so random. It continually cites opinions as facts, without any evidence base.  There are much, much better books out there than this one. Don't subject yourself to the needless anxiety of this book 
 I listened to the audio version of this book. While most of the things said in this book may be true, it appears a bit biased. In addition to facts, the author uses some adjectives which show her personal dislike of the famous couple.  In the end, I had an impression that this book grew out of author's frustration upon Mark Rich pardon. Many chapters are dedicated to that case.  A disproportionately large portion of the book is devoted to two topics: pardon and donations. At one point the audio book spends a large amount of time only listing names of who donated what item. It goes on and on and on with names that make no sense and contribute nothing much to the story. That could have been moved to the appendix to keep the flow going.  I was hoping to find details about mischievious behavior by Clinton staff during the last days. There was no mention of that 
 THOUGHT THIS WOULD WORK,SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.A PEN LIGHT WOULD DO THE SAME THING.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,OR YOU WILL LOOK AS SILLY AS ME.I RETURNED THE PIECE OF JUN 
 What a disappointment this film was for me!  Let me say first that I have a terrific fondness for good martial arts films, and many of the Hong Kong films of the genre, while certainly showing and revelling in elements that are cheesy, yet succeed in being extremely entertaining. But this...!  I think it's fairly well understood that the Hong Kong martial arts film genre deliberately utilises many American westerns. It's not exactly unusual to see a tumbleweed go rolling across a deserted plain or through a deserted Chinese village, however silly that may seem. But in the case of this film, it went too far. My willingness to suspend disbelief and criticism came to a crashing halt. It began, I'm afraid, with the very opening scene. As soon as I heard the Chinesified western theme (borrowing heavily from the well-known musical theme that you'll recognise the instant you hear it), I flinched and said, "Oh Lord, please let it improve."  The film's score is just a mishmash of inappropriate melodies and songs. Featuring far too heavily are those frankly appalling songs sung with sugary sweetness by Chinese popstars who moo their way through lyrics of awful saccharine fake emotion. Chinese lyrics and poetry can be so delicate and powerful (exciting our admiration especially when they use miniature to create a sense of space), but the flip side is that they can also be horribly vulgar and overly sentimental. This film showed the flip side.  The story is predictable: displaced prince (Brother Yen) wants to regain his throne after travelling like a nomad through the land for years. His faithful follower, a beautiful Chinese girl, turns out to be hired by his evil brother (who usurped the throne), but switches sides yet again (after failing to kill the prince's betrothed) to fight for the prince in the final showdown. A young fisherman named Fei, with fabulous martial arts skills, defends the prince's party in a surprise ambush, and consequently bonds with the prince, falls in love with the prince's betrothed when he's sent to fetch her, and plays artlessly with a large dolphin called Wei. (There's a truly awful song at this point, by the way - it tries to be a lovely innocent "love the environment" song, but oh dear... oh no... it's one of those moments where one cringes and fast-forwards through the embarrassing music.)  Fei hides the prince's party in an underground tomb accessible only by a path which he knows (but that doesn't stop the evil usurper from finding it without difficulty) and also by sea. The final show-down reveals that: a) an evil usurper can generally fight off as many attackers as need be; b) rightful emperors (aka the prince) can be defeated by said pole-bearing evil usurper without difficulty; c) the girl who doesn't get the guy (aka the girl who joined the prince's forces in order to betray him but ended by loving him, even though his emotions were centred upon the daughter of his old friend General NanNing (I think that's the name)) is sure to be killed by the evil usurper, and to murmur, "Even though I could not live for you, I am happy to die for you, my prince"; d) the general's daughter is of course torn between the prince and Fei, loving both of them, and of course she dies; and e) (this one's the killer) it takes a dolphin to kill an evil usurper. Yes, indeed - I joke not. The finale includes Wei surging through the river that leads to the cave in which the underground tomb is built, LEAPING out of the water to whack the evil usurper in mid-attack, and pulling down the entire tomb structure to kill everyone except Fei who finishes the film by looking at the flower-covered ground below which is the tomb, and making a philosophical comment that harks back to an earlier moment in the film.  The film's not all bad. The actors all look fine, and the swordplay is neither better nor worse than most of these types of film. I did become exasperated with some aspects of the fighting, because too much of it was dancing around attacking each other's weapons rather than each other - a big no-no in martial arts. "Have at you, you foul sword of my enemy! Let me beat you, o most hideous polearm of my foe!"... There's a good idea for a spoof there.  The story is, again, neither better nor worse than many another film of this genre - except for the laughable ending.  The cinematography is only adequate, not wonderful. It certainly isn't a patch on some of the magnificent films in this style which have emerged just recently.  The insistence on having the terrible enemy be undefeatable is a peculiarity one often meets with in Chinese films of this sort. I confess I have never become accustomed to it. Why is the hero not able to defeat his evil foe? They are both mortal. They're both skilled. It's clearly a cultural element that is difficult for non-Chinese to understand.  But by far - BY FAR - the worst thing about this film is the soundtrack.  Comparing this film favourably to "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", "The Emperor and the Assassin", "House of Shining Daggers" and "Hero" is unbelievable. The aforesaid films are not just nice-looking - they're gorgeous. The cinematography is superb. In most cases, the plots are good (in the case of "Crouching Tiger", the plot is superb and intricate). In each case for the films I've mentioned, the acting is magnificent and the fight scenes beautifully done. I'm afraid "Moon Warriors" will disappoint those who expect the same standard.  Recommended only for those who want to collect every film in this genre 
 I put one star because it's the minimum, if not, I would've gave it zero stars. This CD can be reviewed in so few words... here are some: NO!!! Don't Bad Stay Away from it I told you, NO!!!  In short, no music from the movie is here, and the music that is here... well, it might as well not be here, and it would it be better that way.   Summary: NO!!! don't get this CD, use the money in something else, get a hamburger or somethin 
 Dull and inane come to mind. Consists mostly of Peabody's artificially "catty" - sometimes racist - first-person remarks about everyone she meets (even the cat), fuzzy descriptions of Egyptian "archaeology" (...). The plot is slow moving, cliché and peopled with characters that come across as cardboard cutouts. I found more of pennance than pleasure in this read. Avoid it 
 Lookslike it would be a nice product, but it's only for very small babies up to 12 pounds and 23 inches. My baby is very long and just doesn't fit - wish Target/Amazon would have been more upfront with the sizing 
    "bell hooks" may very well be insane.    Rather than take responsibility for her own ludicrous actions and assertions, Ms. Hooks continually reasserts her position that none-none!-of her cruel and immoral actions are her own fault because of the ridiculous misfortune she had by being born dark-skinned and female.    I am an academic, I admit, but I live in the real world, and I know that the vast majority of Americans are simply attempting to carve out lives as best they can.  We work, we sleep, we pray.  Sometimes we fall in love.  Sometimes we read, and I deeply regret the thought of Ms. Hook's racist immorality falling into the hands of already volatile citizens.  When our country can no longer rise up and denounce racism (which Ms. Hooks claims to do, though of course, only perpetuates the problem), when we do not thoroughly reject those who advocate violence, theft, and irresponsibility, we are indeed in a sad and terrifying state.    The great civil rights leaders of the 1960's insisted upon non-violence.  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. built an entire system of social reform upon the concept of peaceful resistance.  I know, grade-school regurgitation, but Ms. Hooks could stand to review (or, dare I say, read for the first time) her Dr. King.  "Letter from a Birmingham Jail" carefully outlines the fact that civil rights are in adherence with Divine Law, and that there is a just, holy, and perfect law which all humans must obey.    How can the racist rants-the "Killing Rage-of Bell Hooks possibly compare to the heights of Dr. King's moral reasoning?  The Civil Rights movement was a humble, firm request that the United States government obey natural law.  What does Ms. Hooks have to offer?  Anger.  Hatred.  Accusation.    In "Letter from a Birmingham Jail," Dr. King is careful to say that should the Civil Rights movement forget its Christian roots (he warns, particularly, about conversion to Islam), it will fail in its endeavors.  What have civil rights been since our society has, in great chunks, disregarded God?  Violence, the death of innocents, lies, double standards, the welfare state, fatherless children, the rise of drugs and gangs.    Ms. Hooks, before you and your kind crept into our university systems (which, of course, we touchingly remember are the bourgeois institutions busily funding your lush lifestyle), black children were raised by two parents, in relatively safe neighborhoods.  They were taught to love God and country, and to do, as Dr. King and all moral leaders have done, what is right.    You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Ms. Hooks, for presenting your message as helpful.  You are not helping.  You are a woman obsessed; you are resentful; you have no peace.  How could anyone possibly want to live as you so claim?  Do you desire discord?  Are you so hardened to your own heart?  Are you so evil?    I urge all who are concerned with issues of race to consider Dr. King (immoral though he was, in many sad ways), to urge one another to live righteously, and leave the garbage Ms. Hooks spreads on the curb, where the bourgeois-funded trash collectors will, if we're lucky, cart it away 
 Rabbi Michael Lerner wants to develop a leftist response to the Religious Right. Unfortunately he throws out the baby and _keeps_ the bathwater: retaining a vague veneer of "spirituality," he rejects the  political and economic theories that are in fact the Right's real strength.  Proclaiming himself "agnostic about capitalism," he nevertheless  proceeds to disagree with capitalism point by point, denouncing the  "selfishness" and "materialism" of modern America and  decrying the power of the "market" to impose values on its  apparently passive victims (shades of Vance Packard!).  Our real problem, he  asserts upon astoundingly little evidence, is that we are  "systematically misrecognized" by our families, friends and  peers; what we need, he says, is a "politics of meaning" that  seeks to rebuild community and change the "bottom line" of our  culture.  It is unfortunate that he did not feel compelled to study  capitalist theory before rejecting it in toto; otherwise, he might have  learned that the "market" is precisely a vast network of human  beings cooperating in the production of values and that most of the  "problems" he cites stem directly from the increasing power of  the federal government. But his characterizations of "capitalist  theory" suggest that he consulted no higher authority than John  Kenneth Galbraith.  If this is the best the Left can do, then the Left is  intellectually bankrupt. Anyone interested in "the politics of  meaning" should skip Rabbi Lerner's book and instead study the  _meaning of politics_, beginning with the Austrian School economists --  Ludwig von Mises, Murray Rothbard, et alia. And maybe a little Ayn Rand  too 
 I loved The Secret Life of Bees but I found this book to be formulaic and uninteresting.  Its difficult to like any of the characters, especially  the main character, and much of the scenes with the monk are sexually gratuitous. It has as much deapth as a Harlequin romance novel.  The relationship between her and the mother was a bit more dimensional but only slightly.  All in all, a poor follow-up to Sue Monk Kidd's break out bestseller.  Don't waste your time.  
 people this is easy listening at it's easiest. Every song is and will be a candidate for adult contemperary rotation in 2 years, that is if it isn't allready. I don't know anything about what they have done in the past, except for a song I remember being played on the radio a few years ago. Must have been on the album prior to this. But that song sounds just like two tracks on this one. Not only that but if there wasn't a pause in between these mini mediocre fests I couldn't really tell any of them apart. Horrible music with no feeling or soul, not even creative. don't waste your time with this. 
 Does not compare with Motorola.  The range was poor.  Interestingly, when I pressed the call button, that was transmitted but the recipient couldn't pick up my voice and vice versa.  If they work for you, then you have a good deal.  But not for me.  
 I think the only strong points of "The Phantom Menace" is Darth Maul and the lightsaber duals, which I thought were well done, and the visual effects and scenery.  But other than that, "The Phantom Menace" was just an unfortunate mistake.    I think the problem is that Lucas broke one of the unofficial science fiction filmmaking rules: You've-got-to-keep-children-out-of-science fiction-stories.  Or at least show them as little as possible.  How can we take a space dogfight scene seriously when you have a little kid who doesn't know how to pilot a fighter, buzzing all around the battle and saying things like "this is intense?"  I never understood why they felt they had to go that far back into Anakin's life anyway.  Why not just begin the story with Anakin in his twenties and already under the tutelage of Obi-wan?  That's when all the important events began.  And Jar Jar, well, we know the consensus on him.  Well, at least things got more serious again in "Attack of the Clones," and would continue to improve with "Revenge of the Sith. 
 I bought this book in the hope that it could help a pet Bernese puppy buyer with good information.  When reading this book, I felt as if the writer just 'filled in the blanks' of some generic puppy buyer information. This book did not deliver anything I'd hoped for. I consider this book to be a waste of my money and time investment.  I feel there is a much better pet puppy buyer book on the market by Julia Crawford (a longtime Bernese breeder and prior BMDCA President) and the cost is about the same. This better book is called "Bernese Mountain Dog: An Owners Guide to a Happy, Healthy Pet".   I was very disappointed in this book by Amy Christensen. And I hope she'll try again and do a better job next time 
 When I received the punching nun and removed her from the package, her halibut fell off, the glue holding her black cape on didn't hold either.   I wouldn't buy another product through this company if this is the type of merchandise they are shipping.  Save your money and go to your local mall novelty store and pick one up.    
 Frustrated authors take note, you can be published and you don't even have to worry about little details such as punctuation, sentence clarity, story, structure or grammar. Cormac McCarthy proves it eloquently with "All the Pretty Horses." Had McCarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story, however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher, who was either drunk or high or both, who thought "What the hell, let's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it. I'm sure people will buy it, after all Americans don't care about grammar anyway."  I'm not going to dive into the plot of the story- you can read it above. This book falls short of one of the best in literature. How they compare this guy to Faulkner is beyond me, the comparrison is an insult to Faulkner and people who read books in general. Most fifth graders can write better, more enthralling naratives.  
 I just finished a read through of the entire Dirk Pitt series, and overall I'd say that as the series went on, it did not improve.  Now, I don't think that anyone expects great literature, but the author seemed to get caught up in the trap or escalating danger rather than variations of situations to approach.  And as the series progressed, more errors crept in.  Perhaps Cussler's reputation made his editors think that they no longer had  to edit his manuscripts, I don't know.  In this book, obviously the hurricane path issues are obvious.  Another item, for those who have read the whole series, is that Lauren Smith's father who's death was cronicled in Vixen 03 was resurrected to come to the wedding.  Oh, and although it might be cute, the ever increasing roles that Cussler wrote himself into got to feel just silly.  Overall, I can't say that I'd recommend this unless someone had read the rest of the books and just wanted to get the series over and done with.  Read the first couple novels in the series instead 
 After reading through several books on this subject, one can only begin to wonder even more on this subject: should another tree have to be cut down and be used to put on a dusty bookshelf somewhere for this kind of trash to be put into print?This is another example of some egomaniac searching for their 15 minutes of fame and glory. After her supposed extensive travels, this is what she could 'conjure up"? If my lifes' work was based on this and this alone, I would surely leave this world not in a better shape than when I came, but to have totally mislead many people into the dark abyss of hell. It is easy to pray on people fears and doubts and to then take advantage of this for the sake of self. It comes to mind that all that is unknown and unseen is the easiest possible manor in which to play on peoples emotions and thus destroy them. In the world of magic and unknown secrets of any such nonsence, the only person who holds the 'keys' to answering these mystical and spiritual unknowns is the supposed finder of these deep dark secrets, and that is what this book is totally about 
 to waste reading political hatchet jobs like this!  It is just a worthless piece of bad lit written due to the upcoming elections 
 This movie is designed to view black people in a negative light because they are portrayed as the oppressor. What kind of bad joke is this?? There is a scene where John Travolta is robbing Harry Belafonte's character and he puts a gun to his head and starts to curse him. Do you understand that this is a white man putting a gun to a black man's head? Does that not make you sick? Its like watching bad white actors who are trying to act black, but because their white they come off as being racist.  I don't know who wrote this movie but it was obviously written by a white person. This kind of trash should be a reminder to everyone that America is one of the most backward, racist, brainwashed countries in the world. And this is because white people run things. The writers of this masterpiece put black people in power of the white man's system. In reality, if blacks ruled instead of whites, I guarentee we would have a more peaceful world. If you like this movie well, your just above the level of retarted, to the point we're you can drool a little bit and pee on the floor if you want to. 
 Ugh. I did not even try to finish the book. It is full of sexual content. Not recommended for anyone who likes clean literature 
 After reading this book, it was apparent to me that the author was implying that Nixon was a dark and grumpy man who needed his image repackaged.  McGinnis boasts of Nixon and his PR teams ability to hide the "true" Nixon and to trick the public into voting for his image.  He proclaims that the real Nixon was the one that the country saw debating Kennedy on TV in 1960.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  First off, Nixon won the 1960 election but did not contest the results for the good of the nation.  All historians admit that JFK had help from Daily in Illinois and LBJ in Texas.  Furthermore, in the 1960 debates, Nixon had a high fever and was recently out of the hospitable and JFK's staff broke into the basement of the studio and turned up the heat to make him sweat! If anyone decieved the voters with his image, it was JFK using his dramatic but bubbly rhetoric and not backing it up and JFK the family man and the idealist.  JFK exploited the Missile Gap, had numerous affairs, assassinated Ngo Dihn Diem, wire tapped Martin Luther King, screwed up the Bay of Pigs, and had ties to the Mafia!  Now, I could be wrong, but JFK's campaign sounds like a true selling of the President.  'Selling of the President' has little credible content but infact is a good historical document that portrays Left Wing propaganda of the 1960s 
 In a factual book I have a high standard for factual accuracy and against propagandizing through adjective excessiveness  This book does not live up to its sub-title.  There is little if anything covered in this book that has not appeared frequently in other books or magazines covering the FBI.  There is a lot of material missing.  For instance the charges of a homosexual relationship with Roy Cohn.  There are far to many cases or instances where Kessler is indicating his approval or disapproval of the bureau and its actions.  There are cases and officers mentioned to the credit of the FBI where that credit belongs to others or the officer in question was not an agent at the time of the event.  Some controversal instances such as Waco are very badly handled. At Waco there are instances of commission in the history.  That Koresh was a religious fanatic with illegal sexual practices is widely published but what those crimes have to do with either the FBI or ATF is an item of controversy.  Investigation by Texas Rangers have shown that ATF lacked probable cause, and through failure to communicate with the sheriff and poor planning turned an investigation into a nightmare.  The FBI's   failure to publish an adequate report after the incident only made things worse in hiding Governmment mishandling of this incident.  Without writing a book of my own I cannot in a small case give all the reasons that I do not intend to share, recommend or inflict this poorly researched and propaganda like book  PeteTestart@Yahoo.co 
 I JUST DIDN'T LIKE THIS BOOK. I WANTED TO PUT IT DOWN AND NOT PICK IT UP EVER AGAIN, BUT ONCE I START READING A BOOK I HAVE TO FINSH IT. FIRST SHE WAS TRYING TO RUN AWAY FROM HER PAST, THEN I DONT KNOW WHY HER HUSBAND STAYED WITH HER. SHE MADE ME SICK AND I LIKED HER SISTER MORE THAN HER. I WAS KIND OF HOPING THAT HER HUSBAND WOULD HAVE LEFT HER FOR HER SISTER INSTEAD OF STAYING WITH HER. ERIC JEROME DICKEY HAS BEEN SLIPPING IN HIS LAST FEW BOOKS I HOPE THE NEXT TWO COMING OUT THIS YEAR WILL BE BETTER. ASHLEY 
 Dr. Arthur Guyton and Dr. John Hall fail in offering a comprehensive molecular understanding of physiology.  Although the general presentation of subjects is decent, it does not offer a thorough understanding of molecular events that occur to create what is observed macroscopically.  The diagrams are weak utilizing ancient graphs that do not serve to clarify difficult points, and the book is in desparate need of some schematics and flow charts.  Tip to Guyton and Hall:  today's medical students need more than just a cursory glance at the molecular basis of physiology.  And I would suggest to those reading to check out Berne and Levy and Ganong, the latter of which offers up much more detail than Guyton despite being a review text 
 It seems many reviews discuss this book through the prism of their politics, as opposed to reviewing it _as a book_.  As a book, I was quite disappointed. Firstly, a good half of the book is taken up with the PRE-war planning on invading Iraq, rehashing material presented (much better) in Woodward's or Clark's books.  When we finally get to the post-invasion planning, the book suffers from a fatal flaw - the author's own axe-grinding. The author was a principal on the multi-agency project, led as I remember out of the State Department, which compiled a long set of guides for how the reconstruction should go. In one of the more notable (but already known) failures, these guides were discarded by the Bush administration, as the authors were viewed as too "soft". OK, fine. However, the author harps on this over and over and over. Over and over, the book reads like this: "So then Bremer made this decision, which turned out wrong. We told you so.".  This is also weakened by the fact that the authors recommendation is virtually _always_ "form a multi-sided commission to study the issue" - not exactly gripping reading. Frankly, I can see why more action-minded minds might have started to ignore the author and his comission - sometimes multi-sided comissions are not the right answer!  The blurb for the book gives the impression that the author was a "True believer" (one of Rice's friends, etc.) who became disullusioned over time. This may be true, but the book is written instead with the advantage of 20/20 hindsight - the author's recommendations were always right, Bremer's/Cheney's always wrong, according to the book. Not only does this strain credulity, but it made this a rather unenlightening read for me - i would have been much more interested in something that discussed how the planning _evolved_, rather than the litany of "we told you so's" that this book presents. 
 The book is divided into two parts the first identifies the causes and nature of 'toxic shame' and the other how to heal from it.  I found the first part quite convoluted and lacking clarity he repeats things alot and seems to have invented a new vocabulary which is not always well defined.   The book uses alot of material from other authors such as Alice Miller et al. which represent the best parts of this book. There is an originality from them which Bradshaw lacks, his input felt quite biased and perhaps that is why he rambles so much.  I have begun the second part but have found it lacking, it uses the 12 step program as the ideal model for healing and somehow just throws together disparate research on healing.   If this book represents his others I think it sad that he has made a career out of simply putting forward other people's work with little valuable contribution from himself.  I found his tone somewhat preacher like and I feel he hides behind ambiguity in his language and writing style to disguise the lack of substance.  THe book does have value but only becuase of the references to other people's work.   
 I felt this was a highly disappointing and unsatisfactory book about an 8-year-old child who has autism. Kristy, the 13-year-old protagonist in this story baby sits Susan, whose autism is so severe that she does not communicate meaningfully. She has an extraordinary gift for music and can reproduce any song she hears on the piano. She does not play or interact with others.   Other kids soon learn of Susan's musical prowess and charge admission to hear her play. They exploit her talents until Kristy intervenes. Susan can also provide any given date and her mother explains that Susan once saw a perpetual calendar which sparked this interest.   Parts of the book reflected antiquated attitudes and misperceptions about autism. Kristy looks the word up in the dictionary and the definition provided was that it is a form of schizophrenia or withdrawal from reality. Autism is NOT schizophrenia and people with autism don't necessarily "withdraw from reality." Indeed, people with autism often feel bombarded with outside stimuli and develop coping mechanisms to "come even," that is to tone down the sensory onslaught that is so much a part of the autism experience. Suggesting that autism is in any way, shape and form related to schizophrenia has proved very costly to people with autism. Sadly, this kind of thing has caused many people with autism to be misdiagnosed. This in turn has led to many inappropriate treatments and placements being inflicted on people with autism! This kind of thing does not help anybody and has harmed many.   This book is not meant to be a diagnostic tool, but I wish autism had been defined in a more accurate way.  Rest assured, autism is NOT a disease but a neurobiological condition that affects sensory integration and communication based on the individual.  I for one am good and tired of seeing characters with autism being portrayed as having savant abilities. That only applies to roughly less than 10% of the autistic population and I can't help but wonder if this story just reinforces those stereotypes of people with autism to the neurotypical population. Same old tired tune, just a different performer.   To the author's credit, no promises are made. Susan is by the close of the story enrolled in a residential program for autistic children. I did feel the story was extremely weak. I also wondered why Susan was sent to a residential school as opposed to a day program in her area.   Read Ann M. Martin's "Inside Out" instead. That is a much better book by this author about a child who has autism.  At least James is a Beatles' fan 
 One of the Spotlight Reviewers says that by combining two great characters--Sunny Randall and Jesse Stone--Robert B. Parker has doubled our fun.  Quite the reverse.  He has cut it in half.  The characterizations of Sunny and Jesse are enormously feeble; and the the rest of the characters are no great shakes, either.  Sunny's Irish Mafia uncle is a cardboard cutout.  Suitcase Simpson has three funny lines and is heard from no more.  The villains--Buddy, Erin, Missy, Gerard, Moon--are little more than vague names and stereotyping.  Spike is relegated to a scene and a half.  Oddly, the only interesting character is a very minor one: Eddie.  But he only stays around for 10 minutes  Even the plot is tissue-thin.  The love-story is lame; the sex-scenes boring.  Worst of all, who should appear but (Christ!) Susan Silverman, from the Spenser series: one of the dampest and most wooden and least interesting characters in fiction.  As with "Cold Service" and some others, Parker is just coasting with this one.  He is capable of far better.  
 I had high hopes for this book, but they were soon dashed.  The book is terribly superficial, and is more of a lengthy series of factoids than a deep analysis of current issues.  The writing style is breezy, and has the feel of Newsweek or Time articles rather than what one would expect from a nearly 400 page book.  As to the substance, the Tofflers point to "deep fundamentals" of social activity, consisting of time, space, and knowledge.  These fundamentals are undergoing change, as the pace of life and innovation accelerate, more knowledge is generated, and we shift into the "third wave" of civilization.  They also claim that we are in a new era of "revolutionary wealth," in which monetary, measurable wealth of consumers and producers is joined with the value provided by "prosumers," a neologism that describes those who provide value for themselves, or engage in volunteer activity to help others.  I don't see how the mere recognition of this element of activity is revolutionary, however, inasmuch as it has always existed.  Much of the book engages in digressions that do not really further the thesis of the book.  I also found that they emphasized their criticisms of "antiscientific" activities of environmentalists and animal rights activists, but paid scant attention to those in American society who deny and attack evolution theory, resist efforts to have governmental sponsorship of stem cell research, and who advocate a radical right wing political agenda.  These concerns, which are prominent in Kevin Phillips's far more insightful book American Theocracy, are never explored by the Tofflers.  Ironically, the Tofflers engage in what I would call "second wave" logic and analysis in pursuing what they call "third wave" ideas.  They perfunctorily dismiss any ways of knowing outside the reductionist scientific paradigm.    I would not recommend this book as one that is particularly edifying.  There are some interestng vignettes and factoids in it, however.  Most of the endnotes are citations to newspaper and magazine articles, and website entries.  Occasionally there is a book or journal article citation, but the flavor of this book is more of a journalistic essay than an analytical study with well-considered insights about how the future will unfold 
 Yes, this is a supernatural psycological thriller... but far from a good one as far as I'm concerned.  I love these kinds of stories and I went to see this film with a lot of excitement... first because it has a interesting subject. Second because it has a great actor. I thought Denzel Washington would never associate himself with a bad script... but I was wrong.  But Denzel is always top notch. The rest isn't.  By now you already know the story. A good detective... a killer who happens to me a demon who happens to pass from person to person just by touch... the hunt... blah blah blah....  The script is idiot from page one. The killer (as we will see as the story develops) travels by simple touch. So... excuse me... why doesn't the killer passes to a guard as he is going to be executed??? I mean... The guy is sooo powerful (and mobile) that I find it unbelievable that he gets to be executed in the first place.  But... ok... let's give the screenwriters a break.  Somewhere in the middle of the film, the demon enters a cat. Ok... so he can enter all kinds of animals. Fine.  Later on, the main character learns that in order to defeat the demon, he must kill his body in a place where there is nobody around. His brilliant idea: the forest. Full of animals.  Was I the only one who did not know the ending before it came????  Want more?  In an interesting twist, the protagonist kills an innocent man and later on... his own brother. And no one will believe the truth! How is he gonna get out of such a mess???  In the world of storytelling, there are only two ways of getting out of such an impossibly difficult situation: EITHER the screenwriter is brilliant and finds a believable way to save his character from the master mess built by the screenwriter himself - so he should know! (and then we get some sort of positive ending despite everything...) OR something deep inside the protagonist fails and he loses the battle against evil (despite the fact that there was a way out).  First line of solution: Die Hard, The Fugitive. Second line of solution: S7ven, Chinatown.  We have none of that here.  Instead we have an evil god against a simple man (great starter for drama, right?) ...BUT the man gets weaker and weaker and weaker... and the demon gets stronger and stronger... to the point where we get the fact that the demon IS invincible long before he actually wins. And the great turnaround never comes.  Obviously we all hope he will be defeated... and that's why I kept myself seated all through the film... because if there was a way out... it would be brilliant. If the character dropped the towel... it would be thought provoking to say the least.  But no... the ending was easy and predictable. The screenwriter could not achieve one of the two possible lines of solutions. He wrote the first thing that came to his mind and hid himself under "The story ends bad" label. Without any depth.  Every villain has a weak point. It is up to the hero to explore it (may he loose or win). The only problem the hero faces here is a stupid lack of data. We have the data the moment the demon enters a cat. That's why we know how's gonna end.  What about the girl who helps Denzel? What about his nephew? Shouldn't they be part of the ending too? Don't come with the "this is an open-ending" kind of talk!  Do I sense a smell of desire for a sequel? Quick! Gas masks!!!! Or... as A.C.Doyle would write: "Quick, Dr. Watson, the needle!"  Despite a stupid screenplay. Denzel is always great. 
 THIS ALBUM WAS TOTALLY WHACK. I DIDN'T HEAR ONE GOOD SONG I LIKED AND I PERSONALLY AGREE WIT THE PERSON THAT STATED THAT HER FIRST ALBUM WAS MORE ON POINT WHICH I TWAS. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM NO MATTER HOW BIG OF A THREE SIX MAFIA, OR HYPNOTIZE CAMP FAN YOU ARE, IT AIN'T WORTH IT. IF YOU JUST NEED IT TO COMPLETE YOUR COLLECTION, TRY NAPSTER NAIMINE! AND FOR THE PERSON THAT STATED KOOPSTA KNICCA ONLY HAS 2 ALBUMS? GET REAL MANE. KOOP HAS 4 MAIN STREAM ALBUMS, AND ABOUT 3-5 MORE UNDERGROUND ALBUMS, THE DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND, THE INEVITABLE, THE K PROJECT, AND UNDERGROUND MUSIC VOLUME ONE ARE JUST TO NAME AFEW. AND THOUGH HE DOESN'T DO MUCH WIT THREE SIX, HE STILL HAS THE HCP LABEL. BUT FOR THIS LA CRAP URR LA CHAT, SAVE YOUR CASH FO SHO 
 At this moment in time(Oct. 2005)and for people familiar with electronica in it's many variations, the sound on this release is dated. Not destined to be a classic 
 Dont buy this book!  Or buy it and tear it in two pieces because it is much to long.  Wow I mean talk about boreing.  Is it the best of times or is it the worst of times?  You cant make up you're mind on page one sentence one even!?!  If I am this guys editer I would have told him to just write about the best of times.  Thats plenty and people dont need another depressing book in this day and age anyhow.  Only ONE STAR for you but keep trying youll get there 
 I spent about 20 minutes trying to ascertain how much this item cost, but to no avail whatsoever!  I'm so frustrated after such a lengthy, yet futile search that I want to hurt someone!  Instead, I'm shutting down my browser.  You idiots should think about how many more sales you'd make if you just included a price, for God's sake! 
 I just received these.  They're not flash cards.  A flash card has a question (images, etc) on one side and answer(s) on the other.  These cards just have info on both sides.  They're review cards, not flash cards 
 Have I ever listened to this all the way through?  I suppose I have, once or twice.  "Nobody Told Me" knocked me out when I first heard it.  But the final creative outpouring of the Lennons ("diarhea of creativity", John called it in his final interview) doesn't hold much attraction for me anymore--and not because of Yoko, either (not in particular, anyway).  It's too much personal myth-making, too self-centered.  I hope to someday understand this period of their lives better than I do now.  Meantime, anyone want to buy my copy of the record?  Near-mint condition 
 The author does an acceptable job of presenting _what_ his opinion is, but a very poor job of explaining _why_ anyone else should share that opinion.  The footnotes and references he introduces are only rarely pertinent and never compelling to the sweeping conclusions he draws.  For example, as support for his premise that global warming and climate change (a claim which is still heatedly debated among scientists and far from being established as fact) will impact the United States' ability to project power, he invokes a single article in the NYT referencing a white house press release that carbon emissions _may_ be a factor.  Wow.  Gosh, I'm convinced.  The book is full of such cases where the author cogently and effectively presents an alternative or scenario which _may_ be true, and then blithely moves on sans proof or support of _why_ it is true to spend the next ten pages describing how that unproven premise will impact the United States and its role in the world.  The author may be correct in his suppositions and conclusions.  But I found I couldn't focus on his points since he left such glaring holes in the chain of reasoning by which he reaches those conclusions.  If you're going to say "If X then Y", you'd better spend some time showing that X is actually the case before you spend pages and pages talking about the impact of Y if you want anyone to care.  "If martians prefer bic lighters to zippos, then clearly the democratic party needs to move more toward the political center" is insufficient justification for then spending 15 pages on talking about why the political center is good for democrats.  A minor peeve of mine was that the author seemed to fall in love with his own clever terminology for things.  For example, he introduces and then gauzily defines the term "soft power" early in the book, and then never misses a chance to refer to how this or that factor might impact a nation's soft power.  To readers who weren't convinced (for the reasons outlined above) in even the _existence_ of soft power, these continuing references are at best annoying and at worst irrelevant 
 Ali G: meet Stuart Smalley, The Ladies Man, Pat, and the Butabi brothers.  You are now in the distinguished company of your SNL cousins from across the pond who turned funny 5 minute skits into full length movie suckfests.  Yes, Da Ali G show is hilarious, due mostly to its main character, Ali G.  His interviews with famous politicians and roundtable discussions with experts are never a disappointment.  You would therefore think that an Ali G who is funny in extemporaneous situations such as an interview would be even funnier in a movie which he scripted.  And you would be incorrect, sir!  The movie is a 90 minute mess.  The "plot" is mentioned elsewhere on this page, so no need for me to ridicule it.  But suffice it to say that the Ali G character here is a grating bore, lacking in wit or charisma.  If you like Ali G, you will not like this.         
 Gave this heli to my 30 year old son on his birthday. It was supposed to be easy to fly. It rolled over and crashed inches off the ground on its maiden flight, spewing propeller parts everywhere. With all retailers out of replacement parts it may never fly. If you buy this heli, don't buy it through the mail or online but from a local dealer with parts and expertise to help you get it back together 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 Why is it that studios think they know what we like, and even if we don't like, they know best and we should follow as "Lemmings" right over the cliff's edge. This is a classic movie and deserves to be released in it's original movie-release ratio, in other words, WIDESCREEN. I can deal with "Colorization" by turning off the color (If I so desire), but with Pan & Scan treatment of a movie, the only other alternative is to not buy the P&S version. I choose the latter. I still have a laser-disc copied to VHS version that is in it's original aspect ratio, and I will just have to dig this out of the closet. I have a brand new(Bought 3yrs ago)VHS player still in the box, just for this purpose. Wake up Hollywood, don't be a bunch of schmucks, make P&S disappear forever!!! CG13 
 To me, John Gardner was egotistical, self-serving, and liked nothing better than the sound of his own voice.  Ms. Thornton was nothing but a doormat, and a doormat who should have known better.  Ms Thornton claims writing this book was therapeutic, brought closure, etc.  Frankly, I don't think the book served its' purpose.  She seems to be the same starry eyed person she was, when John Gardner first appeared on the horizon.  And there is no doubt, that Ms. Thornton would have continued on her path of self destruction had John Gardner lived 
 Really what demographic were these people trying to reach. You're better off having a bum teach you how to get free stuff you would get better stuff than what's in this book. Most of the stuff isn't even free, its cheap and its useless garbage. You probably shouldn't waste your money on this book folks it really is not worth it 
 In the first 7 books, there was the same reader, now, with the mark, there is a new reader,  which is always a pain in the butt.  This new author also tried to imitate the accents of each person.  Not fun to listen to.  Add to this my opinion these books are nothing but poorly constructed religious porn 
 Gerd Lï¿½demann begins his historical inquiry into the question of the resurrection of Jesus Christ by writing in chapter 1: "... if Jesus' resurrection did not take place and consequently Jesus was not revived.... Christian faith is as dead as Jesus and can be kept alive only by self-deception." In light of the stakes Lï¿½demann asserts that an investigation into the historicity of the resurrection is of the utmost importance.  However, after making the case for investigating the resurrection historically, Lï¿½demann goes astray. Chapter 2 is mostly a benign look at the different types of resurrection texts found in the New Testament. However, even in this early part of the book his agenda is clear: "Those reports within the gospel narratives that stress the bodily nature of the risen Christ are presumably of later origin (35)." The idea of a late doctrinal development regarding the bodily nature of Jesus' resurrection appearances is important in the strategy that Lï¿½demann desires to employ in chapter 3. He desires to discredit most of the resurrection material in the gospels as the product of late theological aggrandizement by the early church. However, even the most liberal dating of the gospels has them all completed within 65 or less years of the events. This is an incredibly short time span for reporting an event in antiquity, and severely hampers the potential exaggeration. Yet, even if Lï¿½demann were right in his critique of the gospel material (he's not), the case for an early and pervasive confession that Jesus was bodily resurrected can still be made. The reason for this is because Lï¿½demann, along with virtually all critical scholars, allows for and admits that the material recorded by the apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 15:3-8 is of the utmost importance.  According to resurrection scholar Gary Habermas, virtually everyone who has studied the material in 1 Cor. 15:3-8 - including Lï¿½demann himself - dates it to within 3-7 years after the crucifixion of Jesus. It is conceded that the material in this section is creedal material transmitted to Paul, and represents the early Jerusalem church's confession about the resurrection of Jesus. In it, we find many interesting details: Jesus Christ was buried, was raised on the third day, appeared to Cephas (Peter), then to the Twelve, to more than 500 brothers - many of whom were alive at the time of Paul's writing, appeared to James, to all the apostles, and then lastly to Paul on the Damascus Road. Thus, we have a report from Paul, including the earliest material representing the church's belief, and it all points toward a heavily witnessed bodily resurrection of Jesus. Interestingly, Lï¿½demann points out that Paul intends to place, "his encounter with Christ in parallel with the appearances of Christ to the other witnesses (44)." However, where Lï¿½demann takes us after discounting much of the gospel material and focusing in on Peter and Paul's eyewitness "seeings" is to assert that they both fell victim to self-deception in the form of visions brought on by intense emotional pain they felt in reference to Jesus: Peter, because he denied Jesus on the night of his crucifixion, and Paul, by reaching a point of emotional breakdown regarding his legalistic Judaism and persecution of Christians.  Surely, however, Lï¿½demann's thesis doesn't deal with several important facts. First, modern psychology tells us that hallucinations (this can be seen even in the cases Lï¿½demann mentions in chapter 4) occur with people who have an expectant desire to see a deceased loved one. Neither the denier (Peter) nor the persecutor (Paul) had that. Also, James, the unbelieving brother, would not be in a psychological state of expectancy, yet he turned from a skeptic into a pillar of the Jerusalem church. Second, hallucinations are individual in nature and cannot be shared. But Paul tells us in 1 Cor. 15 that Jesus appeared to groups in different locations and over many days. Third, it is extremely difficult to believe that a mere audio-visual experience of Jesus would convince second-Temple Jews who believed in bodily resurrection (see N.T. Wright's decisive study of this issue in Resurrection of the Son of God) that they were really experiencing a risen, triumphant Christ. Rather, it was the persistent and very physical nature of the resurrection appearances that convinced a small band of Jews to preach and proclaim the resurrection of Jesus boldly in the city where earlier he had been killed. Fourth, it is extremely naive to conclude that even totally convinced hallucinatory saints could not be stopped by a simple trip to Jesus' tomb by his enemies. The Jewish authorities would have had every means and motive for producing Jesus' body. Fifth, it simply is the very best explanation of the evidence to believe that the willingness to suffer and die for the message of Christ was affected in the early church because of the rock solid conviction that they had seen and touched a bodily resurrected conqueror. Hallucinations simply could not have provided that type of unshakeable conviction.  Lï¿½demann's final analysis is that Christianity should be abandoned. Ultimately, though, it is the biased and highly presumptive conclusions of Lï¿½demann that should be rejected in favor of an explanation that does justice to the evidence of an early, transformative, powerful belief that Jesus Christ rose bodily from the grave. 
 Yet another book about the "Great Game" that isn't great, and has no game.  No sense of person, place, or time can wriggle past the stifling ooze -- consisting of equal parts journalistic drone, hoary cliche, and predictable modifiers -- that lies, awaiting unsuspecting readers, between the covers of this tome.  MacIntyre deserves to be applauded for his research; he should have hired someone else to do the writing.  Here again we have a fascinating subject rendered lifeless by low-level prose.   You want to know about this stuff?  Read Kipling.  He, at least, was not guilty of adverb abuse 
 This is the only one of Myers' book that I read.  I disliked it early on - but I was determined to see it through.  The novel has some wit, some mystery, some cleverness - but oh what an unsatisfying mish-mash.  The writing style is skittish - from page one to the finish - so nothing is developed to any extent that you start caring about anything.  I just yearned for release at the last page.  The lack of focus was grating - but I appreciated the author's gumption of sticking to her style.  This is a light distraction - all froth and little substance 
 What a waste of time.  This book is good for one thing.  It reminded of something I need to work on.  My stubbornness.  Sometimes I can be just too stubborn for my own good.  When I was reading this I just wouldn't quit and had to go all the way to the end.  This will teach me.  Thank you Mr. Baldacci!  Here is a synopsis of the book:  "A" is the biggest strongest man in the world.  No way!  "B" is the biggest strongest.  How can they be if "C" was in the most awesome group of men in the world?  Then they try to catch a bad guy who thinks he is the biggest, strongest and smartest of them all.  Thank you again David!  This would have received a 1 star except I was reminded of the lesson I needed 
 I bought this because I didn't want to buy a cd to replace my well-worn album.  Entertainment! is by far their best album; this is a lame reworking of the songs on that (mostly) with some cuts from their other albums as well. Maybe it's because I grew up on the originals, but I think this cd sucks.  However, it's still ten times better than most stuff out there, so I gave it 3 stars.  The melodica is missing is some spots, the guitars sound less jagged, and the drums have lost a lot of zing, particularly on what we all want.  So, if you don't have any gang of four, get this, then get entertainment 
 The book was great. The ending TERRIBLE. This is becoming a pattern with his books!!!! AVOI 
 Rairly have I read a book that I hate.  This is it!  Not only is it not funny but it is insulting to anyone who would sit in his dining room.  Tony's fan base just lost one 
 This "mini-booklet" is basically a reiteration of the stages of grief set within a Judeo-Christian perspective.  One could probably stop by the local funeral parlor and pick up a free pamphlet that would be every bit as edifying.   Good grief, what a disappointment! 
 This guy is a snake oil salesman. Watch out people.  Open your minds 
 This author pushes his personal and anthropological views on his reader in a big way.  Had this book not been a required text for a class, I would have put it down after the first chapter.  This is not a linear book, meaning Brody skips around sometimes over periods of years while recalling his experiences.  It is a boring read and Brody is pushy with his ideas, to an almost sickening degree.  I wouldn't recommend this book at all 
 My views are terribly coloured by a lot of non-fiction type historical reading, so while it was fun reading a thriller after a while, it certainly is not the best Forsythe, or a thriller in general, that I've read.   While Forsythe's eye for detail, particularly in the chapter "The Vigil" is extraordinary, I feel that in general this kind of detail lends itself well to a storyboard for a film but not necessarily a thriller.   The silent, street smart & tough Dexter (Ex-Vietnam, Ex-Lawyer) is just the kind of hero you'd expect. The story, too, while it is about extradition of a narcotic & arms trafficker, builds up rather slowly describing Dexter's years in Vietnam, his childhood, his law years & his personal losses which makes him the take up these kinds of jobs in the name of justice or some such moral thingummy.   The story has a few other important characters - most of them appear in some context during the build phases listed above & then again reappear to help Dexter out while he is on his assignment. This is a rather trite story-telling technique.   In addition, some of the lucky breaks are plain theatrical. Particularly, the way the baddie is first testified against by a scared youth overcoming his fears once he is detected with cancer is just ridiculous.   Overall, read this book if you have nothing better to do on a lazy afternoon. I'd suggest you go for a run.   Or a triathlon - like Cal Dexter.  S! 
 An unreadable book.  Bits and pieces stretched out over 800 pages that never add up to a whole.  To use DeLillo's garbage theme: it was like finding litter on a sidewalk.  Each piece once meant something, but who knows what.    I finished it because I had read so many good reviews that I thought there must be something worthy in it.  Sometimes a book is torture and then everything comes together at the end.  Not in this case.  Torture for 800 pages and then poof! DeLillo tidies everything up in an epilogue.  Nice scenes and nice sentences and BIG ideas don't necessarily make a book a worthwhile read. It was my first DeLillo book and it will probably be my last 
 The charaters are flat and under-developed. Author has depressing out look on life 
 Like another person here mentioned, this TV does not exist. I bought this TV from Amazon and they sent me the W version (the one without the Integrated ATSC Tuner). After almost a month after I bought this thing, I'm still waiting for my refund. Do yourself a favor, stay away from this. Hopefully Amazon will take down this product listing so nobody else has to deal with this BS 
 The end of this book was terrible. The end of a series should be catacalismic for someone, but in this book everyone, even the bad guys, get what they want. I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 My son received a beta as a gift, and when we went to the store to buy an aquarium, the clerk recommended this tank, and also recommended getting a second beta to add.  In hindsight, he wasn't looking out for our fish, but for his profit.  Even though betas CAN live in small spaces, I would not recommend it.  Even for one beta, this tank is too small.  It gets dirty easily and needs to be cleaned once a week, which is an immense stress on the fish.  The fake plants provided with the tank don't help with the water quality either.  For now, we moved our beta to a large glass baking bowl, and we are in the process of shopping for a larger tank with an undergravel filter and live plants, plus a heater.  I absolutely agree with the other review:  If you can't afford a good tank for your fish, don't get one.  Betas like space, too 
 McCammon's characters begin fairly well developed, although they all seem mostly defined by their various maladies/deformities.  Once the protaganist is surrounded by the other characters, any meaningful inner dialogue seems to diappear, and the story plays itself out to a predictable, redemptive ending.  The bounty hunters sailing off together is a bit trite 
 My all time favorite book is Deavers THE BLUE NOWHERE and The Testament by another author.  I think this book is on the bottom of my list.  It was a combo term paper and novel.  I wonder where the editor of this book is.  Where was he/she?  It read like it was written by two different people and a poor editor combined them.    Don't worry Jeff, I'll still buy your next book...I've bought them all but please ...get a second opinion about your editor. I good editor wouldn't have let it go out in this shape. 
 i tried, really tried to like these guys and understand why so many people say th?y are great and all, but apart from single "let?s wrestle..." the music here is extremely annoying.  You can do experimental music wisely (like Beta Band) but tweaking  buttons thinking you?re the new Can is simply boring. Zzzzzz 
 James A. Michener built a writing career on impeccable research of a subject and writing as if he did not have a clue about editing. It seemed as if Michener attempted to outdo himself in the number of words he produced for each subsequent book.  It appears as if Michener could not pull himself away from his novelized form of history while penning this work on the Kent State shootings. There is one main character that is pure fiction, the "drifter." That character - as stated by Michener when he got caught in his web of make-believe after the book was published - is an alleged composite figure.   In actuality, he may be based on a real-life male who was a government informant, hired to infiltrate organizations and then trumping up "facts" to prove they were prepared to unleash violent acts against individuals and institutions.  But people as real as Homer Simpson and scenes that may have been built better in the back lot of a movie studio did not prevent Michener from defending the book. But a writer does not report news by penning a great lie.  Michener refused to let facts get in the way of his storytelling. If nothing else, this book is a great example on how myth becomes reality & how an author can get onto the fast track for a Presidential Medal of Freedom 
 Ok, I don't mean to be rude, but if you think this is great writing you are woefully uneducated. It is almost a sad confirmation of the common stereotype of fundamentalist Christians being uneducated yokels that so many of them think this is great writing. Here's my take: I'd enjoy a good "end of times" story - this just isn't it. The Left Behind series is amateurish and poorly written and just plain astonishing to me that it has had such huge success. P.T. Barnum once said that no one ever went broke understimating the intelligence of the American public and this series proves it. Christians should demand better writing from their revered authors. Go read some C.S. Lewis or something - please. 
 You can judge a photographer's skill by his/her photographs. All of the photographs in this book look like they were taken by Average Joe with a disposable camera. This book was written backwards. The book does not mention metering technique until chapter 8 (near the end of the book)! They mention handheld meters in chapter 7 but never explain proper use of them. The book never discusses studio lighting techniques or even portable (on camera) flash technique. They never discuss proper use of available light or use of lighting modifiers (reflectors, diffusers, etc . . .). Most of this book rants on and on about arbitrary +/- .25 to .5 exposure adjustments for a million different specific situations (mostly travel photographs) instead of explaining overall technique. Save your time and money. Read another book written by a professional 
 I was reading this book again the other day and after initially being sucked in, I was vividly reminded of how much I disliked it.  The history is accurate, the writing style is both gripping and crisp. What is it, then? I suppose the characterization really bothers me.  Whether it is Mary Boleyn, Hannah the Fool, Amy Dudley, or the main character (can't remember his name) from Earthly joys, in several different Gregory books I have read, the central character is the Exact. Same. Person. Give them a different name, a different background, but the exact same personality/values/relation to the world and characters around them.  The person is unusually honest, kind-hearted, and guileless amidst a sea of corrupt people who admire him/her. The main character is generous to a fault, cares deeply about either Mary Tudor or Katherine of Aragon (depending upon which of the two is in the book), and looks down upon the antics of Anne Boleyn or Elizabeth Tudor (depending upon which one is in the book). The main character is always recognized by the historical figures as uniquely honest and wonderful in that way only Gregory's protagonists are. The main character does something self-sacrificing and generous and Katherine/Mary (or in Earthly Joys, Cecil) stands in awe or admiration of that other person's naï¿½ve and unique generosity.  That characterization is TIRED. And I think she is capable of more; I wouldn't be so sick of it if she wasn't a good enough writer that I've read four of her books.   For God's sake, Ms. Gregory, you have amazing talent-- take on a new protagonist! Stop inserting the exact same character in every single one of your novels!  In this novel, she wants to have it all ways with Mary Boleyn. Gregory wants her to be a guileless and innocent sweetheart amidst all these corrupt people (guileless to the point of utter stupidity for a Tudor courtier-- questioning why her family would want her to cheat on her husband with the king? Come on! Short of a mental impairment, she would understand at least the basics of the ambitious world she inhabits!) Yet Gregory also wants Mary to be a calculating and clever courtier like all the rest... She just makes Mary clever/wily whenever it suits the plot, and innocent whenever she wants to prove to us how wonderful Mary is. You can't have it both ways.  She wants readers to get an "insight into the psychology" of these people, yet she makes Anne Boleyn a cookie-cutter villain (to the point where her book presents as the truth anti-Anne Boleyn propaganda invented by Boleyn's CONTEMPORARY enemies in the 1500s) and she makes Katherine of Aragon a cookie-cutter saint. If you want psychological realism, give them -depth- or give up the pretense that your own personal likes/dislikes are not coloring your characterization of them.  My complaints aside, I will tell you that I was pretty sucked into it even a second time around... She's a good writer. I plowed through the first half of the book before the characterizations really started to irritate me.   I'd still take this novel any day over the abomination that is "The Virgin's Lover"... Good God, but that one makes me cringe. However, I'd recommend both Gregory's novel "The Queen's Fool" (same protagonist, as always, but a better novel) and the wonderful "Earthly Joys" before this (same protagonist, again, but so many unique things in that book to make up for it!)  So, get "The Other Boleyn Girl" for a quick read, great historical accuracy, a blatant smear job on Anne Boleyn, glorification of Catherine of Aragon, and an annoying glance into the plot-shifting psychology of the exact same character who narrates every other Gregory novel (at least the ones I have read).   But if you want a sublime Tudor era novel, go for Susan Kay's "Legacy" 
 doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires; and will turn away their ears from the truth, and will turn aside to myths." 2 Timothy 4:3-4  This verse was written by Paul almost 2000 years ago to warn the Christians to guard their hearts from false teachings that will arise from among the Church. - "and from among your own selves men will arise, speaking preserve things, to draw away their disciples after them." - Acts 20:30-31    As a servant of the Lord, I feel strongly compelled by His Spirit to warn my fellow Christians of the false doctrine being taught by Tim LaHaye.  This man and his partner are being used by Satan himself to decieve millions of Christians across the nation concerning the truth and the end times of this earth, and this is making me sick.  Tell me why Tim LaHaye, who has never studied theological doctrine or mastered the Bible's teachings, has sold millions upon millions of books regarding prophecy.    The verse that I started with clearly tells us why.  If Tim LaHaye really loves God, than he would respect His Holy Word including God's sacred prophecies.  But instead of writing a book strictly on the Holy prophecies of God to bring Him the glory, Tim chooses to envelop God's sacred prophecies with his fictitious novels known as the Left Behind Series.  Now what were his motives for doing this?  To interpret the scriptures correctly, or to sell millions of novels and receive the wealth and fame for himself? For those of you who read his novels, did you desire to truly know what the Bible says concerning prophecies or did you enjoy having your ears "tickled" by his fanciful writing. "but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires."    In the past year, a man completed devoted to God, has taken up the monumental task of writing a new book to help clear the confusion behind the modern view of Biblical prophecies.  The book is called End Time Delusions by Steve Wohlberg, and unfortunaley, it is directed at refuting many of the false teachings endorsed by the Left Behind novels.  Mr. Wohlberg has been earnestly studying Biblical prophecies for the past 25 years.  Everything he comments on is strongly supported by the scriptures and he encourages every reader to evaluate the Bible before establishing an opinion.  The book is concise (220 pages), but it is jam-packed with years and years of extensive research.  May the Lord be with you as you continue to search the scriptures for the truth.  "For the truth will set you free! 
 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS has been promoted as a "gripping legal thriller" but I didn't find it particularly gripping or thrilling.   I ultimately found this novel to be a rather slow-moving experience.  The main character, middle-aged lawyer Michael Seeley, is not particular likable or well developed.  Despite his enormous financial success, Seeley spends a lot of time in this novel pitying himself and engaging in a variety of self-destructive and unprofessional behavior.   I found him a tough character to root for.  The plot moves slowly and mainly consists of a series of dialogues between Seeley and a host of supporting characters.  Much of this dialogue is stilted and ponderous.  This is the type of book where characters give speeches instead of having real-life conversations.  Some of the subject matter of this novel is interesting, but it is not served well by the dialogue.  I also found the storyline of this novel to be remarkably convoluted and largely rooted in the past.  I was hoping for a more realistic and topical plot, given Goldstein's background as a prominent copyright and IP attorney.  That didn't happen here.    In short, I found this book rather disappointing.  It's a decently written novel that explores some interesting issues, but the plot and characterization falls short.  I also found the ending rather limp and unsatisfying.  For a debut legal thriller that's much better than this one, I would recommend John Hart's KING OF LIES.  
 I should have known something was amiss when the only positive reviews the publisher could drum up was an anonymous homemaker in Baton Rouge and a nameless graphic designer in California.   Don't bother reading this book if you didn't read the first installment because the author makes too many references to the events in the first book and often it was hard to figure out what she was going on about.   The author tries too hard to make the main character Savannah  funny, the result is you get a lot of one-liners and not much character development. Because of the lack of character growth and development, I found it hard to empathise with or care about Savannah or any of the other characters in this book.  The pace of the book is very slow, and there are many scenes where nothing happens. I skipped and skimmed over pages and was still able to follow what was going on in the story. Alot of the story seemed to be just filler material, that had nothing to do with the plot but was just a chance for the author to air her own political views-which I might add I could have done without.  If you are looking for an entertaining work of fiction you'd better look elsewhere.     
 This kit conveniently contains 20 sheets of photo paper. Unfortunately, Kodak doesn't contain an ink cartridge for them.  Fine, I thought, I'll buy a separate cartridge. Guess what? You can't! Kodak only sells cartridges bundled with paper so you will be forced to use their paper. Why do they sell paper separately but not ink cartridges? Seems pretty dirty 
 I gave them a chance.  I read the hype about how this album is so momentus and amazing.  I bought it. I listened to it.  Over and over. Sorry, I just don't think it's very good.  In fact, I would say this is incredibly over-rated, self-indulgent, pap.  Ok, so life is dark and hard and sad and black and... you get the idea..  there are dark albums, Springsteen's "Nebraska" for example - that speak not only to the harshness of life, but give a hint of fighting back, of a spark of soul rebelling even as it sits on the electric chair.. and there are dark albums that are angry, like Eminem's "The Marshall Mathers LP", where the music and lyrics are as violent as the life they portray.  "Closer" is completely lacking any of the soul or vitality evident in these works however, and from the start of "Atrocity Exhibition" to "Decades", this is an album that accomplishes nothing but staring at its own belly button. Oh, and the fact that lead singer Ian Curtis committed suicide doesn't make it tragic - it makes it pathetic 
 What do you get when two of the most visionary science fiction writers of modern times combine forces to produce a novel of the near future?  In this case you get pure and utter drivel.  I picked this book up because Clarke and Baxter have been favorite writers of mine for years, but they obviously do not work well together.  First, a warning.  I am going to reveal plot points in this review, so don't read on if you don't want to see spoilers.  This story is filled with holes.  It revolves around the invention of a technology that lets people view any location both now and any time in the past.  Yet one of the first major plot points totally disregards this capability and sets up one of the characters to be framed for a crime she didn't commit.  Other things are merely implausible, like a worldwide obsession with history suddenly emerging after the technology is introduced.  There are also long, long, unnecesary stretches of exposition detailing, for instance, the true life of Jesus Christ, or the last work of Fermat.  I know that these two authors are capable of telling good stories, but in this book they have apparently forgotten the writer's maxim to show, not tell.  Some of the story seems completely random, without connection or purpose.  For instance, one of the main characters is revealed dramatically as a clone.  A mass mind emerges out of the wormhole viewer technology for no apparent reason.  The lead female character dies in between chapters and is barely referred to again.  Another intelligent race is discovered to have evolved on the earth tens of millions of years ago, and been wiped out by the collision that gave birth to the moon.  And, in a final unncessary twist, in the very last pages the main character dies and is resurrected hundreds of years in the future, but given nothing to do or say.  Overall, I can't recommend reading this book, much less buying it.  Save up and get the books these authors have written individually, and skip this sad mishmash 
 It's beginning to seem like any person can get a book published.  I would have thought the number of people trying to do that would have meant competition.  Not so.  All you have to do is get ONE published and you get free ride for any subsequent books.  Obviously that's what has happened here.  The author hasn't done basic research and the editors just accepted it without comment.  For instance, highly trained assassins (Mossad or not) do not indiscriminately spray a restaurant with AK 47's.  There is no such thing as a Browning high-power revolver (a point that's very relevant because it is mention several times as the favored weapon of one of the major actors).  Many of the previous reviewers who were not satisfied by this book have done a good job of beating up the author for the book's characters, many plot holes, dumb assumptions, etc.  Not bothering to make an effort to become knowledgeable on the important details (like the Browning reference, above) exposes the author's obvious unfamiliarity with the subject of personal combat, as opposed to dropping bombs or shooting missiles.  If he's going to write about it, he had better at least read about it first.  I slogged through to the end but won't waste my time starting another Robinson book 
 Ill-researched and wildly inaccurate.  If your ideal woman is barefoot and pregnant, you'll love it 
 how about season 1..im tired of their greed!! do it right or dont do it at all!! i dont own any of the volumes 1-5 and i never will.im a huge scooby fan and would love to see these released by COMPLETE SEASONS instead of the stupid (out of order) volumes they come out with.PEOPLE IF YOU WANT COMPLETE SEASONS THEM PLEASE DONT BUY THIS.the only reason they do this is to take your money.lets force them to do it right by not buying these stupid volume 
 The authors suggest, reasonably enough, that one's personal political and cultural predispositions affect how one assess the risk of different possible social dangers. If this were the only factor affecting people's risk assessment, it would be quite difficult to generate an informed social policy in a democratic society, and research in to actual risk levels associated with different degrees of social damage would be worthless, since people simply listen to the gurus that support their personal positions.  The authors present no data. Why is data important? Because if 90% of voters fit their description, we are in a much different situation that if 10% do. My best guess is that people systematically underestimate most social risks (e.g. accidental nuclear war, deadly SARS-type plagues) and overestimate a few (riskiness of air travel, danger of poisons in food). Most people, however, are willing to let the ideologues battle it out, and are strongly affected by the way the journalistic accounts of the battle portrays the cogencies of different positions. If I am right, the extremists on either side of positions, of the sort depicted by the authors, perform a valuable function but do not determine the outcome for the purposes of social policy. For instance, there are vehement supporters of gun control and equally vehement supporters of the rights of gun owners. Most voters, however, lie somewhere in the middle and are swayed both by events and scientific evidence. If that is so, the possibility of effective social policy is possible in a democracy. But, some say, the extremists are willing to put in time and money to sway the public, so ideology wins the day in this manner. I respond that it is wise for voters to take the strength of preferences into account in making social policy decisions. At any rate, no balanced discussion of these issues will be found in this volume 
 There are many problems with this book, starting with the fact that the magic system presented, while effective enough, isn't really Celtic at all, more of a basic Wiccan/Ceremonial system.  However, if one wants to learn this there are better books out there to do so.  The tables of correspondances are handy enough and are practically the only reason to recommend this book, but again, there are better sources with more in-depth knowledge.  This book would be great for a beginner, but advanced practitioners are advised to look elsewhere 
        The book is called The Circuit. This book is about a boy named Francisco Jimenez who wants to be another person. He had a hard time in school because he almost knew no English. He couldn't understand her. He had 3 brothers and 1 sister and a mom and dad. The worst thing to him was getting deported.        In school he had a problem with 2 kids named Curtis and his friend. They were the bullies. Once Francisco had wore a sweater that belonged to Curtis. Of course he didn't know. He was lucky they didn't beat him up. Later they became friends.         His brother that was born after him had a rare disease, but he made it through. I think that people who would like this book are people who have boring lives. After every chapter he wanted you to put the book down. He didn't leave any suspense. I hated the book so much. 
 I have been in Technical analysis for more than 4 years and have many books on the subject but of all the books I have "The Encyclopedia of Technical Market Indicators" is the most misguided title ever. Motivation for this statement is that the book is almost like an empty vessel. The author relates to numerous indicators and indicates how successful or unsuccessful they are but without explanations which make it difficult to comprehend. Also nowhere in the book does he indicate how these indicators should be used which, in my opinion, should be the essence of a book with this title. The author attempts to correct this on his website at: www.robertwcolby.com 
 This book is hard to find things in and doesn't seem extremely well-organized. Besides that, it's annoying because it looks like it was done on an old school typewriter. I thought I'd need it because I need to write a lot of papers for my classes, but it turns out I can just look in the journals I'm using for the citation style for the most part. 
 This is the worst book I have had the mispleasure of reading. The entire book  has no point; moreover, it describes EVERY painfully tedious detail that the main character enounters. Completely irrelevent minutiae is described ad nauseum and in the end the reader is left without any sense of conclusion or satisfaction, instead asking "what the hell just happened?" There is no other way to describe this book other than ABSOLUTELY AWFUL.  Alain Robbe-Grillet, I hope you are reading this: thank you for wasting four hours of my life 
 This book was extremely disappointing.  It is not written or illustrated by the creators of the Magic School Bus series and it is obvious from page one.  There are none of the informative side bars (papers, etc. "written" by the kids in the story) and the information is not as complete.  This alone makes the book less appealing than the originals, but to top it off, the children in the book bicker and compete with each other and are not supportive or respectful.  
 Great Expectations was a mediocre book.  I was not impressed.  I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class.  It was too long and boring.  I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real.  It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill.  Every chapter was boring.  I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book.  Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays?  This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.  In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!  If you want to read a good Dickens story, read "A Christmas Carol" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens 
 I flip through Time every now and again at the barber shop.  Sometimes there are good bits that they are using to keep the interest of people who want progressive social change, people who are sick of the power of the corporate elite and the violence of our militarists.   For the most part, since Time receives most of its revenues from Big Business advertisements, it can't challenge the establishment as it needs to. So instead I read magazines like Z, Utne, Mother Jones, The Progressive, The Sun, Earth Island and the New Internationalist 
 About as stereotypical as you can get without being Liberace. And not half so funny or insightful as the authors would have you believe. To quote one of my favorite Queens, "We are not amused" 
 i have read this book and have done thorough research on islam and other major religions too, but this book does not have a lot of authentic or traceable facts. this is just rubbish 
 I got this book from the library based on the author's name and the recommendation of her writing from some friends who had read "My Sister's Keeper" and some of her other books.  I eagerly read the first 30 pages, then quickly became bored and even started disliking the characters.  A good writer is supposed to give you enough details about the characters to make you feel as though you know them.  I am halfway into this book and not only do I not feel like I know any of the characters, I don't want to.  They are tired stereotypes who are lacking in depth and personality.  You wonder why Eric and Fitz are so in love with this woman who is totally unlikable.  The character of Fitz is so much like every other "male best friend" you've ever seen on a TV sitcom.  The stereotypical descriptions of the "fringe" characters are so boring.  Of course the prosecuting attorney is an overweight Jewish shrew.  (aren't they all?)  Of course the character of Ruthann is a "tough old" Native American who rarely shows emotion.  Of course the carousel operator is an "acne-scarred" teenager.  I just feel that these negative descriptions and characterizations are purposely written that way to somehow make you feel that the main characters are "better" than everyone else.  Poor little victims, even.  The descriptions of Eric's alcoholic mother were just like any other suburban alcoholic woman ever contrived.  I can't even muster any emotion for Sophie.  Fitz and Eric remind me of two overgrown frat boys and Delia (Bethany) is so self-centered, you almost don't care about her at all.  I hope to be able to finish this book, so at least I haven't wasted my time reading the first half 
 After reading the reviews of the book, I expected much more.  The e-book really just whets your appetite with generalities (e.g., about the internet or globalization) summarized from the full-text version.  One could get far more from a typical on-line article in Fortune, Business Week, etc.  The e-book version is 9 pages of about 14 font text, double-spaced.  I guess that this would calculate into about two or three pages of a regular book.  I would still like to read the full-text version but I would advise avoiding the e-book version 
 Clearly this book was written to shock and disgust the reader.  It largely succeeeds.   The overriding weakness of the book is that all the characters basically act, sound and view life in the same way. After reading a couple dozen pages I noiticed that you could simply insert the name of one male charater into the place of another and not really notice any difference.   All the men are ignorant, physically abusive and shiftless drunks (of somewhat varying degrees).  (...)  I wonder if this work would have been more interesting if Selby took one of the stories in LEB (...say..."Strike"...) and provided more depth about the character's history and motivations.   This work suffesrs from the same fatal flaw as Richard Wright's "Native Son" (although a much different work): the main character(s) is (are) simply unlikeable and repellant; the reader has no reason to care what happens to them.  
 Should it be that easy to write a book? Collect all the bits and pieces from newspapers' weekend-supplements and almost scientific coffeetable-talk and toss in some currently fashionable phrases concerning physics and mathematics, stir until the lumps have disappeared and do not bother with the spices of explanation and insight. If you love math and physics, stay off  
 Who is her editor?  The main character self-analyzes to the point of nausea. We got it. We do not need the author to explain to us what she is trying to say.  I felt, as the reader, that the author did not trust me to "get" her own work. It would have been a much better novel had she given her readers more credit. Not to mention, if she grew up in a cold family, with no experiences to open up her sexuality and sensuality, I did not buy that one boyfriend would all of a sudden be a panacea to a lifetime of suppression. 
 "Four Brothers" is yet another nail in the coffin of John Singleton's increasingly moribund moviemaking career.  The director - who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty "Boyz n the Hood" - has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once-promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again.  The story, reeking of artificiality, features Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother.  When she is killed in a convenience store robbery, the quartet launches into action, seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced, through their investigation in the neighborhood, that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe.    The main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters.  By not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother (except for one embarrassingly bad Thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a first-year film student), we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith, rendering the boys' thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best.  The acting is uniformly flat, with the characters little more than wafer-thin stereotypes, and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and second-rate given the Singleton pedigree in this area.  The boys' running around from venue to venue in their Detroit neighborhood, brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother's killer, is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque.    With nary a single moment that rings believable or true, "Four Brothers" is by-the-book filmmaking from a director who has proven that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more. 
 A great portion of the book is very boring. I really felt like rushing through the book. I don't recommend this book to other 
 When Jeremy Camp came onto the CCM music scene with his stellar debut album "Stay", he was like a breath of fresh air to a stagnant industry. His sound was a good mix of crunchy rock songs and reflective ballads. What made that disc special was, moreso than the music, was the lyrics. Lyrics in songs such as "I Still Believe" and "Understand" almost had me convinced that someone in the CCM industry could in fact relate to the struggles I was having with my own faith as I moved away from the safety of youth group to the "real world" of college and work and making my faith my own. Sadly, both on Restored and now on Beyond Measure, the lyrics that folks who dare to ask the difficult questions of our faith can relate to are no longer present. I feel that Mr. Camp has resorted to cliches or Christian catch phrases (see the lead single "Tonight"), or the near-constant references to struggles with pride to the point of bordering on whining about it. The point is this, we as consumers need to start demanding something more of the artists in this industry: 1) because they fly under the banner of "Christianity" and as an artistic person in my own right I resent being painted with the same brush by the rest of humanity as many in this industry who produce bland, cliche-ridden music and 2) because God is creative, and I think we could stand to do a better job of reflecting His creative nature than the sort of music that's been on Mr. Camp's last 2 albums. This is not an attack on Jeremy Camp, nor his testimony, nor his theology. This is purely an art issue that is fueled by my own personal beliefs. I hope this helps some consumer to think through their purchase before financially feeding an industry that is in need of change 
 Didn't the author even attempt to verify any of his technical aspects in this book? I didn't even get through the first chapter and I had to stop reading, my brain was hurting so much.  There is NO scientific accuracy in the book whatsoever. He talks about the retired astronomer observing Mars through his personal telescope, and seeing Valles Marineris and other things, which have NEVER been seen by ground-based telescopes. And when he talks about "volcanism" he has no concept of the scientific principles behind it. Not to mention the errors in earth-hardware (aircraft and the like).  Don't bother with this book 
 This book should be a freebie considering all the promotional content. I read about half the book before I threw it aside. There are few ideas, and a lot of promotional stuff about the cheesey marketing people that contributed articls 
 I ordered this book after seeing all these reviews praising the information on growing with hydroponics and was pretty disapointed to see that there were only 8 pages dedicated to that system. Still I guess it was better than the 4 pages dedicated to growing in soil 
 Jackies wild Seattle is a adventure story about two kids that stay with their uncle in the summer in Seattle,Washington. Cody, Shannon, uncle Neal and they save animals. The two kids are the many caracters  Cody and Shannon. Cody is the one saving all the animals. Shannon is the one woring about her parents. The plot of the book is that uncle Neal gets unjured and shannon has to save uncle Neal. On the way cody is always saving animals. the authors style is that he likes adventure books and the themes are that they save many animals and they save many animals and they save their uncle. Its mostly sad range and the book is sick sometimes and also sad. I havent read a book related to the book. The tipe of reader that would like this book ts a person that is into adventure story. 
 First I rated it great and it was, for two movies. Then it broke and the picture was scrambled and rolling. The end. 
 The cast of mostly fine actors (Cuba Gooding, Jr., James Woods, Anne Archer) must have been echoing CBJ's classic line from his Oscar-winning role in "Jerry Maguire" when they agreed to appear in this wretched misfire.  When the President is assasinated, the agent in charge of his safety (Gooding) and a maverick reporter (Angie Harmon) go on the trail of the conspiracy behind the crime.  The dull investigation requires all the deductive expertise of a child's connect-the-dots puzzle, existing merely as a skeleton upon which to hang the various action scemes, some of which are quite good.  Not good enough, however, to rescue this amateurish attempt at a screenplay.  End review 
 I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, "Collapse" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK 
 I`m trying to remember what made me pick up this book. I know I wanted some light reading for the summer days sitting on the beach but the Face was so bad it took me a month to finish it. I literally had to force myself to read it. The writing is vintage Koontz to the extreme. Koontz likes to describe things that not many people really care about and this book is yet another example. I call it diarrhea.(Spell check)  I respect Koontz, for example, Odd Thomas is really good but the face is a story of a boy who is the target of a sick, demented killer. Thanks to some spirit who led a disgraceful life while alive, the boy lives in the end.   A good 200 pages could have been deleted from this book and maybe then we would have had something decent. My advice is skip this one.   I would love to know if Mr. Koontz is being paid by the page? The face makes me wonder.. 
 I picked up this book hoping it would live up to its title, but what I found was that it was rather boring and lacking in character development. The ending seemed rushed and many of the issues raised were left unresolved. I was disappointed. 
 Thats the main problem with this kind of black comedy.  Good story line, funny lines good actors but not one grain of chemistry between Ewan and Carmen.  I don't for 1 minute believe that beautiful, rich and spoiled Carmen would fall for boring, somewhat English cute, thin, floor washer Ewan.  No way.Ewan is good in certain roles but he's hard to understand and he reminds me of Austin Powers, but not as funny.  He was just miscast, and the casting director should have hired an American comic actor, maybe a Jim Carey type could have pulled this off 
 This is the worst cookbook I have ever used, and I have a lot of cookbooks. While the photos depict mouthwatering dishes, every recipe I have tried has one, if not multiple, faults. These were clearly never tested. Amounts, temperatures, times, pretty much anything and everything is wrong. As an example, a recipe that claims to make 12 cupcakes produces enough batter for 24, and enough frosting for 48! A recipe for roasted veggies calls for a baking temperature of 325 -- maybe after six hours that would roast a root vegetable, but I'm not so sure. At best, this can give inspirational ideas for those with enough skill to make it on their own. At worst, it's a series of failed recipes and wasted ingredients. With so many other great vegan cookbooks out there, I have decided, after giving this book plenty of chances, that this is not worth the space on my shelf 
 I heard an interview with Dr. Kushner on NPR today.  He explained how the comfort in the 23rd Psalm lies in the realization that, for example, God is not on the side of the terrorists, or the hurricanes; he is on our side.  Why define the world as divided so in the first place?  Terrorists are people too.  Nature is people too.  Until we accept the fact that God is in all of us, we will continue to place things in "good" and "evil" bins and only strengthen the hatred and suffering in the world.  Our comfort and relief from Psalm 23 will only revitalize us to more intensely resist those things that we (WE, not God or some divine law of the universe) label as evil.  I rate the book 2 stars instead of 1 because it is clear the author means well and has a heart of gold, full of compassion.  Unfortunately his wonderful intentions are sorely misguided. 
  Only a short bus rider like Debbie davis  could love this book.This book is the second book in a row this parish character wrote and its boring an old news from the old tabloids.Unless you have lived under the dirt there is nothing new here. Just an obvious attempt to make money. This has been done much better by better writers like Bob Thomas and James bacon and Earl Wilson!!!!- Note- one reviwer wrote Don Johnston of Beach Boys wrote I write the songs. His name is Bruce dear 
 Okay. The premise of this movie had wings. I mean here we have a crazed asylum patient trapped in a spooky hospital for eternity trying to get out.  Fun stuff..right. Not in the hands of this director. I mean, when the only good scare devices you can offer up are an exploding clown and a dog thats had it's day, your in trouble, Mr. Director. Okay..lets try to right some wrongs done by this movie.  Right- Scary Hospital  Wrong- Un Scary plot devices  Right- Dead people making twitching movements Wrong- Exploding Clowns and rushes of violent air ala Evil Dead-       but much worse  Right- My complete and utter hate for the jock in the movie Wrong- My complete and utter hate for all of the actors in this         movie- I mean, come on who in the hell was this Shaft         wannabe and why didn't that dead dog rip a whole in his         cranium before we had to sit through all of his inane        epileptic dialogue.  Right- Use of confined spaces, like an elevator to heighten the         spooky.  Wrong- Too much use of going up the elevator and down the           elevator. I mean if there is such a thing as elevator           sickness, I had it.  Right- The film makers hearts were in the right place with an         attempt to do something a little different.  Wrong- Hey Bubs, listen. This day and age of horror..a little        different is like shooting yourself in the foot.         We horror fans expect more now days..even from grade B        movies.  Wrong- This was obviously a lame attempt to run with the big          dogs aka: Session 9.  Right- Okay everybody makes a big deal about them creeping          past that ghost. They say.."Oh what an intelligent        thing  to do." What? How the helk is that intelligent?          That ghost could have ghost rabies or something!  Okay, I digress. See this film only if you would like to see a rubber clown explode and a dog with no skin. Other than that, don't say I didn't warn ya 
 We bought our 4-year old daughter this V.Smile NODDY video game for Christmas 2006. One particular section of the game involves the child to complete pre-arranged words displayed on the screen. To get right to the point, I nearly fell off the couch when then word SEXY was displayed as part of the game sequence. Perhaps the manufacturer hasn't heard of a WORD FILTER. What's next, F**K?  I have a photograph of the TV showing this exact scene. If Amazon allows me to post the image, I will gladly share it. I intend to also share with the manufacturer, once I locate their website.  SEXY is one of the four-letter words I would prefer not to explain to a 4-year-old child.  
 This is the second Vault guide that I have read, and the second disappointment that I have had with this series.  I really isn't a career guide at all, just a very short back ground on what IB is.  You can find a description of IB on the internet for free.  The only redeeming value is the "day in a life of", but even then, there are only a dozen pages or so.  In all, you can find most of what is in the book for free on the internet.  I won't be buying any more vault products, as they have little information, and more pages of ads for other vault products than pages of usefull information 
 This is a novel about a professor who is slightly cuckoo.  This is a story about a man who is filled with opinions that can not only be considered conservative for our time, but did for his time as well. I used this novel to exercise my Nabokov, and is my least favorite novel by the author.  I am glad he wrote others, because this alone would have stolen Nabokov's artistic genius.  The book is written well, but the plot is immensely boring.  I would suggest you NOT bother reading it. 
 DW Griffith was amongst the early filmmaking pioneers, the battle scenes set the standard for what would follow in the next several decades.   He was also a southerner full of racist angst with a vehicle to vent his toxic spleen. Not only were many of the present day stereotypes of African Americans either started or reinforced by this film he goes one further and rewrites the outcome of the civil war. Anyone who thinks this is an accurate portrayal of reconstruction and the mission of the KKK is sadly mistaken or prone to the same sort regressive school of thought that denies the holocaust, thinks the native Americans had a chance to fight back, and believes the history of man began 6,000 years ago.  This is actually a great tool for teaching tolerance. When it is presented in the classroom most students can plainly see the contradictions between this film and legitimate history.  Those who do not see the contradiction (versus legitimate history) as obvious need to catch up on some reading and/or have some type of moral reevaluation regarding their thinking. 
 Everyone (or nearly everyone) seems to love this book. So, we tried it - and had a visceral negative reaction. We read to our daughter every day. I try hard to stop what I am doing and read to her when she comes toddling up with a book in her hands. For the sake of sanity, we've experimented with picture books, particularly rhyming picture books, but really anything with very brief text so we don't go completely mad with repetition. This is NOT behavior we wanted to introduce to our toddler daughter. That said, when she's older and able to understand that the pigeon's behavior is not to be emulated, we might give this another try. maybe 
 Look I enjoyed the book a lot, but got nearer and nearer to the end and noticed the plot wasn't wrapping up.  I got that awful sinking feeling that I had been suckered into a book without a good ending, without closure, which I HATE.  Sure enough!  At the bottom of the last page they *FINALLY* admit "Armageddon's Children ends here.  The story will continue with the publication of Terry Brooks's next novel."  NOWHERE on the front cover, back cover or ANYWHERE ELSE but on the last page does it mention this.  I hate being manipulated, and that's why I gave the book one star, and why the publisher Del Ray/Ballantine Books will never get another cent from me 
 Dashiel Hammett, author of such classics as THE MALTESE FALCON and THE THIN MAN, certainly deserves credit as one of the originators of the noir genre. Unfortunately RED HARVEST doesn't live up to this reputation.  	RED HARVEST starts with the Continental Op arriving in the mining town of Personville (sometimes called Poisonville). He has been hired by the editor of the local paper, who turns up dead. This editor is also the son of mining magnate Elihu Willsson, who had called in a collection of hooligans to break a strike. What he had not foreseen was the inevitability the criminals would take over the town.   	Originally I had the idea the "red" in the title had something to do with the socialist workers movement or the Wobblies, a logical assumption since Hammett was a communist, but Hammett settles for the obvious, the red meaning murder after murder as  the Continental Op turns the criminals against each other.  	A blurb on the back of the book lauds Hammett for "sharply and economically defined" characters. They're sharply defined all right, so sharply defined that they all run together. Pete the Finn, Lew Yard, Max Thaler and Noonan, the chief of police, could be the same character. At the beginning of the novel, the Continental Op learns the history of conflict from Bill Quint, an I.W.W. organizer from Chicago, but that's pretty much the last we hear from him.   	About the only interesting character in the whole book is the femme fatale, Dinah Brand, but her sole motivation seems to be money.  	Hammett also has problems with resolution of conflict. When painted into a corner, he simply kills off another character.  	Even the Continental Op is pretty much a cipher. He doesn't seem to have much of a background, other than that he's somewhat afraid of the Old Man, who runs the Continental Detective Agency. We know he smokes and drinks too much and even takes cocaine, but other than that he doesn't live up to his cool name. Unfortunately all of this reads like a bad comic book. Even Hammett would have a good laugh at what the New York Times said about RED HARVEST, I would assume in 1929 when it was published: "RED HARVEST is more than a superb crime novel: it is a classic exploration of corruption and violence in the American grain." I'll give him two stars for noir dialogue, but the rest of it is pretty much dreck. 
 I couldn't tell you who this book was about, but it certainly wasn't Elizabeth I.  Portrayed by Gregory as a dependent almost stupid neurotic, this estimation of her character flies in the face of all accepted scholarship.  And the writing isn't so hot, either.  If I had to read one more time that Elizabeth was picking her cuticles, I would have gone mad.  The Other Boleyn Girl is a much better effort 
 I love Sidney Sheldon's books, but I was quite disappointed with this one.  I can't believe it got such good reviews.  The story was fast-paced, interesting, and well written.  However, the ending was awful and frustrating.  It was too abrupt and too many things happened at once, it didn't resolve well.  It was also too much of a let down.  There are definitely better Sidney Sheldon books than this one 
 We've had this coffeemaker for about 10 months now and so far it has worked reasonably well. I have to admit that the coffee is not as hot as I would like it though, when brewed. However what is more upsetting is that the carafe exploded on me today after it had been washed. We are very careful with the carafe and always handwash and take good care of it. Is there a replacement carafe? Can Krups replace this?  Regards, Kavith 
 I am supposed to get 16th edition, instead I received 15th edition. The book was completely changed from the previuos editio 
 This is one of those catch-all biographies that attempts to throw in everything including the kitchen sink and fails in all regards.  The author, D. J. Taylor attempts to connect Orwell's writings with his life but spends so much time on trying to find little kernels of truth in the authors mundane diary entries that he accomplishes almost nothing.  Since Taylor has no ability to write critically about Orwell's works he should have focused on the details of Orwell's life which are easier to record.  Also one gets the feeling that Taylor isn't a fan of Orwell's writing and has little simpathy for his weaknesses in character. So why write the book 
 I picked this book up because it was on a book club's book list.  I actually had to go through InterLibrary Loan to get it since it wasn't available at my library.  After reading and forcing myself to finish it, I envision the head librarian at my branch shredding all copies to line hen cages, which would explain why a book club item wasn't available in a library.  Or perhaps the book club people had gone temporarily mad, who can say.  Many other reviewers have commented on the one-dimensional characters, the wooden pace, the absence of any attempt to sketch character motivation, but no one has mentioned the idiotic prose that flows, page after page, endless as the wine in Salim's cup.  "He looked down, and there was something sticking out from his belly.  It was a sword," is a paraphrased example of what you might find in this book, or with equal probability and more purpose, on an SNL skit.  This is a badly written book, if you had no interest in Mughal history, you will not have any interest in it after reading this book.  If you thought that was a wonderful period rich in complexity, you'd shred this book and line the hen cages too 
 Now don't get me wrong: I'm all in favor of Bloom's now-unfashionable liberal-humanist method of interpretation arising, as it must, from balancing wide experience with close reading.  In fact, I'm in favor of any critical approach that illuminates, appreciates, elucidates, and speculates, as long as it's coherent and interesting to read. I agree with Bloom that contemporary criticism has become mostly an unreadable, hidebound, tendentious parody of itself written, primarily to earn tenure, written largely by embittered academics who are mad as hell that they have so little influence on the ways of the world.     Others may disagree.  Yet, for all Bloom's specialized knowledge and obvious passion for Shakespeare, his magnum opus poorly serves the purposes of good criticism.  Who is he writing for? Other critics, it would seem. To appreciate Bloom's book, unlike the work of, say, Harold Goddard, whose name Bloom invokes as a model, you have to know plenty about Shakespeare already. Thhis isn't a book for beginners.  You also need to overlook Bloom's tendency toward vagueness and lack of cohesiveness.  Granted, there's so much even one writer can say about Shakespeare that it's difficult to write tightly and concisely, but Bloom's commentaries do seem to ramble with insufficient emphases and rather hazy direction. I felt a less than agreeable mixture of tedium, annoyance, and uncertainty as I read Bloom's "Shakespeare."  It's hard to believe he's writing about the Western world's most read, most honored, most brilliant, most resourceful author.  The excitement that Bloom  felt as a youngster reading the plays and the poems for the first time just doesn't come through.  His initial enthusiasm has morphed into deep and abstract thought that only another literary critic will appreciate. And, of course, not all of them.  This would have been a great book if somebody else had written it.  Somebody like the now-derided but wonderfully readable A.C. Bradley, whose work on Shakespearean tragedy is still in print and still great after one hundred years.  (When Bradley wastes your time - an exaggeration, really - by speculating, for example, on how many children Lady Macbeth really had, he has the courtesy to do so in an appendix.) It seems symptomatic of their approaches that Bradley, also a liberal critic, was overwhelmed by how closely Shakespeare got his characters to resemble us.  For Bloom, it's vice versa. If you think that's an interesting idea (and it is), don't get your hopes too high: it gets submerged, like most of Bloom's interesting ideas, in the enclosing sea of rumination.     
 When I started reading this book, I was hopeful that it would be an insightful commentary on the ridiculous nature of politically-correct word choice.  Unfortunately, I did not find it to be particularly clever or funny.  On some level, it seems like the PC craze has subsided since the mid-90's when the book was written, and it just doesn't read as the brilliant critique that I expected.  We've now heard so many silly descriptions followed by the suffix "challenged" that it just isn't funny anymore.  I suppose that this book worked much better when it was written, but it hasn't aged well over the ten years since 
 I bought this item because Amazon never had the 3M model I wanted in stock.  So I settled for this one.  That was a big mistake.  The wheels on this stand are only about 8 inches apart which makes your CPU very unstable.  The spring steel friction fit makes it difficult for one person to attach or remove this stand from the CPU.  It is really a two person operation.  Finally, if your CPU has a side access panel, you will have to remove it from the stand to gain access since the stand uses a pressure fit to hold it to the computer.  Take a look at the 3M CS100 stand.  I think it is a much better design 
 Light is beautiful and functional, and so great for traveling, but first LED light failed almost immediately and second after about 2 months.  Too bad. 
 One very funny song...(Flushed down the Pipes), rest is rather dull, and humorless, unless of course forgettable tunes and less memorable lyrics are your bag.  Only for the die-hard cast recording collector...which sadly I've become.  (If you want a funny show about trailer trash, buy the DVD Sordid Lives)

 Ralph Bakshi's boho fantasy Wizards, like Richard Williams' doomed Thief and the Cobbler, is a reaction against Disney animated features and shares many of its flaws, as well as many of its own. For all his talk about wanting to show Disney how to tell a real story with real passion, there's a real lack of story and worse, a real lack of feeling that the dull characters and disinterested vocal performances only draw attention to. But perhaps most fatal of all is the largely uninteresting animation that often seems pitched somewhere between Filmation and underground comics, with the more interesting (and potentially expensive) sequences played purely as two-tone still concept images with Susan Tyrell's flat narration giving the film an uncompleted work-in-progress look. The use of crudely rotoscoped footage from El Cid, Alexander Nevsky and Zulu for the choppy battle scenes is also rather too awkward to work, especially since it is never properly integrated with the genuinely animated characters. At its heart there's a vaguely interesting notion (it's certainly not developed enough to be called an idea) about the war between technology and magic - embodied by two brother wizards at each others throats for thousands of years - coming to a head when the bad one discovers the motivating power of Nazi propaganda, but too often it's simply clumsily reacting against the Disney formula rather than telling a story and you can see all too clearly the early signs of just how badly Bakshi would mess up The Lord of the Rings here.  Still, Fox's DVD boasts a nice widescreen transfer and a good selection of extras - an audio commentary by Bakshi and a 35-minute documentary on him and the film, various stills galleries, TV spot and two trailers. 
 I found this book was written like a comedy but because it only made me laugh once it was just silly. Comedy is one of those itchy things that you either get it, and love it or you don't. I didn't. I found the dialect frustrating: It was supposed to be set in Kent but the dialect read more like northern England, you have to read it slower to work out what is being said and in doing so you lose your attention slightly which takes the edge off the humour to the extent that you're not even aware that humour is present. At least that's what it was like for me. Whatever the nasty thing in the cowshed was isn't explained in the end but you're left feeling that there is a hint of bestiality that didn't really suit the book, being or trying to be a comedy, hence the lack of explanation. I've given it two stars because when Gibbons takes a step back and looks at the overall picture she has a great way of describing scenes 
 This could be the dumbest movie ever made (and that's a bold statement to make when one considers that "Underworld" also exists).  Sadly, unlike "Underworld" there is no leather clad Kate Beckinsale to drool over. Instead, we are treated to a movie that could easily be confused for a map of the human DNA (but a human with an extra chromosome).  Jason Statham, so likable in "Snatch", "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "The Italian Job" is thoroughly wasted in this flick.  When he's not busy escaping from his tricked out house, driving fast whilst looking cool and beating up on clichéd Euro trash delivers lines such as "Rule #1. Never change the deal" and is expected to act with a straight face when he's the recipient of this type of drivel - "You're always complaining, except when we make love. Then you say nothing.".  Thankfully, the one thing Stetham is great at is keeping a straight face. But you won't.  Not if you have a brain, that is 
 Kimmel and Messner are acomplished researchers, yet I find no reason for the "cute" little additions such as average male size charts and sarcastic quizes revolving around the "gay or straight" issues.  We are saturated with sexuality in our day and age, we don't need it from our scholars as well 
 I am an Electrical Engineer in graduate school studying Information Systems and this book was definitely written for professionals currently in the IS industry, working in systems analysis. The book illustrates  techniques in a very broad manner and utilizes vague generalizations.  Definitely NOT for  inexperienced IS individuals 
 There is an interesting comparison to be made between Ingmar Bergman's classic "The Virgin Spring" and the grisly exploitation shocker it inspired, "Last House on the Left" by Wes Craven.  They share identical plots, feature graphic rape scenes, and before it's all over turn average men into murderers.  And yet one is considered to be a bona fide classic and 1961's Oscar-winning Best Foreign Film--and the other appreciated only in underground circles, but largely reviled as cheap gruesome exploitation.  So just how different are they?  Not as different as you might imagine--but as different as art and exploitation.  "The Virgin Spring" is easily one of Bergman's most accessible films.  Telling a simple story in a straightforward fashion, he exposes a frankness and brutality people weren't accustomed to seeing.  A young girl venturing through the woods encounters two men and a boy.  Though they initially seem helpful, their actions quickly become violent.  After a graphic (for the time) rape, the girl is murdered.  Later, the wrongdoers happen upon the girl's home and seek shelter from her family--both groups unaware of who the other is.  Suspicions start to arise and vengeance is sought.  It is a powerful tale of love, loss and the depths people can be driven into--where they become unable to stop themselves from betraying their faith and moral code, where savagery and rage take over.  Bergman's film benefits greatly from a stellar lead performance by Max von Sydow as the father.  Real conflict and raw emotion burn up the screen.  Add the beautiful cinematography and haunting score and it's a winning combination.  But what endures in the story of "The Virgin Spring" is how strong a component faith becomes--when there is nothing left to believe in, can you still believe?  A classic in every sense, "The Virgin Spring" still has the power to shock but there's something very redemptive about the film.  "Last House on the Left," however, is probably more notorious than acclaimed.  The plot, as I've said, is identical.  Coming 12 years later, in 1972, Wes Craven was at the beginning of his career and sought to retell this tale.  It is a shocker, and the scenes of rape and murder clearly foreshadow the "torture cinema" of today.  It is brutal, uncompromising and graphic--and the film was championed in the underground horror market.  Working with a small budget, the film lacks the artistry of "The Virgin Spring."  While it still packs a visceral punch and has the power to shock--what it lacks is depth and subtlety.  The characters aren't particularly drawn out so their actions don't have the emotional resonance of the earlier film.  Without contemplating faith and moral choices, what we're left with is straightforward revenge.  And the film, ultimately, has no redemption--no uplift.  It's violence for the sake of violence.  It remains a historically significant precursor and influence on other shock films without being a particularly good movie in it's own right.     And therein lies the difference between art and exploitation.   KGHarris, 11/06 
 I know I was supposed to find Jim Lynch's debut novel, "The Highest Tide," wonderous(!), and magical(!) and mystical(!).  Surely, the diminutive precocious hero of the book, young Miles O'Malley (who has a particular knack for finding odd sea life on his late night strolls along the beach of the Puget Sound) is irresistible(!), and inspirational(!).  As you can tell from my sarcasm, none of it really worked for me.  It's not that I really despised the book -- it's just that I don't like when an author tries to awe me on every other page.  By about the middle of the book, I started getting pretty bored with not only Miles, but also with his rough-around-the-edges air guitar playing side-kick, Phelps; the totally messed up love of his life, Angie; and his best friend, the elderly, new age spouting, prophetic, Florence.  The last described character especially annoyed me, in the way her off the wall predictions always came true.  I guess we have to trust the author's depiction about the sea-life that he describes.  I don't know about you, but I'm not about to start researching the sex lives of barnacles, clams and mussels for verification purposes.  Although, I admit it would be kind of neat to find a giant squid washed up on the beach.   
 While the book had some valid points, Peterson's main thrust seemed to be promotion of his own Bible translation and criticism of other scholars. The argument that "X says Y, but he's pretentious so don't listen to him." I bought this to read for a book group and our response was pretty similiar. While it persuade me to sit down and read the Bible more regularly it didn't teach me much about "the art of spiritual reading". It just told it was important to be grounded in the scriptures.

 THE LORD OF THE RINGS   I was a teenager back in the mid and late 70s, and JRR Tolkien's popularity was inescapable. I started reading THE HOBBIT, which is a little prequel to this. I don't think I finished it, and I know I never tackled THE LORD OF THE RINGS. I found Tolkien hard to read. Imaginative, sure, and no doubt thematic, but it was like Margaret Mitchell. Unreadable. (Don't start -- I'm from the South.)   Later, I saw an animated version of the trilogy on TV which lasted somewhere between 90 and 120 minutes. Naturally it made no sense, because you can't compress all that into such a short time span.   Then, I gave up on Tolkien and played another game of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. I was addicted, folks. Role Playing Games are an author's playground. I didn't play as much as I wanted, because I was too much in demand as a Dungeon Master. Naturally.   But now, in this millennium, let's watch some movies! I live in China, where the trilogy cost me 20 yuan. For those keeping score at home, about US$2.50.   THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING   It was a bit slow getting started, presenting all the back story, but I was surprised later on when I needed it and remembered it so well. Okay, yep, Tolkien's got game. Given his popularity, one would sincerely hope so.   You absolutely have to love the look of Middle Earth. How are they able to adjust everybody's heights? Most of the special effects are impressive.   Most importantly, somehow I feel sure the filmmaker stayed true to Tolkien's vision. In fact, I read somewhere that he did.   I never found elves quite so annoying in my Dungeons & Dragons days as I do now. I bet they never sweat, do they? They talk in riddles and glow too much, but I guess that happens when you live too long.   The various species are quite distinguishable, aren't they? So are different members of the same species. This is masterful. It's a skill far too few modern authors possess. Either everybody in the book seems like the same person, or else each character seems to belong to a stereotype of some sort. Tolkien avoids both pitfalls while simultaneously acknowledging that, yes, sometimes it's reassuring to a person/character to have a stereotype to fall back upon for a sense of identity when circumstances require.   Once our fellowship finally goes into battle, we get some great sequences. Among many fine performances, those of Frodo and Gandalf stand out in my mind. Oh, and "never toss a dwarf," which I KNOW Tolkien didn't write. Anxiously awaiting part two.   THE TWO TOWERS   What's more boring than real world politics? Fictional politics! I don't believe Tolkien spent this much time on the war aspect. Well, I hope he didn't. Saruman makes a bunch of uber-Orcs and sics 'em on humanity. Fine. We don't need a cast of thousands to spend hours in mock battles. Nor do we need the lamest excuse for a "love story" in cinematic history.   But once we FINALLY get past all that, I believe we get back to the Tolkien vision. Here's hoping we stay there for part three.   (Two hours, two paragraphs. What's wrong with this picture?)   THE RETURN OF THE KING   A balanced attack. That's what THE TWO TOWERS lacks but THE RETURN OF THE KING has. By this, I mean that long sustained fight sequences are boring. That's not your "action," unless your name's Jackie Chan. Give us just enough fight to let us move from plot point to plot point, then switch over to the real conflict before we get bored and leave the theater.   {No hate mail from Jackie Chan fans, please. I love SHANGHAI NOON.}   The real drama comes in the interpersonal, and in Frodo versus that @#$%^* ring. Gollum is one freaky deaky, ain't he? Liv Tyler is still unwatchable, but fortunately her screen time was minimal.   We get very close to the end of this film before Hollywood excess creeps into the war scenes. Those very cool elephants, for example, seem unstoppable. I was quite impressed with Orlando Bloom's quietly effective performances, but I'll never believe his computer simulated double took down one of those big bad muthas. Those elephants are doomsday machines, and the heroes' strongholds were Hiroshima and Nagasaki.   Meanwhile back at the ranch, perhaps we had one too many dramatic rescues that stretched credibility. Sam the Hobbit versus HOW MANY orcs? Um, lest we forget, he's only a freakin hobbit!   I don't know if it was the screenwriters who wrote themselves into a corner or perhaps Tolkien himself. But, well, somebody damn sure did. Let's floor the gas over those speedbumps and see what's on the other side.   Unlike some critics, I appreciated that this film didn't end at the "climax." We needed some more time to just hang out in Middle Earth, well over 9 hours after we entered the place, without all that pseudo-violent cast-of-thousands FX crap.   However, anyone who left on the elf ships is a geeberhead, and that includes the entire elven race. You can leave your Shire without leaving your world, Tolkien. I did. I've been in China since 1999.   THE VERDICT   I appreciate Tolkien's imagination, and I'm glad the film people made this. But I know it could be so much better with an editor. Yeah, I'm talking about changing what Tolkien wrote if required.   (There goes another subscriber...)   I read somewhere that so many people write in this genre because they don't think Tolkien wrote enough. I disagree. I think they write in this genre because they know they can do it better.   (And there goes another subscriber...)   Nothing about this movie changed my opinion. I was happy to watch it once, but I can't imagine anyone wading through it twice. I've swapped it for a copy of the GODFATHER trilogy, which I'll review in a future issue of WHO MOVED MY RICE?  
 Well here we have it - a book AGAINST the age of progress. This guy is FOR keeping PARALYZED PEOPLE PARALYZED. This guy is FOR KEEPING AMPUTEES AMPTUTATED. This is guy is for KEEPING DEPRESSED SUICIDAL PEOPLE DEPRESSED AND SUICIDAL. Its because of this attitude that neoluddites like this cannot win 
 Yikes - who edited this thing?  While there are a few gems, I felt like I was reading a book with half the pages missing.  Clearly, material is taken from his other books and recycled for this one, but he might have checked to make sure that all the referenced graphs and text were actually in the book!  Numerous times I was flipping around to try to find a chart he was talking about, only to find that it wasn't anywhere in the book.  You get the impression quickly that this was churned out to scrape in some extra dough.  Larry's writing style is "conversational" - and that's a charitable way to describe it.  Despite all these flaws, there is some good info, and some good trading ideas, but I can't recommend it 
 I want to make a short comment here: 1) This book is quite confusing. It mixed up the real story with the make up one. 2) Saying that Ramanujun thought Goldbach Conjecture is wrong was a huge mistake. Everyone believe that Goldbach Conjecture is true. And Ramanujun is a real genius. I cannot stand this make up part 
 I've owned a number of Krups products, including a 17 year old steam espresso maker, and over the years have been consistently very pleased with the design, quality and reliability of the Krups products.  So I decided that it would be nice to have a new espresso maker, perhaps one that has more options and can brew more a bit faster.  After looking at the various products and the reviews of the XP4050 here on Amazon I was somewhat concerned but nevertheless ordered this machine because it appeared to be about what I was seeking.  The reviews gave me some pause but in the end I dismissed them, crediting Krups for past performance and assuming the reviewers were just incompetent or were not patient enough to learn to use the product properly.   HAH!  Boy was I wrong.  My first clue that there was something different about this item was the instruction manual.  I am able to read several languages and was amused to see that the instructions, while close, were not the same in each language.  In fact there were recipes in some languages that were missing from the English version.  What's THAT about?  Then we I tried making my first batch of espresso I found that, as others have complained, I made a mess trying to load the filter.  The next disappointment was the brew... I followed the instructions to the letter (such as they are) and the result was a pretty poor example of espresso.  The attachment for frothing/steaming the milk was not much better and also made a mess.  I put the liquids together for a latté.  Okay... I was impressed with how smooth the taste was, but the espresso itself was just plain pathetic; weak, especially compared to the output of my old machine.  So I gave it another try, this time with twice the coffee and tamping it down more and created another counter-top mess.  This time the brew was stronger, still very smooth, but only about 2/3 the quantity.   Consternation was setting in.  Then I discovered that the drip tray was FULL of liquid!?!  What the heck?  I tried every darn way I could come up with to brew a decent latté over the next couple weeks.  Alas, it was to no avail, each attempt was disappointing in some crucial aspect.  I called Krups and the very nice people suggested that if I was actually doing everything correctly then the unit must be faulty and I should send it in.  I knew that one of my attempts should have been somewhere close to the realm of doing it correctly so I doubt that there is anything faulty with my machine.  I also suspect this since my complaints echoed those I had read.  What a failure this thing is!  I am happily back to using my antique Krups unit that cost me $49, 17 years ago and the XP4050 is in route back.  Each morning I produce a wonderful, adequately strong espresso and the steamed milk is perfectly frothed.  I should have been happy with the old machine all along.  I am so sorry I doubted the other reviewers 
 I should have listened to the other reviewers...  I wanted to replace my C: drive with a faster one, and Ghost 10.0 says it can do it, but don't be fooled.  Even if you follow the extra steps from their support site (which are not in the documentation), you will end up with an unusable copy that will boot up but then fail with assorted catastrophic errors.  It will also give you occasional error messages that are neither in the documentation nor on their support site.  A friend recommended Acronis TrueImage which I ended using instead.  It's much easier to use, copies about 2x faster than Ghost, and best of all it works.  I cloned and replaced C drives from two laptops in a couple of hours with no problems.  
 I would've given this film 0 Stars if it would have let me. I've seen every werewolf movie from Naschy's Mexican lycanthropic romps to every installation of the Howling and I have NEVER seen a worse werewolf movie. Anyone who liked the special effects in this one would be impressed with the graphics from old Atari videogames -- seriously, it's that bad. And acting? Give oscars to the cast from Plan 9 from Outer Space and attack of the Killer Tomatoes compared with the performances in this piece of celluloid trash. No..it's not even good enough to be in the same category as trash. Let's see what else, oh yeah a plot? Nope, none to speak of here. The sex and nudity is the only reason I even finished it. Do yourself a favor and avoid this flick like rabies, or you'll find yourself wishing you had the last hour and a half of your life back 
 Really liked it.   Would have rated it 4-star. But last night it suddenly stopped working and would not turn  on anymore. Only the clock works. Just one month out of warranty. From other reviews, this seems to be a common problem 
 ...but it's true.  Sammy's gone country.  There are 2 MAYBE 3 tracks on this whole album that are any good.  My taste in music is very broad with one exception - country.  If I had to name one rock icon of mine, it would be Sammy and...Sammy...you really let me down with this album.  It pains me to say so, but I can't recommend this album to the classic Hagar rock fan 
 If you are going to Walt Disney World Resort for the first time and want to keep some mystery until you actually ride the attractions, then this book may not be for you.  Some of the descriptions for the various attractions go step-by-step through them, including plot points in 3D movies and so on. The book also leaves a lot out in other areas, such as dining (little coverage), getting around Walt Disney World, and off-site hotels and dining.  For me, the Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World (by Bob Sehlinger) was much better at giving me the info I needed without giving away any details as to the surprises on the rides. That is, it told me what might frighten a youngster, what might bore an adult, and so on, but it didn't say specifically what would happen at every stage of any of the attractions. Just generalizations about the ride, then specific warnings for different types of people.  The only things Birnbaum offers that the Unofficial Guide doesn't are pictures and info on some of the ancillary activities such as parasailing. If you have an Internet connection, you don't need the pictures.  And as for the ancillary activities as well as nice maps, you can't beat the Passporter book on Disney World.  So, for me, the Unofficial Guide plus the Passporter yields the best trip planning library for Walt Disney World.  If you like, you can also pick up the EZ-Guide, as it also has some interesting maps and info.  As for Birnbaum's, it really doesn't have anything to offer.  I wouldn't recommend against buying it, though, except for the "let me tell you the plot and ending to the movie before you go" mentality. I hate spoilers, and wish someone had warned me before I started reading this book 
 I should have read the description more closely.  It is 96 pages including index, etc.  It is taller than Joy of Cooking but as skinny as the free blooklet you get when you buy a slow cooker, making it difficult to handle.  The recipies look OK, nothing caught my fancy, but this book was NOT worth the money to buy.  I have the Better Homes and Garden crocery cooker book and it is great.  Perhaps as a first book it would be OK 
 If you're looking for an historical overview of the subject -- go elsewhere.   Unless you're fascinated by the etiology of the language which evolved on the subject matter, this is a very disappointing read on the subject of the terrorism in Argentina 
 This is a very uninteresting book on the subject.  Much more could have been done about this important subject.  There was absolutely nothing of value in this sheer waste of paper and trees.. 
 There is WAY TOO MUCH going on in this story..Hollywood glamour, Indian mythology, Anthropology, Domestic violence...rates down with romance novels. This is definately not the author's best. I am thinking of giving up on it. A BIG disappointment! 
 I read this book in a bookstore in about 20 minutes. I have to admit it was funnier than Mad Magazine. But the question that arises is this: have all these people who gave it 5 stars now acquired the ability to look into  the future and accurately pick lottery numbers? No!  Then this must be two  sesame seed buns with no pattie. Bummer! I was going to buy it and win big 
 Bill is very boring typically talks about business tips you already know.  The show was much better, you should buy that.  Kwame is much smater and deserved the job.  I can tell that this book is another promotional tool.  Don't waste even a cent on this book 
 The title character does not get much screen time in this film.  He doesn't even get any lines (most of his yells are done so that you can't see his mouth).  This is really the story of Jane.  Jane has decided to go to Africa to search for her father who left her and her mother many years before.  On the way she must defend her virtue, kill the crew of the boat she hired, and pilot the boat to her father.  There she finds a man who seems to have had his brains baked in the sun a little too long.  Eventually they all go off to search an escarpment to find the elephant's graveyard.  Once on top they find the giant inland sea and a bizarre tribe living near the graveyard (we only see one dead elephant so at the time I did not know the "graveyard" had been found).  They also run into Tarzan who has the habit of not speaking and passing out whenever he exerts himself.  I really got the feeling that the only thing any of the film's creators knew about Tarzan was what they had learned from Johnny Weissmuller films.  The escarpment seems to be about half the continent.  It is nearly impossible to climb so I don't know how dying elephants manage to get up it.  Jane's experiences with the bizarre tribe (where she gets painted white) seem to have been lifted from Ursula Andress's film Slave Of The Cannibal God.  There is very little that is right with this film (other than that it does finally end).  Jane goes from super-able to a frightened schoolgirl but eventually falls for Tarzan and reconciles with her father.  But in the end it is not really worth watching.  For viewers who are hoping to see Bo Derek nude, almost all of that is found during the closing credits so you might as well just skip right to them. 
 This set of CD's never arrived. They must have been delivered to the wrong address. So I am disappointed to never have heard them 
 As a rule, I'll give a book 50 pages to get interesting. After that, I'll put it down.  I went to 75 with this book and it still disappointed.   It was excessively laden with detail and not light reading. Other documentaries (notably those by Iris Chang) have given a lot of historical detail and yet still were interesting and easy to read.  I've not suitable alternatives to suggest, but I know that at least one other book has been written that has been as boring as this one. And that's not because I've found that book, but because I know that no other book can be as boring as this one was 
 Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.    I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.  I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.  Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.  I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.    
 This album is waaay too deep and self-indulgent for my taste. Being a huge Alan Parsons Fan, it pains me to have to say this, but this was almost a total waste of vinyl, energy and money 
 i have not read this book...i would look at it if someone tossed it to me, but i will not go out of my way to look at it, nor would i purchase it...for the simple reason that the author, mr. barkun, appeared on c-span, and engaged in a tag-team attack on one of the subjects of his screed, alex jones, along with the host, brian lamb...ANDDDD more importantly, he refused to appear on Jones' show when Jones invited him to discuss what he'd written, and what he'd said...and he apparently did not even interview jones for his book, which is inexcusable negligence from someone who purports to be a scholar - or from any author for that matter.. 
 I think this book was the boringest, and dumbest book ever!   But I have to say that the movie was pretty good and funny so you have to give that credit 
 This book was ok . Its sad because Gebu beats Ranofer but the ending stunk 
 I read a review on Rage Against the Machine that claimed this band is "a million times better" than RATM.  I have only one problem with that opinion - it's wrong.  These guys have a pretty good sound.  Nice, hard riffs and basslines, but I think they could've found a better singer.  This guy has a major speech impediment.  The vocals don't even sound like English, for Webster's sake!!  And those song titles???  Some are legible, but most look like Greek to me.  How about a little spell check next time?!  I AM over the age of 13 
 I was quite upset after receiving this book to find I have had read it years before. This should be stated in the ad about the book. Although , I love Mrs. Delinsky's books, I have found her and her publishers to make this a habit!  Plus I was charged to return it..... 
 Just having read Julia Child's "My Life In France";Anthony Bourdain's "The Nasty Bits;, and, Bill Buford's "Heat" (all beautifully and wryly written); I found Ms. Greene's memoir sleazy and extremely self-absorbed.  Ms. Greene was living in a halcyon period of evolution in the history of cooking in America; but alas, she was more engaged in her own glorification.  Way too much self-promotion and not much real information on the wonderful awakening of Americal's taste buds and techniques in the kitchen 
 Grisham's worst book by far.  90% of the story is preaching to the reader that homeless people just have bad luck and are good guys.  It would be ok if that was woven into a good story, but it is not.   For great Grisham read The Firm and The Partner.  For very good, read Runaway Jury and Pelican Brief.  All of these are page turners.  Street Lawyer is a stomache turner.  Really bad.  What happened 
 Atheists have a lower divorce rate than born again christians but I guess thats just a fluke hu, Ann. They must be bad people somehow. People like Ann can't be christians because they shame one person for having an affair and then forgive another that is an alcoholic because he's a republican. She speaks to people who want to believe so bad they don't care that she doesn't have a christian bone in her body. True christians don't defame, judge or claime superiority. She doesn't have any idea of what being Jesus-like is. Oh and intelligent design is not science. Science is how Religion is why- They are too different questions 
 Disliked table.  Each time table was set-up, legs had to be attached by the support rods.  This was not an easy process nor done quickly.  The face hole in table was not useful to me and was very uncomfortable.  1 Star for this item is too much for my usage and review.  I sent it back 
 This book would have been more suitable as a graduate level business course text book rather than as a "suspence" novel.  It was boring.  Although Ludlum is a favorite author, this boring attempt at  suspence took him down in my estimation 
 I would be better off with the single edition than the deluxe.  The price is TOO HIGH for it in some stores--$27, $28, $34 or $32 in some places.  This sounds more like a greed thing for Boyz II Men than the music itself.  Plus the song selection isn't very well done with the remixes and other songs along with the hits.  I liked the 13-song set of this album better than this bloated package.  The high price for it is a complete turnoff and it should have been affordable for the consumer.  While Boyz II Men get high marks for their music and harmonizing, this double CD packaging comes off as distracting and misguiding and not as well done as other artists' greatest hits' compilations 
 The main disappointment with this movie was the excessive number of shots of the cars zipping through empty roads as compared to the number of points won by mowing down citizens. Actually not that many of the latter - the satire (such as it is) could have been much sharper and more extravagant here. Did the Director feel that stepping up that side of it would be too shocking?   Otherwise the movie has an agreeable facile sense of the period (bad hair styles, would-be funky music, absurd sets, inane plot, cheapo design all round). So worth a watch. But not the witty classic I had expected 
 I JUST CANT UNDERSTAND AS TO WHY WOULD ANYONE IN HIS RIGHT MIND LIKE THIS LOUSY BAND.THEY ARE JUST A BOY BAND WITH GUITARS.THEIR MUSIC AND ALBUMS SUCK HORRIBLY. GET ANY ALBUM FROM LEGENDS LIKE PINK FLOYD AND LED ZEPPELIN INSTEAD 
 Another book that is written like hearing a narrative. I would not recommend this bok for any reader 
 For some time I've been buying a new Palm every couple of years. This is first time I've really regretted my purchase.  I'm now on my third Tungsten T5, having sent one, then another, in for warranty "repair." (Really, they just replaced it.) The second one froze up and died after only one month. At least the first one had lasted a few months before it died.  Even the replacement I just got crashes with regularity. I haven't even installed any third-party software on it yet. The touch-screen goes completely out of alignment every few hours, sometimes so badly I can hardly get into "Settings" to fix it. The SD card reader is also not working. I probably won't send it back over that though, because I'm sick of paying to send it in for "repairs."  When it's working properly, I generally like it. I'm annoyed that it has no "vibrate" function, though. I don't know why they eliminated it. And I wish it had WiFi capability instead of just Bluetooth.  At this point, I'd really just like to get my money back but it's too late. 
 Once again Gary Null "Phd" recycles information into another GN book with his one size fits all vegeterian diet and vits and supplements. Gary Null is probably the only author that carries a Phd and fails to reveal where he got his BA, MA and Phd. A quick reading of Quakwatch.com shows that Gary Null has  "nontraditional" credentials and owns a multi-million dollar supplement company. He also sells everything from magnets to water and air filters.   The confusing thing is why someone consuming a nutrient dense diet of organic vegetables, fruit and legumes would need supplements at all. The only reason I could think of is it is a bait and switch technique since most people unable to continue any diet that is restrictive, time consuming and costly give up. So GN conveniently has dozens of vits, supplements, and food replacement products to fill in the gap. I estimate the cost of following GN recommendations in full it would cost about $600 per person a month. To prove my point GN for decades has been against chocolate but recently he has added a GN "healthy" chocolate bar to his portfolio. Gary hooks people in by promising the fountain of youth and eternal life. Interestingly this 60 plus year old finds it necessary to put a old stock photo of himself in his books. 
 Well, truth be told, I am a die hard Barbara Michaels fan (aka. Elizabeth Peters).  I exausted my Barbara books and decided to switch to one of her Elizabeth Peters novels.  Since I didn't want to get into a whole series like the Peabody series or what not, I picked this book.     What a let down!!!    OK, it kept my intrest and wasen't a total waste of time, but the story was predictable from the middle of the book.  Maybe even the beginning. Normaly when I read one of her books I feverishly tear through the last 20 pages or so.  Yeah, this one contained the quintessential explination and the "wrap up", but there was no basis to it.  I came to the last page and thought  THATS IT, you gotta be kidding me.  
 The first twenty pages of the book quickly sparks your interest but soon after that, the story drags until it picks back up again toward the last third of the book.  I think the story would have been more credible if Barr would have thoroughly explored the inner workings of her fictional religious sect and offered more details about it.  Without those details, the book seemed "unfinished".  It was like watching a movie and only viewing the actions of the good guy without being exposed to villain.  Boring in my opinion.                                                                                                                                                                                            
 Malcolm aka Big Momma comes back after the original became a big hit about 6 years ago. Martin Lawrence again wears a fat suit to play the role of BM, undercover agent in the disguise of obese Southern lady. The fact that this sequel reached the No. 1 in the US box office chart, getting more than $70 million proves that people (at least in the United States) fondly remembered the original film, and wanted to see what Martin Laurence can do. Not much, it turns out, except for the more family-oriented taste and a few precious laughs.   It is pointless to pick out the countless plot holes of `Big Momma's House 2' in which Malcolm is now doing less dangerous jobs like publicity activities. After his former partner's death in the line of duty, Malcolm again disguises himself as Big Momma in order that he can get some information about the killers.  This time Malcolm/Big Momma is employed as nanny because he must infiltrate a dysfunctional family. This is an obvious rip-off of `Mrs. Doubtfire' but instead of doing Robin Williams' over-the-top turns, Martin Laurence shows less manic schticks than you expect. You seldom see sexual innuendoes, nor hear dirty words from him. This is the same road where Eddie Murphy went years ago (from `Raw' to `Dr, Dolittle'), and though it is an understandable choice, it may also be killing some of Laurence's merits as funny man.  The whole film goes on like autopilot, and everything is predictable. Laurence does not seem very interested in what he is doing, and the supporting actors are at best so-so. The technical staff did a fine job to make Laurence a fat lady, to be sure, and some scenes include Big Momma in a scanty bathing suit ala Bo Derek, which must be a touch task for anyone involved, but those outrageous ideas that could have invigorated the tepid script are hardly to be seen during the entire film.  `Big Momma's House' is just another pointless sequel from Hollywood and Martin Lawrence, who seriously needs a hit. Strictly for his avid fans 
 THIS IS THE SECOND ( IN SIX MONTHS ) OF THESE UNITS I HAVE BOUGHT. ONLY FOR THE SPECS AND ESPECCIALLY THE SIZE. THE BATTERY FOLDS OVER , FLAT ON THE BACK OF THE SCREEN SO IT IS LESS BULKY. HOWEVER I FOUND OUT THEY DON'T LAST VERY LONG . THE FIRST UNIT THE HINGES JUST SNAPPED OFF, THE SECOND, THE SCREEN WENT DEAD AFTER ONLY DAYS OF USE 
 Community Playhouse in Long Beach did the show this August. As it played, the plot didn't come through, but the wit of Shaw did. The playhouse didn't have the costumes of the military men, nor the actors to carry-off the pomp and bravado of these would-be heroes. In a time when G.W. Bush is fighting his own phantasmic enemies this play should have lapooned the whole spectre of military madness. George Bernard Shaw gave us the theme it will take some imagination and talent to make it contemporary and equal to the madness of our times. Ano 
 Someone bought this 3D DVD for my almost 5 year old daughter.  We thought the special effects would be fascinating and they were.  However,  within minutes of the movie's beginning my daughter was in tears. I won't say why but she found the plot frightening.  Several times during the movie I tried to talk her out of watching but she wanted to see what happened in the end.  Fortunately the movie is relatively short.  Overall, I found the story to be a cynical look at Christmas.  As an adult, I think it might be humourous to watch after a hard day of Christmas shopping but I urge caution before showing it to young children.  There was way too much animated violence to match the spirit of Christmas 
 Weak philosophical analysis.  I expected much more thoughtful discourse.   All I found was "I believe, so there" 
 I'm surprised this travesty is still in print.  "Not in McLuhan's style" is a kind understatement; Powers demonstrates flagrant misunderstanding and confusion of basic McLuhanesque ideas.  Try 'Laws of  Media' or 'Understanding Electric Language' instead 
 i'm very sorry i bought this book.  It may be concise, and it may be cheaper, but one shouldn't sacrifice spelling for saving a few dollars!  The concise edition drops the dots off many of the letters, thus either misspelling the word or creating letters that don't exist.  i borrowed the full-sized edition and found it to be fine.  Don't waste your money and your sanity on this version 
 I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.  But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books 
 I get the story line but 5 grown women need to suicide!?  The one dare to have a boyfriend and not go home for the night.  Why would that kind of free sprite would kill herself!?!?  It is not matching the character 
 If you are taking an introduction to genetics course, this book is difficult to understand. It seemingly presents the concepts for those that have had previous knowledge of genetics. The chapters on Mendelian Genetics, Mitosis, and Meiosis are done well, but later chapters dealing with regulation, mutation, transcription, and translation are difficult to understand. The pictures are not very helpful, either. If this book is required for your introductory genetics course, i recommend getting another book in addition to this one 
 I found this book completely useless except for a paperweight or doorstop!  What I did find interesting is that Vickie Adkins-Marcum seems to review all of Matthew Lesko's books.  Of course Vickie highly exalts him using such phrases as "KUDOS to Matthew Lesko! He's making this world a better place!"  For those of you who are a little slow, let me inform you that Vickie Adkins-Marcum is really Matthew Lesko, or someone Matthew gave this review to and paid Vickie to post it.  It's strange that Vickie's reviews all start out with the same first paragraph and have many of the same phrases throughout.  It is also strange that Vickie only reviews Matthew's books.  Shame on you Matthew Lesko for writing your own review 
 Now Amazon has reviews for the movie that I am reviewing-'North and South Shaolin' and a Jet Li Shaolin Temple movie.  Now I can guarantee you that the 3 Jet Li 'Shaolin Temple' movies are great but this one is kind of a dud.  I don't know why Amazon thinks these are the same movies but they ARE NOT.    Cassanova Wong stars as a young monk who has to take down the majorly underused kung fu superstar Eagle Han.  Sadly Eagle is in Godfrey Ho form and the action director does not know how to use him properly.  Cassanova on the other hand looks superb but does not get in near enough fighting.  While the choreography is average at best, they speed up the film so much we can hardly see what the hell is going on in the fights.    The story is not really worth going over.  Eagle Han(Han Ying) plays your standard government bad guy.    2 things that really stood out to me was the great training sequence with bamboo that Cassanova has and in the final fight you will see a couple of short action scenes that Donnie Yen ripped off for 'Legend of the Wolf'.  Then this movie rips off that sweet kick that Cassanova does in the finale of 'Warriors Two'.  Sadly the final fight is not great but the last 12 minutes are still worth a watch for any kung fu fan.    Picture quality from Video Asia is not very good but it is LETTERBOXED!!! 
 I agree with another reader who stated that the characters never really get to know each other or fall in love with who the other person really is because of the lust factor. The Bible states that lust is a sin. Even when you lust after your wife. You should LOVE your wife but not lust after her. Lust is a selfish motivation to fulfill your own desires.. is that how God loves the church? I don't think so. Sex inside of marriage sure, but it should never be just about getting what you want from the other person. In my opinion the story lacked romance because real romance is about love and not lust. Lust is very unromantic to me. It read like a trashy novel. Just my opinion 
 I bought this book thinking that the "secrets" therein would enlighten me as to things we might be missing in our planning for retirement.  The other reviewers on this site made it sound like the book would have advice on little-known health care deals, finding a good place to live, etc.  Instead, it is filled with common sense tips, such as "enjoy sex" and "learn to forgive."  Gee, thanks.  This might be a good book if you're retired and bored, but don't buy this looking for much more. 
 Lol, Elizabeth Clare Prophet, the cult leader, a huxter, nothing close to a scholar, is teaching us about Christianity now lol? Lame 
 The emotional exaggeration and vitriolic attacks are so great readers will have a difficult time trusting the author's research and writing. Hanegraaff's diatribe should be ignored 
 The authors of this book are concerned. Americans aren't doing what they should.  Specifically, to paraphrase former president Bill Clinton, they're not spending their money right.  They value things they shouldn't.  They work too much.  They own too much.  They shop at evil big box stores like Wal-Mart.  So, with paternalistic concern in their hearts, they have written this book to warn us that we're in need of a correction.  The enemies they identify read like a laundry list of the Left's archetypal villians: wealthy merchants, credit card companies, and of course Ronald Reagan.  Along the way they disparage virtually every technological and economic innovation that has occured over the last 25 years.  Particularly sickening is the warm, fuzzy picture they paint of the "good old days" when most Americans bought their goods from locally owned stores.  I grew up in a town identical to the one they idolize in this book.  It sucked.  All of the stores were located around the downtown square.  They closed at six o'clock or earlier.  Wednesdays most didn't open at all; Sunday was dead.  Parking was extremely limited.  Lack of selection forced consumers to go from one shop to another, often in blistering summer heat or freezing winter temperatures.  Prices were high and selection limited.  Especially bitter are the memories I have of trying to find part-time work in these businesses while in high school.  Virtually all the owners had their kids filling what few jobs existed.  Being from a lower-income family I desperately needed to work to help my family out.  But I was unable to find anything in the stagnant local economy.  Then one day a Wal-Mart came to town. My mom took me there on a bright Saturday morning.  She was ecstatic.  Here at last was a wide variety of goods she could afford.  She didn't have to hurry to get there before the store closed at dinner time.  As for me I landed a position with the store which allowed me to contribute to the family income as well as save for college.  Writers of books like this one love to talk about how merchandisers like Wal-Mart "steamroll" over Main Street.  Bulls***.  Stores like Wal-Mart don't put guns to anyone's head to gain them as customers.  Rather the local people look at Main Street with its inflated prices, inconvenient hours and parking and limited selection, and then at the new Wal-Mart, K-Mart, Home Depot or whatever, and freely choose how to best spend their money.  In other words they control the way their community works.  And no one seems to mind except for a handful of elitists living in faraway places who are upset that people would rather spend less of their hard-earned money than live the rest of their lives in a Norman Rockwell painting.    But I've saved the worst for last.  After wringing their hands for a couple hundred pages over the current state of prosperity in this country the authors outline their plan for "recovery."  Guess what it consists of?  Bingo!  Higher taxes and more government control.  They even pull that tired old cliche out of their rectums: "we must protect the children."  Not from sexual predators or terrorists, but from the local mall.    My response to this 300 or so pages of hysteria: get real.  This is the 21st century.  Modern technology and business innovation have given Americans marvelous new options for travel, work, leisure and, yes, consumption.  In other words, our society is evolving.  The local coffeehouse now has a Starbucks sign hanging in it.  Main Street is dead, replaced by a row of 24 hour big box stores.  Spending one's life hanging out with good ol' Bob and Joyce from down the block has been swept away by Internet chat rooms and social mobility.  Most of us are happy with this arrangement.  If you aren't then that's fine, but keep your damn noses out of our business.  I give this book two stars rather than one because they bring out a solitary point worth pondering: how corporations like McDonald's deliberately market to kids, even teaching them how to bilk money out of their parents.  Bravo for pointing this out!  But rather than Big Brother tackling this problem, how about parents grow spines, learn to say "no" and tell the companies they won't get another bloody dime until they amend their marketing practices?  That's a solution that goes unmentioned in this preachy, whiny, paternalistic volume.  In the end it's the individual, not the collective, that guides society.  Let's have more celebration of individualism and less of the socialistic nonsense our oh-so-concerned authors seek to impose on us - for our own good of course. 
 Not a bad beach read but nothing in this story is unexpected. I didn't really connect with the main characters. I was interested by the description in the supernatural aspects (the lights) it seemed like a mystery/love story that may have been unique but instead was a way too predictable love story. 
 These, folks, are cheesy shows. You watch the first (Virus) and wonder how a film could be worse. But you watch the second (Hurricane) and realize that yes, it is possible to make an even worse movie than Virus. But boy oh boy, when you get to number 3 (Deadly Harvest) you realize that the impossible has been made manifest! It is also stunningly awful!  In short (the films aren't worth more than that), the productions are cheap and sleazy, the actors are off their feed (if indeed, they'd eaten from the apple of talent at all), the settings are lousy, most of the footage is stock footage, and some shots are even repeated. The scores match all of this in quality. But the DVD presentation equals the worst I have seen on the medium (a cheapo early DVD of Metropolus, where all the subtitles were trimmed off left and right). The film is grainy, they are too dark, etc. etc. etc.  The reason to own these epics? If you are an exhaustive collector of the 
 this book is very biased,not hard to understand seeing this book was co written by an israeli.israel and iraq has been arch enemies for a long time,how can a person who was taught to dislike and hate hussein  write a non biased book on the man.i'm waiting for a biography of saddam hussein written by an iraqi author who can tell us what it really was like knowing saddam hussein and living under saddam hussein years in power in iraq 
 This book's greatest flaw is, undoubtedly, its predictability.  It naturally has the descriptive and creative style of Scott, but the plot moves too logically from high point to high point with very little between.  There are very few "plot twists," and those which do occur are far from surprising.  From the book's outset, the story proceeds rapidly to the obvious tragic ending and seems to repeat regularly.  This ending also seems hurried and completely unbelievable.  The characters are poorly developed and, rather than seeming independent and realistic, seem to be nothing more than puppets forced to follow the extremely depressing plo 
 FSM=Funny for your educated, liberal parents. The satire is tame: about what one would expect from "an out of work physicist". Preach the gospel of Bob Dobbs, Salesmen to the gods! Revel in Bull-dada, excremeditation, and win back your slack 
 Nabokov hated Don Quixote and loved this sprawling piece of junk.  The only way to account for this is that Nabokov was the world's most insecure genius.  Don Quixote prefigures many of his most brilliant techniques, and upon study, he had to feel threatened by the fact that some of his best devices had been invented 400 years ago.  Anna Karenina poses no such threat.  Over half of the book is taken up by Levin, a Tolstoy stand in, who is hands down one of the most boring characters in any classic.  He is a "revolutionary thinker" who can never state an idea clearly and brings us to doubt whether there is any real thought in him at all.  Compare this with Dostoevsky whose minor characters trot out monologues that change the course of political science.  Tolstoy's greatest strength is that of a faithful observer, but he is lured into relying on that technique for far too much of the book and observes irrelevant phenomena for page after page with little to no insight.  There is a wedding scene that I put up as the most necessary rewrite in Russian.  If you tolerate this book long enough to get there, see if you don't agree.  Even more sadly, when observations reach into women or peasants, the characters tend to fall apart.  When they are in strife, Tolstoy is ok, but as soon as he wishes to portray a character positively, the book becomes hagiography.  Compare a Renoir painting of a child with one from Cassat, and you can see how much idealization can ruin a picture of reality.  And the end, oh the end.  There are two essentially unacceptable endings to any fiction.  One, the character wakes up and it was all a dream.  Two, can't come to a resolution, the main character commits suicide.  Why is this ending applauded?  True, there is some stream of consciousness, but is anyone convinced by this bizarre line of thinking?  Try out Molly Bloom, who must have been born out Anna's final scene, that's a stream of consciousness.    Nabokov took  much of this novel for Ada, but that's because this could be improved upon.  I'm coming back for War and Peace as soon as the new Pevear/Volokhonsky translation is out, but with this as a Tolstoy sample, I'm worried about throwing away any more otherwise enjoyable months 
 This book is a total bore. The flowery description is beautiful for the first three sentences, but then it becomes a tranparent cover-up for a book with no plot! Even I could write a more interesting book, and I failed high school english! Muir was a great person, but he sould have stayed where he was better aquianted: the woods! Anyone who enjoys this book obviously has never seen a tree before. A whole book dedicated to them is ironic and lame 
 This book is great for freshmen or anyone who had never exposed to economics. It's simplicity and clarity makes learning economics fun, yet it doesn't sacrifice any indepth necessary 
 I gave up reading this tripe after about 60 pages or so. Mr. Hughes may have actually had something valuable to say in this book, but it gets lost amongst all of the socialist ("liberal democratic" and so on) propaganda. The book appears to boil down to "If the government would just give everyone everything, it'd be all right. 
 Ethan Frome paints a vivid portrait of the beauty that is wintertime New England. Unfortunately, that's about all it does right. I was surprised to find the lack of both interesting and sympathetic characters in a novel that appears to be a character study.  Ethan Frome, the protagonist, is selfish and cruel toward his wife's illness. At times I despised him more than any character due to his extreme self-centeredness. In fact, his only characteristic that I can almost relate to, a repressed intellectualism, is barely even mentioned.  Mattie Silver, Ethan's object of desire, is an underdeveloped character in the most extreme sense of the phrase. It is unclear what her motives and feelings are even by the end of the story. However, this underdevelopment may have been for the best. The little that we are told about Mattie only adds to the disenchanting strangeness and sloppiness of the book. Most of the time, she comes off at immature and thoughtless.  Zeena, the supposed antagonist, is actually the easiest character to feel for. But don't get me wrong, she's unlikable just like the rest of the characters.  Overall, I suggest you avoid this book if at all possible. It's a loppy book with no real purpose or message. 
 Community Playhouse in Long Beach did the show this August. As it played, the plot didn't come through, but the wit of Shaw did. The playhouse didn't have the costumes of the military men, nor the actors to carry-off the pomp and bravado of these would-be heroes. In a time when G.W. Bush is fighting his own phantasmic enemies this play should have lapooned the whole spectre of military madness. George Bernard Shaw gave us the theme it will take some imagination and talent to make it contemporary and equal to the madness of our times. Ano 
 The design is great, very light, easy to handle.  It's very nice to be able to use it cordless.  However, this is the least powerful epilator I have ever used in my 14 year of personal epilation history.  (I have gone through six epilators.) It takes forever to clear a small area. 
 I would like to express that Junie B. Jones's poor grammar sets a bad example to children. Inaccurate grammar is no substitute for a good, funny piece of literature. I cannot believe that a publisher would accept such books. Junie b jones also gets away with bad behavior too often. And she says balderdash like, "I runned all around" and "my bestest friend". I don't like the idea of children being exposed to improper English. 
 I tried to listen to this story on CD, and aside from the story not being terribly interesting, I was surprised at Asimov's attitude towards religion. I suppose I shouldn't have been. He is a sci fi writer, after all. But I thought he was supposed to be a smart guy. He's not -- at least on this point.   The basic outline of the story (at least the beginning -- I didn't make it all the way through) is that some guy predicts that the galactic empire is going to fall, so he tries to make provision to preserve technology so that the succeeding dark ages don't last as long as they otherwise might. Toward that end he gets a select group of scientists onto this relatively isolated planet where they can carry on their work, which becomes the invention and maintenance of a religion that's supposed to preserve certain technologies through the coming dark ages. In this religion the high priests understand the theory -- the technology and all that -- but the local priests and the people are duped into believing in some mumbo jumbo.   It's as if you're supposed to picture some priest waving incense and saying prayers while he adjusts the knobs on the nuclear reactor, believing that it's God doing something while it's really just technology.   I know that "technology as magic" and "religion = magic" are common themes in the sci-fi genre, but for some reason I expected better from Asimov. It shows a rather alarming lack of thought.   Religious rituals are always geared towards the chaotic and the mysterious. There aren't religious rituals to cause the sun to rise, because it's regular and dependable, but there are religious rituals for storms and floods and harvests and childbirth and whatnot. Religion is also used to explain hidden things -- psychology, forgiveness, etc.   IOW, religion is subject to criticism ("it's not measurable") in precisely the area where Asimov is trying to squeeze it. He's trying to make religion the mystical cloak for something that's regular, predictable and logical. It just doesn't work that way.   If religious rituals had precise, measurable results, people would suspect that there's nothing religious or mysterious about them and they'd look for a material cause. Anyone who doubts that simply doesn't understand the religious mind, or hasn't been paying attention. Sure, there are gullible religious folk out there who'll believe anything, but the majority have half an eye out for tricks and deceptions.   The very idea that you can hide technology behind a cloak of religious ritual is a rather silly science fiction writer's fantasy.  Anyway, the story wasn't that compelling, and this "religious cover for nuclear technology" business was so incredibly stupid, I couldn't finish it. 
   I was very excited to read this supposed classic of sci-fi but was left very disappointed. How does one take the midieval idea of the devil seriously in the face of a more varied and marvelous universe than anything concieved of in our distant past? We must be less anthropomorphic in our ideas about the universe. The father's reaction to a "perfect" but godless alien species is to fear it was set up to fool humans into thinking they don't need god to be moral. However, that's just it - WE DON'T NEED GOD TO BE MORAL! Even Plato asked more than 2,000 years ago if the good is good because of itself or merely because the gods say it is. If morality is only good because God says so, then murder and rape can be good if God just changes His mind. Please!!!!!!!!!!!  In reality, the father's attitude is outdated and in-fact as frightening as Kierkegaard's psuedo-religious justifications of terrorism. If you're looking for a real examination of religious questions coming into conflict with cosmic issues, read something else. This is stacked in religion's favor. Moreover, it's written in a very confusing and tedious style - do we really need a scientific explanation of why a man's eyes get tired from reading too long just so the theme can be so ridiculous!? 
      I read previous reviews about not being able to run the program because the computer recognized it as a copied disk. I thought this couldn't possibly happen on my high tech computer... I WAS WRONG... Even though I purchased a legitamate copy, the program still would not let me run it.... BUYER BEWARE!!!!! 
 Who is this recording for? Surely not for Billy Joel fans, who would undoubtedly prefer Billy doing the actual singing. For that matter, why would anyone want to listen to 60+ minutes of Billy Joel covers? This is the most pointless cast album since Contact. Movin' Out is a similarly visual show the appeal of which lies not in Michael Cavanaugh's admittedly distinctive performance. It's no wonder you see used copies of Movin' Out is used records stores everywhere 
 I was also misled, the picture they used is the book that i needed, however, it is not the book i received. I wasted my money on a cd-rom guide book that i dont need or wan 
 After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to try Skeleton Man as my first Hillerman novel.  Unfortunately, I'm about 100 pages into it and have decided to give up on it.    I read a lot of novels and have never really had a problem with this before, but I find Hillerman's writing style to be very choppy and awkward.  I find I have to re-read sentences to catch the meaning because it just doesn't flow smoothly.     Here's an example of one paragraph that I opened to randomly:  "Getting this ceremonial procession from Tuve's village on Second Mesa to the canyon rim and them to the riverbank involved describing several more stops for prayers and offerings, the placing of painted feathers in the proper places with the proper songs, and putting prayer sticks where the proper spirits traditionally visited.  By the time Tuve had brought them to the Hopi shrine at the tribe's cliff-bottom salt deposits, Joanna Craig had looked at her watch three times that Chee had noticed.  Navajo fashion, he hadn't glanced at his own.  Tuve would finish when he finished."  It's like he talks in short cuts that you're expected to follow. When I'm reading this book, my mind is wandering all over the place because the text doesn't draw me in.  I'm glad he has a lot of fans out there, but I'm not one of them 
 I picked this up a few months ago at Borers because the topic seemed interesting and the cover was nice (it's usually how I get sucked in).  I read a few pages and it seemed ok, so I got it.  Six months later we used it for world literature book group, and when we met to discus the book I felt the need to apologize.  Although there were many good points about the book, there were more negative points.  The first problem I noticed was that Lamb discusses "characters" from the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan as if we know them, and will discuss someone on page 5 and again on page 325 and assume you remember (after 320 pages of other new people).  Second, Lamb's writing style is verbose and the editing wasn't done very well (should I be finding run-on sentences in a book?).  She is the type of writer who will give you a lot and not give you the chance to digest what you read before writing another heady topic.  Although there are negative aspects of the book there are also very interesting and positive aspects such as the discussion of Afghan culture, the thoughts of people being governed by the Taliban, and other things that we can usually only learn from an in-depth discussion with someone from another culture.  In all, I would suggest this book to people who are more interested in history and politics than in social life and culture 
 this book is as much about the gypsy communities as it is about confirming the author's own preconceived notion of  what eastern europe is (or what is not): in her own words, "certainly not a melting pot."  i will not comment on how the author deals with the main subject of her book, on the gypsy communities, its cultural heritage and its current problems- as a romanian, i am ashamed i know very little about it, and i was hoping to find out some answers by reading this book; i did not. there is one point where i agree on with the autor, when she deplores the absence of this subject from the public debate and modern scholarship.  let me now say what this book excels at: A. lack of scholarship.....: the author does a poor job identifying her sources. the 15 century of eastern europe as seen through the eyes of this author is full of surprises; to give just one example, "the princes of the teritories that would become romania made great fortunes of war, supplying food to constantinople". this is quite funny  given the intricate politics among the ottoman empire and the various genoese and venetian principalities that controlled the trade in the area at that time. what is more surprising is the almost random insertion of this statement in the context of the book.  B... to donwright plagiarism: one chapter of her book is entitled "temptation to exist" which is the famous title of a book by the romanian author emil cioran. name-dropping cannot replace bibliography (and this is unfortunately one of the more annoying habits of romanian scholars that the author seemed to have taken to).  C.... to insulting ignorance: is she aware of the sympathy of young cioran for the iron guard movement in the 30'? is paraphrasing a fascist sympathizer appropriate in a book about opressed minorities?   D... to cold war cliches: "to the people of the balkans, [the ursars... gypsies travellers with dancing bears] must have been a wonderful sight in the grueling last years of communism. for some reason, in ceausescu's romania people continue to pay money..." a bit assuming isnt it? well, what else were doing romanians during communism? gymnastics, nastase, sucking their own blood...perhaps, since even even the "literacy of the average romanian" is subject of mockery. E...to selective 20 century history: here again the evil spirit of eastern european chauvinism  is the obvious cause of all the evils of the century, if it weren't for other standard choices: nazy germany, etc... how about mussolini? there is not one mention   about mussolini and the fate of gypsies in italy...   For various reasons (perhaps some or many of them good) the author hates the country i am from. sometimes i do too. but i think a writer, an intellectual, should always be ready to engage in dialogue and thus set an example rather than labelling people (who did not benefit from the same schooling as the author did) as ignorant folk. on the contrary, this author does not permit even her (close?) romanian asisstant so much as a "tentative revelation" on the subject (these are the author's own words!!), not to mention that she misspelled her name (twice) in the acknowledgement.    Finally, i have a recommendation if you want to know more about gypsies and eastern europe check out emir kusturica's brilliant movies 
 Damn Yankees was a supergroup containing Ted Nugent,Tommy Shaw(STYX),Jack Blades(Nightranger)and someother guy. All talented musicians, who are best heard in their prespective groups. Damn Yankees just doesn't rock,like it should. I've given it a chance and just can't get into it. A lot of talent involved, just doesn't do anything for me 
 I liked this book all the way through the trial, but the post-trial revelation was, at the very least, ridiculous.  It did not come across as a "Sixth Sense" shocker but a cheap shot out of left field.  It was stupid and didn't fit with the story, at all.  The author didn't need it and should have tied up the loose ends a different way.  I can't even look back on the book and see how it all it.  It didn't.  Throughout the book, even alone with his own thoughts, Tom didn't reveal his true character.   This book was a huge disappointment!  I would not recommend that anyone waste their time.  In the end, when all is "revealed" nothing makes sense.  No matter how hard you might try - it doesn't fit, at all!  
 compared to this revised edition, i would rather refer to the original work of W. D. Ross, whose translation is excellent and marvelous. i recommend this one but don't know where to get it now 
 I felt like I was watching a poorly made horror movie that included casual sex while the killer was planning his next move. I can deal with there being a rape or murder because all suspense books are based on some type of violence, but did there have to be such graphic detail? I only finished it because I wanted to know who the psycho was.  All violence put aside, it was a decent suspense story but didn't include any romance whatsoever. Casual sex does not equal romance in my book. Reader discretion advised: rape, murder, lots of casual sex, adult scenes and overall violence. Not on my bookshelf anymore 
 This movie is typical Hollywood anti-war, anti-military, anti-American trash.  The "show biz" liberals, aided and abetted by their ideological cousins, the left-wing TV news moguls, have always sought to portray American soldiers in Viet Nam as baby-killing, drug-crazed monsters.  This movie is typical of that ilk. If you want a more balanced view of the men who fought in that terrible war, buy the DVD of "We Were Soldiers."--a much better, and far more honest, film 
 After seeing the motion picture "De-Lovely" and reading several Cole Porter bio's, I eagerly anticipated listening to "Capitol Sings Cole Porter: Anything Goes". Although the  Capitol CD contains many more selections by competent, well known artists, I much prefer listening to the CD from the soundtrack of the movie.  The "Capitol Sings..." arrangements are slick, but to my ear the De-Lovely arrangements are more wonderfully crafted and have a much more sensuous, emotional quality, even when sung by non-singers Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd. Diana Krall's interpretation of "Begin the Beguine", along with the gorgeous minor key accompaniment, is worth the ownership of the CD alone. I find it to be nothing less than thrilling, no matter how often one listens. I gave my "Capitol Sings..." CD away 
 Well, similar to another reviewer, the Get Up Kids encouraged us to check out Braid (us being the whole crowd). Assuming that TGUK's were clever enough to listen to none but high-quality music.  Sorry to say, Braid is not impressive.  Their vocals leave something to be desired, and their music has a chaotic element that, frankly, i did not appreciate.  I think people sometimes mistake randomness for creativity.  If you like poorly produced, poorly sung, and semi-chaotic music, this cd is for you.  If you like music that sounds like the Get Up Kids, Jimmy Eat World, Sunny Day Real Estate, American Football, or any other recent, poppier emo bands, don't buy it.  This cd is like throwing paint  on a wall and calling it art.  Remember, people only color inside of lines because it looks better that way 
 After reading the numerous positive reviews for this phone, I purchased.  Here are the main issues I have found with this phone:  1) The buttons are too small, particularly the main control button.  You have to used the side of your fingers to ensure that you do not hit too buttons at the same time. And, believe me, I do not have very large hands.  2) If you have quite a few contacts in your phone, you will be irritated by the delay when you scroll down quickly to select a contact.  You will notice that if you are not careful, you will dial the wrong contact due to the delay when scrolling and selecting quickly, so if this is you, be aware.  3) You must open the cover and look inside to see if you have missed a call or have a message.  VERY INCONVENIENT!!  There is no indication to show this on the top screen, only the inside screen.  4) On occasion, the display on the outside of the phone stops working entirely.  What you just need to do is power the phone down and they back up again.  Not optimal, and I probably just got a bad phone, but I am just waiting for the situation to get more frequent, so I can then deal with the likely nightmare of having to get a replacement phone from Motorola.  NOTE:  I have no personal vendetta against Motorola, but wanted to provide some real feedback rather than all just rosey stuff I bought into before purchasing 
 This book was assigned reading in an introductory philosophy course and I am very, very glad I read it at the end of the year rather than at the beginning (although it is too simple for a college level course in any case), because Nagel's conclusion suggests it's all an exercise in futility!. Although it is a good introduction to some of the major questions of philosophical enquiry for complete beginners, I feel that Nagel should have included some recommended reading at the end of each chapter for those who need more depth, especially for readers who are not using this book as part of a course in philosophy. Those same readers might well be put off by the dour ending of the book which strongly hints that (1) any God is merely a God of philosophical gaps (2) ultimately life has no meaning and (3) those who look for meaning are probably taking themselves too seriously. Why do philosophy then? And why write a book about it! 
 Zoe Heller tells the story of three obessions. The first is the desperately lonely spinster, Barbara Covett, who longs for companionship. The second is the bourgeois bohemian, Sheba Hart, who goes into teaching because she wants to be loved,and because she lives in our time, confuses love with sex, and the third is the author herself who seems to believe that only a terrible person could say terrible things about other people, especially children. Barbara, Heller's brilliantly drawn protagonist, sees through all the "care and share" rubbish put out by the striving headmaster and her moronic colleagues. She knows whereof she speaks when she sums up the barbarous behaviour of the kids, but the author won't let that stand, so she turns this magnificent misanthrope into a monster. The "battle axe" is made out to be exactly that, a battle axe, whose predatory lesbianism distracts the reader from her hard earned insights. By turning her into a disturbed stalker, readers will not gain from what she no doubt actually was, namely, a strict, disciplined teacher who knew that being nice is not a viable strategy for dealing with today's benighted youth. If readers were asked to deal with this instead of the author's witches brew of sexual repression, something really scary would be revealed, namely the fact that it is the adults who have to change and not the kids, and the "battle axe" provides us our only hope 
 In another rehashed treatise on Savage's perverted sense of truth, he sells a miserable, peripatetic screed to his lemming-like followers.  This man's politics and principles have been condemned by such well-established conservative journals as The Economist.  We all need someone to trust, and for Savage that person is the MD who will prescribe him some thorazine.  Gets 2 stars only because of the book's educational value as an example of the ramblings of a lunatic.  Barry Goldwater must be spinning in his grave 
 Alan Lomax's contributions to American music are enormous. His field recordings and archives are the foundation of the American Songbook. But he's a terrible writer, and this book is practically unreadable. There are some great interviews with Delta singers and musicians, but they're embedded in page after page of Lomax's lousy prose. If you really want to know about this music, skip the book and buy the CD, which is a phenomenal collection of blues, gospel & work songs Lomax recorded in the South in the 1930s and 40s. The music says it all much more authentically and eloquently than Lomax's words can possibly convey. God bless him, but he should have stuck to the tape recorder and thrown his typewriter away 
 When I opened the package, I found the filter box seals (one at each side) were broken, an indication that it was not new. I thought it's ok as long as the glass is clean and clear. When I opened the filter box, three pieces, the ring, the glass and the circular clamp, jumped out. While it's bad sign, I still thought it's ok as long as I could put them together. Well, the glass was not clear, as if it was sanded in the middle with a fine sand paper (I never saw any filter or lens in that shape  before!). Before to ship it back, I did try to put three pieces togather (so next person will not see these pieces jump out when open the box). Guess what, the circular clamp was about 2-3mm longer and two ends couldn't meet!!! I couldn't image any scenario under which this could happen, since it was from Amazon, not from some unknowns of eBay (actually, any eBayer will have to worry about the Feedback). I was really shocked that Amazon shipped that garbage to its customer!  Hope this is just a random incident and Amazon does have a very easy return practice. Otherwise, I would not buy anything from Amazon 
 T. is my favourite composer but the interpretation on this CD is rather like a good effort in high shoo 
 I'm a long time BT fan, I know that some of the best bands in the world are ones that are able to reinvent themselves and sound nothing like they did 10 years ago and still sound great but this is not the case with BT and with this album. Simply put, this album is junk but I still hold on to the hope that they will improve with their next. If you're thinking about buying a BT album, get Travelers and Theives or Save his Soul, you will not be disappointed. This album is best forgotten. We will all miss you Bobby S 
 More than two thirds of the book is dedicated to paintings related with Christianity. And the real arts are either completely ignored or dealt carelessly. For example, The whole Van Gogh's paintings are described in mere four pages, while each of  so may Christian related paintings by some obscure painters, is shown using four split pages. If your religion is Christianity and your objective is to investigate Christian paintings, this book should be fine. But for the rest of  us who are not Christians, this book is not worth reading or looking at. There are so many other good art books out there without religious bias. This book is not about painting as described. It is about the Christianity religion disguised with "Painting" 
 At least this book held my attention.  I finished it all.  There has only been one book that I have put down: Pride and Prejudice.  Blue Shoe is a bit more interesting, yet still boring.  I randomly picked it up at a bookstore, since the "New York Times Bestseller" at the top caught my eye.  Bestseller?  This book barely kept me awake.  There is no point to it.  It's predictable, and even the family secret is ho-hum.  There are a few funny instances in the novel, but the rest is pitiful.  Poor kids, their mother is a bad parent.  Seems to be more interested in men than in her children.  Don't read it 
 I've been a loyal user of Systemworks (also "Utilities" & AntiVirus) for many years, frequently buying upgrades as I moved through various Windows OSs.  The latest verison (2006) has been a big disappointment.  1) The "integrator" repeatedly crashes (and "must shut down").  I was told to reintall (it took 4 hours).  Tech support (email) was slow and barely intelligible.  2) The full scan now takes over 8 hours on a modest sized system.  3) The utilities have not been substantially improved in 5 years  4) The rebate (for upgrade users) came in the form of a debit card, not a check.  (What a hassle!  I don't want any more "plastic"!)  5) Turning the Norton protection off substantially speeds up my PC.  What the heck is going on back there?  During the next year, I'll be looking for a new Anti-Virus support product.  Cheers, Joh 
 The A1A Album includes "God's Own Drunk" and this is not included on the CD with the same title.  How did this happen?  We main purpose we purchased the CD for this song and it's not here 
 To anyone who has endured corporate life at a sub-executive level, the title of this book will be seen as a dead giveaway to the underlying motives of its authors and those to whom they pander.  The book's message? When one is too greedy a bastard to pay employees a fair wage, simply devise schemes that make them temporarily forget that they are being exploited.  Such short-term distractions allow the "chosen ones" to continue creaming off profits for themselves.  It doesn't take much time to figure out that there is a chasm between executive rewards (e.g., multi-million dollar payouts, regardless of performance) and the scattered bones thrown to an organization's "little people".  [... 
 I agree with the reviewers who found this series "stuffy, predictable and annoying" and advised, "You might as well buy a romance novel." (Or a super-heroes comic book for the action parts.) What horrified me was that one reviewer mentioned Peters in the same sentence with Jane Austen and the Brontes!! Austen did not condone much of the absurdity and pomposity of her time, but chose to demonstrate it, rather than rant or lecture against it, as many authors and poets were doing.  In a few simple sentences she skewered inheritance laws' cruel unfairiness to women. The little girl asks, "Why do we have to move?" and her mother explains simply, matter-of-factly, that's the way it is.  As outrageous as the law itself is the docile,(seemingly) unquestioning acceptance of it.  Austen didn't go into an enraged diatribe, just assumed her readers were perceptive enough to get the message.  Peters would do well to emulate really good writers: demonstrate talents and other qualities with actions and events, rather than repetitive, tiresome descriptions 
 I bought this vacum at Target nearly six months ago. It has a very strong suction, and runs relatively quiet, but it cost a fortune to maintain! The root cause for this maintainence is that Dirt Devil designed this machine to use the Hepa filter as a vacum bag. All the dirt raps itself around the filter until its completely crapped up, and if you use it beyond that stage it will completely shut-down. I call customer service about it, and they recommended that I clean the filter more frequently. Which I now do, but I still have to replace the filter on average once every 2 months or else I'm force to breath all the fine particles that the Hepa is suppose to protect me from. The cost of each filter is an appauling $30 bucks. My car filter doesn't cost more than $7 dollars. At this rate I've already bought the vacum cleaner within my six months of use. Save yourself the hassel. Don't buy it! 
 The essence of "Iraq Confidential" is that the CIA and NSC were unwilling to permit a U.N. arm led by an American to successfully investigate what weapons Saddam had.  The problem was that U.N. policy was to lift sanctions once Saddam had shown disarmament, while U.S. policy was to retain sactions until regime change, regardless of Iraq's armament.  In addition, there were also problems with poor coordination between the CIA and FBI.  The key "bottom line" is that this Machiavellian U.S. strategy to defeat arms inspection probably led to the U.S. and G.B. being convinced in 2003 that Saddam had WMD when he actually had none, and thereby an unnecessary war.  As for Scott Ritter, he ended up becoming controversial himself (to say the least); fortunately Seymour Hersch's vouching for Scott makes the book credible.  Regardless, "Iraq Confidential" should have only been an article - not nearly 300 pages 
 My wife and I enjoyed the book but found it to be extremely deficient in providing pronunciation and also in defining the meaning of each name.  The book also seemed a bit disjointed.  It did not follow well from one section  to the next, with the same name often appearing in multiple sections 
 Since the break up of alternative metal pioneers Faith No More Mike Patton has freely indulged his avante guard palate on projects like Mr Bungle and the incomprehensible Fantomas.  With the first Tomahawk album Patton promised Faith No More fans that he had made the album they had been waiting for. It was a bold and innacurate claim and I am sorry to report that Mit gas shows no improvement. If you did not like the first Tomahawk album you won't like this one. Pattons vocals are , as always, superb but they are set against a bleak and colourless backdrop. Opener Birdsong is like a bad nightmare.  It's awful while it's happening but as soon as it's over you start to forget it. The track ends with a depressing and droning organ sound that is far more reminiscent of the music prevalent on Mr Bungles appalling Disco Volantae than anything Faith No More ever recorded. This early impression is reinforced by tracks such as rotgut and the painfull desastre naturale. Only single Rape this day provides a glimpse of the heights to which Patton once soared but is all too brief. This track like all the others seems incomplete. A Promising intro , a crunching guitar riff and menacing vocals give way to a chorus that trails off disapointingly. If you liked Fantomas and Mr Bungles Disco Volantae and California albums you'll love this. Personally I am growing exceedingly tired of hearing Patton spew this musical dirge into the void left by Faith No More and I intend to avoid his future releases.  
 Self what? The entire magazine now pushes product on every inch of every page. Their product placements went from "convenient and subtle" to obviously pandering to their revenue sources. Plus the stories and tips are so far out of reality that anyone over 25 with half of a brain couldn't relate. I once enjoyed Self and their monthly self-help plans. Their core message has gotten lost in the sea of product pushing 
 I was looking for a Cussler-esque adventure for my recent vacation and read a few reviews of DuBrul's books.  They seemed mostly positive, so I bought a couple thinking they would be good for long airplane flights, afternoons in the sun, etc.  Sadly, both Charon's Landing and Vulcan's Forge were mind-numbingly slow, the action sequences were nothing special, the characters were wooden stereotypes, the heroes were no better than the villains, etc.  There really was nothing to hold my attention from chapter to chapter.  Mercer (the hero) acts like a pubescent boy looking down the top of every blouse and up the slit of every skirt, and DuBrul can't seem to write a decent piece of dialogue between a man and a woman.  Ultimately, I read both books, but it took the better part of a month to get through them (I usually read a Clive Cussler novel in about 2 days) because I kept putting them down and picking up other books that held more promise.  I won't be buying any more DuBrul 
 Jill McCorkle seems to be trying too hard to be unique and quirky just for the sake of being "original." I was attracted to this book because I like fiction written from the point of view of many characters, but "Carolina Moon" was an amalgam of too many different styles that just wouldn't blend. We have letters, we have third person narration, and we have first person narration in the form of an annoying young woman talking to a tape recorder diary. Too much.  This last narration bothered me because the woman didn't sound like she was talking to a tape recorder - the voice sounds more like a written voice. For example, she barely distinguishes who's speaking, which is fine on the page where you can see indents and paragraphs and quotation marks, but as a spoken voice it didn't work. She didn't sound like a real person. The point of having someone tell his or her story through a tape recorder diary is to capture his/her voice more naturally. McCorkle just tells the story this way because it's "neat." The character doesn't sound any different from any of the other characters - and her story is pointless and contributes nothing to the plot or sublot or second subplot.  Quee was just plain annoying. She's an old, quirky prostitute medicine woman who collects pictures of people she doesn't know and makes stories up about them. She was quirky and had a quirky perspective on morals, so we're supposed to like her. I hated her. I'm tired of fiction about crazy, quirky people trying to force their agendas down our throats. The best novel I've read about a quirky person was "A Separate Peace" because the narrator in that novel gets just as annoyed at the quirky character as the reader. (And he pushes him out of a tree.) Read that book instead.  I think McCorkle may just have been suffering from some quirkiness herself when she wrote this book. The characters are flat and uninteresting, and the stories are bland. There's no reason for the unnamed woman to drop letters to her dead lover in the mailbox except to advance the story. And the only purpose the mailman has is to read the letters to us. The characters are more like the author's pawns than real people. The book didn't really seem to be about anything, and the ending was unbelievable (in a bad way, not a good way). I was surprised because McCorkle is usually a very good character writer. Her short story "Intervention" is a marvelous story about a woman torn between her alcoholic husband and her children, who wish to have an intervention. Great character in that story. I'd recommend reading McCorkle's short stories instead of "Carolina Moon." 
 This is a nice book. I say nice because it does tell you what to do but not how to do it! There are some parts where I was completely stumped, so I bought the book. It still didn't help me so I am going to buy the other one  and see how it is 
 When putting together the mobile section of this item, I was very disappointed in its flimsiness. It looks like just a few knocks will cause the screws to break from the plastic.  When I turned it on I was disappointed a second time, this time by the irritating buzzing sound that the mobile makes as it rotates. It's so loud you can't hear the music, which is a shame because I'm sure my son would enjoy looking at the moving lights. The third disappointment - the buttons are VERY hit-and-miss. Sometimes the music buttons don't work (the lullaby one worked eventually once I mashed it in really hard). That I could live with, but it's fiddling with the other controls that is really irritating. Control for music off, lights on/off and rotation on/off all seem to be tied up in two buttons. If you have the music and lights going, then turn on the rotation, the music and lights will go off as the rotation comes on. Then you have to press buttons in whatever order seems logical until you get them all going the way you want them. Please bear in mind I am NOT particularly daft - I managed to figure out my TIVO remote in a day or so - but the controls for this baby's musical mobile make no sense to me. I thought at first it was supposed to be deliberately challenging in order to stimulate 'baby's natural curiosity', but after two nights it really got on my nerves, and if I can't figure it out, I don't see how my one year old is supposed to. I can only think that there is something very screwed up with the circuitry in there.  I'm not dismissing this item all together. The music is lovely - not too simplified and not too electronic-sounding. The Minute Waltz is particularly nice (I've noticed my son scans for it). The lights are lovely too, and do look pretty when they're moving if you can stand the buzzing. My son has come to depend on the music to amuse himself with as he falls asleep. BUT, if you buy it, I'd recommend testing the buttons and the motorized rotator before screwing the very flimsy mobile pieces together in case you need to return it. 
 A lover's betrayal. . . A killer on the loose. . .   Eve Duncan was actually happy. She had a man who loved her, an adoptive daughter as great as her own, and her dead daughter's bones were found and safely buried. But then a letter in the mail opens her eyes to a secret her boyfriend, Joe Quinn, kept for two full years. Now she wants away from him, and when a job opportunity in a different state presents itself, she packs her bags and leaves. On her first night in Louisiana, someone tries to kill her, and they won't give up until she's dead! Will she uncover the secret in time? Or will death silence her?  When I picked up this book I wasn't surprised it got high on every bestsellers list. It was moving a mile a minute and between the hired assassins, secrets, deaths, and conspiracies, I knew I was reading a great novel. And then, after chapter 5, the book came to a stop and decided to creep at turtle speed. The character of Eve Duncan became uncharacteristically naive and immature, while her 12 year old adoptive daughter Jane was acting like a 50 year old, smart and mature beyond her years. The book dragged all until chapter 12. Once chapter 12 begins, the book takes flight once again and the bombs (literally) start going off. The ending was good and though I thought it was predictable, it was still somewhat enjoyable. It wasn't as good as the first two books in that series, but it was better then the third. 
 I am a French myself, I've noticed that there are a lot of books to teach people out there "how to be French", "how to eat like French", "why French are so great", for me, it is very strange. Of course France is a great place with all those history, food, museums, culture. But we also have a lot of bad things. So prasing French all the time is a bit non sense and it really makes us French more arrogant. (Yes, we are too arrogant and proud of ourselves). Even being a French myself, I have to admit it. We should learn to respect other culture and people. But all these books are making us feel like privilage. There is another book called" French women don't get fat". To be honest, we have a lot of fat people in Paris, a lot of women out there are not slim or as elegant as the books described. These books making the girls here feel like they are godness, which is bad. More and more people here are thinking they are the best. But the fact is, we have high unemployment rate, our streets, metros are so dirty, our people don't want to face the reality. We love to enjoy life too much, but we are too lazy to earn money to support ourselves and we are rejecting other culture. So wake up, we are all equal. Don't let our surface fool you. 
 I wouldn't go so far as to call it brilliant. Zorba is a refreshing and likeable character, but at times i felt that he was a bit too preachy, his dialogue a bit overly pedantic. The story to me felt a bit too long and choppy, with not much of a plot. But there are a few interesting and beautiful moments that reminds us to enjoy life to the fullest. Like I said, not a brilliant book, but pretty good nonetheless. 
 I slogged my way through Chapter 4, got through Chapter 5 out of sheer curiousity, and then threw the book (trash) in the trash. 
 This book looked very promising; the format and premise of a history book  written from the year 2025. Unfortunately, the book is so superficial in  its treatment of the subjects that I found myself falling asleep whenever I  attempted to read it. The book reads like a collection of facts or  sidebars; there are no stories, fiction or non, to pull you through the  chapters. Read Probable Tomorrows instead 
 I feel like a traitor since I love Seton's THE GREEN DARKNESS but this is probably the worst book I have read in ages.  The characters are amoral and unsympathetic and nothing really happens.  Blech--I want the two hours I wasted on this back 
 'Dance of the Dead' is director Tobe Hooper's (Poltergeist, Texas Chainsaw Massacre) contribution to the uneven first season of 'Masters of Horror'. The series contains 13 mini-horror films helmed by famous horror directors.   Some entries have fared better than others. This particular episode is, unfortunately, one of those others.   The setting is a post-apocalyptic society where a plague has wiped out most of humanity. There are two kinds of folks left; decent, and 80's-movie, leather-clad baddies.  Sound familiar? That's because it's adapted from a short story by Richard Matheson who penned 'I am Legend', another 'Omega Man' style yarn that draws a line between good and not as good.   It isn't, however, the story that I take issue with. It's a decent 60-minute distraction, and the premise, from which the title stems, gleefully earns its horror stripes. The acting isn't all bad. One can always count on Robert Englund (all dolled up as the wicked drag queen MC of this freakshow) to bring something original to the table. Rather, the issue at hand is the stylistic choices, or lack thereof, employed by our featured director.   Tobe Hooper has directed everything from horror masterpieces (The aforementioned 'Poltergeist' and 'TCM'), to interesting misfires ('Spontaneous Combustion' and 'TCM 2'), to absolute stinkers ('The Mangler', 'The Funhouse'), but they've always had that distinct, old-school Hooper stamp. This, I am sorry to say, does not.   If I am to ingest an episode from a series with the moniker 'Masters of Horror', wherein a featured director brings his own sensibility to the table, then that is exactly what I expect to see. What we have here is a director who, afraid of taking a misstep, ends up delivering something entirely not his own. 'Dance of the Dead' is a slap dash jumble of a film that heavily employs bargain basement level 'MTV-Style editing', which only as tired and outdated as the term 'MTV-Style editing'.  Don't get me wrong, for fans of the series, it is not to be missed. For those that desire to know every aspect of the production (from the adaptation of the story to Englund's inspirations for his character) this episode is for you. However, if you're in the market for top-shelf Masters of Horror, you'll find better company in Don Coscarelli, John Carpenter or Stuart Gordon.   This one is better left for dead. 
 The music is simply awful.  I enjoyed the CD from the first season (as well as the opening digital theme) and am still reeling from the granola chomping, politically correct, old fashioned and weird theme song from Season 2.  NOT hot, NOT cool, NOT fun to listen to.  Elizabeth Ziff's negative influence has really hung a job on the musical score- I am left pondering WHY Showtime and Ilene Chaiken have let her run wild with this glob of amateurish and self indulgent effort 
 The writers of this movie thought that referencing dozens of different movies would make a comedy. No. There has to be jokes, funny jokes. There needs to be something humorously said about the original films to make it a satire. I have seen many of the films this movie "spoofs" including Napoleon Dynamite, When Harry Met Sally, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Hitch, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, The Wedding Planner, Jerry Maguire, Sleepless in Seattle, and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and ALL of them are funnier than Date Movie. It really is pointless to spoof comedies. The writers don't even reference date movies all the time. They reference King Kong, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and it doesn't work. Even the so-so Scary Movie films have something to say about the films they are spoofing. Not only was it terribly unfunny, it was sick. I like Monty Python and American Pie but when a cat starts humping a decayed human torso I draw the line. The writers of this film also made Epic Movie. I saw Date Movie on DVD. I will not see Epic Movie ever or any other film made by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. It is a sad time in our world and an extremely small part of that sadness is the fact that movies like these are made and make millions at the box office 
 I admit it was a quick and entertaining read, and I enjoyed the first part of the book. Then it became pat, implausible and annoying. A better written book in Mommy lit category would be I don't know how she does it by Allison Pearson 
 Where's the subtitle of this very effective book?  Did the modern editors simply take it away?  Darwin titled his book: "The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection" and subtitled it: "The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life."  When Hitler came to power in 1933, he had one overarching idea in mind: his radical Nazi racial philosophy built on the Darwinian principle of natural selection.  Hilter thought the Aryans were the fittest and he wanted to help speed up the "inevitability" of natural selection.  He first started off with the sterilization of nine categories of "the unfit" which were feebleminded, schizophrenia, manic depression, Huntington's chorea, epilepsy, hereditary body deformities, deafness, hereditary blindness and alcoholism.  He then worked his way up to attempting the complete extermination of entire categories and entire races of people.  Speaking of modern day little Hitlers, the Columbine High School shooters carried out their bloody rampage on Hilter's birthday, April 20th, and had planned on causing more than 500 deaths at the high school.  Shooter Eric Harris had written on his website, "YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE??? Natural SELECTION!  It's the best thing that ever happened to the Earth.  Getting rid of all the stupid and weak organisms."  After the bloody rampage, Harris' autopsy report revealed that he was wearing a T-shirt with the words "Natural Selection" emblazoned on the front.  Beware of those who hold this book dear to their hearts.  This book is not about man descending from the apes.  The ideas in this book have caused and continue to cause more deaths than any other notion in modern history 
 I found this magazine very unrealistic in terms of fashion (not clothing you would actually see people wearing on a daily basis and definitely not clothing that most people can afford).  The whole magazine is one big ad.  If I wanted that, I could just turn on the tv 
 The book is not even statistical by scientific standarts. It is a vague collection of observations that tend to change every year. This book has lost more money than it has made for people. If you want to get serious about trading read Toby Crabel, read Linda Rashke. You don't like to pay money for their books? Don't expect a $30 book to tell you about making money. It takes thinking, hard labor and teachers like Toby Crabel 
 an amazingly bad movie. eddie murphy (who was funny in the 80s) manages the near-impossible: he makes jerry lewis seem sophisticated. now dont get me wrong; i love stupid comedy -- when its funny. murphy never convinces an iota here in the role of the HUGE professor klump. there is scads of humor to be mined in the struggles of fat people to fit into the normal world (take my word, i know about THAT) -- just recall oliver hardy's girth getting him stuck in a doorway during his attempt to escape bogeyland -- but murphy is merely contemptuous and nasty. well, contemptuous and nasty in a comedy i can accept, but it better be funny. this movie has a high spot on my list of the 10 worst i have ever seen. 
 getting this album kind of hurt me and alice's relationship. over the last year or so i've enjoyed discovering his 70's albums like school's out and killer, and so i decided to check out his lesser known early 80's stuff. special forces is cool enough and flush the fashion is pretty solid. zipper catches skin is just too corny though (no to mention boring). i actually feel very nerdy and self conscious listening to it. it's hard to explain but it's an akward experience. though i do like "make that money" and "i am the future," they don't justify this albums existance 
 i have not read this book, i stumbled across the listing on amazon and looked at it, so i can't actually comment as to the comments. but i want people to realize that the publisher is listed as the john birch society, a very right-wing fringe group that among other things in its history, was against the civil rights movement. look them up on wikipedia or something if you want more information, i just wanted to let people who are not familiar with the jbs know who was responsible for publishing this 
 The basic plot was a little incredible - the idea that this junior partner could fake his death and run off with a fortune was somewhat believable, but many of the details are absurd. In fact, the more the story is filled in, the more ridiculous it becomes. Until the last 100 pages or so, it is a fine and entertaining read. It starts to break down at that point, with two revelations near the end that make no sense at all. (No spoilers here; keep reading.)  The first revelation is just absurd - it makes the main character look like a moron. The second revelation, just a few pages from the end of the book, makes a critical character look ridiculous, as well. This latter revelation is not consistent with the rest of the plot or the characters as they have been developed. Worse, it is bad writing. Worst of all, it turns an enjoyable book into a horribly depressing read.  I read the bulk of this book on two plane flights, then stayed up late to finish the last couple of chapters. I ended up falling asleep depressed and resolved never to read another Grisham book; he has let me down too many times, now, and the last thing I want after several hundred pages of fun reading is to have that experience yanked away by a cynical finish 
 This book irritated me on many levels; not that the writing was poor or the plot weak. In fact, the plot, the premise, the writing were good--unfortunately the characters didn't pull it off or keep me interested because they were all kinda indifferent or unlikable.  I read somewhere the number one reason people keep reading a work of fiction--regardless of plot--is because they care about someone in the book.   In this book, I was hoping they would all drown by the end of the story...  
 This is only a portion of this episode.  It cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
 If you admired the young McCourt boy who survived misery and a drunken father in Angela's Ashes (A'sA), this book is sure a huge deception. The first 80 pages are a great continuation to A'SA, but suddenly the rhythm of the book stops, as if McCourt had suffered from a severe drought of ideas. The storyline becomes chaotic, changing the day-today timeline we were used to to a mixture of anecdotes that take place 5 years forward and jump back again, no order or sense whatsoever. What's worse, nice and naive Mccourt transforms into a copy of his drunken father, constant beating up of women included. It's a huge shock (hey this story's REAL, folks!); it's as if Snow White suddenly turned into the role of the Queen.  McCourt won't be the same nice, brave and funny guy for me nevermore. 
 ... but very little real information.  At 65 pages of large print and sprawling cartoons, rather devoid of anything exceptional.    I'd skip it and find something more informative for your child.  
 If you're learning to use Maya, this is NOT the book for you. from the get-go, the instructions are NOT clear on what they want you to do. The Solar System was a few pages and it took me 3 weeks to do it because I had so much trouble. They tell you to rotate things but they don't say by how much or what direction. and they leave you in the cold. Stay away. Now I may be hasty because I'm learning maya myself, but this book is NOT helping 
 Movie got 2/3 through and just quit. No problem, this is Windows right? Just reboot and start where you left off. Only for whatever reason I can't restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning. I'm not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again. Only a couple bucks, but definitely not worth it 
 very repetitive, midi jam tracks that sound awful,  and you are with nothing that you can apply to real world of playing. I gained much more from the Hal Leonard Blues Piano and Smooth Jazz Piano Series books. i.e. useful licks, chord progressions and basic soloing techniques 
 Save your time, money and patience.  This may be the worst book I have read since the equally monotonous, predictable Stone Barrington novel "The Short Forever".  Wow, this one stinks.  Like others, I put up with the shallow characters, ludicrous dialogue and endless parade of showers, boobs and guns to figure out whodunit.  Unfortunately, this book had an ambiguous ending that seeks to be clever but is instead is just stupid.  Who on earth did kill Vance?  And come to think of it, who gives a damn?  I don't what women did to Stuart Woods but he sure seems to hold them in complete contempt.  Every female character, save for Isabel the maid, felt compelled to practically rape our handsome hero.  Each is flawless and gorgeous but also all are dumb, vacuous, self-centered and thoroughly unlikeable - hey a couple are even truly psychotic!  The only normal female character who spared Stone, Mary Ann, unfortunately has a room temperature IQ.  I am hardly a prude, but I lost count of how many women either Vance or Stone made love to in the course of one short novel and felt the need to take a long hot shower to rid myself of the feelings of filth.  Mr. Woods either lives in a world of complete ignorance or the reading public is a lot less discriminating than I thought 
 Kids will like... for as long as it lasts. And it won't last long. I also found the way the basket attaches to the wheel base to become a cart annoying. The darn thing falls off all the time and eventually I threw it out. It just frustrated the kids at church nursery. Better off seeking a sturdier option. Even for a household with jsut one kid -- this thing is flimsy. It def. won't work for a situation where many kids will be using it (church nursery, preschool, etc. 
 I like self-reference jokes. I enjoy them quite a bit, actually. But this book beats you over the head with it. I wanted to read the whole thing, just so I could feel like I had a more informed opinion than I would otherwise, but I got about halfway through and there was no sign of it ever getting any better. I see a lot of reviews full of praise here, but for me reading this was incredibly tedious. He lost me forever when he was being interviewed to be on The Real World. The only reason I gave this book two stars was because I didn't finish reading it and it could be that the constant self-reference is actually some genius device in which we're shown how arrogant the main character is. But I don't really care, I hated it. 
 I read mysteries for the simple enjoyment of it all.  I don't expect great literature - but I struggled to get through this one.  Maybe I've been spoiled by J.A. Jance.  I've come to expect interesting plots and subplots, compelling dialog, and likeable characters.  None of these are evident in Desert Noir.  I'll continue my search for new mystery/suspense writers 
 TALK ABOUT A WASTE OF MONEY.  FIRST OF ALL WHAT IS TYCO THINKING.  $70 FOR THE TOY AND YOU HAVE TO BUY THE BATTERY PACK SEPARATELY?!?!?!  NOT TO MENTION I COULD NOT FIND THE BATTERY PACK ANYWHERE.  ALL THE STORES WERE SOLD OUT. ALL WEB SITES (TOYS R US, KAYBEE TOYS, ETC) WERE SOLD OUT.  ALL OTHER SITES (SPECIALTY HOBBY SHOPS) HAD THEM AT RIDICULUOUS PRICES, WHICH DID NOT INCLUDE SHIPPING.  I FINALLY FOUND IT AT AMAZON.COM AT A REASONABLE PRICE AND I OPTED FOR THEIR FREE SHIPPING WHICH TOOK LONGER THAN I WOULD HAVE LIKED BUT AT LEAST THEY HAVE THAT MONEY SAVING OPTION WHICH HELPS.  MY SON PLAYED WITH IT ONCE AND HATED IT.  IT WAS HIS # 1 CHOICE ON HIS X-MAS LIST.  TALK ABOUT A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT FOR US BOTH 
 Among my favorite books is King Con!  I have bought many copies to give as gifts to friends.  I buy Stephen Cannell always hoping to find another King Con.  The best character in this book is a marmalade cat named Franco.  The plot goes off in many different directions! It never really hangs together.  The shoot-out at the end is ridiculous.  People who are supposed to be competent and intelligent make idiotic decisions.  Scully's wife (groomed to be head of Dectives at LAPD) is so sweet and kind and thoughtful (and dumb)! Would LAPD groom such a woman to be head of detectives?  Well, maybe in real life - but it just doesn't work in this story. Too many characters; too many subplots; racial stuff, gangs, Hollywood, the Mafia, family issues, movie making.  I thought Cannell must have had a deadline for producing a book and looked through his file of old ideas and threw a bunch together and did his best to contrive a plot to connect disparate ideas.  This book doesn't say anything, doesn't do anything.  It's a dud.  Don't bother 
 I really want to give 2.5 stars. It's really just sort of a dry, rote listing of every control on every rack device. The examples lack aesthetics and interest. A lot of the better info is tucked away among the odd collection of sidebars, captions and block quotes. The illustrations are likewise offset from context and in funny formats. Typically, the illustration for the point in the text is several paragraphs later in the book. Also there are a lot of partial shots of the interface so you sort of have to track down the area of the device interface the book references. It's just a petty annoyance, no worse.  The info that's in there is accurate, and that's good, but it is neither in an easily referenced format, nor a format that would cause tidbits to stick in your memory. It's just sort of "there". I'm still reading it cover-to-cover because, well, I paid for it so I may as well get all I can out of it.   There are much more entertaining and stimulating books out there -- one which even has the word "Power" in its title, too. 
 This book did not keep my interest.  I have read other books I borrowed from my local library that were more informative.  I would not recommend this book to any military wife facing deployment of a loved one 
 This Oregon Scientific Pedometer is very inaccurate and a waste of money even at the cheap price.  There is no point to even considering "saving money" when it comes to pedometers if the count is going to be almost arbitrary 
 When I saw this movie, I thought this is a soundtrack I got to have.  I went out and bought it the next day.  It took about 10 minutes for me to realize that I'd made a huge mistake.  The soundtrack is not really a "soundtrack".  I could hardly pick out the songs on the CD as being songs in the movie.  I was really looking forward to the diverse mix of rock and hip-hop that was in the movie, but all that the soundtrack has is Nelly, Nelly, Nelly.  Where's the other cool songs from the movie?  My review is one star because they won't allow less than that 
 Its ok.  Of course if you take a philosophy class in todays secular universities, you will read 20 things by hume and other atheists and not much pro theism.  His work is ok, but I actually used it as part of a proof that God does exist 
 If you have no patience for reading-don't try this on 
 Ten years ago, I worked for a company which was in the midst of a culture crisis. Part of this crisis was due to the owner's insistence on managing from afar and not allowing skilled managers to make decisions based on local needs. This crisis came to a head when the owner met the author of this book on a ski - lift.   The main premise of the author's "philosophy" is this: people play(read: work) harder during their time off than they do at their jobs. [I'm alright with this part.] The reason being, according to the author, is that nobody keeps score at work. This, of course, is patently ridiculous. Almost every company keeps score on their employees in some way and most of us enjoy 'sports' in our off-time that don't keep score.  The author was brought in to train us in his "method'. Keep in mind that we already had complex yearly reviews and most managers were selected after they had met certain criteria in personality tests. Some people may be intrigued by the author's writing but his personal style is boorish. He typically ate while he lectured and his constant reliance on record - breaking sports events as an example of what people at work should do every day not only alienated non - sports minded people but showed the second major weakness in his philosophy. Guys get paid millions of dollars for getting a hit 30% of the time - not grand slams every time they come up to bat. But that was the author's next premise - that we had to perform these types of record feats everyday. (This strategy is not restricted merely to the author, sadly, but seems to be a major strategy of most US companies.)    The author had a difficult time with me especially as most of my hobbies involve physical activities in which one does not keep score - surfing, hiking, gardening, etc. I actually argued the contrary to the author's philosophy - that people actually played harder than they worked precisely because no one was keeping score when they played, as I stated above. However, discussing this with the author was like the narrator of "This Is Spinal Tap" questioning the notion of 'this one goes to 11' with Nigel. The author just kept repeating his litany about needing to keep score.   We started measuring anything that could be measured - this was keeping score. Then, because they could be measured they had to be reduced. Things that were vital to the integrity of the product were cut back on in order 'to win'. The product (and product reputation)was damaged and some of the better people soon left the company. Eventually, we careened into other changes in company philosophy and left this "Game" behind. Sadly, none of these philosophies helped- but that is another matter.  This author's work is dreck. You would do better to read Scott Adams and do exactly the opposite of Catbert, Ratbert, and the Pointy - Haired Boss.  Make it interesting, make it fun, treat people with respect and people will work hard.  They may still work harder at play but that is probably human nature. After all, there are words for "work" and "play" - they are not one. Keeping score doesn't really play into it 
 Has a horrible "show don't tell problem", pacing problems, clichs are handled poorly and characters are rather two dimensional 
 I purchased this book hoping that it would clear up my confusion about LOST - but quite the opposite. This book is so poorly organized, I may as well be using it as a driving map for Italy. Purchase the other Ultimate Unofficial Guide to LOST, this one sucks 
 PLEASE,help me, I dont know why I didn't receive my product. 
 This story starts out pretty successfully. We are shown the life of the brothers in the abbey and their daily routines. This seems to set the tone for a dull plot. Then, the reader experiences the sickness of a brother of the abbey and the mood of the story changes from the placidity of the abbey life to the chaos of trying to help the brother. This livens the book up some, but not enough. Very few exciting events happen between that point until the death of Rhisiart. After Rhsisiart's death, we are thrown back into that state of low-action; only this time, with the added commotion of trying to figure out the murderer's identity. The ending wasn't a huge shocker. It was almost too predictable from the beginning. So, all in all, I would not recommend this book unless you wanted to be easily put to sleep 
 . . . and I use the word in its strictest sense:  "more harmful than is apparent."  The only reason Esposito has been able to rise to the heights of his profession is basically because his audience consists either of Muslims who approve of all the congratulatory things he says about Islam, or Americans who simply don't know one way or the other -- and naturally would like to believe his drivel about "the peaceful religion."  Notice that his audiences never consist of those (non-Muslims) who haved lived and traveled in the Middle East, who speak and read Arabic, who have read the Koran, or who have dealt with Muslims and Arabs for years.  Such people invariably revile Esposito and would promptly laugh him off stage.  Still, it's interesting how someone can study a subject academically for all his life and never really see it . . .  For a useful analysis of Islam without rose-colored glasses:  Robert Spencer, David Pryce-Jones, Thomas Friedman, Victor Davis Hanson, Serge Trifkovic, Bat Ye'or, Daniel Pipes -- even Bernard Lewis, if you must 
 I've read and enjoyed all the StarFIST novels. This is one of them in name only. It starts like a typical Starfist novel and even ties in some references to Charlie Bass and high level politicians but there the similarity ends.  I never did figure out what the author's point was except perhaps to rake in some quick cash. The men of the FIST are hard working, hard fighting Marines who trace an honorable history back to the US Marines of the 19th & 20th century. These "Force Recon" marines are a ruthless bunch of screw-ups who could trace their ancestry back to the Waffen SS.  Rather than root for them I soon found myself rooting for the opposition. They invade a fellow member of the confederation, screw-up their primary assignment, fail to get the info they were sent for, kill allied soldiers and airmen, murder helpless civilian prisoners, and assinate the leader of a confederation allied state.  Someone should remind the authors that Recon is about getting accurate, timely, information. It's not about blowing things up.  I really wasted my money on this book, I definitely won't be the first lemming off the cliff the next time these authors have something to peddle. 
 I used this book for an Organizational Behavior graduate course.  The overall topic is very interesting, however, the book is incredibly hard to get through.  It seems that all of the long drawn out chapters could be cut down easily to a tenth of their size, while still conveying all the necessary information.  I found myself spending several hours reading each of the chapters, only to find that the same information was just being regurgitated over and over again.  And I had to read many of the sentences over and over until they made sense.  Though such an interesting topic, it was difficult, time consuming, and frustrating to get through the whole book 
   First I must state I am a huge Douglas Adams fan and enough of a Monty Python fan to know who Terry Jones is.  So when I saw a book with the two names on the front, I was excited.  I remembered hearing about the computer game of the same name, but had never gotten around to playing (still haven't) so I can't compare the two.  Disclosures aside, I still can't believe I didn't enjoy this book.   In the beginning notes, Douglas Adams says this book is "altogether sillier and naughtier" than his would have been.  That's not the half of it.  This novel is Terry Jones' doing a poor imitation of Adams.  It reminds me of what Adams may have written when he was 14, complete with disjointed plot, terrible dialogue and sophomoric sexual humor.     I actually found myself having to re-read passages because the editing was non-existant.  This must have been a rush job, because I spotted quite a few spelling errors, and at least a dozen passages that were extremely confusing.  Did I mention the dialogue was horrible?   I made it through the entire book only because I can't bear to leave a book unfinished.  However, I would not recommend it to anyone.  I hear the game is much better 
 Baring the Calphalon name I was expecting something really nice, especially for the price I paid through Amazon of $84.95 - boy was I disappointed. Although Amazon is selling it as high-quality piece the Calphalon Contemporary Stainless 1-1/2-Quart Saucepan with Glass Lid is clearly on the cheaper side of the Calphalon brand. It looks like one of the pans Calphalon gives away to get you to purchase their higher end cookware. The item arrived nicely boxed in the Calphalon box but when I opened the box the pan looked like it had originally been a Return item before it was sent to me - The pot and lid were both in orginal packaging but the lid was clearly broken. It looked like someone had taken a hammer to it and stuck it back in the box and sent it on to me. Amazon has agreed to send a replacement at no charge but I can't believe they would have sent something like this to me to begin with without first inspecting what they send out. Unless it's being given to you as a "freebie" I suggest you save your money. 
 "Looking Backward" is considered a classic of its type: Utopian literature, which was popular from the sixteenth century into the beginning of the twentieth.  But of course, the vast majority of lives were lived in desperation then, and any escape into a better world was well received.  Bellamy was 31 when this book was published.  As the narrator, he relates his experience of being put into a hypnotic trance as a sleeping aid in 1887 only to be awakened 113 years later, sound of body and mind just as he was when he went to sleep.  But the world has changed to a completely socialistic system.  Bellamy goes into interminable explanations of how the new world operates.  His characters go into long winded, somewhat repetitive, explanations of all phases of this new order.  These tirades become brain numbing in their length and use of archaic words.  I believe it would have been much easier to take if he had made his explanations through dialogues instead of monologues.  And then his character goes out into the world of 2000 Boston.  But, what does he see that's new, different, and exciting?  We never find out, because he doesn't tell us.  In fact, the only new inventions he describes in the entire book are water fountains whose spray works as airconditioners in buildings, awnings hanging over the entire street to keep out rain, pasteboard credit cards, and music and sermons piped into the home through telephone wires.  Too bad he didn't talk with some creative visionaries about what the world might be like in the year 2000, and incorporate some of those concepts in his tale.  He says nothing about changes in fashions, transportation, or any other aspect of his new surroundings.  And there is a glaring error in his utopian world:  He does not take into account human nature.  He glosses this over by claiming that the new socialist order was so successful, that all humans immediately fell into step and laziness, jealousy and greed are no more.  As if that would happen. There is one thought in the entire book I found illuminating.  Paraphrasing here:  Credit can be compared with nothing else but the plight of a man building a house with dynamite for mortar.  With that, I agree.   
 32 years ago I was so stoked that Clapton was finally coming out with a new album, I walked five miles to Deorsey's Records in Lewiston, Maine the day that it was released to buy this much anticipated record. The still near virgin vinyl remains in my LP collection and has only been played once. Once was enough. Heroin robbed a true master of his creativeness, inspiration and technical ability. Sad. 
  After reading bits and pieces of this book from Borders, I decided to order it online. Well, all I can say is that this book was not worth my time and money.    I'll be very honest with you. He does have useful information such as manuscript formatting when submitting it to a publisher, but that's as far as this book goes in terms of being informative.   The attitude of the writer was a definate turn off for me. At first I thought him amusing, but as I kept reading this book I couldn't help feeling that he was being very arrogant and egotistic. In fact, the whole book seems like an ego trip to me. Unlike a lot of writing guide books, Monteleone actually tells us that all writers should aspire to be on the New York Times Best Seller List. Now, throughout the years I have heard of lot of writers and novelists cautioning their creative writing classes   about the consequences of "writing for profit." If you make money on the way, that's great. But making money shouldn't be your biggest reason in writing novels or short stories. You should write because you enjoy it. This, I believe, rings true. Of course, everyone has different opinions about how and WHY he/she writes, but Monteleone keeps shoving the Best Seller's List down the reader's throat. He even has a whole chapter dedicated on    promoting and marketing your novel (such as radio shows, press release, websites, etc.), but barely touches on the subject of getting an agent. After devoting roughly 30 pages on how to sell your book, he makes a few jokes and remarks about literary agents  and then moves on to other topics without telling us where and how we can go about obtaining one. His message is clear: "Making profit should be the writer's ONLY goal."     Also, Monteleone is not shy about showing his disdain towards academics and people who dismiss the so-called "drugstore books" as low-end. He thinks they are cocky and therefore deserves no respect from him (who, by the way, wrote over 20 novels that are out of print). But as far as I am concerned, he is the one who is the arrogant one that belittles the readers of this "How to" book. He has a very strong "it's either my way or no way because other people are all stupid and don't know what they are talking about" idea going throug his book. He lists a bunch of writers who were "the crassest commerical writers of their time" -- Twain, Poe, Dickens, London, Hemingway, etc. But what about writers like Virginia Woolf, D.H. Lawrence, James Joyce and Kafka who were not commercial writers? Monteleone seems to be certain that people will still read Stephen King and Danielle Steel 100 years later.    He also states that he hates people who call themselves "authors" and not "writers" because he finds them (people who prefer to be called "authors") cocky and pretentious. This is one of many examples of Monteleone's arrogance. Again we see the "anyone who does not conform to my rules are stupid and ignorant buffoons" attitude.    One of the absurd rules he strongly suggest that we enforce while writing is "writing three pages a day." I have read other books on creative writing, and although many professional novelists stress the importance of writing steadily everyday, Monteleone is the first one to say that we HAVE TO write three pages a day. His reason for this ridiculous rule? Simple. The faster you write, more books you can sell down the road. The issue of profit-driven writing surfaces again.     Overall, I felt like taking a shower after I read this book. It's more about how to crank out a mediocre novel once a year and  doing everything you can to sell it. Although a good portion of  the book is about writing itself, Monteleone's emphasis is on marketing rather than techniques or even writing a good, solid novel. I felt more discouraged than anything because of his black/white attitude towards writing.     Monteleone ends his guide to writing with "if you want to tell him how much you enjoyed this book, e-mail him at ~." Even that sounds cocky to me after reading this parade of "I'm so great" book. The whole books just sounds like a HUGE EGO TRIP, nothing more.    I found books by Nancy Kress much more helpful than this one.  "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Writing a Novel" is one of the worst investments I ever made.    
 I don't know what language the people in this movie are speaking but it's not English. What comes out of their mouths is a whole lot of nonsense and you end up watching these characters go from point A to point D and have no idea why or what they're doing. Towards the beginning of the movie, Leto and Gyllenhaal visit this lunatic before heading out on their road trip. This guy goes on a rant about God only knows what for what seems like 15min and you can tell by the look on Leto and Gyllenhaal's faces that they wish they were in any movie besides this one. All of the characters in this movie are obnoxious and you care nothing about any of them. But what I found to be the most ridiculous is how these character kept bumping into each other. The movie starts out in Nevada and ends in Washington. Somehow, they all just happen to have run-ins. And what was the point of Alligator Boy? Seriously?   This movie should have been 10min long. Leto has sex with that guy's wife, they break his feet, the end 
 I suppose some people think that one can write anything in a book and call it "history."  But I think Smith's portrayal of the conflict is just too misleading to be called history.  Real people in real life do real things for real reasons.  But after reading this book, I had an image of wicked unarmed Zionists maliciously stealing land from hapless heavily armed Arabs.  It wasn't exactly what Smith had said.  But it was close enough to make me realize what was wrong with the book.  The constant whitewashing of Arab misdeeds and criticism of reasonable Jewish behavior had simply erased the motivations for the two sides in the conflict.  Are there books that do a better job?  Oh yes.  I'll give you ten examples of books that are far better, and there are many, many more:  The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Middle East Conflict (Bard, 2003) A History of Israel (Sachar, 1996) The Siege (O'Brien, 1986) A Young Person's History of Israel (Bamberger, 1985) The Rape of Palestine and the Struggle for Jerusalem (Casper, 2003) Atlas of the Middle East Conflict (Gilbert, 2002) Islam and Dhimmitude (Ye'or, 2002) Right to Exist (Lozowick, 2003) A Place Among Nations (Netanyahu, 1993) From Time Immemorial (Peters, 1984)  Try one of them. 
 This book is pretty much worthless if you are looking for any sort of detailed technical content or information regarding to RFID applications and 'how it works'.  If you are looking for a few 'cookbook' projects to try out then this is kind of good for that, but still not overly impressive.  The author is definitely not an engineer and is just an amature trying to spread some vague information about an technology subject that is much more complicated than is explained in this book.  Buying this book is not a wise of money, in my opinion 
 It is shameful that publishers are reissuing titles previously published under different names.  This volume is nothing more than a compilation of previously published work.  I could have just thrown my money in the garbage 
 At least if you only watch the movie you will save yourself a lot of time, I on the other hand was not so lucky. It is often said that the book is much better than the movie but not in this case. I often found myself saying "Why am I still reading this!" I thought the book would never end. Don't waste your time if you really need to read a novel by the author then pick "A day late a Dollar Short."  
 I've owned this software since it's ridiculously overpriced $500 1.0 inception.  Even at it's latest 1.5.1 $299 version Apple should still be ashamed of themselves.  I use Final Cut Studio and own 3 recent Macs, so I've been devoted to Apple to say the least.  I am a professional wedding photographer/videographer.  I have been more than patient with this software.  It looks great, up to Apple's standards in design and vision but remains absolutely plagued with bugs.  And unless you pay Apple laughable amounts of money (much more than the cost of the software itself!), they will not provide support on anything except installation...even if there software update is the source of the issue.  As someone who has been such an Apple fan, I feel obligated to let everyone know that unless you enjoy pulling your hair out and repeating tasks over and over again do yourself a favor and DOWNLOAD LIGHTROOM FROM ADOBE.  
 This is simply bogawful. Annoying vocals (another Robert Plant wannabe --- I've lost count already!) coupled with substandard, boring and repetitive riffs played by a garage band who struck a record label deal.  Sorry, but these rookies are just too lame and pretentious to compare them to any hard rock band who played in the '70s.   Don't waste your money on this garbage and get any CD recorded between 1970-79 by a REAL HARD ROCK band instead. Retro?... c'mmon, this is getting so tiresome and absurd, such as these guys' stupid lyrics. There is no need to cash out on hard rock's greatest era, much less by a low-level bunch of puny novices who are just yelling and starting to learn how to play guitar and drums.  Please save your hard earned money and get the real thing.  (ONE star for the cover art 
 I have greatly enjoyed the Anita Blake series previous to this installment, even going back to re-read many of them several times.  However, I found "Danse Macabre" disappointing. While the imagery and characters are solid and well-developed, this individual book greatly lacks for a plotline. The characters spend so much time having sex that they don't really get out of bed until somewhere after the first 400 pages, then they go to the ballet, which is interrupted by an emergency sex scene, then they finish watching the ballet, talk to someone at a dance club, then it's back into bed for more sex for the remainder of the book. This felt like a half-developed idea for a short story, propped up with 500 pages of extraneous sex.  Still, the endless sex scenes are very well written. If you enjoy detailed, passionate, sensual, group sex, erotica narrative, you will enjoy this book very much. However, if you are hoping for the exciting mystery and adventure of the previous thirteen Anita Blake novels, you will find none of that here.  On the bright side, the excerpt of the next book, while containing one sex scene, also contains a scene in which Anita interviews a client in her office. That does seem to suggest that an actual mystery may be addressed in book 15. Here's hoping 
 This book is like reading a trashy tabloid - lots of flashy big colour photos, low on substance. Obviously trying to cash in on current interest in forensics, each chapter is poorly written and is accompanied with 3 or 4 case studies.  The material in each chapter seems to be just common sense any adult could write about after doing minimal research and the case studies are too short, repetitive and sometimes don't even make sense.   Very disappointing. I suspect this book is intended for age group around 8-15 although it never says this anywhere 
 With so many excellent unsigned bands in the world, you really have to wonder when you stumble across a major label debut from a band as terminally boring as The Lashes. Get It provides around 40 minutes of straight-ahead rock that is far too by the numbers. Straight-ahead rock can be fun when played with blistering emotion; however, The Lashes are going through the motions. Bringing absolutely nothing fresh to the table musically, the compact songs seem to drone on well past three minutes.     Occasionally slipping into a faux-European accent, lead singer Ben Clark sounds about as pretentious as a rock star can get without actually being a member of Spinal Tap. The album features mind-blowing elementary lyrics such as: "Sometimes the sun goes down/Sometimes it comes back up/I'm wondering which one you're watching now" on "Sometimes The Sun". In an attempt to wake up the band on "Safe To Say", the Seattle sextet ends up making more noise than music. The Lashes' laughable hook on the song consists of repeating: "I guess it's safe to say it's over" about 10 times. Unfortunately for the listener, it isn't over at that point - the album still has another seven attempts to bore you into submission.   Rock music should be dangerous and fresh. Listening to it should give the image of a runaway freight train that might fly off the tracks at any moment. You know exactly where all 11 of these songs are going, and don't care. There is nothing fresh, new, exciting, or emotional on this album. Do not follow the album title's advice. 
 In purchasing Delta, I thought that I was going to be able make a lot of money in the stock market since the ups and downs are already locked in. The only way you're likely to make any sort of money from this is in long term commodity futures. Even then, you're still not guaranteed success. I've given this book one star based on the fact that fundamentally Delta is utterly useless when it comes to accurate buying and selling 
 here is yet another dense math book unreadable to everybody except those already familiar with the material-- why the  authors opted for this broad and sketchy treatment is unclear --- introducing more topics than a russian novel has characters, the book is more likely to lead the reader to a state of exhaustion rather than enlightenment -- one has to ask who could possibly benefit   from this machine gun style exposition as there are more comprehensive  and gentle surveys available of each of the many subjects they touch on -- answer = no one -- ps it is an abomination to compare this unwieldy mess to a pedagogical masterpiece like Hardy and Wright -- don't believe their lie 
 I wanted to like this book: but often asking writers such questions brings on words that are not spontaneous and that though they may be competent in intellectualism, they are impoverished in beauty and in gutsiness, which is the kind of writing that truly sings. Since time to read is limited for most persons, it might be good to read the original materials and forget about the rehashed commentary. I would far rather see a diamond than read about one 
 I am a huge Dylan fan and have watched entire documentaries and tv specials just to see two words uttered about him but "1966 World Tour - The Home Movies" stretches the bounds of legitimate Dylan enthusiasm.  To say it will add nothing to your Dylan collection would be an understatement.  In fact, you might be just as likely to catalog this video under "miscellaneous" in your movie library, as it is more about some guy who Dylan employed as a drummer for a while in 1966 than it is about Dylan.  I don't know if Dylan refused to allow the release of actual 1966 video footage of him or if he just avoided this guy when the camera was rolling.  Regardless, if you want to see good "home movie" footage of Dylan, this is not the place.   
 This book didn't give enough information, and it was very misleading.   Look for Dr. McDougall's books on Amazon. Or, if you google Dr. McDougall, you can go to his website and see what he has to say about diabetes. Numerous studies show about 75 percent of type 2 diabetes is completely curable - within 10 days - by changing your diet. Period. You can come off all medication and insulin. He gives the information you need, completely free, on his website. Use his method, and you'll soon see your blood sugars return to normal . . . but then the various companies that make a fortune off diabetes will be suffer.   Another thing about this dummies book: It's chock-full of ads. The author heavily peppers his writing with all sorts of product endorsements and gets kickbacks for them. 
 Don't be fooled by the positive reviews.  This film is low-budget in a cheap, cliched, poor dialog, predictable way.  Less than halfway through, I began to wonder if I had accidentally picked some soft core porn.  But this movie isn't even sexy.  I don't know why I finished watching it.  Those are some minutes I can't get back 
 Not having read any of Vonnegut's work for 30 years, I opened A Man Without a Country and remembered why I'd SO assiduously avoided him. As a natural conservative I much enjoy the thrust and parry of lively political debate. But KV, like almost every socialist I've ever met, doesn't do debate, preferring mockery, innuendo, myth and wilfully distorted facts. It's the superior sneer of the self-styled intellectual who doesn't know what he's talking about. His unwavering belief in doctrinal socialism brings to mind a line from Emerson: "Foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds."  His defence of Marx, beginning with religion being the opium rather than the opiate of the masses demonstrates his willingness to distort language. That he then manages to blend the benefits of Marxist ideology with the evils of slavery left me moderately bemused. (The American Indian, who cause he champions, was something of a proto-Marxist and quite happily used slaves.) His obsession with slavery and the inference that the United States was uniquely guilty of it is symptomatic of historical revisionism at its most banal. Slavery is a millennia-old, worldwide phenomenon, with a reasonable chance that most of us have distant ancestors who suffered it. But during the period he's most exercised about villainous white slavers didn't mount raids into the interior of Africa, they purchased stock from coastal chieftains who enjoyed vast profits from the sale of fellow Africans. And who, after parliament made not just the trade but the ownership of slaves illegal in Britain, wrote letters of howling protest to the crown that the new law was going to ruin them. Just as Vonnegut ignores the complicity of Africans in the trade, he also omits that it was white European stock that lobbied against and eventually outlawed what had existed in Africa long before the arrival of the first Portuguese explorers, and continued long after it was banned by European and North American governments (or that it still exists amongst the Arabs and West Africans today). Unsurprisingly, he overlooks the enslavement of over a million white Europeans by Barbary corsairs between 1500 and the mid-1800s. Spain and the Italian city states suffered the greatest depredations, but the North African raiders seized thousands of Irish, Cornish and Welsh and not an insignificant number of colonial American seamen. (See Christian slaves, Muslim Masters, Robert Davis, Palgrave MacMillan, 2003)  Vonnegut decries the "135,000" deaths in the bombing of Dresden, deliberately ignoring that German academics now put the figure at closer to 30,000. Which is bad enough, but ol' Kurt not only prefers the discredited number, but makes no mention of the 60,000 British civilians killed between 1940 and 1945 by German bombs, V1s and V2s.  His horror over the deaths of some 200,000 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki doesn't include the 300,000 deaths in Nanking to Japanese bullet, bayonet, gang rape, and burning or burying alive, or the three million Chinese who died during the invasion and occupation of their country by Imperial troops. Or that Allied soldiers, PoWs, and enslaved Asian labourers were dying at the hands of the Japanese right up to the day after that big flash over Nagasaki. Balance is not one of Kurt's strengths.  Comparing Americans with Nazis ("And with good reason.") is simply fatuous. Not even the most virulently anti-Bush liberal leftie hyperventilates at the prospect of the USA invading Luxembourg or Andorra.  "Our president is a Christian?" Kurt asks. "So was Adolf Hitler." In fact, Hitler had the same disdain for religion as Marx had. The future Greater Germany was to be religion-free.  His many references to the evil of oil might have at least a hint of resonance if I knew this great sage hasn't driven a car, used the subway, boarded a commercial flight, or used an electrical appliance that wasn't powered by his own wind-driven generator in the last 30 years.   And then...oh hell, there are so many more examples of the woe-is-me-a-lone-voice-in-the-wilderness-that-knows-how-evil-America is. Vonnegut belongs to that genre of Western self-loathers who have benefited enormously from the capitalist system they hate. You'd think he might have considered settling in Sweden. Maybe he was put off by the socialist tax rate he'd have to pay.  
 Two of the short stories in this book, "Running out of Dog" and "Gone down to Corpus" are not new stories.  Running out of Dog is a spelendid example of what we expect from Mr. L. writing about ironies and tragedies of average people.  But, it should have been noted that 40% of this book is not original.    The others are average reads, over before we have any understganding of the characters Mr. Lehane writes so well about.  None of the others are full of tension, irony, comedy, tragedy, and suspense we've all come to expect. They are mediocre stores meant to sell on the author's excellent reputation.  We waited a long time for another Lehane.  This book certainly does not showcase his talents 
 I hate this book. I wanted the apocylipse, i wanted world war watever the people in that book had gotten to. I wanted the Phalanx Nations to reign death and destruction upon the unsuspecting populous of Yonwood. Instaed, i got a crazy old lady, and even crazier old lady who should be arrested, and a whole town full of otherwise crazy people, acceptign a few people of course. 
 I have read several books in this genre, and this has to be one of the dullest books on the market that deals with life in Italy.  I've lived in Italy on two occasions for short periods of time and can't help but wonder - if Mr Parks dislikes Italy so much, why is he still there?  He certainly comes across as disliking Italy and Italians.  This has none of the humor or whimsy of other similar books.  Very disappointing.   I should have know better since I also read "Italian Neighbors" and was unimpressed by it 
 Am I the only one who knows that Mr. Douglass lost his mother at an early age and that contrary to this book, she was not a major influence in his life? The author didn't do his homework. This book is full of inaccuracies  about Douglass' life 
 I bought this book. I read this book. Then I put it back on the shelf where it has sat ever since.  I'm a more recent convert to Anne Rice's vampire books, having only read them since Pandora came out in '98 (By the way, thanks for that one Santa!)but I have since bought all the vampire and mayfair witches books. I enjoy the witches and the vampire books in two very different ways, and if I had not realised this before, it was made clear to me by this book. Unfortunately, even those parts I enjoyed were ruined by those I didn't. The introduction was both patronising insulting. Lestat's scene with the Pope, frankly silly, as has his very character become. I think the main problem I had with this book was the romance between my formerly favourite gorgeous fiend and Rowan, which seemed tacked on to the story as an after thought rather than a truely pivotal plot point. The series has been going for a while, and one can't blame the authoress for losing interest in the characters after so long, but one can't help but wish Lestat's final outing had been less... well, bland. I found the typographical errors frustrating, along with the plot holes and continuity errors (which others have gone into in great depth, so I won't bother with them). It's an okay resolution to the Witches series, but leaves the vampire series gasping and flipping around like a dying fish on the carpet. It's hard to say more without giving away the plot, so I wont, however, I will recommend other books by Anne Rice should this one not suit your taste.  DO read: Interview with the Vampire, Pandora, Vittorio the Vampire and Tale of the Body Snatcher.  Pandora, which I read first, remains my own personal favourite.     Now to address all the idiotic controversy:  1) Play the ball, not the man. When you write a review, keep your opinions of authors names to yourself. No-one cares. Nor do they care about your opinions of their private lives or habits.  2) Saying an author writes only for his or herself is not only a hideous cliche, but is undervaluing the work that goes into writing a successful book. If people are parting with their hard earned wodges of folding stuff  to purchase copies, and you are supplying copies, you are no longer writing only for yourself. If you are writing for yourself, it would be scribbled in private diaries.  3) On a public fourm, anyone can express their views, positive or negative. Variety of opinion is a sign of a healthy readership. Deal with it.  4) Don't feed the trolls.  When an author posts a rant, even if you feel it is justified, remember: Trolls who are posting merely for the attention take any response to them as a win and are thrilled. People giving honest reviews and critiques will find the vilification and insults defensive and immature. People who are devoted and loyal readers probably wont read any reviews. And those who make up the majority of the worlds readers, who have no particular affinity for any one author will take away a negative view of all those concerned. If you must reply to reviews (even the very off-topic ones) for goodness sake provide an calm and reasoned explanation do not denigrate, patronise or attack those with differing opinions.  This goes for reviewers as well 
 This could be a useful source on several different levels, but there are some problems in the text that may confuse the average reader. The book is designed for readers to better understand the basics of the Balkan Crisis.  However, the reader must understand a good deal of history (a little more  than a college survey in Western history) in order to fully comprehend the  method the authors use to describe Bosnian History. Furthermore, the book  contains too many generalizations and not enough details. Evidence is  rarely given to support their conclusions or defend their position from  other theories. Definitions on some key pharses are lacking in the text  itself when the reader encounters it for the first time. A glossary is  provided but the information there should be mirrored, at least partially,  in the body of the text. I do hold that the authors are well studied and  educated, and that their conclusions *seem* correct. But I need some  documentation and evidence that should be contained in their arguements in  order to trust in their conclusions 
 Don't expect any code from this book from the WROX website - the book says it's available but I couldn't find it - and the people at WROX don't answer their email. I like the book, don't like the publisher much 
 I have read a few things by Lattimore, and while he is touted as the most accurate translator of Greek literature, I find him increadibly difficult to read. His sentences sometimes make no sense at all.  English is a language that depends upon syntax and the order of words in a sentence; Greek is not this way, it is a language with myriad declensions and conjugations, effectively allowing its poets to manipulate a sentence's word order.  Lattimore may simply be too accurate to the Greek originals, because the word order--translated so precisely--simply does not fit well in the English. I recommend Fagles, who is an amazing translator; and while he is accurate, he also understands the limitations of translating the Greek to English. His sentences are fluid and capture the life of the translation. For Aeschylus, I also recommend Philip Vellacott. Check out Fagles, then check out Vellacott. But please forego the Lattimore translations, unless you really want to understand just the sort of impact a bad translation can have. 
 I'm not a member of Douglas' target audience.  That much is obvious as soon as the book opens.  Nevertheless, I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt.  I don't consider myself to be a sexist, though I wouldn't label myself a feminist, either.  I'm sympathetic to some of the goals of the feminist movement: equal pay for equal work; non-discrimination in employment; basically, equal rights across the board.  What Douglas advocates in her book, however, is not equal rights.  It is special rights, and I believe that women like Douglas are the reason the feminist movement often gets such a bad rap.  Government-funded child care, taxpayer-supported abortions, national health insurance, Social Security for homemakers, and many other socialist policies are proposed as solutions to what were predominantly cultural issues, not legal impediments to equality (though I'm not denying that they existed, and still exist in some cases today).  She often uses her book to make ad hominem attacks against anyone further right on the political spectrum than Ted Kennedy, at one point calling Walt Disney a "right-wing reactionary" for his support of Barry Goldwater in 1964.  She further declares that Richard Nixon's election in 1968 convinced her that "America was not a democracy at all" and that "the status quo was inhumane and monstrous."  She uses her book as a forum to protest the Vietnam war, lend support to black radicalism, and basically do anything she can to distract attention from the fact that the feminist movement was extremely radical and that perhaps the ERA went down to defeat because people truly did understand what was at stake and chose to reject it.  As for the main subject matter of this book, any movie, TV show, or song which did not depict women getting the best of men had deleterious effects on the female psyche and made her feel worthless as a person.  The most absurd moment, for me, came when Douglas felt the need to refer to all sorts of phallic symbols in various westerns.  I'm sorry if it offends her, but the cowboys' "shiny metal oblongs" were not designed to oppress women, they were designed to shoot small oblongs at other cowboys with oblongs.  It's one thing to see a sexist message in I Dream of Jeannie; it's quite something else to be pig-headed for its own sake.  Douglas' failure to remain objective makes this book an unenjoyable read for anyone whose politics are not those of the extreme left.  .. 
 Some good stuff, but lacks structure and suspense. It's like wading through a lake of warmed-over oatmeal. (SPOILER ALERT) Certain moments are fascinating. The story that the famous gangster tells the cop, while he's sitting outside the thug's bunker, works well, but then the guy is dead, supposedly, and the air goes out of the story. I didn't believe the gangster killed himself. Doesn't make sense. But he goes on telling the story anyway, and now there is nothing at stake. Even a literary novel has suspense. "As I Lay Dying" is a page-turner compared to "Sacred Games." I lasted exactly 50 pages. Some of the writing is good, but some of it is clunky, too. I got tired of looking up the Indian words, flipping to the back of the book. I'd rather have them translated right there, in italics or in parentheses. Soon I just read over them and didn't care. There is something compelling about a more-or-less stock gangster story set in an exotic culture, but I needed interlocking story questions to hold me there. 
 This book can be a light read to occupy an hour on the plane. I kind of expected some miraculuous book after reading reviews like: "Wow it changed my life" or "I wish I knew this stuff  10 years ago". In my opinion, most of the stuff explained is pretty obvious. A lot of the stuff is absurd. There are some good tips but they're few. For example, some topics or advice:  "How do determine the gender of your date?" Doh!! "How to escape from a bad date" comes down to do a major dress and makeup overhaul in the washroom or break the washroom window and run away. And has picture of a man doing that. Come on! What kind of woman can scare the hell out of a guy that he wants to break a window in a washroom and run? "How to survive credit card decline" advises you and your date to wash dishes in the restaurant to pay for your meal or teaches how to run away quick "How to make love in an elevator" comes down to two things:  1. Stop the elevator 2. Make love really fast.... Very insightful  How to fake orgasm and how to stop the wedding are fascinating reads. What to do if you wake up in a bed with a person whose name you don't remember gives a positive and refreshing attitude and a bunch of suggestions where to look for a name tag :)  There is some potentially useful stuff how to fight your body odour, bad  breath, etc. But if you know you have this problem it's easy to find the right solution against your particular problem on the net.  Overall, there is not much worth keeping in memory besides your common sense. Unless you're a virgin who does not know how to remove woman's bra or an idiot who does not know that if you cheat you should take every possible precaution 
 I'm part way into this book, I have about 200 pages left, and I'm already confused.   For instance how is everyone in the little unheard of community of Ravenkill right up with the happenings in The Hague?  Does world wide news reach little burgs that fast.  And what was with Andrew Franconia the innkeeper that he calls the US Marshalls as soon as Maggie registers?   I don't get it, everyone seems to know what everyone else is doing faster than they can move about.   So I guess I'll have to finish the story to find all the answers if they are revealed 
 This is a badly written book. Unfortunately, there is a plethora of poorly conceived books on this subject, written by folks who seem to have become "feng shui masters" overnight. It's a shame because it makes it more difficult for people to wade through the  nonsense written out there such as this, & find material that IS decently written. For example, this person gets their compass directions utterly "au contraire", yes that's right.......backwards. Any architect that endorses this book is an embarrasment to the AIA. Look elsewhere. 
  well, sometimes a generalizing lie. .  IMHO, this book should have been named "(some) Spidering Hacks using Perl" .  the "100" and "industrial strength" sale pitches they could have spared from the title as well .  the very little python and java code that was either mentioned and/or included as code examples I think was as a way to pepper the content and apparently make it more appealing to a broader audience .  ._ the book is mostly about Perl scripts (you could compile Perl to C and then use c2java, for example, but why bothering if, as I noticed right away, it was mostly toy code?) I wonder what the "industrial strength" thing was all about.  There is also some gnu utils examples (wget and curl), from which you could get better examples online  ._ the book has "examples" that don't make any sense (to me) and not only that but you could see as a total waste of time, why bothering scraping amazon's pages if they offer SOAP/RSS feeds? And not only that but then he goes on telling you how to scrape a site offering financial stocks info, too!?!?! I would have started by splitting the book in two, cases for which you don't really need scraping at all and those for which you do  ._ the author in an attempt to reach the "100" mark, included cases on how to download, say MP3 with Beatles songs and PDF files from IRS sites as separate cases :-? I wonder what the difference is once you have a connection to the data feed?!? .  there is, "Web Content Mining with Java" ISBN: 047084311X and as you see the publishers/authors named this book after what it is all about and if you want to read about "industrial strength" approaches I would recommend "Mining the Web" ISBN: 1558607544 .  usually "hacks" books are about hacks, meaning you already know your stuff and are learning some hacks. If you know the basics of spiders and how to retrieve data off the Net programmatically this book is not for you. If you, on the other had, are new to this subject and are a Perl programmer you may learn a few things from it .  ot 
 This is the only book in this series I've read (thank heaven!), but I could not believe the author was serious with all her trite adjectives and cliches. Suits are "neatly tailored." People "peer intently" and "collapse in a heap." She is particularly found of well-worn similes: "Her heart thudded like a drum in her chest." "He gripped his pencil like a vice." "...thought that buzzed through her head like a fly caught between a window screen and the glass." And the most irritating of all, this book could have been subtitled "Antiques Author in Heat." I've never read a mystery that sounded so much like a bad romance novel. "He exuded a powerful aura of sexual intensity and electricity that seemed to surge through his hand." That was her second conquest -- the first "longed to kiss her full, pouty lips." Not bad for a writer "with thick legs." I laughed, but the sad part is I was predisposed to like a good mystery about antiques, but whatever plusses the plot had got buried in the horrible writing. 
 With Asie Payton dead the folks at Fat Possum have scraped the bottom of the barrel of tapes to make this cd. It sounds like demos, out takes, rejected songs or practice sessions from different times some solo some with different backings .Im a big fan of Fat Possums style but this is the worst bunch of crap they have ever released 
 As a piece of entertainment, this book falls flat. Way flat.  There is a story here, but mundane sub-plots (including the love story) are thrown in in an attempt to fill the pages to make it a book.  I found myself skipping pages - lots of them - to get to the point.  Overall, very disappointing.  
 Call me simple, but I had a hard time gleaning anything useful from this book. I was able to understand a few of her points, but mostly I was just reading words that I couldn't quite grasp or put into use. I would recommend "Great singers on great singing" by Jerome Hines. That has alot of valuable information from some of our favorite singers 
 This book is certainly heavy on the eye-candy - it has lots of great pictures (though perhaps dated... very late-80's hair styles) and nice listings describing the colleges and whatnot. If you're looking for something that gives a feel for the look of the place (or at least the look on nice early-summer days when all the students are wearing their gowns), this is a lovely place to look.  Unfortunately, glaring factual errors and odd 'stereotypes' really detracted from the quality of this guide. Included is a brief summary of the Oxford colleges. Unfortunately, many are left out (seemingly at random - the maps also leave out several important sites while including other entirely mundane ones) and the descriptions of others are factually quite incorrect (and sometimes contradictory - All Souls is described as being the only graduate college [it is not a graduate college], then Nuffield is also described as being a graduate college [it is]). There are also odd little tidbits of information that seem to represent a story of the colleges frozen sometime in the past (and not a nifty 1920's past - presumably the late 1980's or early '90's when the first edition was published) - 'excellent darts team?' ok, so they may have once, but that's rather useless information today. My own college's description, though quite pleasant, is not a very good representation of the place today. Some of the college descriptions are also really just mean, representing some undefined antipathy on the part of the author (did someone from that college steal his girlfriend or something?).  Overall, it's a very pretty publication that certainly had a very good team of photographers and graphic designers, but as it's not so strong on the facts and could do with some updates - Oxford isn't as unchanging as it may seem 
 The genius of the Authority and the fantastic Transmet. has produced quite possibly the worst series ending story in existence.  Garbage is what this is, pure garbage.  I was truly insulted by the choice of scourge.  Aliens.  Sigourney Weaver's Aliens.  Oh yeah.  Quite insulting.  I won't say how it ends because I want this review posted, suffice it to say that you'll be hurt and digusted.  Ellis must have been possessed to write this disaster.  DO NOT BUY 
 This is a nicly styled jersey that could use a fabric or fabric finish makeover. The plain polyester is rough to the skin requiring the use of an undershirt to prevent chafing. The collar is cut high enough to cut across the base of the neck leaving a nasty burn mark.  A cotton, cotton blend, or silk would have made a better choice of fabric making this an unbeatable jersey for many uses 
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 I loved Waterhouse's book "Outsmarting the Female Fat Cell" and I was hoping to learn a lot from this one too.  Unfortunately, this book was offering 8 commonly known strategies, like: destress your life - that's good - without more specific HOW's.  An example; if you have three kids, a demanding job and an unhelpful husband, she'd like you to change your attitude, not particularly your life.  Hello!  I've learned all of her strategies and a lot more from magazines, such as Prevention, including more up-to-date facts.  For instance, Waterhouse recommends kava-kava for sleeping.  However, lately kava-kava has come into disrepute due to German medical studies.  Also, I would have rather seen more information explaining WHY these 8 stragies work, rather than just the "do-it's", for instance: how hormones affect us, etc... as her other book did 
 I was extremely disappointed in this version. The translation by M. D. Herter Norton is much more eloquent. Save your money and buy that one instead 
 Please, if you want to waste your time and money buy this book. Sincerely, this book does not say anything valuable or new. There is a program (for free) RF-popHR made in 1998 that calculate these claimed kabalistic hours and you do not need the book for anything (I remark, for anything). The only thing you have to do is to adjust the hour playing with Time Zones in using a good ephemeris as Suncycle program (also shareware) 
 Simply, a terribly written book.  It has a shallow plot, flat characters and no style.  His descriptions of people are often late, and tend to consist of someone's skin colour.  And that's all.  The story moves ok at first but degrades into the most uninteresting chase/camping trip in the history of the world.   The ideas presented are soft, touchy feely sort of "the soul is love" type crap.  Seems like it's a rip off of The Celestine Prophecy, which isn't something anyone should want to rip off in the first place 
 I purchased a case of angelfood cake and the first three I baked didn't turn out very well. I ended up giving the other three boxes away 
 I decided that I had to write a review about Newsweek this morning, after I came across yet another biased, over-hyped cover story. This particular one is entitled, "Rethinking the Marriage Crunch," and goes back on everything they presented 20 years ago about a woman's chances of getting married later in life. This was undoubtedly very easy for them to do as they probably had no evidence for their assertion the first time around, and neglected to have any on this occasion. I really think another reviewer's comparison to People is quite apt, but Newsweek also provides a reliably pro-sexual revolution and pro-sixties counter-culture take on almost every issue. Two years ago, we were made privy to another bit of front page sensationalism concerning "Infidelity Chic." Yes, it seems, according to their sources, spousal cheating is all the rage even though they argue, without even a hint of contradiction, that everybody still wants to get married as much as ever before. I find the magazine to be [...] as they offer opinion instead of news; theirs is a mission of persuasion. Overall, there is little of which to recommend this publication as it is geared for a readership of trivial people who possess the depth of a kiddy pool. 
 Boy, I hate to point out a negative here, but to say that fundamentalism is a way of holding a belief and not about content is historically ill informed. Fundamentalism began as a reaction against denominational seminaries adopting theological views that were viewed as against scripture in their content. Here are a few of those issues. You tell me if you think they are content or ways of holding it: Jesus was not born of a virgin. Many of the miracles of Jesus were fictional. Jesus did not necesarily raise from the dead. Most of the more outrageous Old Testament stories were not to be taken as historically accurate. I could go on. Has he not read what really happened historically to create that movement??? Big mistake, or real dishonest! Even now Rollins goes about building what they reacted against. Rollins says he will not be undermining Chrisitan content, but he is opening the door for those who will. In fact, for him to make the following statement about life after death makes me wonder if he really cares about truth or his post modern posture. "Death is a term that refers to the end of all experience. Regardless of what, if anything, happens after this event,..."page 47  He strives to make his own point at the expense of Christian truth.  Fundamentalism, even today, in it's popularly decried "no fun, too much dam, and not enough mental" caricature is really primarily about content and only secondarily about how they hold their views.  It was born in a fight and Rollins wants to take us back into the fight. Evangelicalism is the answer as to content and holding it rightly, but Rollins really does not believe in answers. 
 I can fix this! This movie never happened. Now we need to make Starship Troopers 2. I will contribute a few bucks. If we all contribute, we can get an actual director to come along, preferably the one from the first movie, get us some big time sponsors, and make us one heck of a Starship Troopers 2! There, I have repaired the terrible tear in all our souls that this fake Starship Troopers 2 caused us all 
 I heard Taubman touting Secret Empire on NPR and was expecting a really good book. Nevertheless, the book disappointed me.  Although it does contain some useful background material on US reconnaissance efforts in the 1950's, the book's hundred pages of interesting material are interspersed with three hundred sixty pages of dull banter about bureaucratic turf battles, tedious background information on personnel, and other tiresome detail.  Oddly, what I felt were the most compelling stories often got short shrift. The development of the SR-71 Blackbird, for example, merits only a couple pages.  The U2's operation over Cuba also got virtually zero coverage.  I find it incredible that this book could have been written without a comprehensive telling of the story behind the Cuban U2 flights and Adlai Stevenson's presentation of US reconnaissance images before the UN in 1962.  I was also caught off guard by the somewhat odd, non-chronological format of the book. Taubman will spend an entire chapter discussing the United States' utter inability to get a reconnaissance satellite into orbit, then a few pages later in the next chapter he will jump to another subject, only to refer in passing to a constellation of advanced US spy satellites.  I couldn't help but think that the subjects were portrayed in a hit or miss fashion, and perhaps I had missed the best parts.  Finally, the terrorism add-on at the end of the book seems like a half-hearted (and somewhat cynical) attempt to keep the book's material relevant in the post 9/11 world 
 Not really up to my expectation and I'm not impressed, there was no historical background on the Bloody Sunday, mainaction in the movie were streetfightings, killings etc. Would not recommend. 
 The original. He was kind of cool, but now he ain't; people using his backwardness against us. Forget this dude, or perish. 1896 speech was a total sell out to da man.  Drop ya boots, dawg!!! I 
 As a fan of Frederick Buechner, I found this volume in our church library and secured it anticipating a summer weekend of ecstasy, reading this book on the back porch while sipping lemonade.  I found it disappointing, as he focuses on his  collection of Buechner  family memoribilia.  As hard as he tries to universalize it, making it accessible to all of us, for me, it just didn't work.  And it reads like  a review of one's summer family reunion.  Sorry.  Read his other stuff.  It's great! 
 I liked: 2:Aging Spinsters 6:Pillow Fight 13:Puerto Rico Way  the rest sounded a bit bland. The song lengths are not to long which is good because even if these songs were any longer they would start to be boring 
 Ladder 49 was not the type of film I expected-- I was hoping for a good, fast-paced action flick, which I got for about the first 5 minutes. The remainder of the 30 minutes that I watched was flashback to the rookie firefighter's first days at the station.   Someone looking for drama and a story about the growth of a firefighter would probably like this movie. However, those looking for action should probably look elsewhere 
 I like Sam Elliott movies very much. This one was BAD!!! A lot of Bad Language. Every couple of words. It should be rated R. I think instead of PG 
 received above book; correct cover, but inside is another book by name of 'the glass key' by dashiell hammett. tried to contact you by various means, to no avail.original packaging long gone. how do i go about getting the book i ordered?? 
 I was excited to get my hands on a book that was intended to help family members understand the thought process of a person with an eating disorder.  What I found was a confusing circular discussion that never achieved its goals.  Reading each chapter leaves the reader hanging for some answers only to be dissappointed with the next chapter and hoping for a summary at the end of the book which never comes.  There are several books on the market for family members that are useful but this is not one of them 
 Like other reviewers, I found MeetThe Parents mildly amusing and this sequel was in the 3 for $25 bin at Hollywood so I figured "Why not?" Well here's why not. It presents the main character's parents as crude, clueless buffoons, and having no social judgement whatsoever, but it seems the writers want the audience to think of them as cool and hip. And for some odd reason they live in a house that resembles the castle on Fantasy Island. I'm surprised they didn't include a sex with a midget scene. Nobody would want their daughter to marry into this family let alone a right wing former CIA agent, who was set up as an object of ridicule. Oh, and they had to be Jewish too. Streisand and Hoffman should be ashamed of themselves portraying their own people in such an unflattering way. {"Our people don't shoot ducks, dear") Do former CIA agents make enough money to live in mansions and buy a custom built RV that would cost at least $250 k? The toilet humor and profanity wouldn't have made it into "Dumb and Dumber" Nothing reedeming or funny here. Fuhgeddaboutit 
 I bought these for my mom as a gift thinking, "hey, they're cheap, isn't all shearling good?" Not so much. The insides of these slippers felt similar to burlap. They were very sturdy! Not so comfy.  They also ran about a size smaller than I ordered. I'm a size 7, and the 8's were a little small for my feet. 
 After having read and loved Howard Pyle's 1968 Classic Press edition of "The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood" I was quite  disappointed with "The Story of King Arthur and His Knights". Whereas Pyle brilliantly brought his characters to life in "Robin Hood", the characters of "King Arthur" seem flat and lifeless by comparison.  The King Arthur stories read like little more than a description of events; one doesn't really get a feeling of being there while things are happening as in "Robin Hood." The dialogue seems much more realistic in "Robin Hood", but I think there's more to it.  The writing style in "King Arthur"  I'd characterize as prosaic---in sharp contrast to the charming, poetic style of writing in "Robin Hood."  
 In "The Lady in the Tower" Jean Plaidy sets off to make Anne Boleyn sympathetic-it does not work. In history, I view Anne as one of the most complex and intriguing characters, one whom I have grown to love. Anne Boleyn was smart, intriguing, mysterious, and dark yet she was still kind, relgious and irresistable.  In this novel, she seems to be none of these.  Jean Plaidy's Anne Boleyn is dull, mechanical, moral, sweet, and arrogant(if I had read the sentence "I had many admirers" one more time, I just might have thrown it out the window).  I felt like I was told of Anne's good qualities, rather than shown them.  Also, Plaidy's Anne is quite judgemental, which I have never seen the actual Anne as being.  Anne is the first to judge her sister Mary, Henry, Her father, and most of all Cardinal Wolsey.  Never have I been more confused as to a character's relationship with another character.  For instance, we are told over and over again how much Anne dislikes Wolsey, but in the next sentence she says "poor old man" or "I felt sympathy for him".  Also, many of the facts of the story are repeated over and over again and almost all of the book is Anne repeating politics.  I would have enjoyed hearing about Anne's personal life, for once 
 if you search a bank of america somewhere in florida this is the book to buy. despite of this there is a lot of other useful and useless information in the book. unfortunately the authors did usually not try to give valued comments, therefore you have no idea which things you should see and which aren't worth the trip.Additionally the authors do not always give you good descriptions of how to get to certain places and you should have another guide or at least detailed map for that. FOr example we ended up walking 2 hours through the sun to find the entrance of one of the parks... This is very different from the high standard of the lonely planet california which I had in mind when I bought this book. In conclusion I was very disappointed by this guide and would not recomment to buy it at all... 
 I received the boots and found them to be extremley well made. I liked the double zippers very much. I was looking for a boot that could be put on easily when wearing thicker socks and the double zippers really worked well. However, I normally wear a size 9M so I ordered a 9 1/2M. What I received  (although marked  9 1/2M) was more like 10 1/2M. Just way to big in length and Amazon did not have any smaller sizes. Sadly I had to return the boots. I found the same boot (smaller size) advertised directly  from Kenneth Cole but was twice the price that Amazon had them listed for. One thing to note on the return paper work there was not sufficient reasons or space to spell out the reason for returning item 
 I read A is for Alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series.  Years later I read S is for Silence and was hooked. I started to read the series--backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning.  I have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine (and forgiven Ms. Grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6" frame).  However, I agree with the other readers who feel like this is not Grafton at her best.  You just can't believe that Kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions---belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating, remaining in an incredibly (and unbelievable) dangerous situation, to name a few.  The dialogue is weak,the sexual situations seem gratutitous, and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics.  But even with these issues, I did finish the book.  Grafton at her low point is still a good read 
 I waited 6 weeks and Amazon never sent the book so I cancelled the order and gave up 
 Once I saw the numerous reviews coating the inside and outside of this book telling me how much I was going to like it, I was already dubious.  Perhaps I like to be contrary, and that may be why I was irritated by this book.  I understand that this is his way of dealing with the passing of his parents and the growing up he was "forced" to do, but his style of writing came off as abrasive, narcissistic, and smug.  This is a memoirs of sorts, so it's hard for me to criticize his need to put this out, but if I was supposed to gain anything from it, I didn't.   I didn't find his wordplay sparkling, I don't find him droll or charming, and I felt like he was trying too hard for me to do so.  Plus he yammered on so much it was hard to understand the message(s) he was trying to convey to the reader, if any.    
 As a subscriber to a service that Mike Coval writes for that I enjoy, I had high hopes for a full length book written by him. Unfortunately, this book really sucks and the money I spent to buy it would have been better spent on just about anything else. Period. There is NOTHING of value here. By about page 10, I was fully convinced that I had been had, and realized all too late that this was just a poor excuse for a book.  Please don't buy this - Buy the Josh Lukeman book, or any Alexander Elder book, or even a Cramer book. This thing stinks to high heaven 
 I cannot believe this is the same person who wrote that fantastic book, Absolute Power.  David, what happened????  The story is very fascinating but the characters were not.  I found myself rooting for the villian who is definitely a very bad person.  But our herione, LuAnn, is not believable.  He has her as a backward hick who does not have a social security number on one hand and then he has her acting like a genius on the other hand.  There were just too many up and downs for me.  I am sure the next book will be back on track 
 I started reading 'The no.1 Ladies Detective Agency' but could never really get into it. I liked the idea of this book however so decided to give the author another go. Sadly, although the book has some funny moments (Bertie's tantrums!)it never really gripped me. I love Scotland but am not familar enough with the places and slang terms so felt i missed out on the 'insider' comments. The book also has a very poor ending which leaves lots of loose ends and you end up thinking 'hold on what happened to..?' and 'what was the point of?'.  On the whole it is ok and i imagine if you are familar with Edinburgh you would enjoy it more than i did 
 He died for good on October 26, 2005, at Houston, a city he probably never saw in his actual life.  Nobody will remember him any more. He is dead. He will remain  forever as a Black Sock.  
 I have really enjoyed most of the Jury series, especially the interactions between Jury and Plant.  This book, however, fails to deliver in my opinion.  She starts off with a wonderful premise and could have really built upon it....but she didn't.  The book starts to become annoying because she gets lost in "educating" the reader on quantum physics.  I kept nodding off and wondering if I'd ever be able to finish this book.   I skimmed through so much of the last few chapters and still found that you're left hanging at the end.  It's not even the fact that Harry walks away in the end, it's more that Grimes fails to give anything in the story proper closure.    I don't really know what she was aiming at with this one, but it really missed the mark for me.  I agree with the other reviewer who said she seems to be tired of writing Jury.  Even Melrose Plant has lost some luster in this book and he usually shines through in most of them.    I noticed the next title in this series is "Dust" ... I fear that may be a literal description of this series at present.  It's dry as dust to me.  
 This is a fantastic book for those people who are slowly losing their grip on reality. While some of the basic underlying concepts are good I don't find myself practically applying the concept of psychic prisons to my organisation, nor do I view my staff as ameobas that make up a large organism. I have to admit though that I know of others who found the paradyme of organisations as instruments of domination highly arousing 
 Contrary to popular belief today, Kennedy was a cold warrior. There is no evidence at all that he was (in his second term, if he even got one) going to end the cold war, or pull out of Vietnam. Michael Lind in his book 'Vietnam: The Necessary War' addresses this issue, and points out that the record clearly shows otherwise. Several of the people who claim that Kennedy told them he was going to pull out of Vietnam revealed this information in the late 60's after the war had become traumatic for the country. Robert McNamara (one of the original architects of the Vietnam War), who has speculated for years that Kennedy would have withdrawn from Vietnam, admits that Kennedy never told him he was going to pull out. In an interview with Walter Cronkite a few months before he was assassinated Kennedy said (about Vietnam): "I think it would be a mistake to withdraw." Oliver Stone (cleverly), only shows bits and pieces of the interview at the beginning of JFK. Editing the interview to make it look like Kennedy was going to withdraw. In fact, the day he was assassinated Kennedy gave a speech endorsing our involvement in Vietnam. The claim that Kennedy was going to pull out of Vietnam is speculation at best. Go to : http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/stjohn.htm  This post details many of the myths surrounding JFK's policy stances, and shows that (by today's standards) Kennedy (most likely) would have been a moderate Republican. There was no motive (as Prouty claims) to kill Kennedy.   Also go to: http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/prouty.htm For some more of Prouty's crackpot opinions.  Kennedy was a cold warrior: he was conspicuously absent (as a representative from Massachusetts) when the House of Representatives voted to censure Joseph McCarthy (he even praised McCarthy on several occasions). He ran against Nixon in 1960 on the missile gap (i.e. we were behind the Soviets in the number of ICBM's). He said in his inaugural address: "......Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and the success of liberty." Doesn't sound to me like he was going to "bug out" of Vietnam.  Also, check out: http://www.jfk-online.com/jfk100vietnam.html This further debunks the idea that JFK was going to withdraw from Vietnam 
 I loved Mortal Kombat,and I thought the sequel would carry on the great Kombat legacy.I was heartily dissapointed when I saw annihilation.Brian Johnson was cool as Khan,but some of the special effects were so fake I had to laugh.Robin Shou returns as Liu Kang,the savior of Earth.After killing Shang Tsung,the group heads on home when all of a sudden,the Emperor busts up the party and sends his minions down.There,Khan makes his first appearance,along with his abnormal,yet awesome soldiers.Johnny Cage is killed,and Rayden(now played by James Remar)fights Khan,winning but sacrificing Johnny Cage.Now,Earth has seven days before it's destroyed.What I didn't like about this movie was appearances by people who had died in the first film,like Scorpion and Sub-zero.Who heard of Sub-Zero having a brother.Another thing that got me was how Liu Kang's fighting got worse since the first film.He was losing every battle,except the end,and even then he wasl osing.Do not get this film if you want to avoid dissapointment 
 Please do not support this release of Cassavetes' films by Criterion Collection.  Purchasing this DVD set constitutes a denigration of real criticism and suppresses the appreciation and comprehension of true art.  The troubling circumstances leading up to the release of this edition (in which world-renowned Cassavetes critic Ray Carney was snubbed and fired after his work was completed) are absolutely pathetic and embarrassing for both Criterion and Miss Rowlands.  
 This was the first it what seems to be an endless quest for a good working radio. It was hard to get the stations in and those that did come in where kind of fuzzy. It didn't seem to work well when joggin. Like the stations would fade in and out from the bouncing. I'm not sure what the deal was. I spent $10 on it, but after a while the $10 here and there is making me look foolish 
 This gets my vote as Miles' worst pre-electric recording date. It's one of the most desultory jazz recording sessions ever made. All the tunes are done slowly to highlight Miles' lyricism, but everything is so draggy that he just sounds bored. Elvin Jones, a great modern drummer, is totally handcuffed. Also, the CD is a major ripoff (even as it was on LP): we get only 27 minutes of music (which, come to think of it, might be a blessing in disguise: the less of this music the better). For die-hard Miles fans only (and then to only hear him at his worst) 
 The woman KILLED a boy - she was driving her car down the street and of all people in town for her to accidently kill - she runs over her boyfriend!!! Talk about coincidence!  There's a lot of bloodshed in that family.  They're the new Kennedy's!!  Let's open a dialogue about what a murderer Laura Bush is!  Why didn't her husband send her to the deathchair?? 
 This was awful. I'm sorry I spent a penny on this. 
 I think I've read most of Mr. Woods' Stone Barrington novels, enjoying them thoroughly - BUT this is a sad addition to the collection. He just called this one in - unrealistic plot, unresolved plotlines, bad dialogue.......I think he's unfortunately succumbed to the 'publisher's lament': "You just HAVE to release another Stone novel this year!" There's no pride of authorship in this book - it's strictly a throwaway....and the circular bin is where it's ended up...... 
 You've got to be kidding is right.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me 
 Danielle Steel stories are always so fairy tale type, macho prince on a white horse, weepy needy naive princess in a pink dress and all. If something is bad it is all bad, if it is good it is all good. Nothing in between. Everything falls into place. A character would start as a very busy boss of a very profitting business, very tough boss with no escape, and he would turn out to be a too-caring babysitter with nothing to do at all if the storyline needs it. Only Americans can take so much juvenile crap because they choose to live in a fantasy world and this lady writer is just feeding them with it. From my experience female writers happen to have a weak capability in depicting male characters, they get so anxious to cover up this inability that they tend to make all the male characters from their dreams with a little touch from their real life. As a result the male characters are all depicted as phony, hard-to-believe type. The way of storytelling is so shallow, even a 12-year-old will laugh at it 
 The book do cover interesting topics, but most of the really useful things on it are as homeworks assignments. Therefore to get something out of it you got to work (cough** suffer) with it's exercises. It would be nice to see the solutions manual of it to get 100% of its material understood.  Books like these i score them with 1 point. If an author writes a book he should put everything on it, not holding back information. 
 I have read all the books n the series and have come to expect an enjoyable light read with a little mystery. I thought the menace in this book overwhelmed the 'light' plots. There are serious themes here - murder, death, kidnapping, and others. Too bad the authors didn't focus more on the light plotlines that reader's look for in these books - Maggie's romance (this came across as ridiculous considering the fact that Maggie and her daughter were being stalked by a convicted murderer) and the Jamie / Max story  (which unfortunately is treated as a throwaway storyline). I also disliked the way the authors abruptly got rid of Destiny - love her character or hate it - she has been in enough books that longtime readers care about her. 
 Don't be seduced by Pinkermania; he's trapped in a little box and he won't be taking a look around anytime soon. Edward Oaks couldn't have said it better in his review:  http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft9803/articles/oakes.htm 
 The stories that accompany the recipes are wonderful. They are told in the way only Maya Angelou can enrapture us. The recipes were disappointing. All of the recipes I tried came out bad. Two of my co-workers (one is a culinary genius) had similar results. I'm glad I got the book at the library before wasting my money 
 I don't know what's up with all of these 4-5 star reviews. This movie was awful. There was no plot and the movie just seemed to drag. Not even the guest appearances by Afrika Bambataa, Melle Mel, and the Rock Steady Crew could save it. I couldn't wait for it to be over with. The "graffiti" throughout the movie was absolutely awful. Ramo and his girlfriend were too white to have a baby that dark with curly hair. Guy Davis was fine back then, but not anymore. Rae Dawn Chong was just annoying. This is one movie I never want to see again 
 I am a long time fan of le Carre - have read and loved all his books - until this one. I just could not summon the interest to finish it. Yes, I'm sort of curious about why this guy's wife was killed, but not curious enough to wade through all the documents and emails et cetera ad nauseum along with him to get there. I was on vacation and had nothing else to do, yet still, I could not wade through this mind-numbing book. I got about half way through - did I quit reading too soon? Did it suddenly pick up after that?  If you're new to John le Carre, start with an earlier book - seriously. Because he's a wonderful writer, really 
 I'm surprised no other reviewer noticed! Why did Penquin place Ronald Colman and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. prominently on the cover? In this reviewer's opinion, they must secretly realize that the wonderful 1937 classic film vastly outshines the printed word. I found the  story to be poorly written and hard to follow. Its' style is too formal, too flowery and too wordy!	If I had not seen (both) versions of the film, I could not have followed the "action". I constantly referred back to mental images of the movie to orientate myself. A review of "PZ" boils down to a basic truth: While most agree that the book is usually superior, occasionally the movie wins out. "PZ" is a prime example. ("Strangers on a Train" is another!). As for the so -called sequel, "Rupert of Hentzau"- don't even bother, unless you are an Anthony Hope fanatic. Reviewing the book makes one appreciate-once again- that wonderful film fadeout as Ronald Colman rides off over the hill. Since it happens to be available on amazon, click on the movie reviews. Therein will lie the essence of the wonderful adventure story of "The Prisoner of Zenda" 
 I generally don't enjoy reading books with teenaged legs and sunflowers on the cover.  I often read on the subway, and it can be a bit embarassing.  If I chose to weather the pornographic implications of such cover art, I expect to be rewarded for my sacrifice--with, say--A GOOD BOOK.  I'd even settle for full characters who change and grow.  I'd settle for dialogue that occasionally rose above tediousness and pointlessness--perhaps dialogue that, in fact, advanced the plot or advanced character development.  If I am going to sit on the L train with a book that slightly resembles a Baby-Sitters Club Epic, I would like for that book to be enriching/rewarding/entertaining/redeeming.  Why is this book 400 pages long??!!!!  Nothing happens.  The family has the same conversations over and over again, and nothing ever changes, and the father character is so irresponsibly designed that his dialogue is virtually identical to that of her 31-year-old boyfriend, Oliver.  No one comes alive, except maybe the mother.  I found almost nothing to hold on to in the entire novel.  The opening line was intriguing.  From there on out, it becomes progressively worse.  I felt only for one person: the mother.  Because she sat in the background, hands folded meekly, kind of depressed and annoyed, for the entire book.  Which was a lot like how RR made me feel, too 
 These were the worst pair of earings I have ever seen.  They were yellow from a mile away.  Amazon was very accomodating when I returned them, but save yourself the hassle the price is too good to be true with these earings 
 In the end I was disappointed.  Throughout the book two separate stories take place. One is a record of Bob Dubois, whose life is ruled by circumstances and bad life management skills. The other tells of Vanise Dorsinville, a young Haitian woman, who struggles to survive as she makes her way to America. Neither is a pretty story, and when the two characters finally meet it gets even worse. When I finished reading this book I was angry at myself for muddling through all the italicized Haitian accent dialogue and French Creole voodoo terminology.  Yah mon, true 
 It's always difficult for a beginner to review a textbook, because there's always the chance that your reactions are entirely offbase. It is possible that some people, trying to learn to hold their breath longer while underwater will value 360 pages of advice as "Getting Dressed. Start by putting on the trousers: insert the legs, first one then the other," and "We complete the scaling of the existential levels by passing to the colour violet, where we stabilise a contact with our most intimate reality, that which we call the spiritual dimension," while foregoing any significant discussion of strategies for dealing with the sensations of holding your breath.   To me, this book is infuriatingly short of relevant information. Not only do you get advice on how to put on pants, there are sections that seem relevant (the 2.5 pages on the circulatory system, say), that jump between streams of grade-school exposition ("The heart is a hollow muscle that has the capacity to function like a pump; expanding and contracting, it sucks blood that is delivered continuously by the veins and pushes it to the peripheries of the body through the arteries....") and trivia ("...[blood] is propagated by their elastic walls at a velocity of 9 meters per second. However in the arterioles of the periphery the velocity drops to one millimetre per second....") without actually introducing any relevant facts (does blood velocity have something to do with freediving? Maybe. I wouldn't know it after reading this book. And the book is packed with clearly irrelevant information, such as 2 pages on the Beaufort wind scale).  To reconcile my reaction with the 5 star reviews from those who can do statics of 5+ minutes and so forth, I can only say that perhaps they skipped the trivia, don't need practical advice on breath holding, and valued specific advice on, say, finning technique.   The 30 pages of chapter 11 "Training for Apnea" will _possibly_ take less time to read than finding equivalent advice on the Web, but are hardly worth $40. For me, this book was an utter waste of money. 
 Thank god I got this from the library and didn't buy it.  It's terrible.  And the ending is so abrupt I turned the next page expecting to read more and was shocked that the book was over.  The sex is icky and there's little else in the book 
 The abridgement of this otherwise wonderfully delightful and wickedly sensual book is a huge disappointment. There was little of the drama nor the depth of character found in the actual novel. I read this book years ago and found it quite profound. The tape, which barely last 1.5 hours covers none of the motivation, the anticipation nor the quality of Rice's intentions for placing the characters in this specific situation and performing these activities. Incredibly shallow reading by both actors, also 
 I bought this book for my husband, thinking 'aww' a book especially for him. My husband hated it. And on reading so did I. The author obviously has a very usual relationship with his wife as he often talks about feelings of jealously between them. Its very unusual. For example "when you feel the baby kicks your wife might feel jealous as so far its been her private pregnancy"! How ridiculous how would jealousy ever come into it! The book assumes all men are concerned about is finances - it has pages and pages on money, insurance etc. there is nothing much about the joys you feel as a father. If your husband is kind hearted, honest and is truly looking forward to pregnancy and the birth of his child I would advise not to buy this book. The tone is very negative and some of the statements and assumptions about what "men" and "women", are very generalised bordering on ridiculous ie "your partner might be worried that you're going to leave her" what the heck?. It seems very personally related to the authors experience, and is simply selling because it is one of the only books packaged to be directly aimed at men.  I would suggest the book "the birth partner" it is for men/the partner and is written in a matter of fact and open way (the author is not overly emotionally involved) - getting you to ask questions about how you would feel about certain situations rather than dictating how you do feel. READ THE OTHER 1 STAR REVIEWS AND YOU'LL SEE EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT 
 For me, this book was too general to be of any help. The best I've read so far is FROM REEL TO DEAL 
 what a load of rubbish - I very rarely give bad feedback as I know that it is easy to criticise BUT really this book is absolute rubbish.  Claims are made but not substantiated, putting a reference does not validate a claim.  The title is attractive and the summary compelling but the actual content insults any experienced marketing, or for that matter any business, reader's intelligence. If you want a laugh go to page 31 where the author says ""What happens when a "marketer pyramid" and a "consumer pyramid" come together...The result appears in figure 2-2".  Figure 2-2 shows two triangles with lines joining bits up BUT there is absolutly no content!!! - I laughed so much people sitting next to on the plane looked at me and I showed them the page. Five other people read the page and laughed at the audacity of what was being presented.  I will never buy another book from HBS Press. Where is the peer review? Where is the editorial control? Heaven help us if the current and future generations of HBS graduates are being taught, and accept(!) this garbage 
 I often have to mix by hand, things always end up dry and grainy.  Might be partially my fault - maybe I should try adding the ingredients as it's mixing.  It makes a REALLY huge mess.  My mother and I both bought one, but I told her to return hers, it wasn't worth it 
 This book is an extremely long-winded road trip memoire dressed up in the conceit of a search for "The Perfect $100,000 House". If you are considering it for what it may yield in the fields of architecture or development, you will find it adds little insight and little originality with respect to $100,000 houses. If you are considering it as a memoire, I commend it only to insomniacs 
 I usually enjoy Ann M Martin's books very much, but I'm not too impressed with the information in this book. A previous reviewer pretty much said it all- also I would not be happy to see an instructor that would let a collision almost happen. I know I didn't begin cantering for a few months after I began riding, as did most of the other riders my instructor trains. But I must say that the book has a wonderful writing style for that age group. =O 
 The information presented in the book is useful, however there are a number of the test questions that are typed incorectly and formatted incorrectly and in one case the letter of the answer differs from the explanation of the answer. Its almost as if there was a rush to get this in print. There are a few inconsistencies between this book and the other major study guides and this can cause confusion. My main complaint is the number of errors within the book. The content itself is helpful, not the be all and end all but useful for review nonetheless 
 I'm not a kid, I just don't feel like creating an Amazon account.  I don't normally review items, but this time I felt compelled to.  I would give this single zero stars if I could.  It's basically just a bunch of monotonous whispering over a forgettable beat.  It's so forgettable, I can't even remember exactly what it sounded like, other than it was really bad.  Thank God.  By the way, I did not buy this single, nor did I waste my energy downloading it.  My friends and I were subjected to listening to it in a movie theater 3 times while we were waiting for a movie to start.  We hated it, yet we could not escape it for fear of losing our seats.  We're now going deaf.  Can we sue Paris for punitive damages?   
 The idea was good but Natasha simply didn't have the talent to put it in written and understandable text. She switches all the time the "I", got me confused about who she was talking about, her or her aunt.She mixed both stories, suddenly she wants to explains her "great destiny" (narcissism) at the same time as she tells the strory about her great aunt. Those second, third, fourth, xth brother's wife, sister, uncles, all irritating narrative. I really tried to like the story, to pick and read and just gave me headaches trying to figure it out whose story she is talking. Go back to school. I don't know how the editor accepts this kind of book to be published, need a lot of editing. Maybe someone in the publishing house is her relative. 
 Why doesn't Amazon mention that this video talks about Wicca in their review or in their product description? I also looked at the video in a store, and there was no mention of Wicca on the case. That's important information to leave out. If it were there, consumers could decide for themselves whether or not it was an appropriate video to show their children. 
 This is sad for me because I love her other work. And even though that last couple of books aren't as funny as they were in the beginning, they still have a plot and they make sense. I feel cheated by this series and won't be reading anymore of it.  I called my friends and told them not to read this. The plot is just too stupid, who is going to cut up a couple of NASCAR's and steal a hauler and seriously what guy doesn't have tools in the trunk of his car, even if they are just for show? Then you have a dead guy in plastic wrap and you argue about what god would want you to do with him?  The Cigar/Fruit stand ladies, are not only annoying, all the "secret" staying over is just ridiculous. The autographing was kind of funny in the 1st book but in this one it was over used and stupid. If you're hiding, you hide. In the opening of the book Barney said no body cheats her, and in the end she's sleeping with Sam who did exactly that.   I am tired of media that has women taking back cheaters or worse yet begging for a second chance. Stupid funny isn't for me and a bag of dog poop? Not funny. This book treats us like we are too stupid to care there is nothing but a bunch of slapstick going on, I might as well have watched a 3 stooges episode it would have been more fun.   There were a few times I laughed, the NASCAR stuff was interesting but the rest of it had me calling my mom mid book and asking her to shoot me.  
 I have recently purchased several 10- and 20-pack spindles of this product. I have also have two new dvd burners - A Plextor PX-760 and a BenQ DW1655 - and and ALL burns have been coasters. I have also tried some test burns on a BenQ DW1620 Pro. Each of these burners have put on a different computers, the second being set up only for dedicated burning (i.e. no connectivity to network, no anti-virus or spyware, etc. On a freshly installed XP SP2, with nothing other than dvd burning software). All the burns had PIO failures to the point of making the disks unusable. Quality rating of burns 0, sone 45 (out of 100). Needless to say, I am not going to buy any more of these disks for a while...I have had absolutely flawless results in the past 
 This book was a big disappointment. You spend the whole book waiting for the main characters to get back together, and you don't even really like them. If you're looking for a fun chic lit book, this is not it! 
 I was a strong Sarah McLachlan fan up until she released Surfacing. NOw, I like Surfacing, but I felt it was inferior to her earlier albums. Then, she took a long break and, like so many others, I thought "Great! she will be rested and blow us all away!" Wrong, Afterglow is the worst of all Sarah's albums. It is unimaginative, boring and not as musically solid as Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, Touch and Solace. Case in point, the last song on the album, Dirty Little Secret, is actually painful to listen to for me. It is awkward musically--choppy and discordant--and lyrically it is only slightly better than Britney Spears' attempt at song writing with, Dear Diary (don't bother listening to that song--it is trash). Having said all that, I do like a some of the songs on Afterglow:  Stupid Fallen Drifting  This just was not a justified purchase (not to mention a justified wait of 5 years). It was almost like she realized at some point, "Oh wait! I have a music career, don't I? I better put something out quick so I can support my family." If I were you, I would pick up her first three albums and maybe Surfacing (it is at least better than Afterglow) 
 The original Eloise was a sustained thrill. I have avoided all sequels until now for fear of just this sort of crashing disappointment. Think of the difference between Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II, then multiply by ten. It is a bore. It is an embarassment. It is rawther godawful 
 I HAVE OWNED...6 ESPRESSO MACHINES THAT I CAN RECALL IN MY LIFE. 1 GAGGIA, A HEAVY ITALIAN MACHINE WHICH I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN MUCH BETTER CARE OF - WHICH MEANS WIPING OFF THE STEAM NOZZLE WHEN STEAMING MILK ALONG WITH RUNNING THE STEAMER WHILE WIPING, AND DECALCIFING WITH VINEGAR WHICH IS SMELLY BUT UNCLOGS MINERAL SEDIMENTS WHICH PRECIPITATE IN THE WORKINGS OF THE MACHINE.  THESE STEPS MUST BE PERFORMED ON ALL ESPRESSO MACHINES PERIOD CASE CLOSED.  THE GAGGIA I BELIEVE I GAVE AWAY OR THREW AWAY.  1 PROTEO GRANDE, ANOTHER HEAVY ITALIAN MACHINE WHICH I NEGLECTED TO DECALCIFY BUT SIMPLY STORED AWAY 10 YEARS AGO.  I HAVE ALSO OWNED 4 KRUPS MACHINES.  2 OF THESE KRUPS WERE THE VERY INEXPENSIVE VARIETY THAT LACKED A PUMP, BOTH OF WHICH FAILED BECAUSE THE PRESSURE VESSEL FOR STEAM BEGAN TO LEAK AND OVERHEAT.   1 KRUPS MACHINE, A PUMP MACHINE MODEL 968 WORKED VERY VERY WELL FROM DECEMBER 1999 THRU FEBRUARY 2006.  MODEL 968 MADE EXCEPTIONAL ESPRESSO: (YOU GOT A VERY NICE CREMA LAYER AT THE END OF THE DRAW).  SIMPLY BECAUSE A LITTLE HANDLE IN FRONT WHICH SELECTED WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANTED STEAM, OR FLOWING WATER SNAPPED OFF, I WAS FORCED TO USE A KITCHEN KNIFE IN THE GROOVE LEFT BY THE SNAPPED OFF SELECTOR BUTTON, AND BECAUSE THIS CAUSED THE MECHANISM ITSELF TO PREMATURELY WEAR MADE THE UNIT UNUSABLE.  UNUSABLE IS WHAT KRUPS XP 4000 IS, FOR SOME REASONS NOT PREVIOUSLY STATED. 1.  ATTENTION XP4000 USERS: TAKE THE PLASTIC WATER STORAGE UNIT OUT AND CHECK THE BOTTOM OF THE UNIT.  MOST LIKELY YOU WILL SEE 1/4 TO 1/2 INCH OR MORE OF WATER THAT HAS LEAKED FROM THE WATER INTAKE VALVE.  NOW WITH THE MACHINE OFF! COOL! AND ALL WATER TRAYS AND TOP AND BOTTOM GRILLS REMOVED SIMPLY TURN THE UNIT OVER 90 DEGREES AND DUMP THE WATER OUT.  REPLACE THE PLASTIC WATER STORAGE UNIT, AND EVERYTHING ELSE.  THEN USE 'NORMALLY' IF YOU CAN FOR A FEW DAYS OR A WEEK.  THEN TAKE THE WATER STORAGE OUT AGAIN AND CHECK FOR WATER SEEPAGE AND LEAKAGE INTO THE MAIN PLASTIC HOUSING.  YOU SHOULD FIND THE SAME LEAKAGE PROBLEM. THIS IS AN UNACCEPTABLE DESIGN DEFECT WHICH PREVENTS WATER FROM COOLING THE BOILER, AND SERVICING THE STEAMER.  2. AS WITH ALL THE OTHER REVIEWS THE STEAMER SIMPLY LEAKS A DRIBBLE OF HOT WATER, NOT ENOUGH TO MELT ICE.  IF YOU LEFT A PITCHER OF COLD MILK UNDER THE STEAMER AND RETURNED 15 MINUTES LATER YOU'D HAVE: WATERY LUKEWARM MILK!  3. OTHER REVIEWS STATED THAT THE FROTH STEAMER ATTACHMENT CONSTITUTES A HAZARD AS IT FLYS OFF UNEXPECTANTLY.  KRUPS MODEL 968 HAD A SIMILAR ATTACHMENT WHICH I REMOVED AND THREW AWAY.  WITH MODEL 968, THE STEAMER WORKED VERY VERY WELL WITHOUT THE FROTH ATTACHMENT FOR 6 YEARS.  OCCASIONALLY IT WOULD CLOG UP AND I'D TAKE THE END OF A SAFETY PIN TO UNCLOG IT, OR I WOULD SIMPLY UNSCREW THE PLASTIC HOUSING: IT WOULD REMOVE NICELY AND I'D PLACE THE STEAMER NIPPLE IN SOME HOT WATER AND VINEGAR OVERNITE, AND THE STEAMER WOULD PERFORM PRETTY NICELY.  NOTE: THIS IS MODEL 968 NOT XP 4000.  DO NOT TRY TO UNSCREW THE BLACK STEAM NIPPLE FROM XP 4000 SEE NOTE BELOW!!!  YOU MAY USE XP4000 WITHOUT THE FROTH ATTACHMENT, AND IT WILL STEAM MILK OKAY, BUT IT MUST BE FUSSED WITH POKING THE HOLE IN THE BLACK STEAM NIPPLE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BUT: --FREQUENTLY HOWEVER STEAM PRESSURE GOES DOWN SO LOW YOU HAVE TO PUT THE SELECTOR KNOB TO THE 90 DEGREE POSITION, ALLOW WATER TO FILL IN THE MACHINE AGAIN, CLICK OVER TO 'HEAT UP', THEN WHEN THE LITE GOES OFF YOU MAY CONTINUE STEAMING.  KRUPS XP-4000 IS A PERFECT EXCUSE FOR BEING LATE TO WORK, OR ANYWHERE ELSE IF YOU CANNOT LEAVE THE HOUSE WITHOUT YOUR LATTE.  AND I WILL NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE TO GO TO STARBUCKS FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER UNLESS MY MACHINE FAILS.  WHICH IT DID!  NOTE:  XP 4000 CANNOT HAVE IT'S RUBBER NIPPLE UNSCREWED, YOU ARE FORCED TO STICK A SAFETY PIN OR OTHER SHARP OBJECT IN IT TO UNCLOG THE MILK STEAMER.  THE HOLE IN THE NIPPLE ITSELF IS MUCH TOO SMALL: IT IS SMALL TO OVERCOMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF PRESSURE FROM THE PUMP, KIND OF A WISHFUL DESIGN INTEGRATION TECHNIQUE WHICH FAILS OH SO MISERABLY!  3.MY XP 4000 STARTED LEAKING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF WATER AFTER LESS THAN 45 DAYS OF USE.  I SENT IT TO A LOCAL KRUPS REPAIR FACILITY AND I IMAGINE I'LL EITHER GET ANOTHER XP4000 OR THEY MIGHT HAVE THE COMMON SENSE TO DISCONTINUE THE XP4000 AS A BAD DESIGN MISTAKE FROM BEGINNING TO END IF ANYONE UP THERE LIKES ME, AND KRUPS MIGHT UPGRADE ME TO THE MORE EXPENSIVE XP4050. SO NOW YOU HAVE IT. SO THERE I WAS ESPRESSOFIEND WITH NO JAVA, AND I'D RATHER PULL OUT MY FINGERNAILS THAN GO INTO STARBUCKS FOR LATTE.  ONLY I CAN MAKE THE PERFECT LATTE.  WHICH EXPLAINS WHY I AM SINGLE!   SO, I TOOK OUT MY 10 YEAR OLD PROTEO GRANDE FROM UNDER MY SINK WHERE IT HAD BEEN STORED FOR 10 YEARS, AND SAID A PRAYER WHILE CLEANING THE COBWEBS OFF AND DECALSIFYING, AND WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT: IT WORKS!  JUST FINE!  BUT THEN AGAIN, THAT IS WHAT I'D EXPECT FROM A HEAVY ITALIAN MACHINE.  MORAL: IF YOU WANT TO SAY BYE-BYE TO STARBUCKS FOREVER, AND BREW THE PERFECT LATTE OVER AND OVER AGAIN, SPEND AT LEAST $200 ON A QUALITY ITALIAN MACHINE.  KRUPS DOES MAKE NICE COFFEEMAKERS, EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. WHEW!  I HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEBODY! 
 Danny McGoorty was a gifted pool and billiards player.  He was also a lazy, drunk petty thief.  He spent his life trying his best to avoid honest work. He took as much as he could get from everyone that crossed his path without ever giving anything back.  He died bitter and broke.  There, now you don't need to read the book.  
 I don`t like this magazine. It is so boring. The gossip is lame and dry, and it`s basically a mag for tweens to say ¨OMG, ANOTHER HD poster for my room!!¨ There`s hardly any real pages, just regular old posters. Teens, beware- you will be disappointed and totally bored. This is a magazine for girls aged 9-12. Strictly for tweens 
 Sorry but I could not even finish it.  I was bored out of my mind.  I just did not feel the characters had any depth. If I put down a book, it is rare that I will pick it up again 
 a waste of my time------and i won't even waste more of my time letting "you" know why 
 The book attempts to discuss the importance of multiculturalism within America's educational system, yet, the author's method of discussion throughout the book portrays biased and hipocritical views.  The book intends to inform readers to stray away from prejudices and personal opinions, yet, the author seems to include his own prejudice views making his book hipocritical of the very point he attempts to conjure.  He makes various comments throughout the book that disclose negative personal opinions upon current education within America's schools and educator's "white" methods of teaching.  I agree with his claims on the need for educators to incorporate a more multicultural perspective in teaching, but he seems to boast more on his negative views and multicultural issues in education throughout the book, rather than including ideas and advice for educators on improving it.  
    This book is absolutely terrible!  It contains explicit religious content (Christian, no less;-) for no reason at all.  More importantly, this story is taken SO FAR out of context, it looses ALL meaning and emotional impact.  Why are the white people so mad?  Why are the children segregated in the first place?  I don't know for which grade this is intended; but whichever it is, the students ask those questions.    One of the author's more recent books is on Bruce Springsteen, OK?  'Nuff Said?      If you see Robert Coles, wish hateful stuff on him for me. The illustrator is culpable by association 
 This is an example of what happens when a writer gets too famous for an editor to touch him. It's repetitive, with too many coincidences, too little explanation, which would have been difficult to do, so, better left out, I guess. Every time they are starving, they find a store of food. The woman conveniently dead because McCarthy doesn't like to write about women. He writes convincingly of the relationship between father and son, but if the landscape is as completely dead as he makes it out to be, there is no explanation of how they survived this long -- must be seven or eight years, minimum, on what? Leftover canned goods somehow overlooked by other starving people? Like a previous reviewer, I also wondered what the people in the cellar were eating.  Also, the one good person appears at the exact right time, or perhaps a day late or too late, but in time for a rescue. Too many haircuts, perhaps the author lost track, but starving people do not need to have their hair cut twice in 100 pages. And he indicates they had been on the road over a year, again without explaining how they managed that. It wasn't hard to read, but it just wasn't that skillfully done. It has a fairytale quality that I found frustrating--poof, that's how it was.  I need details.  The whole point is to construct a believable world, even if devastated, not just to write whatever you feel like writing and let the reader try to patch in the rest. Nice to be famous enough to get away with it, though. 
 Philip Roth is a taste I haven't acquired yet.  He is lauded by critics - including Harold Bloom, who just happens to be a friend of his - as perhaps the greatest living American writer.  Before this novel, I had only read Portnoy's Complaint, which I couldn't even finish; I found it hopelessly dated, pedantic, and repetitive.  I like Operation Shylock more than Portnoy's Complaint, I guess - although I can't say that I really ENJOYED either.  However, at least things happen in this novel.  The gimmick of the book is that it is a "confession" - a story of supposedly true events that happened to Philip Roth in 1988.  The story concerns the emergence of a "fake" Philip Roth who is traveling around Israel, promoting the cause of "Diasporism" - the relocation of Israel's Jews back to Europe.  The real Roth travels to Jerusalem to confront his impostor.    Having now read the book, it is difficult to tell whether or not the real Roth is for Diasporism.  There is a lot of anti-Zionist rhetoric in the book - much of which I found distasteful - but is that the "real" Roth or not?  Is he really anti-Zionist?  It's hard to say, because he frequently asserts how foolish Diasporism is: the European community would not welcome the Jews back with open arms.     Somewhere in one of Raymond Chandler's novels, Philip Marlowe mocks Hemmingway as a man who thinks saying the same thing over and over makes it profound.  Well, the same thing can be said of Philip Roth.  There are a lot of things about his style I don't like.  He is very pedantic: he always has an axe to grind, but instead, he grinds his readers into the ground.  He allows his characters to speak, sometimes for pages at a time, without so much as starting a new paragraph.  His most annoying trait however, is how in love with himself he is.  It's odd but true - if you keep saying how great you are, people will believe you.  Through his characters, he lavishes praise onto himself and his books.  Also, he's apparently catnip to the ladies.  Is this novel non-fiction?  Of course not.  Will I ever read another Philip Roth novel?  Probably - with so many critics telling me I'm wrong, I have to allow for that possibility.  I'm just not looking forward to the experience. 
 I have been teaching statistics for quite a while. I picked up this book thinking that I would find some good examples and methods of explanation that would help in presenting concepts to students. However, the examples are not any better than you would find in a textbook, except that they are missing the many of the details. If you wanted to try to do some analysis based on what you find in the book you would have a hard time.   If I were a person that bought this book thinking it would help me understand statistics better, I believe I would be disappointed. 
 Oh dear, you know a band are struggling when most of the first side is taken up with a rock'n'roll medley, sometimes in concert they work but invariably they don't. This deffinately doesn't. Hearing someone with a pronounced German accent attempt it, is well either laughable or cringeworthy. Actually a bit of both. 'Samantha's rabbit' is equally amusing in a Guru Guru type of way. The second side is a vast improvement 'der elektrolurch' is brilliant produced and executed, showing off the bands heavy roots mixed with electronics with Ax Genrich showing off his array of special effects 'The story of life' takes some time getting started (face it most of their tracks do) but when it gets there it has a doom Sabbath-derivative riff and a nice jazzy interlude. Overall after the excellance of 'Kanguru' (still their best. They used to use it to sell stereo systems in the local hi-fi shop)this is one big flop. What happened Mani 
 this is the kind of book that IMO gives gifted studies a really bad name.  does this pass the laugh test?  where's the common sense?  I am not going to summarize this approach b/c other reviewers have already done so.  but how about a few simple questions.  why is it necessary to be this complicated?  5 levels?  demarcation with different cutoffs of IQ with in-depth explanations of why the cutoffs matter and why level 4 is different from level 5......  what's the point?  other than job security for gifted professionals b/c this is much too complicated for the layperson, parent or teacher, to figure out.  before developing an extraordinarily complicated model such as this, the first question should be:  is it helpful?  I think this is not.    Obviously, to me anyway, there are gifted children.  there are some children who are so profoundly (or whatever) gifted that they basically can't be served in our school system, while others can be served by a combination of grade skipping, advanced classes in talent area(s), talent searches, perhaps private schooling, etc.  it's funny and you wade through this very very very complicated model and you get to the bottom line which is pretty much what everyone else says:  perhaps grade skipping, AP classes, etc. etc. for the level 1, 2, maybe 3 kids and then more dramatic accomodations that may well involve a total lifestyle overhaul for the levels 4 and 5.  all of which has been covered better elsewhere.  the profoundly gifted recommendations were done better IMO by the Kearnseys (spelling) and Ellen Winner and Miraca Gross.  another common sense question is what the heck ever happened to knowing your child and not putting him/her in some category based on IQ or whatever?  if your child is interested in and ready for AP English and physics, great, hopefully it's not a fight with the schools to make those classes available.  why the need to stick a label on the child?  (I have been in the mental health system a long time and had many labels attached to me.  they did not help.  this is not a denial of illness; I take the same mood stabilizers and pursue the same treatment even though I do not center my life around a diagnosis or two.)  I don't see the point of this book quite honestly.  2 stars b/c the descriptions of children are interesting 
 This is something I would find on a humor website. And it's not very good. Most of the jobs listed is only held by a few people and not what I call real jobs. There is a show on The Discovery Channel that is titled "Dirty Jobs". One job that Racz mentions was featured on it. Chicken sexer. And what the job is about is quickly finding out what sex the baby chicks are. But he mentions silly stuff mostly like Saddam Hussein Double and Exorcist. A few real ones like Data Entry and Shopping Cart Valet.   I got this book from the library by placing it on hold. If I saw the inside of this book I wouldn't have bothered with it.  
 Had problem with unit w/in 3 mos of purchase. Was finally able to make contact with company after several WEEKS of trying. Even their customer support line disconnects you when you try to keep holding and don't leave a message. And when you leave a message, it must be deleted, because they don't return calls.   Product was replaced w/ refurb unit missing parts. Now I can't get ANYONE!   Altec Lansing is a poster child for extremely poor customer service. They have your money, and you have, well, a product with their name on it, for as long as it works. Had I known this prior to purchase, I wouldn't have purchased. It's that simple 
 My mother would very much like to read this book and others like it, but she has age-related macular degeneration and can only read large print books.  Why are these books, of all books, not printed in large print 
 I can't agree any more with the reviews that have pointed out the poor writing in this book.  As a fan of stories about Chinese Americans and of historical fiction, I was sorely disappointed with this novel; what could be emotionally-moving scenes just aren't because of the "see jane run" kinds of descriptions.  There is no skillful subtlety in this novel.  I normally don't like to be this publicly critical, but this is one of the only times I've felt this strongly about something 
 This movie tries way too hard to the point that it becomes a painful melodrama filled with gratuitous dialogue and over-acting.  I found this movie to be thoroughly unsatisfying 
 Started reading it and put it down three times, just couldn't hold my interest 
 Dr Laura gives some good advice but it is mixed with absolutely stupid advice such as when she says that a person should stay in an unhappy marriage because of their commitment.  It is unfortunate that she chose to use this relationship book as her soapbox to promote her own religous beliefs. If you dont believe in God and as Dr Laura, you can never be happy is the moral of her story. Laura makes a number of irresponsbile and misleading statements such as calling daycare, modern child abandonment. She talks about chastity until marriage several times and about 'shacking up' to use her term but never once does she explain why monogomy is important in a healthy relationship and she absolutely never mentions that a relationship has a natural progression part of which is physical. She moves the step of marriage up to be much sooner than it should be in a relationship while at the same time saying people should wait 'through the 4 seasons' or a year before being married. Actually says 'it is dangerous to pursue a physical relationship without the promise of marriage'. Is she saying men should promise marriage before they are ready?  She would have produced a much better book if she had given more examples of callers to her radio show or letters and given less malformed advice. Her rants and raves are actually entertaining, too bad that along with examples were cut short with her religious promotions and poorly thought advice snippets.  I listened to the whole thing(audio book cd) and I couldnt list the 10 stupid things implied in the title. I guess they are there and maybe under chapters 1-10 in the book. I could call out several stupid things but I didnt see 10 that stood out. Lots of it was common sense and phsychologically off callers made it obvious.  It is fun to listen to but make sure it is not the only book you use as a source. There are other better sources for relationship info. 
 I bought one of these can openers today. The mounting screws stripped out even before I got it completely mounted. The screws thread into soft metal tabs instead of nuts, making it impossible to mount securely. I don't know if it would open a can, as I never got that far, but it looks difficult to locate the can properly. It's a piece of cheap Chinese made junk 
 This movie is NOT good for the kids! It teaches them how to be prejudice and will probably result in them hating cats! Cats are actually really sweet animals, like the complete opposite of what's shown in the movie. People, you shouldn't get this for your kids unless you want to teach them prejudism. Besides, the movie is full of lame, dry humor that's not funny at all. I saw it at a friend's house and I practically had to force myself to stay awake through the whole thing! It's not that I don't like dogs, cause I do, but this movie is a bad influence for the kids 
 I am from New England and was looking forward to receiving this book. It reads like a textbook and is incredibly boring. Don't waste your money 
 May be as damaging as out and out lies.  I think Crichton is a fine writer who could have written a great novel about the manipulation of a populace through media and other networks.  Instead we have a hodge podge story that jumps around the Earth as the theses it posits jump around the truth.  One of these that I found most disturbing was the Antagonists statement that DDT was not proven to be harmful.  Maybe so, but the chemical reaction (something that happens quite often in nature) DDT has with some soils leads to DDE which is very harmful to native species.    It reminds me of Bowling for Columbine.  Whether you like Micheal Moore or not, he had a thesis about how afraid Americans are made to feel.  Why do you lock your door at night?  If someone wants to get in, they will.  Moore touches on, but does not get in depth with the pervasiveness of fear in American society.    Crichton does the same while attempting to discredit many environmental groups. He portrays these organizations very well, however, the story never really develops into an in depth investigation of what really terrorizes our society and why that fear drives us to consume, ultimately leading to our very real fear of a society that is one of the safest in the world. (check the FBI website to see how crimes have fallen and show that really we are safer than we were 40 years ago!).       
 I know it's a toy, but this xylophone is offensively out of tune.  I wouldn't subject anyone to it.  It's terrible 
 I thought it would be much more exciting but it was not what I thought it would be. 
 Out of this whole CD, I could only pick about 3 songs that I liked.  This CD is very disappointing and some of the songs were down right annoying.  The best songs on here are Everything Part I, II/ Bow Before The King and Victory.  Past those songs, there is not much because I can't bear to listen to the rest. Those two songs get 1 star each 
 I had high expectations for this production based on the trailer and excerpts I had seen. Unlike FahrenHype 9/11, I expected less talking heads and more of the raw footage showing the reality, while listening to major politicians lie. There was a little bit. Michael Moore's comment about there being no significant terrorist threat was juxtaposed to footage of the hijacked airliner crash into the tower. Protestors extolling the great things Saddam Hussein has done voiced over vivid footage of Hussein's atrocities.  Unfortunately, like FahrenHype, most of it falls back on well-known commentators such as Fred Barnes, Michael Medved, and Michael Barone. They are all articulate and entertaining speakers, but much of what they say is similar to what they say on their own cable and radio shows. This DVD is also past its prime. To my surprise, rather than being a refutation of Moore's production, almost half of the DVD is dedicated to taking apart John Kerry. Entertaining? Yes; but no longer relevant (one can only hope). There is a refutation of the generic laundry list of attacks on G.W. Bush (he stole the election, he lied about 9/11, he lied about WMDs, etc.), but that was also timely, and is significantly less relevant after the election. Technically, there were a few shortcuts. Rather than using real footage or audio from public speeches by John Kerry or Hillary Clinton (or even GW Bush), the audio is over a still image, or the text is rolled in front of a still image with a narrator reading. The real footage is available, so it is unclear why they weren't able to get it. The image quality is excellent, but there is no menu system to the DVD, it plays just like a VCD. If you want to rehash the election, you might want to rent it. However, if you want to prepare yourself for Fahrenheit 9/11, or just see the other side (aka, get balance), you are better off looking on the web for some excellent exposé's and refutations of Moore. 
 First off, I am an avid reader and love a long challenging read, however, this novel is one of the worst I have ever read! It is long, boring and has absolutely no plot. I purchased it when it first came out without reading any reviews. Although from the looks of most of them here, I personally suspect that many of those who raved, never actually read the book 
 This is not a book, but a simple collection of articles. The result is an extremely poor "Work" ! The claimed " ...plenty of practical 'how to do this' " and the source code are unrateble 
 Gideon's Spies is packed full of exhilarating and outlandish tales of the Mossad's exploits.  It is, however, notably short on accuracy and journalistic integrity.  Some of its claims are obviously false and many others cannot be substantiated and hinge of the testimony of mysterious unidentified sources. The book reads like fiction and many of its stories likely are just that 
 . Thomas Penham searches throughout the novel, for his grandfather's amazing collection of pornography, for the girl of his dreams, for the code word bluebells, finally for his place in the world.  From explosions to bodily functions, dissolving marriages to World War I, Robinson has it all in this novel, yet there is a huge problem; I never once cared for any of these characters. From the dying grandfather to Thomas himself, a fairly repulsive twerp whom Robinson tries to save by giving him the soul of a poet, there was not one character here who brought about any kind of emotional response and reading about characters you don't care about is always a chore 
 While an interesting work and worth reading, it is not nearly the biography that Blair Jackson's "Garcia" is.  Many aspects of Jerry's life are somewhat polished up it seems.  Not that gory expose is  desirable, but still I was left feeling that perhaps the book had a  censored feel to it.  This is just an opinion.  Read Jackson's book, then  "Dark Star", for a much more complete and well rounded view of  Jerry's life 
 I love to read, and have all my life.  I don't know how I escaped reading "Mary Poppins" as a child, because I read nearly every other children's classic book.  I decided to read this aloud to my children precisely because I hadn't read it.  I was horrified as the book went on...if this Mary has a heart, I can't find it.  You'd have to use a microscope to find it.  Yes, there are strange adventures that are interesting.  I don't have a problem with that.  My problem is Mary  herself. She's nasty and mean, and there isn't one redeeming quality about her in the book.  I found myself disliking her more and more as the book went on.  Perhaps I was tainted in my viewpoint by the Disney version. But I'll gladly take that version, for once, over the book.  At least in the movie Mary could crack a smile and actually enjoy something.  In the book she's as friendly as a block of ice.  Watch the movie.  Forget the book 
 ...when they cut out the instrumental portion of "Angry Eyes"? I was furious when I discovered that fact after buying the CD ( I got it before reading the reviews here). Yeah, yeah, some of their other nuggets like "Vahevala" are here, but messing up "Angry Eyes" totally tripped me out. Save your money unless you have no use for "Angry Eyes" but if you ask me (well, you didn't, but I'll say it anyway), that's the magnum opus of this band 
 A wonderful series with outstanding military and historical foundation and detail, gone bad. The writer doesn't even seem to know his own characters anymore. The sex scenes seem like they were written by a 14 year old kid. When I began to get the distinct impression that the author had lost his way, I put the book down. As a historian, I'm disappointed that Whyte has chosen to sell out with this drivel 
 I bought this for my cat a few months ago, because he just loves playing with a laser pointer. The whole concept of this toy was great but they should've expanded their ideas a bit more. For the size of the toy you would think that it would point further out than it does. I'm not sure about others but most cats I know like to run back and forth a room chasing the laser, maybe even jump up the wall. As opposed to with the Bada Beam that just goes in a circle, reversing its direction every once in awhile. My cat never avoids the laser pointer, when he sees that red light he jumps right up! But with the Bada Beam, he will just sit and stare at it. The whole point is so that you don't have to hold it and let the cats go crazy! NOPE! It's one thing for me to be disappointed, but it's clear that my cat was more disappointed. 
    The concept is the same as total recall. Vanilla sky had potential, but the viewers hand is held in the end ,like we are retards,  and everything is explained in one scene. I did enjoy this movie at one point, but when the entire idea is relayed in the end, it became stupid. Better than alot of Tom Cruise garbage, but not good overall. 
 Only little principles you can earn from this book 
 I read parts of this book for a class assignment, where I had to identify the different paradigms which Gardner uses in his assertions.  Basically, Gardner's reasoning is science-centric; even his declarations of faith fall back on science and reason.  He also does a good job of artifically separating faith and reason.  He is surprisingly ethnocentric, as in one of his refutations of cultural relativism that asserts that certain "primitive" societies do not meet basic needs as well as other societies.  He uses pragmatic proofs to refute pragmatism, seemingly without knowing it.  Basically, all his conclusions rested on Western principles that are easily deconstructed, that he apparently had not thought about deeply enough.  This book shouldn't have survived the 80's.  Buy something by Derrida instead 
 Andrew Weill is perhaps the most well-known of these type of practioners.  Unfortunately, some of what he has to say has been clinical disproven. For example, in study after study, large amnounts of Vitamin C given orally do absolutely nothing more than a   placebo for cancer patient.  Yet he still preaches this.  Given intravenously, actually, there is some evidence that it may work for some people..but it does not work by stimulating your immune system..it works in a different way.  The book How To treat and Prevent Cancer with Natural Medicine is far superios in my opinion, even though it was written by four naturopaths in 2002.  Even then they admitted that clinical studies were showing that there was no advantage of taking Vitamin C orally over a placebo,  and the authors freely admitted it. But much of what the discussed in that book..Eight Magic supplements to take when you have cancer..has actually been proven. I am a cancer patient with myeloma.  Maitake D fraction, curcumin (it must be taken w/bioperine an hour before meals), selenium, and some other things they mention have all been proven in clinical studies or are being worked on.  They do not promise that they have a cure of anything..they only say it may help in the context of complimentary medicine. They do not claim an organic diet will cure cancer or that medical science would hide it if they have a cure.  The book by Quiallan I think claims that an organic diet will cure you, and there is post after post that this has actually worked.  Maybe it has..but as a myeloma patient..my immune system is overstimulated, so I cannot take most immune system supplements..and some like Vitamin C are actually antagonistic In Vitro to myeloma treatments..this usually translates to the same thing in the body..unlike positive in studies that often do not pan out.  Anyway, I am not saying Dr. Weill is all wrong, but do not pretend he has a cure.  I have known secondhand two people who have been cured by long fasts of only carrot juice, another two by healers (I  am not religious), and one who claims that barley juice and lowering his PH totally got rid of his cancer.  I believe these people all may have gotten rid of their LOCALIZED tumors this way. For blood cancers, such as leukemia and myeloma (a cancer of blood produced in the marrow), we do not exactly have localized tumors.  But with the addition of supplements mentioned in Dr. Murray et al's book, my response to medications has been phenomenal and I have went into remission. Unfortunately, at this time, myeloma always comes back from remission. There is new understanding why this may be so..that just came out December 2005.  There is even a drug available..but it will not be available to myeloma patients for a long while 
 should both teach and delight.  The Monk's delights are many, but it teaches not.  therefore, two stars 
 It does not explain that this is two items at the cost of $ 3.99 each.  I thought I was purchasing one item for $ 3.99 
 I was confused by the range of reviews for this item, so I went and checked it out at a local bookstore before I ordered.  I'm really glad I did.   This book is clearly drawn by, and for, the people who think Star Wars films are great because they have lots of chases and fight scenes and techo-gadgetry. The woman who comments on what was left out of this "Complete" Guide strikes a note with me.  I'm a guy, but a guy who loves Star Wars for its archaeological richness and mythical roots.  The buildings which really interested me in the movies were the ceremonial ones, not the mechanic's shops.  I can't believe that the Galaxies Opera House was left out completely and that only the hangar of Naboo's royal palace was drawn. That said, I still found things to interest me.  Jabba's palace was well covered, and the illustrators showed a Wookie tree, which didn't really enter the films much at all except as background shots.  The podrace stadium and Geonosis battle arena included areas of sociological quirkiness.  Mostly, though, my eyes glazed at the minute details of hyperdrive cores and droid factories 
 At first you think that this book is going to give you insight into the stardard language as spoken in Britain, Australia, and so on. There is a lot on diversity but we never quite get to the practical side of things and it is all left a bit unclear. What I needed was a straightforward guide for my work, when I travel on business, so I avoid misunderstandings and get the language right when I talk. It would be really helpful if this author could write a book with a description of the standard language for each country and vocabulary lists for the most usual words. You could then look across. I am going to Australia, then I say this, I am going to Britain, then I say this, and so on 
 I bought this book as a present but when it arrived it definitely was not like what I expected.  There is only one project design with directions.  The rest of the book is just pictures of what other artists have done.  Maybe this would be a good book if you are a skilled carver but for a novice it may be difficult to replicate the designs without any directions 
 Hi,  I am highly regretting buying this mat.  It is too bulky to carry.  And it came on sale in Big 5 for half the price of Amazon 
 I suppose I should have realised that if I hated "L'Avventura", I would probably hate this, too. Just wish I'd thought of that before buying it. Ponderous, slow, self-consciously arty. A milestone in cinematic history, and all that, but terribly off putting and, in some instances, terribly obvious in its ennui. There will be much eye-rolling on your part. You probably only need to see this if its part of a film studies course. Really.   Good package by Criterion, though. 
 I bought the Spiderman II  Cd and absolutely fell in love with it, i love every song on that cd, best cd i ever bought.  So i figured i'd like this one too.  It pretty much sucks.  There's a few good ones, but i end up skipping most of them.  Thuroughly disappointed 
 This book wasn't quite what I expected when it arrived, but I kept it anyway since I am a Korean Studies major and can probably use it in the future.  It is somewhat "technical and scholarly" and I wouldn't recommend it for the casual reader.  If you're seriously into studying about Korea this might be an OK book 
 Demos used an Inter-Disciplinary approach to writing this book. It resulted in a book that is dull and boring. Demos utilized Biography, History, Psychology, and Sociology in an attempt to better understand the witch crazes that periodically swept New England in the 17th century. Psychology is a load of garbage and Sociology is not much better. Demos should have kept his focus on his area of expertise: History. He focused on other outbreaks of witch hysteria other than Salem in 1692, and this proved to the book's only strong point. Salem is the best known outbreak of mass hysteria relating to witchcraft in Colonial America, but it was not the only one. Some outbreaks were simply accusations against 1 or 2 people at most. Other outbreaks may have seen several people accused, but not on the scale of Salem. I give this book a "1-star" rating simply because Amazon does not have one for "0-star" books 
 I recently took a trip to the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State, and one of the books I took with me was the Insider's Guide.  I was disappointed to find that it was the most frustrating guide book that I have ever used.  It is so poorly organized! Having the information separated into so many different sections makes it impossible to find anything.  For example, I have a son and so I looked at the Kidstuff chapter.  It's organized like an alphabet book - which is cute to read but impossible to use.  Please re-organize this book - or at least re-do the index.  I would like to be able to go to one chapter and find everything in a particular area, not have to read most of the book to find out what's going on in one area. I do think the book is interesting if you have time to sit and read through the whole thing, but I found it very difficult to find things in it.  
 I downloaded a copy of this book from Itunes for my ipod. He was hard to understand. I don't think we need to know all about History. A little background information would have been enough. It was repetitive. He was abrasive and annoying. I did agree with who marketers are ignoring but these marketers aren't listening. Mainly this just kind of repeats what he has done in the past 
 When my son was in a convertible car seat which was tilted back slightly and had head/side wings, this pillow worked well.  It was propped well enough to support my son's head when he took a nap.  But when we had to switch him to a straight-back booster seat that had shallow head wings, this pillow was not usable at all 
 I wrote a huge review for this and don't know where it is but let me give you the short version.  They don't continue the story, that is until the end of the movie.  AND THAT WAS THE PART TRHAT RUINED THE MOVIE FOR ME. The movie is about this kid from the wudang sword school and he is going to get married.  Enter the Bride.  She of course doesn't want anybody to be happy so...  The story is not really worth going over, it is just injected and there are no real emotions.  Except of course for an ending that really PO'ed me.  The only reason this movie gets a 2 stars and almost gets a 3 is for Christy Chung.  Not only is she one of the most beautiful women on earth, she is a great actress.  So I know of 2 movies now that are only worth watching for her, this and Red Wolf.  It may be because the people she works with are so terrible, but to tell the truth, Christy Chung actually made me pop this dvd in for a second time.  Not a big deal since it was only like a 77 minute long movie.  
 The Maxtor OneTouch iii - Mini Edition did not function as expected. It doesn't backup system files (neither the Windows folder), nor make an image of the notebook's hard-drive. Maxtor wasn't very specific about all it can really do in their webpage.  The software which comes with it, is really poor, and offers almost the same that i can already do in Windows with 4 or 5 batch commands and schedule.  I do not recommend 
 first, i'd like to qualify that i did not read this book. after hearing the interview with tom bethel and chris mooney on the science friday podcast 6/16/06, i wouldn't touch the book with a ten foot stick. if anything, the book sounds like a study in demagogery and devil advocacy. mr bethel could not defend a single point opinioned in his book, from global warming to intelligent design. listening to his ramblings, i was embarrassed for the guy. if you are considering this book, save yourself some time and money and download science friday 6/16/06 podcast 
 This is a rather bland film.  It is the usual boring, insipid romantic comedy that Hollywood should stop making, as they are so silly and unbelievable.  Janeane Garofalo, who I consider an immensely intelligent person, is not really right here.  She has a disdain throughout the film (except when she turns on the sarcasm, which is the real Janeane), like she doesn't really believe in the material.  She's far too smart and cynical to really pull this kind of film off, even though, if they cast another actress, it would still be a middling film.  The film is not horrible, but it's nothing really special.  The biggest asset it has is that it's filmed in Ireland.  The locations are magnificent, and the filmmakers should be commended for shooting there.  The film would be absolutely abysmal if it was shot somewhere else.    
 Was rather of a long story and sometimes hard to read as it doesn't get to the point quick. But I did get one good idea from it so there was some value in it for me 
 As someone who studied meta-mathematics at Caltech and UCLA, I found this book disappointing-stylistically, mathematically and philosophically. To paraphrase the physicist Pauli, this isn't right; this isn't even wrong. This well-meaning man's editors should do a little bit of legwork before reprinting a man's inflated self-appraisal. I am so disappointed in this book that I am seriously considering returning it for a refund.   I guess I should blame myself. My first response to the editorial comment naming the author as the intellectual heir to Gdel and Turing was, "Gregory who?" Shelah, Solovay, Martin: these are names I know, but who is Gregory Chaitin? I should have gone with my gut. In retrospect, it is telling that all the jacket quotes are from freewheeling authors of popularizations, not from respected philosophers, logicians, or scientists.  The entire book is written in an embarrassingly gushing, adolescent style full of boldface and exclamation points. I know that the author was trying to write an enthusiastic, accessible book of philosophical and methodological advocacy, but this doesn't excuse shoddy editorial craftsmanship.   Don't take my word for it. Let the author speak for himself. From page 7, "Gdel's 1931 work on incompleteness, Turing's 1936 work on uncomputability, and my own work on the role of information, randomness and complexity have shown increasingly emphatically that the role that Hilbert envisioned for formalism in mathematics is best served by computer programming languages[.]"   Imagine if a working composer wrote, "Bach's preludes and fugues, Beethoven's symphonies, and my own string quartets have shown increasingly emphatically..." This man's reputation in his declared field is nowhere near his apparent stature in his own mind. The ideas discussed in this book are worthy of late-night musings over a nice brandy, or maybe a Scientific American article, but only after extensive revision. They are not ready for publication in a monograph.  From pages 148-149, "This book is full of amazing case studies of new, unexpected math ideas that reduced the complicated to the obvious. And I've come up with a few of these ideas myself. How does it feel to do that? [...] You have to be seized by a demon, and our society doesn't want too many people to be like that! [...] In fact, I only really feel alive when I'm working on a new idea, when I'm making love to a woman (which is also working on a new idea, the child we might conceive) or when I'm going up a mountain! It's intense, very intense. [...] I push everything else away. [...] I don't pay the bills. [...] And you can't force yourself to do it, any more than a man can force himself to make love to a woman he doesn't want. [...] People may think that something's wrong with me, but I'm okay, I'm more than okay."  And there you have it. I was hoping for a book to catch me up on some of the recent advances in meta-mathematics and how these ideas bear on science and philosophy. For a far better viewpoint on how information science influences modern physics, check out Charles Seife, Decoding the Universe. 
 This is a childrens book and it is supposed to teach a positive message. It should have been tiltled the "jewish Mother " tree or something. So the message was Use me and use me and use me some more and after I'm all used up, use me some more and I will be happy. Thats something we want to convey to children 
 As a licensed  therapist, I expected to be interested by this book.  I read hopefully for about 50 pages, then I skimmed pretty well for about another 100 pages.  What a irritating bore!  The counseling accounts were  bearable, although a little boring, but the eternal droning on about the  squirrels and birds was more than I could bear.   The writing was awkward.   It made me want to go to my back yard and quit reading -- which i did.   Maybe, if you are interested in counseling this might hold more appeal -  but I found it simplistic and sentimental in an irritating way 
 For the most part, the author seems to have pretty  good information for the time of the book's printing, but for anyone who wants to read this book on purely scientific terms, be warned; there are several places where the  book goes awry, for example: the author states that tracks of tyrranosaurus  indicate that it was a solitary animal, occasionally hunting in pairs.  Problem: no  tracks of a t. rex have been discovered to date, a decade and  a half after the writing. Aside from that and a few other points, though,  the book is good reading 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
  Very disappointed by Canon on the fit of this adapter.  Adapater and shade attachments block camer lens view and create flash shadows  
 I am a doctoral candidate and basically this book is not telling me how to write my dissertation and complete it giving 15 minutes a day to the writing (let alone the research) but really how to overcome blocks and start writing. Haven't we all been there, done that already?  To me, this book didn't offer anything I hadn't already read, figured out or been taught. Perhaps it would be a good book for procrastinators, but not for me 
 If you bother to parse the author's execrable writing, you find that he has very little to say about whatever it is French people do to avoid obesity.   Instead, he goes off on tangents. He tells cutesy anecdotes about family members that probably aren't even interesting to his other family members. Having established the the French are more inclined to eat organic produce and natural-sourced food than Americans, he then fills PAGES with irrelevant (and dumbed-down) factoids about chemicals in food.  If (as he says) the French aren't big on surgical solutions to obesity (e.g., stomach stapling and liposuction), why has he included an entire rambling chapter on them?  In fact, you might wonder how how someone as apparently incapable of getting to the freaking point as Clower got a PhD.    But if he just stuck to the point, he wouldn't have a book--he'd have a short, not-well-supported essay suitable for peddling to one of the less-renumerative ladies' mags.  Unsurprisingly, he sticks to the hard-to-quantify, touchy-feely (and generally useless) explanations for how the French stay thin and avoids mentioning the one contributing factor that most epidemiologists agree on: The French smoke like chimneys 
 I was really excited to read this book when I bought it, but was pretty disappointed by the end.  First, it is not science fiction.  Second, although the characters are well drawn, the story is just not that interesting.  Finally, and the most important drawback, the ending really sucks.  There is no resolution, so you feel like why did I go to the trouble to read this if it doesn't go anywhere.  Overall, I finished the last page feeling very unsatisfied 
 This book is about a young girl named Mary and her friend. It takes place in Northern France during the time the Nazis were occupying France. The kids don't care about the war until a group of Jewish children running away from the Nazis come to their house with two Nazis soldier hot on their trail. The Jewish children have to hide. Will the Nazis find them? Will Mary and her friends betray them for a bribe?  I give this book one star. I thought that the plot was a little boring and childish. I recommend this book for people who like a easy read.   
 If the church is our example of marriage Christ LOVED us first. He did not need to be respected first. I agree with the main idea of the book, however the author puts more pressure on women than on men. Men, lead the way in love as Christ did, even when he received no respect but crucifixion 
 Joseph Nye keeps repeating himself: multilateralism by global American charm attack. That is simply a stupid assumption. And it is untrue of American history in foreign relations. Nye still owes some answers to European scholars of International Relations who criticized his idea. In fact that is no personal multilateral approach.. 
 This film was boring and convoluted. One big mess that you should not waste your precious cash on 
 This movie was terrible doesn't begin to explain it.  It's a vampire movie that follows none of the rules.  They don't have to be asked to let in.  No attacking them with silver or stake through the heart.  Just shoot em up.  Also the plot seems to randomly occur.  I would give it 0 stars if possible 
 At first I was thrilled. Then I found that color matching was difficult-to-impossible, so the pics look washed out. I tried to download the latest driver from Epson's site, only to discover that it was mistakenly a scanner driver after I wrestled with the fact that the self-extracting archive wouldn't extract. After I contacted Epson no less than six times, a tech confirmed that she couldn't extract it either, and escalated me to a level one tech who said that that file extension needed to be changed to ".app", which did work. Why does Epson not change it if they know it is a problem? This last time it turned out to be the latest printer driver. The nail in the coffin for this printer is that, for no reason that Epson can explain, it started to crop all of the pics evenly on each side. Nothing I did would prevent it. Epson suggested using Photoshop to increase the size of the pic a small percentage, which is not exactly a pleasant thing to do with the hundreds of pics I print. At bottom, I think the problem is that Mac functionality and support is an afterthought for Epson 
 Brothers Johnson on DVD??? Well I couldn't wait to get it it but boy was I disappointed.A shadow of their former selves I'm afraid.Check Loius out on the George Duke concert and you'll see him at his best.Better still try and track down their 1978 concert on DVD.I did and its amazing horns funk e.t.c!!! 
 I understood that The Moonstone is a classic so I decided to read this to be culturally literate. Well the story line may be interesting but the writing is atrocious. It is curricular, bloated, and seemingly pointless. The characters just keep rattling. A lot of writers fill in the story with descriptions of time and place to give an atmosphere to the story. This writer (Wilkie Collins) just fills it with unrelated trivia. Every once in a while I would go back a few pages to see what I must have missed. When I read again there was nothing there to miss. Ether Wilkie is extremely monotonous or other writing from this period is and I am just now lucky enough to find out. I talked to others about this and they said; "Now you know why Sherlock Holmes is so popular"   
 Like the other reviewer below stated, this DVD release from Koch has been cut to shreds. It is not the director's cut and it only runs 71 minutes. Stay away from this one 
 Sure, they look great in the book, but none of the projects in this book will ever come out looking like the examples.  It looks easy, but for little hands the drawings are kinda complicated.  I've seen better drawing books for this age group.  
 I guess Albom will just keep churning out this psychobabble but I'm done with him.  At least I can say I never paid for any of his Oprahlit. Just wasted time at a library. Please don't make this huckster one cent richer. Buy something more edifying.  Like toilet paper 
 I read a 200 page allegory to learn what was summarized in the last 25 pages.  There is not much substance here and not much to indicate whether the method described in the book is proven.  
 Very little to work with here.  Covers everything, but with little detail.  For instance, there are only six pages in the book on sub-contractors. Search a little more and you can find a different resource that will be much more detail oriented.   
 Thin, bland instrumentals with monotonous arrangements that don't seem to accompany Norah Jones so much as just happen to be playing while she's singing.  Her voice has an interesting, appealing quality that is not very effectively supported or shown off.  The mixing seemed unbalanced with her voice too prominent like she was singing in your ear while the band was playing out on the patio.  I think a triple shot espresso might have help her near comatose delivery.  Did no one noticed during the recording of this album that a collection of elevator music was being produced?  The multi-channel track of the sacd version was horribly mixed.  Was everything below 80 hz intentionally left out?  I gave this album 2 stars instead of 1 because it is better than Brittany Spears.  I've listened several times to see what I missed that maked this Grammy material.  I can't figure it out 
 I listned to this cd. its ok. the mElodies are ok, not that good. sort of close to flamenco. Very close to it. I know this is not pure flamenco, but the tunes should be there. Only one or two are nice. rest just goes on. I suggest that people who like this type of music should try Armik. He is really a genius in composing. He makes melodies. he is out of this world. He make pure melodies. No thrash. He is really a professinal. His music really has passion. the guitar sort of begs wanting something which captures in your heart. Try him, you will forget oscar and everybody else. He is the master composer!! 
 Actually, I wish Amazon would allow for two ratings ... one for the movie itself, and one for the DVD.  Fantastic movie, horrendous DVD transfer by DreamWorks.  As has been stated by everyone here, the way DreamWorks has handled this movie is shameful and beyond disappointing.    Do NOT buy this DVD ... it simply is not worth parting with your hard earned cash.  Either rent it or find a away to watch the newly released Australian or UK releases (~March 2006) which have DD 5.1 and DTS 5.1 English voice-over tracks 
 I don't keep up with every single Ludlum book, and when I bought this in paperback I'd just assumed it was one of his earlier ones that I'd missed--since I was aware that he'd died.  About 15 pages into it I found myself looking back at the front to make sure I had the right book--the writing style was juvenile.  It felt like a high school kid's first attempt at a spy novel.    Then I looked at the printing date and realized I'd been ripped of by the publisher!  Ludlum did not write this, and it is so painfully obvious.  I trudged through another 100 pages or so--you know--figuring that I'd invested some time in it and it might get better. It never did.    I admit to not finishing it and I know I'm not missing anything. Just to get as far as I did was a tedious chore.    Robert Ludlum would be writhing in his grave if he knew the slop that St. Martin's Paperbacks is peddling in his name 
 Should Martha Rules have included any information regarding her going to prison as a "business decision"? I would have been interested in reading about the pr strategy used in this "criminal spectacle" designed to make the question of Martha/Mdiddy's innocence a moot point. Are honest business practices being pushed to the side? By normalizing, generalizing, and minimalizing Martha/Mdiddy's crimes, are we loosing our morality? How important is integrity to a leader...former CEO of a company? Be "thoughtful 
 I teach graduate level research courses and reviewed this book for the publisher. There are so many errors in this book that I cannot even begin to list them. I could not in all practicality use this book with my students because of the multiple theoretical and conceptual errors. Another reviewer suggested graduate students get the book because it is helpful. As a professor I would not agree. There are many other texts that do a much better job discussing Action Research that are more practical, precise, make relevant connections to practice, and  offer theoretical and conceptual accuracies 
 I'm not a hard core Dean Koontz fan but I have read a few of his novels and enjoyed most of them (at least enough to pick up another from time to time)   Until now.   I've always found Koontz to be heavy handed as an author and 'The Taking' is about as subtle as a hand grenade. We get it - people are selfish and have lost sight of what is important in life. They should pay more attention to their children and love their dogs.   The preachy tone to the novel reaches a crescendo with a corny 'Noah's Arc' ending. This the worst novel I've read in a long time - and may be the last Dean Koontz novel I'll ever read. 
 I could not believe how elementary, basic and useless this book is. The only people I can think of that could make any use of this book at all are folks who do not have any etiquette skills and barely know what an email is. This book makes such earth shattering suggestions as not to write threatening emails or emails about insider information. Wow, there's something I'm glad I read about. Also, A large section of the book is spent explaining what the difference between CC: and To: is. Long discussions ensue on explaining both CC: and To:. I bought this book expecting a wealth of material on emailing for the average person and have instead found not one paragraph of useful information. For the first time I am returning a book to Amazon. Dreadful, absolutely dreadful. Even sixth graders are too advanced for this book's contents. I sorely wish I could give less than one star- this book has my complete disdain 
 I saw this with an open mind, as some modern remakes have been pretty good.  This was not one of them.  Other than the title and number of children, this bore absolutely no resemblance to either the original with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball, or the book it was based on (Who Gets the Drumstick? -- Helen Beardsley).  The main theme of this movie seemed to be "how stupid can we make our parents look".  If you are going to remake a movie, try to make it better, rather than just trying to capitalize on the earlier movie's name and popularity 
 After 3 months of use, the basket does not close properly.  I take careful precaution to make sure the basket and caraffe are properly in place but three times I have woken up to coffee and grinds spilled out all over my kitchen counter and floor because sometime during the grinding session, the basket was wiggled loose and opened.  Not only that, it is a mess to clean, as you have to take off about 6 parts and clean them extensively, especially the grinder (even when you don't use it, you have to clean it because it fills up with condensation).    Never again will I buy a grinder/coffee maker.  It's better to grind your own and just fill it with grounds.  Trust me, it's not worth the dissappointment and frustration of waking up with a huge mess to clean and no coffee to drink 
 This book is the exact type you don't want your child to read. My sister read this book and she asked me some awkward questions from the book. It told her that the facts wasn't true but she was  still scared. This was the worst book in the series, and I think Barbara Park has lost the skill. DON'T BUY IT!- if you really want to read it to find out, check it out from a local library and read it before buying it. 
 this movie stunk. I remembered it as a child being good... what have I been smoking??? this is boring and have watched it once. I guess i may have been spoiled by the quality of the recent animation 
 This is not one of my favorites. It was a ok read with not alot of action and the ending I wish could have had a little more excitment.The interaction between Jack and Daisy seemed alittle forced with her telling him he's not her type and there was no chemistry between them, something was missing there for me. The way Howard described Jack - graying hair, thick neck, body builder, is that supposed to be attractive? I felt Howard wrote more about the puppys antics than she cared to write about the romance or action. The book was worth reading if you have nothing else to read or important to do. It just could have been so much better. Not up to Howards usual books 
 Back in the 1920s, when there was a resurgence of anti-Catholic sentiment in America, someone obtained what was purported to be the script for a Knights of Columbus degree ceremony, and started passing around copies.  That's all this is -- offered by a firm that prints small quantities of "out-of-print" books and booklets for the curious.  Don't waste your money 
 One wonders how a corporare board would react when the disccovered that Jesus-CEO had put Mark 10:21 into effect as a corporate policy.  Really, this has to be the dumbest title in history. 
 hi my name is alicia i am a high school senior and had to read this book i had to tell a summary and i could not how could i tell a summary of letters plays and her thoughts i needed help and if there is anyone out there  reading it for school i would not recommend you read it at all its good but  not that good to get a F fo 
 I simply spent time watchnig this French response to a Chaplin-style but non-silent motion picture.  Maybe, it was a top at the timing of the making. 
 Did not care for this book. It was a struggle to get to the last 100 pages which read somewhat more interesting but was not worth it. Don't waste your time, you never care for the characters, nor did I want to get to know them.  
   A Cambridge Companion for Kafka (used and new) for over $70.??? What are the publishers thinking? Obviously anyone interested in Kafka is an academic, a scholar and thus inherently poor or, at the very least, not wealthy enough to be downright insulted by the price of this book. Cambridge companions are valuble texts. I've purchased some on Faulkner, Philip Roth and Nabakov. Those, however, were rougly $20. What gives? Is the Kafka companion printed on golden paper? Are they autographed by Kafka and Brod themselves? I'd love a reason on why a normal book is $80. with shipping? 
 I TOTALLY agree with "A Reader" that posted on January 10, 2004... titled." What Would Sue Monk Kidd Do?" This reviewer captured my thoughts exactly. WHY would anyone want to read a spiritual book written by a woman who abandoned her Christianity? Please! This author has one book that is good..."The Secret Life of Bees," and it's fiction! Stick with fiction, Ms. Kidd. You seem to do it in your own spiritual life, so writing it should be simple. 
 I bought this book expecting to have some practice questions and some tutorials on the subject matter that I will inevitably have to face during the actual ACT.  The only thing that it really gave me was just the type of information that was going to be on the test, but no workable problems or tutorial information on subjects that I have either never taken or am rusty at for lack of practice.    This book, in my opinion, was a waste of my money and did not fulfill the objective that I had previously expected it to 
 What Fat possum did to this album really blows!!  Tracks like "I got a friend" start out with a nice southern delta blues sound and then out of nowhere it turns into porn music.  The audio effects and computerized editing really messed up the original sound of Asie Payton 
 Well the women that was selling this product decided that after she had already sold me this car seat that she was'nt makeing any money off of it, so she decided not to sell it to me.   So I never got this car seat. I really don't understand why I need to write a review on it 
 I was disappointed!  This book does not even include a section on Microsoft Notes.  The book covers the basic stuff that you probably know anyway, and does not bother with advanced features.  You will learn more just playing around on your computer 
 For a novel that garnished such high praise, I expected better. I had to work  and force myself to finish. I never became engaged with the character or the story.    
 Yes, it's awful. Truly frighteningly awful 
 If you are looking for love, romance, witty banter and everything else that has made Suzanne Brockmann a hit....don't expect it from this book!!  The romance is undeveloped, sparse and stale.  The suspense is based on gore and the end is abrupt.  A great read if you're looking for nightmares.  
 This book may well have been filled with great writing, however, as a dog owner and lover, I was disgusted and depressed reading these stories.  The reviews on the book cover give little indication as to the repeated  ugliness within.  If you are a parent, imagine reading story after detached  story of babies being killed, lost and neglected.  For me, any great  writing was overshadowed by my sympathies for the dogs.  Not what I  expected and very sad 
 We ordered a tub from Baby Because which was delivered.  Then they mistakenly sent us formula someone else ordered. On route the formula fell off a UPS truck and was lying in the street for over a day.  A neighbor saw it and gave it to us. Baby Because contacted us saying they wanted the formula back to sell it. We expressed concern that they wanted to sell baby formula that had fallen off a truck and been lying out in the street for a day.  They said it wasn't our concern and to just give it back 
 I was so eager to read this book. But I was so disappointed when I finally did read it. I couuldnt even make it to the end of it. its so boring. and she keeps jumping from a story to another without knowing what is the real point of telling that story. its like you'are sitting with some talkative chatterbox who keeps on talking and talking till you lose it..  
 I selected the option for 'paperback' and did not have a good experience purchasing an item a few months back with Amazon so I made sure before I purchased the item it still stated paperback.  When I received the item it was a HUGE book.  This was supposed to replace a book for my son's 1st grade teacher that he brings home nightly for homework because we lost it at a restaurant.  Furthermore, the front and back cover was completely torn off from the rest of the book.  
 At best Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is just a mediocre modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones. The characterization seems like it came straight out of a 70's made for TV movies. If you have read any mysteries before the plot is paper thin, the first time the true villain makes an appearance, it is basically a "well isn't that contrite" moment. But it is a fast EASY reading novel. This book is just fine for lounging on the beach or passing the time on a cross country airline flight.   Some people take the conspiracy overtones to being anti-catholic. I think this is just nonsense but if you are sensitive to this sort of thing you might be offended by this book. Althogh, there are some kooks that think this book is about reality, instead of fiction,   A much more interesting book, in a similar venue (modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones), is Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco. Be forewarned, Eco's novel is a MUCH more challenging read but in the end is a more enjoyable novel. It is analogous to comparing cotton candy (Da Vinci Code) to a 12 course gourmet dinner (Foucault's Pendulum). Both will satisfy hunger, both are a type of food, but the popular one is something which can be consumed casually and in the end leaves you wondering if you should have made an effort to consume something that would have been more fulfilling.  
  "Original Motion Picture Soundtrack" as it says on both the front and back sides of the CD?  Give me a break!  As another reviewer wrote on Jan 10, it is disappointing not to get a movie soundtrack when you pay for a movie soundtrack.  I bought the CD to listen to Olivia Olson's (Joanna Anderson's) "All I want for Christmas is You."  Of course, the track is not the same one as I heard when I saw the movie.  In the movie she sings her intro without background music.  On the audio CD, there is unwanted background music clutter from the start and, to my ear, it only gets worse as the piece progresses.  When will the recording industry set standards voluntarily, clearly spelling out on labels and advertising any soundtrack substitutions?  Or, do they prefer to wait for more government regulation?  J Records, a unit of BMG, shouldn't expect any more business from me anytime soon 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 This is a really disappointing product for a couple major reasons. First, there's the logistical problems. So much of the footage is poor and so badly-cut together that me and my husband, both punk fanatics, wanted to turn it off out of frustration at how jumpy and un-followable the narrative was. Second is the truly unforgivable part and that's the incomprehensible leaving out of so many pertinent bands and events. I understand if you can't cover everyone, of course you can't, but they left out more than they included. Really disappointing...I doubt I'll ever want to watch it again 
 I'm so glad we didn't buy a subscription to National Geographic Kids magazine without checking it out at the news stand first! It truly seemed like there were more pages of ads than of actual CONTENT in this magazine.  If you're looking for a good kids' magazine about nature & wildlife, try one of the National Wildlife Federation's excellent publications. My kids enjoy Your Big Backyard (for ages 3-7) and Ranger Rick (for kids 7 & up), both of which are available through Amazon.com or [...]  Kids Discover magazine (for 6-12 year olds) is another favorite with my children (and me) and contains great science & social studies articles without the commercials of NG Kids. You can subscribe through Amazon or [... 
 This is good for just a general guide. It provides little information on the boss fights in the game and little on tips on how to beat them. I used this and a Free game FAQ walkthrough while playing (and am still playing by the way), and the walkthrough had loads of information on item locations and how to defeat Bosses and other enemies as well. I don't regret buying this guide as it has had some benefits, but unless you have money to burn, I would get a free walkthrough and use that 
 Like the Blues Brothers, the main purpose of UB40 is to introduce listeners to music they might not be familiar with. It is then hoped the listener will go out and find the original material, and then you would see that this is a pallid imitation. When you realize this band's best cover is a Neil Diamond tune on a CD with Bob Marley and Jimmy Cliff songs, you see how authentic UB40 really is. To their credit, just due is given to the original artists in the liner notes. If you like this CD do yourself a favor, and listen to the original recordings 
 Incoherent.  This book wanders seemingly at random.  Travelog?  Literary criticism?  Science?  History of?  Behavior studies?  I might well want to read any one of these, at various times.  What I am not interested in, is a book that wanders from one to the other.  Poorly reasoned.  The author steps from the observed facts of commonalities at the genome level, to the fairly safe conclusion that all earthly life has common ancestry, but then leaps to the absolutely unjustified conclusion that "life [on earth] happened once and only once".  Nonsense: the evidence does not rise to that level.  For one thing, life could just as easily have started 1000 times and been extinguished by inferno in the early bombardment period.  And, it should be well known to the author that there was no single tree of descent for unicellular life - they routinely exchange genetic material and have even combined to form more complex cells.  Pardon me, but there is plenty of room in that history for multiple geneses to have been obscured by early exchanges and combinations.  So, the author can't write straight and can't think straight - regretfully, I find that I for one have no use for this work.  
 Amendment to below review (Mar 07):  My wife really likes them and wears them all the time.  I'd upgrade at least one more star, maybe two if I could. ----------------------------------------------------------  My son wanted to buy mama's present this Christmas so naturally, we turned to Amazon for computer skill training and the ability to view a lot of products easily.    The earrings arrived today (very quickly) but the stone is not nearly as robust as the picture depicts.  The stone is white, like a fake diamond.  When viewed in other kinds of light, you can see a slight tint of blue but nothing like the picture.    Another issue - the clasp or ear stud is flimsy.  I may return them (need to ask my son) but I don't think these earrings will last more than a couple of wears.  On the positive side - it really is a nice design 
 The book starts off on an interesting story - the real life capture of Crassus' Roman legions.  As soon as they hit the desert, the book goes down hill fast.  The overall plot is the stock story of a confrontation between good and evil, with a hero who must learn his supernatural powers.   If the story isn't to be banal, the author has to bring the world and the characters to life, to make them so involving that reader finds them compelling and urgent, not just a rehash of a cliche.  Except for Quintus, most of the characters didn't interest me.   There isn't enough character development to engage my sympathies.   The allies that he meets up with are rather boring people, given to gnomic sayings.  Drapaudi postures rather than lives, and she and Quintus have no chemistry.  Norton and Shwartz have turned to Hindu myth and legend, the Mahabarrata, which ought to be a refreshing change.  Unfortunately, they don't use it very well.  Their allusions to it strike me as rather too elliptical for the presumed audience.   How many Americans or Europeans are truly familiar with the Mahabarrata?   I don't think that the authors can rely on a few words conjuring a lengthy episode for their readers.  It is a vast work, and the authors have not confined themselves to the parts that are more familiar to the West.   It is like listening in on a conversation between two old friends talking about a distant shared past; they may know what they mean, but bystanders who have no context or familiarity with the subjects of the conversation are baffled.  Further, the walk through the desert becomes incredibly boring.  In the first place, it is hard to believe that they decided to cross an uninhabited desert.   The Chinese, who presumably have already made this journey in the opposite direction, certainly didn't plan well; did the commander give no thought to how his troops were to be provisioned?  What is now known as the Silk Road has numerous towns, oases, etc.: it was a major trade route, for heavens sake!  Wouldn't that be the sensible path to travel?   This is rather like describing I-95, the Federal highway that runs across most of the East coast as a animal track through a desolate wilderness.  But having decided to cross Asia the hard way, the story is a monotonous account of the struggle to survive: food, water, exhaustion.  A skilled writer ought to be able to convey the miseries without endless repetition.   Of course it is part of their experience, but this is a novel, it is supposed to have a compelling narrative.   Blinking is certainly an important part of the human condition, but I really don't want to read a chronicle of eyeblinks.  There should be some point to telling this tale. I think that most readers already know that deserts tend to be hot, dry and barren.    A tedious trip for characters and readers alike 
 This is my third Vince Flynn book, and I was thoroughly disappointed.  "Executive Power" incorporates two stories, neither of which have anything to do with each other.  It's as if Flynn had enough for two half stories and then squished them together.  The first is a story about an American family kidnapped in the Philippines. Lurking in the background is another story set in the Middle East.  I thought Flynn was going to bring the two stories together.  But he never did.  He resolved one in sweeping fashion and then focused on the other.  If you only read one Vince Flynn book, I recommend that you read "Transfer of Power."  THAT is an exciting book.  But stay away from "Executive Power."  You'll be thoroughly disappointed 
 This is a huge regret for me. The iAudio is more an expensive portable hard drive than anything else. The navigation sucks, there is no way to organize your music etc.(like, the songs are all there but they aren't seperated by artist/album/etc. it's just a big list. as someone who has over 20 songs, that's a problem!), the provided program is full of glitches and despite many calls to customer service, I could hardly get anything on it, the folders would appear on the drive of the iAudio, but it would not let me open them. I consider myself to be a computer savvy person and if I can't get this machine working for me, I doubt the average person could either. After a month of frustration, I gave it to a friend who could not get it working either, past getting a mess of unorganized songs on it. 2 months later, it broke and customer service was no help at all. Currently it's sitting in a drawer somewhere. what a waste of money!  Yes, this iAudio LOOKS attractive and offers more than the iPod for less, but it's not worth the hassle.   the only positive thing I have to say about this player is that the audio quality is great. But it doesn't make much difference on a player that doesn't do what I need it to!   I am not a fan of apple, but I got a second hand iPod for cheap and I am very happy with it. I also purchased the creative zen visionM and I love it!!! (I am kind of obsessed with music) After A LOT of research, I'd stick with creative or apple.   don't make the same mistake I did 
 I bought this basket because it was the lowest price and cool looking. But after I say 2-3 months the basket broke in one spot near the handlebars, at a critical point. I did carry a heavy backpack in the basket. But still I think the basket is a piece of junk.  Plus the basket requires you use the hardware to connect to the fork, which limits your height of your handlebars. The basket seemed like it was badly put together and just not durable.   I can't recommend this basket. Buy a basket from your local sports authority or something.  thanks DaRealDeal 
 Bizarre atempt at merging the Choose your own adventure style of books with an interactive DVD.  The end result is mixed.  With four possible endings you think you can really control the out come of the adventure, but in reality you can not.  Death and dismemberment await you at all turns  with an anti climatic ending.  As for the CGI animation.  It comes no where close to Beast Wars or The CGI GI-Joes.  The animation is not fluid and tends to bind on the characters.  If you can find it really cheap, buy it but after you watch it once this disk will collect dust on your shelf.    No plot development, no character development, more interaction between monsters and enemies in Balder's Gate 2 or Ever Quest.  I was disapointed to say the least.  -Davi 
 WHAT A WASTE OF TAPE  AND TIME THEY PUT INTO THIS MOVIE,  ANYONE WHO SAYS THIS MOVIE IS GREAT NEEDS HEL 
 I got this video thinking it would be like the baby faith videos with fun and creative elements for learning development. My baby watched about two mintues and was gone. I think this is pitched as a baby video but it's really more geared toward older children. None of the elements have anything to do with the music, making is virtually useless as a learning development product. I give it a big "thumbs down". Try any one of the baby faith products like God Made Me, God Made Music and God Made Animals. They're awesome! 
 Anyone with educational experience knows that good teachers try to make lessons engaging and meaningful. All this program does (if your district uses it) is create more work for educators with no real support or help, just a lot of demands in time and paper work. If you don't or didn't share and get help from your colleges before this program shame on you! How did you get through your Collage of Education?  Anyone with business experience knows this is just a great example of marketing; it plays on the notion of helping and lets administrators look like they have a plan to the public. If your district administrators needed this program they should have resigned their positions. After a few years of experience you should not have to invest the kind of money and resources this program requires. Who is making the money?  Who gets the kick backs? Not the classroom teacher who works longer hours than paid for already. Don't fall for the hype; this is just the latest educational reform gimmick. Making someone rich? Mark Twain had it figured out when it came to school boards.  Look it up. 
 As ridiculous as I found this book, upon reading reviews from so many men who loved it, I am filled with horror.  Granted, I am a female college student, so I completely missed the abused-male-baby-boomer boat, but I cross my fingers and wish like crazy that not all men have this sort of deep psychological complex. I find hope in a few reviews written by men who are still confident that they can be men without a self help book.   Everything that can be said about Bly's methods has been said.  He is not a psychologist.  He is not a folklorist.  He is a poet (that's what the two stars are for).  Folklore is dynamic, and to suppose the "Iron John" folktale is the same today as it was before the Grimms collected it is purely blind.  The Grimms slashed and edited and put in cute morals.  If you think the Granny they collected it from would have told the exact same "Iron John" tale as the woman two houses away, or ten years earlier, or two days later, you are a stranger to folklore.  Society holds on to the tales that mean something to us.  Isn't it curious then, that "Iron John" dropped from our stock of folktales until ressurrected by Bly, who suddenly claims it is a reflection of modern America? 
 I am a big PJ fan but this was disappointing with a serious lack of content. Start with his best works, Holidays in Hell and Parliament of Whores; then if you really want more work you're way down to this 
 i have read just about every popular book on horserace betting and the acid test is: does it help beat the races? the name of the game in betting thorougbreds is data mining and processing, which can only be done with software on a computer. i have software that allowed me to test some of the factors cited in this and other popular books. the bottom line... yes you get a high percentage of winners but unfortunately these horses are overbet, indicating that the info in this and other popular books is well known and used by the betting public. to beat the horses you have to think outside the box. so in conclusion don't waste your time reading this book. 
 Cesar Milan, the so-called 'dog whisperer', bases his training methods on a dog behavior model that is so out of date as to be archaic - from the dinosaur age. He teaches that dogs base all their behavior on their pack status, and that you need to use painful 'corrections' to convince them that you are Alpha. This idea hasn't the slightest shred of evidence going for it.   Yes, dogs do have dominance roles, but that hasn't the slightest thing to do with problem behaviors. Dogs do 'bad' doggy behaviors because they work. Dog guards his food bowl? Dog wants to keep food and knows that growling keeps you away. Dog pulls on the leash? Dog wants to get somewhere faster and knows that pulling speeds things up. The dog doesn't care whether or not you're alpha; he only cares that what he's doing works to get him what he wants.   Technically, Cesar's methods work. But they use force, fear, and pain to teach the dog, when you can teach the same things faster with the proper positive motivation and non-forceful techniques. I have three hyper, active, highly driven Border Collies, and they're all very obedient and mannerly. They don't haul me around the leash, nor do they leap at guests, nor do they ignore me when I tell them something. And I don't need to be 'Alpha' to get them that way; neither does anyone else.   I strongly suggest that you don't buy this item. Good books to start with are Karen Pryor's 'Getting Started: Clicker Training for Dogs', Melissa Alexander's 'Click for Joy!' (also with a great problem solving section), and Jean Donaldson's 'The Culture Clash'. You can easily have a happy, obedient, well behaved dog without causing him fear and pain 
 I spent a lot of money on this product & waited with anticipation for it to arrive. When I applied it, it did nothing to "create" curl and didn't even define the curls that I already had. My hair was limp and frizzy by days end. It smelled nice & that's about it. Cheap-o Suave gel or mousse works better and creating and holding curl 
 I read this book for school, my sister said it would get better, but it turned out to be the worst book I've ever read. I rest my case. 
 Even a week ago I would have said this is book is probably the best popular introduction to the subject. Now that the New York Times has effectively called into question every word published on the subject by its reporter, Judith Miller, I feel I should warn folks to read the book with the NYT's admitted failures in mind. It's not clear how this scandal relates to the information in the book not associated with Iraq's bio-chem weapons programs, but those sections at least are thoroughly tainted by the evolving story of how Iran/Chalabi/White House/DoD collaborated to manipulate public/government opinion by feeding Miller disinformation 
 I am going to resign from critiquing this book on a literary scale, and just say that I didn't enjoy this book for the same reason a couple others mentioned - its boring and repetitive. Maybe its because I'm not used to aimless - albeit eloquent -landscape descriptions, or maybe it's the fact that NOTHING happens for 264 pages, but reading this book felt more like a chore than an enjoyable reading experience. Case in point: Casual readers beware 
 did not liked the book, I thought the pictures were going to be brighter.Excellent delivery 
 I liked this book up until the ending.  I expected the judges to be released and taken care of one by one which would have been predictable (it's what I thought was going to happen), but at least satisfying and believable considering the power Grisham gave the CIA throughout this entire book.  Instead, the ending was quite disappointing and pretty much ruined the book for me 
 Boo-Wop? haha ok, anyways I bought his through Middle-Piller distro. and it's got a couple of o.k. songs on it. The problem is the singing and the overall production. This is definetely a home-recording on computer deal. The vocals are waaaaay weak. What exactly is a "re-worked" debut album??? I thought once an album was out it was done, set in stone? Apparently not,so mister monster gets to pull a Blitzkid (who changed their first album cover years after it came out!) and take the cheezy way out. A definete step up from bands like Blitzkid,but still in the cellar of rock n roll. Do yourself a favor and buy some good old deathrock from the golden years 
 The basic idea of "Population 436," which is exactly what the film title says, sounds like one extended episode from "The Twilight Zone" or maybe "Star Trek." Some say they are impressed with the film's main idea, which I also liked. Another thing I can say about the film is that for all tis great idea its story might have worked better within the format of TV programs. "Population 436" is longer than it should be almost by 30 minutes, showing its hands too early in its storytelling, in fact, in its opening.   A census-taker Steve Kady (Jeremy Sisto) sent from Chicago is stranded in an isolated town of Rockwell Falls. He meets a young girl who is eager to listen to the world outside. He has a nightmare every night. He feels there's something strange going on in Rockwell Falls, where townspeople are all looking at him smilingly. All these things are familiar, but familiarity itself is not a big problem. But its poor storytelling is.  The film is directed by Michelle Maxwell MacLaren, whose previous works are mainly for TV, as producer. In spite of the film's decent photography and effective acting from the cast including Jeremy Sisto, almost everything is told in a wrong order. As I am not allowed to discuss the film's story in detail, I cannot reveal the premise of the film, of which implausibility is less damaging to the film compared with the slow-moving way it is revealed in the flat narrative. In other words, most people would predict what would happen quicker than the film thinks.  "Population 436" is a mildly entertaining thriller, of which clever idea is wasted by its half-baked script. 
 As a debut, this novel is noteworthy, and the author paints a highly visual picture of the Africa she knows.  To me, the disappointment with the novel was the author's inability to go deeper.  It stayed very "surface level" with me, reads almost like a "young adult" novel.  Also deals with the subject of physical abuse, so those who are unable to handle such content should avoid it.  
 While this book provides a lot of technical information it was written over seven years ago.  The information provided is practically ancient in the high tech and ever changing world of IVF.  The author is very dry, clinical and frankly quite negative about the chances of success.  Again, this is due to the age of the book.  IVF success rates have increased dramatically since this book was published.  A much better, positive, timely and accurate book is The Couples Guide to IVF.  It was written in this century and it much more helpful, upbeat and informative.  
 I didn't like this book at all.  I couldn't even finish it.  It was too complicated and too many underlying characters 
 This story takes place in South Africa. It starts off with the promise of a great read as Silas encounters Francoise Du Boise, who had raped his wife Lydia decades earlier. This wound is freshly reopened not only for Silas but for Lydia when he tells her about it. Then the book becomes boring and as slow as molasses with very little action, which when it fleetingly appears is interspersed with a whole lot of thinking. Example: On page 95 "he urinated" but since page 92 we'd been hearing of the hospitalized Silas's "unbearable need to urinate." On page 30 the action here is Mikey peeing and watching "the steamed froth with some satisfaction, shivers with delight at the end. How pleasing the simplest acts of gratification." I think the author loves to pad. The story improves slightly (pg.36) when Mikey remembers how he and Mireille as youngsters "played Ghandi." However when Mikey falls asleep while he is looking at Lydia's diary hidden in her bureau, for which he went out of his way to search for the key, there was something definitely askew here, I thought. On page 78 Kate stumbles on Mikey's ritual but the story gets diluted with that time when she sees a leopard up close. Aouch!! And that "stuff" between Silas and Betty was..... (pg. 98). I persevered to page 100 (1/3 of the book). Couldn't take more. The author's positives were in some of his descriptions, which were sometimes interesting and humorous 
 Having personally had the privilege to study with three of the Underground Railroad's top historians: David Blight, James Horton, and Lois Horton; All three said that there is not a shred of evidence supporting the idea that quilts served as maps.  Quilts were however sewn and sold as fundraisers for abolitionist groups.  
 I worked in an independent outpatient facility in the early 1970's, when Al Lowen was publishing, which ought to give you some idea of the focus involved.  Bioenergetics had something to commend it, especially in the 70's, and still does, for people who are experiencing day-to-day stress (so what's new?).  But I do not see where the long-term benefit can be had for someone who is really ill: anorexic, paranoid, or psychotic.  As with a volcano, venting helps yet doesn't solve the underlying turmoil.  As a daily anger (or other) management tool it may be a bandaid but I do not believe it helps in the long run. I can personally testify that bioenergetics did nothing for me, although admittedly my exposure was not consistent. 35 years after the fact, I'm in conventional therapy as well as pharmaceutical treatment for issues that arose while I was working at the facility, aa was my tormentor 
 Useless book. Waste of time. Waste of money. Trust me.  Anyone who has gone through SOX will really get a good laugh out of this book 
 NOFX is probably the most shamelessly sold out punk band EVER.  Fat Mike thinks his opinion is law, and quite frankly, I'm sick of it.  What happened to the good ol' days, when they were ACTUALLY FUNNY?  I mean, is this record a joke!?!??  Yeah, and um, NOFX isn't the funniest band ever.  In fact, this WON'T give them a song idea.  NOFX has no ideas.  They are just jumping on the political and religious bandwagon to sell more records.  Honestly, I don't care what NOFX says anymore.  All I hear is a bunch of whiners going "Blah, blah, blah..."    Oh, P.S.  If you want a REAL funny song by a punk band that actually has their own ideas, check out GREEN DAY's "Dominated Love Slave" off of Kerplunk 
 I can't help but agree with most of the reviews on this page; this guide is nearly useless. The Prima (the leader in half-assing every guide they've ever gotten their hands on) guide "walks" us through a game where chest locations are off and inaccurate, enemies don't   appear in the right spots, the data on the Fiend Challenges is basically: "kill the guys that um... you know, attack... uh yeah." There's misspellings in a few cases and grammatical errors. Also keep in mind: their boss strategies aren't crucial to your survival, I bearly used 'em. The only slightly useful piece of this guide is the Golden Scarabs. One note on that, once you find the 50th GO BACK AND TURN THEM IN. I made the mistake of not trudging back to town due to being anxious about beating the game. In summery: don't buy this unless you really need feel you need a very small amount of visual support. You're better off on your own 
 Berman speaks like a man who has not had to actually live rough but visited the life style once and continues to romanticize it. His view, and it is only his view, that technology is driving us further apart could remind some of us of the Amish people. If you wish to live that way, fine. But Berman would like to pick a point in history more modern. Again fine. I do find it ironic that he talks with a woman during a flight to Switzerland about the evils of globalization.  He says that the attacks of 9/11 were a wake up call for the US to change our evil ways. After all, people who enslave their woman and beat people for not going to church might have a valid point according to Berman. After all, he considers us soul less. Obviously he despises our society and our form of government. He talks about negative and positive freedom like people should believe this kind of thing. After all, the Islamic terrorists don't force people to make decisions in life. According to Berman this decision making makes life tough. So the Islamofacists have it made. Do what they say or die. He actually attempts to make the argument that they are not fighting because of their religious belief but because of America's globalizing influence.  The left has been foretelling the fall of America for 60 years now. In that time, the USSR fell. That is an event that Berman does say was bad. They had a better cohesive society in his eyes. Berman and the rest of the left believe the only savior is a totalitarian socialist government. Of course socialist can only be totalitarian so that was redundant. His writings is done in the feigned highly intellectual style. In other words he believes that his observations are above review or argument and he quotes many other intellectuals who can't stand an argument as well.  A very poorly written book taken from the perspective that if it ain't socialist, it ain't 
 This book just drags on and on.  Buck's search for Chloe could have been handled in a fraction of the time.  One huge gripe, which represents incredibly poor writing, is the name changes used to refer to one character.  Ken Ritz is both referred to as Ken and Ritz, and not just in dialogue either.  One rule of good writing is to ALWAYS refer to your character by one name.  You wouldn't refer to a mother as Jane, mum, mother and ma in the one book.  Still, the book can be quite entertaining if you know what's coming next, which you would because it's been mentioned enough in the books.  One more thing that bothers me is recapping on past events-- the authors rehash the same old stuff 
 I read this book many years ago, and thought it was terrible.  Looking through the reviews just now, I couldn't believe how overwhelmingly positive they were, and just had to put in a word for those of us (and I assume/hope there are others) who didn't like the book.  The book is ludicrously long, and meanders through way too many red herrings, dead ends, and nonsequitirs.  There are any number of sub-plots that appear out of nowhwere, go nowhere, never pay off, and leave you wondering why you had to take the time to read through them at all.  The sub-plots, though, are nothing like as much of a problem as the main plot itself.  It's a very uninspiring story about a business deal.  Will person A get the contract, or will person B?  A business deal?  Who cares?  SPOILER ALERT:  And then, after sitting through thousands of pages boringly building up to the big deal, at the end one of the characters randomly dies, and the whole thing just peters out.  No climax, no drama, nothing.  I also respectfully disagree with the reviewers who praised the characters.  I found that Clavell has a bad habit of making his characters too perfect, carried out too far in this book.  All of the major characters are the greatest golfer and an olympic diver and the greatest gourmet and a brilliant business person and so on and so on.  These are not real people, they're supermen who I couldn't relate to at all.  It's boring, it's long, it's badly written.  I was particularly disappointed because I loved Shogun and liked Tai-pan and King Rat.  But after this one, I've never read another Clavell book, and I don't think I will 
 This book was a huge disappointment. It's content is weak in almost all sections with much of the information available from either the Internet or you local photo lab. I didn't find it very useful at all and I'm even tempted to send it back.  The book is pretty much broken up into the three section as described in the book's title. The first part brushes over optimising your workspace - calibrating your monitor - and selecting a printer and then basic printing output. Things most people know already.   The second goes into a bit more depth regarding getting your pics on the web: registering a domain name, selecting a hosting company, etc. Information you'll find better provided by a quick search in any web search engine. However, one of my main gripes is that it reads like a magazine review of 3rd party programs you should buy to help with the web authoring in html. In fact it advises using Macromedia Dreamweaver.  A program which cost more than 500 USD. Now, I understand that writing html sounds complicated to the novice but you would - honestly - be better served and save some money from learning a bit from any basic html/web authoring book(any of the O'Reilly books are well recommended) Creating a basic html web gallery is not complicated.   The final part of the book continues on the team of glossing over the subject. It briefly mentions approaching galleries and selling on the Interent. I was expecting so much more from ths section but I really didn't learn much more than I knew already.   I find it hard to believe that one of the reviews here gives this book 5 stars yet points out some of the same failings of the book as me. The book has good intentions but just doesn't deliver the level of content and information required to make really useful. 
 Since he is the famous writer and I'm just a reader, it must me be. But I find stuff written in the first person and the present time a nuisance. Having read almost all of Hiaasen's books, this one was like a cold shower. I sometimes actually doubted that he had written it himself 'cause often the phraseology is so totally not the Hiaasen I got used to 
 After borrowing Moore's first two books from the library, I decided to purchase this one. The book has now been donated back to the library. It was forced and uninteresting. Maybe someone else can find it enchanting. I just thought it boring 
 This is a good book for those who know how to use a PDA and are experts at reading and writing code.  It is not for beginners or those who have never seen Win CE.  But if you love computers and techie gadgets, are good with code and like to play with electronic toys, are looking for another techie's love of toys, then you might get something out of it.  But if you are inclined in that way you already know this stuff.  Don't waste your money.  There are other books that do a better job in both area 
 This book is for people who do not have a wedding budget and who can afford a $100,000.00 wedding.  This book is so dry and boring talking about etiquete it puts you to sleep.  It makes planning a wedding seem like  planning a funeral.  No fun at all 
 This book is very basic.  Those with any training, experience, or knowledge of Project Offices will not increase their knowledge here.  For beginners, it is a good introduction chapter to allow you to know what you don't know and seek greater detail elsewhere 
 This book is horrible.  It is not true to the original classic stories!  Most of the endings, of the stories I've read so far, are different. I don't care for the illustrations either.  I was very dissapointed.  I bought this for my neices, and didn't read the book until they came to visit me, and by then it was too late to return this book. It's basically going in the trash 
 I tried to read this book(translated) to the portuguese, about 15 years ago.Even never finishing it, I as a brazilian (unemployed) agronomist must tell the reality about weberianism. At first, Max Weber was a man looking to show the reality.He wasn't a bigot(or mad) such as Loraine Boettner, Eric Jon Phelps, etc. With no doubt, Max Weber was a great scholar, a man with great IQ, a man man looking for reality.Even with this qualities, Max weber was wrong.Even a man like Max Weber, like you and me, is ever a prisioner of his times, informations and reality. The core idea of this book is that capitalism, industrial revolution and modern science were made by protestantism. Very believed idea in Weber's times. In fact, Weber puts "the cart ahead of the horse", in this idea.In fact, modern world wasn't created after Luther.It was shaped in XV Century, with the press and Great Navigations. The press was invented by a catholic german, called Johann Gutemberg.All the great navigators were catholic men.Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Bartolomeu Dias,Cabral, Gil Eanes,etc. 100% of then were catholics and were under catholic kings money and orders.With the Great discoveries the American continent was under Europe's hands.The claim that protestantism was the source of Europe's power was and is a fraud. In fact economically and lively, after Luther, protestant Germany became a nightmare until the end of 30 years War, in 1648.The claim that protestantism was good for Europe is a possibility, not a fact. In fact, we could see protestantism is a result of nacionalism, church's abuses, education and greed for church's money. Not all protestants countries of Europe had good economical results.Germany was doomed after Luther's Reformations.Not all catholic countries had bad economic results, as France shows.Spain and Portugal were bad, after jew's expeling, not after any reformation. With the Industrial Revolution, coal became condition "sine qua non" for economical sucess.And the Geology(not theology)decided the future for nations in Europe.With no coal Portugal, Spain, Italy were senteced to relatively poverty, in Europe.France with bad coal reserves, has some dificults in industrialization.Belgium, even more than 90% of his population in catholic church, had no economical problems, because Belgium had great coal's mines. Why England had so good economic results, ahead of every other european country?Beeing an island, England shouldn't have an expensive army against invasions.Then, England could built the biggest navy in the world.Geography, not theology gave economic sucess to England in XVI and XVII Century.With the Industrial Revolution, England had coal reserves looking to be minerated. Geography and later geology gave England industrial and economical sucess.With the 30 years War, Germany was splited in about 300 feufdoms. The England's decadency also came from no theological problemas, but geological, political and tecnological problems.With the reunification of Germany, an industrial enemy was created in continental Europe.With the invention of airplane, England could be attacked by an enemy with no navy.With the coming of oil's age, England (North Sea oil's reserves not found before the 1960's) had to import100% of his fuel.With both World wars, England's empire was sentenced to death. Protestantism in fact, like today, was ever divided in thounsands of cults, since his beginnings.If fact all kinds of protestantisms are image and similarity of his human creator, culture and society.Luther made a anti-semithic protestantism suc as himself.Calvin made a bank's friend protestantism, as himself was.And the England's king Henry VIII made an english protestantism.All reformator made a Jesus equal to himself.This fact is true until today.Protestantism don't make a society and culture.In fact a society and a culture makes a protestantism. The brazilian and latin american reality shows that protestantism itself don't make economical sucess.Here in Brazil, 80% of people who go to a church, go to a protestant (pentecostal) church.Do we have economical sucess with all this protestantism? NO!!!! This same fact happened in many parts of latin America.Bad economic results followed protestantism growing.El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua all are as protestants(pentecostals) as Brazil.All with bad economical results. About 35% of brazilian population are protestants, against about 80% of brazilian maids are protestants.In fact the brazilian protestants are, poorer than the general brazilian population.Also brazilian states with more protestants have bigger crime rates.In fact, more protestants, more crimes in Brazil.The poorest of all religious groups in Brazil are, the protestants(pentecostal).Only protestantism as a medicine for economical, political and cultural troubles is a quackery. Not a single african or latin american country had good economical results after protestantism's growing.At the same time, Spain with less than 1% of his population protestant, is an economical sucess.Italy and Portugal with only about 2% of protestants are also developed countries.  This book is a source with some good things to read.As I wrote up, Max Weber was an honest scholar, not a mad or a bigot.After all, Max Weber was looking to show us the reality, but he only wrote us rooted, in his own times, believes and realities.Every man is a prisioner of his times, friends and realities.And Max Weber wasn't an exception.          
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 This book is nothing but a sales pitch for their newsletter and most of the info is both sales 101 and found freely on the internet. Very disappointed 
 From King's College, London, Efraim Karsh wrote: "Rewriting the history of 1948" is rather misleading, for the essays in question do not so much rewrite history but rather endorse the standard Arab narrative - the one in which Palestinians and other Arabs are on the receiving end of predatory Zionist aggression. Israeli academics and journalists who call themselves the "New Historians" have been pushing this theme since the late 1980s and The War for Palestine adds little new or original to these efforts except that they have invited some sympathetic Arabists and Arab academics, including Edward Said and Rashid Khalidi, to join in their efforts. The contributors whitewash the violent Palestinian attempt to abort the United Nations resolution of November 1947. They downplay the pan-Arab invasion of the newly-established state of Israel in May 1948 (euphemized as the "entry of Palestine" by Arab armies).  There seems to be a general consensus among the book's contributors (and also the publisher) that the Arab narrative needs no serious rethinking. Khalidi speaks for them when he justifies the absence of Palestinian "new historians" to shatter the "myths" on the Arab side: "It is not a myth ... that as a result of [Israeli aggression] the Palestinian people were victims, regardless of what they might have done differently in this situation of formidable difficulty, and of the sins of omission or commission of their leaders."  Most of the contributors are oblivious to the Palestinian version having little to do with reality, as best that can be reconstructed through contemporary accounts and reaffirmed by the millions of records in Israeli and Western archives. While the declassification of those documents constitutes the alleged raison d'tre of the entire genre of Israeli "new history," little of this large body of evidence is tapped by the volume's contributors. Khalidi and Said make no use whatsoever of archival source material and instead engage in sweeping and misconceived assertions about the origin and scope of the Palestinian exodus; others, such as Rogan and Fawaz Gerges, quote the odd document in support of their case.  Avi Shlaim claims to have "overturned the myth of the Arab Goliath" during the 1948 War but there is nothing here from the archives of the Israeli Defense Forces or its pre-state precursor, the Haganah. Benny Morris makes the IDF and Haganah foremost culprits of the Palestinian exodus but has not consulted the archives of these two military organizations.1  1 There is more than meets the eye here. In The War for Palestine, Morris concedes that "when writing The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem 1947-1949 in the mid-1980s, I had no access to the materials in the IDFA [IDF Archive] or the Haganah Archive and precious little to first-hand military materials deposited elsewhere. Nonetheless, the new materials I have seen over the past few years tend to confirm and reinforce the major lines of description and analysis, and the conclusions, in The Birth and in a subsequent volume, 1948 and After, published in 1990." Morris inadvertently reveals the falsehood of "new historian" scholarly pretensions. This group insists on tracing its origin, indeed its raison d'tre, to the opening of Israeli state archives in the late 1980s but now its foremost member admits to having written the single most influential "revisionist" work without the use of the most important archives.  To make matters worse, Morris also admits that "some of the material relating to the [Palestinian exodus] may have been open to researchers in the early and mid-1980s, when The Birth was written, but I was not then aware of its existence." In other words, Morris made no use of the Israeli archives due to his own ignorance. 
 This book is a quick read, though obviously there is more there. How much, exactly, remains in question. Apparently, others have seen more there than I did, but I think this is one of those books that reflects back at you what you are looking for in it. If one wants to find deep meaning or spirituality, one will find it -- extracting meaning from each picture, each word, each pause. But, I don't know. I found 'The Alchemist' to be much more successful in doing a similar thing. I would recommend that one instead.. 
 I gave up reading this tripe after about 60 pages or so. Mr. Hughes may have actually had something valuable to say in this book, but it gets lost amongst all of the socialist ("liberal democratic" and so on) propaganda. The book appears to boil down to "If the government would just give everyone everything, it'd be all right. 
 Have the people who've written such rave reviews of this book actually attempted any of the baking recipes?  My second attempt was as bad as the first, and according to one of the online forums I found, I'm not the only one who's had trouble.  I like the ideas behind many of the book's suggestions but putting them into practice made for very flawed results.  The Banana Bread overflowed the pan and over-browned on the top without ever cooking through.  The Breakfast Pastries were so wet, even after adding more and more flour, that rolling them was a joke.  Then they just dissolved into very flat cookies, but considering the recipe didn't call for any rising agent, what else could be expected?  It's like whoever wrote these recipes never even tested them.  
 The book of Ecclesiastes says: "Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new?  It hath been already of old time, which was before us." The discovery reported in this book is no exception.   The mechanism of generating power law distributions, which Barabasi claimed to have discovered, and named "preferential attachment" has been long known. It first appears in the 1925 paper by Udny Yule, and was investigated by many researchers, most notably in 1955 by Herbert Simon. Yule's work was not unnoticed: it is described, for example, in the college textbook "Introduction to Probability Theory and its Applications" by William Feller.   Though mathematical description of "preferential attachment" appeared only in 20th century, the general idea was expressed long before.  Gospel according to Matthew quotes Jesus as saying "unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance". Similar quotations appear in Luke's and Mark's Gospels.  Barabasi does mention Jesus in his book, but only in the context that Christianity became so successful not because Jesus was son of God, but because Paul craftily spread it through his social networks.  I think that scientists should stop this vanity of vanities and read the Bible 
 its the second time in a row that this happens... so i don't know, amazon just lost a customer, even thou i don't think it will make a difference. 
 rev.peterson is nothing more than a glorified house negro. it,s sickening and embarassing to read the trash that this self-hating blackman has written about his own race. granted the fact that there are black leaders that do exploit their people,so does other leaders of the various races. rev. peterson is a blackman who,s racist towards his own black people. his white southern conservative points of view are definitely ku klux klanistic. black men like peterson do more damage to the black race than any white hate group 
 This book was a disappointment. I bought it because I wanted to read about all the interesting women it claims to be about: Nancy Mitford, Ninon, many others. But it is not about them. It is about the author. Once in awhile she thinks about one of these women, and gives you her thoughts. But she doesn't tell you much about the women. You are left still wanting to know the lives and loves of the famous women of Paris. This book is for people who really want to know what the author thinks about Paris, but I don't know her and I'm not interested in what she thinks, nor when she feels tired, when she wants to lie down, what she eats, when she travels on the Metro, what she says to her friends. I wanted to read about what the charming and fascinating women of Paris said and thought. 
 I was hoping to find new insight to me depression and PMDD, but only found the same old same old.  The book's pollyanna tone while talking about such a serious subject was annoying.  For people not already under care of a physician or who think they are alone, this book could be very helpful, but if you already know something about the role that hormones play in women's mental health you won't find anything new here 
 I'm reviewing this only to average down the overall rating.  The album isn't worth commenting on.  It's that bad 
 The best way of persuading people to accept misinformation is to mix it with some credible information. And so Dore Gold demonstrates with this anti-U.N. screed.   Not an adamant fan of the U.N. myself, I began my reading already familiar with organization's questionable track record, replete with institutional corruption and bureaucratic ineptitude. This book, I hoped, might use the ample failures of the U.N. to issue a fair indictment and perhaps show the way to a more accountable and responsible international body.   What I got instead was propaganda from a former Israeli ambassador with an extremely large political axe to grind. Instead of allowing his conclusions to be dictated by the facts, Gold seems bent on ramming a pre-packaged conclusion down readers' throats -- that the U.N. "fans the flames of chaos" and "supports terrorism and terrorists" -- by selectively cherry-picking anecdotal cases, removing them from their political context, and hoping that most readers know so little about his examples that they will leap blindly from his shaky evidence to his conclusion.    Moreover, his decision to use the hashest possible language in accusing the U.N. of abetting terrorism and spreading chaos seems to reveal a personal hostility to the U.N.  This is, of course, speculation.  But what is not speculation is that the quality of his argument is lacking, perhaps due to the fact that it issues from a visceral reaction rather than a rational analysis.  As already stated, his thesis itself is questionable.  Rather than to accuse the U.N. of worthlessly neglecting to handle international crises in an adequate manner, Gold is adamant that the U.N. actually goes beyond that and *contributes* to the crises, chaos, and terrorism.  As a later reviewer notes, Gold specifically states, "**By not adequately dealing with** the conflict in Bosnia, the UN fueled the Balkan crisis, which eventually spilled over into Kosovo and Macedonia. The failures in Rwanda fueled a massive central African war in which five nations invaded the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where approximately 2.5 million people died in the next four years. And as Iraq flagrantly violated UN resolutions on [WMDs], Libya, Iran, and North Korea ignored the UN's international control system on nuclear weapons [p. 224]" (asterics added).  But this claim is not analagous to "fanning the flames of chaos," which implies contributing to a condition through one's actions, rather than one's inactions.  It is more appropriate to say that the U.N., by "not adquately dealing" with these situations, is simply neglecting to stamp out the fire. Yet Gold is content to let his highly inflammatory accusations stand, as though the U.N. were helping Iraq to hide its weapons programs or were passing out machetes to the Rwandan Hutus.   If his thesis were merely that the U.N. fails to stamp out the flames of chaos, he would receive little serious argument.  He would, however, have to account for his analysis of why the U.N. is ineffective.  Gold's explanation of why the U.N is ineffective is that anti-democratic nations have come to dominate the body as its membership has expanded over the past half-century.  However this theory does not square with the examples he cites to prove the U.N.'s impotence.  For example, he mentions the failure of the U.N. to mobilize peacekeepers in Rwanda in 1994, and the utter impotence of U.N. "observers" who did nothing to stop the slaughter of Bosnian teenagers at Srebrenica in 1995.  Gold is correct that the U.N. was quite ineffective in both situations, but he does not give the true reason why:  the U.N. was acting within the constraints laid down by the Western states that Gold claims are so powerless and outnumbered in today's U.N..  In the case of Rwanda, the United States refused to acknowledge that genocide was even taking place.  In the case of Srebrenica, the UN "peacekeepers" sat idlely by because the Security Council -- dominated by Western nations (the "perm five") -- permitted the use force only to protect the humanitarian convoys whose presence the West was using as an excuse not to intervene militarily.  In both cases, assigning blame to the U.N., while only occasionally and sporadically hinting at the policies of individual Western nations, paints a highly inaccurate picture of the U.N.'s failures.  In these two cases, the inaction of the U.N. at mobilizing blue helmets reflected the wishes of wealthy Western states of the Security Council, not the Pakistans or the Irans of the U.N. General Assembly.  In other words, the West was handicapping the U.N., not the other way around as Gold tries to convince his readers with selective interpretations of history.  How ironic that in making his case against the U.N., Gold mentions historical examples that disconfirm his own thesis, and show why the U.N. has truly come close to irrelevance.  Gold also expends a great deal of intellectual effort into implicating the UN by association. Because officials of the U.N. like Kofi Annon have routinely met with leaders like Mugabe or Castro, readers are to believe that the U.N. is responsible for granting legitimacy to them and, thus propping up their "terroristic" and despotic regimes. Though interacting with leaders does grant them legitimacy, sometimes it is the only viable option.  Western leaders routinely meet with the heads of authoritarian regimes in the interests of peace and stability. What is worse, they often do so for sheer personal political or economic gain.  Gold is strangely silent on the fact that Rumsfeld was shaking hands with the Butcher of Baghdad as he was gassing Kurdish villages with chemical we sold him.  He also neglects to mention that Arch-conservative Richard Nixon visited Mao Tse Dong in 1972. Japan and South Korea, long-time American allies, conduct talks with Kim Jong-Il, charter member of the axis of evil, not because they support his regime, but because they understand that ignoring it is not a realistic option. One wonders why Dore Gold would be annoyed at the UN's disproportionate fixation with Israel's behavior, when he disproportionately criticizes UN diplomats for meeting the very same disreputable figures that Western nations have talked to for years.   This critique ultimately falters because it presupposes a balance of power in the U.N. that does not correspond to the body's structure.  The United Nations is a Western contrivance, depending on and thus controlled by Western regimes.  Nothing can get done without the unanimous approval of the U.K., France, the U.S.A, and Russia (as Gold very well knows, having watched in person many U.S. vetoes of Security Council resolutions condemning Israel).  Gold's constant allusions to obscure details regarding the U.N.'s minimal and loose associations with terrorist groups and authoritarian governments misses this big picture -- the bigger picture which is capable of producing the truly important lessons.  About the only thing that one can take away from this book is that Gold hates the U.N.  One easily realizes this from reading the title of the book, however, and need not even pay twenty dollars.  Of course the U.N. is not the panacea for all of the world's political ills, but this book does not even come within shouting distance of the many, far more complex reasons why. 
 While the reason for buying the book was met (required text book for university study) the condition of the delivered item was very substandard. When the book arrived it was bent and creased and the front cover had been "pushed" in such a way that it was starting to come away from the spine. The book was not secure in its packaging and was able to slide around inside the box scuffing both front and back covers. I would not be happy if this happened to a $20 book let alone a book that cost me AUS $135.   I will seriously consider next time I need a book whether I will get it from Amazon.com . The amount of money I saved was not worth the damage that occured to the item.  Not Happy!!! 
 Readers can easily expect that an anthology of poetry about anarchism might be difficult to assemble given that few identify themselves as anarchists or write about anarchist themes.  Yet somehow Visions of Poesy: An Anthology of 20th Century Anarchist Poetry manages to cobble together 267 pages of versification.  I say "versification" because many of the entries do not qualify as "poetry" by any reasonable definition of the term except for their end-stopped lines.  The tragedy is the anthology's evident lack of poetic values unintentionally reinforces the erroneous notion that anarchism promotes chaos.  Quite the opposite in fact.  Anarchism promotes the order that results from mutual and fully-informed consent.  It opposes imposed order.  Apparently, in their zeal to create the impression that anarchy generates considerable poetic activity, the editors have left the impression that anarchism hasn't produced much poetry that is worthwhile.  A much shorter work retaining the few gems this anthology contains would have benefited this work and anarchism better. 
 I began using Gillette's Mach 3 razor when it first came on the market, and was very happy with it (until recently...) The original Mach 3 would give consistently good, smooth shaves, and worked well for about six or seven times until it dulled and began to give rough shaves. That was an excellent product. However, with the introduction of the new Fusion razor, the Mach 3 suddenly became much less effective and the shaves I was getting were much rougher.   I had heard about the Fusion and decided to try it instead, figuring may that Gillette was trying to "migrate" its users towards the Fusion by downgrading their reliable old product, putting all their new design juice behind the newer model. I was shocked by what a shoddy, difficult product the Fusion razor turned out to be. I went from getting several good shaves per razor to, well... none. I'm lucky with the Fusion to get two decent shaves per cartridge -- usually it roughs my skin up on the very first pass, and it doesn't cut my beard back right to the skin the way the Mach 3 used to.   What's the deal? Did Gillette decide they no longer wanted to provide a quality product? That they'd rather have customers have to buy a new razor right away, rather than have us use the same cartridge a few times before needing to buy another one? If so, that marks a huge change in their corporate policy, from giving us a quality product to basically shoving customers around and trying to rip us off. I know they *can* make a great razor -- they used to -- but if Gillette has decided to stop doing a good job, then forget it. So much for my customer loyalty. I'll either switch brands or stop shaving until there's another razor on the market that provides comparable quality to the old Mach 3 
 I bought this book for two reasons - one because it's on a list of required reading for a doula certification I'm currently working on and two because of all the great reviews on here.  I can't say I was very impressed with the book overall though.  There are parts that are pretty good - I liked the information on water births and I do like that overall the book it very pro-birth and pro-natural pain relief, etc. etc.  However it also comes across as very biased to me and anti-men.  And the information on alcohol was just disturbing and wrong.  I was also very disturbed when I read the section on diapering where she compared cloth to disposables - she states that women who use cloth change their babies less often and that therefore using disposables is better for the baby.  This is such an absurd statement and shows that the author not only has no experience in using cloth diapers but obviously didn't even bother to talk to anyone that does.  It's impossible to leave a child in a cloth diaper as long as one can in a disposable!!  Independent research studies have shown that cloth diapers get changed on average 2 to 3 times MORE often then disposables.  That section was so off-base that it made me wonder about the rest of the content 
 The book is narated in a rather monotone, unethusiastic manner. It seems to be filled with Colin just narrating a chronological list of things he did with no insight into what these things meant or why he did them. 
 If you are interested in how food fits in with your life's purpose, then this book might be for you. This book suggests that you should "be mindful more not of the body for the body's sake, but of the body that the temple of the living God may be the better channel for manifesting the spritual truths." Many foods are mentioned regarding their inclusion or exclusion in your diet, but you're expected to take it all on faith since the book does not reference any studies, scientific or otherwise. The book also recommends to avoid microwave ovens for cooking but mentions no reason! Conventional ovens are OK. It also suggests you never eat raw apples. Basically, it's a bunch of advice on how to eat and live without any scientific backing. If you want modern advice backed by science, then try something else like Superfoods RX 
 I bought this book based on backcover info. What a disappointment. It's not just that it is poorly written and unimaginative. Unless you are into sleazily written sex and gore, you won't find much to hold your interest. There is nothing new here. Just tired, sorry, second rate prose, thinly drawn characters in a porno-lite storyline. Save your money 
 I had a hard time finishing this book. The characters were all created nicely, but the book bored me, the end was just too bland, nothing shocking, and no resolution for the reader. I won't read any more of his books. 
 I wasted my money on this book before I read John Sarno, M.D.'s book "Healing Back Pain".  Well, it turns out that Sciatica is clearly part of TMS, which is what I have.  Look up the Sarno book here at amazon, and read the reviews.  The Sarno book has helped hundreds of people be free of both back AND SCIATIC pain.  I am not yet 100% pain free, but I am living an unrestricted, active life without fear.  Don't just treat the symptoms -- read Sarno's book and be cured!!!! 
 Pretty OK coffee. Nothing special, but I suppose its a fair deal for the price. We picked up the pack of 3 as an emergency stash, and it has worked well for that, but its not my caffeine deliver system of choice ;-) Of course, my coffee of choice is over three times the cost of this stuff, so the comparison is not very fair 
 The massage portion of this heating pad is no more a massager than the vibrate on a cell phone.  There is only 1 heat setting, which is OK, but it's a bit hot for only one setting.  It's like the High setting on my 3 setting hot pad 
 This book struck me as pretty dishonest on the part of the author.  It is never clear that she actually told Fisher that she was writing a book about her.  Yet, even worse is how several vignettes set up Fisher in order to expose to the reader Fisher's flawed personality but the author so often turns a blind eye to her own behavior and motivations that her scenarios can't be trusted.  For instance, the author makes a big point of discussing Fisher's great command of the backhanded compliment. But at least one of the examples the author uses to show this is not a backhanded compliment at all but a straight forward compliment.   If Fisher was so difficult, why did the author keep going back for more?  I don't think that Fisher was a saint but I also don't believe that the author was without a lot of ambition of her own. Hence her protracted relationship with this famous writer for her own use.   I know that famous people are often used by others -- usually when the famous people have gotten old and are lonely.  But it is dispiriting to see it in action.   
 A series of quick arm movements rather than a slow concentrated effort that would actually result in sexy arms 
 This is a Grilling Cookbook. Not a book about grilling for dummies. I had never grilled before and this book goes off about sauces and marinades, when I just wanted to start by putting a slab of meat or a hot dog on the grill. Needless to say, I was lost and confused before I got the gas connected (which it doesn't help you with, either BTW).  It was totally useless for me 
 I was really looking forward to this single expecting more of the infectious dance beat of the original. Instead, all I can do is yawn at these typical trancy and uninspiring Erasurish tunes.  "Electric Blue" A+, "Crazy" single - D.  The only reason to pick this up is for the video in my humble opinion 
 The bedlams that greet the current Republican Administration each morning for USA `involvement in Iraq' have actually relegated this DVD to second-rate. It is obvious that the producers of this so called `Documentary' are more likely to be fractious to Mr. Bush in particular than accommodating to the American public at large. It is also obvious that Mr Bush is not the type of person to succumb to self-pity. Mr Moore must be happier receiving ready cash from the other camp though.  In the meantime I can still see very long queues moving slowly waiting for the full truth behind 9/11 to unfold.   
 This book was very disappointing for me. I've heard of Dr. De Bono and expected much more than what he offers in this book. It's bascially an elementary book about common sense divided into different segments (hats). I would not recommend this book 
 I am not sure why this book was written, except maybe, the author wanted to add another title to his published works. This book is basically comprised of briefs from various chapters of the author's two previous books (which were very good, by the way). If you have read his two previous books and/or you are a seasoned manager, the book is repetetive and boring. The author gives many examples of real life scenarios but the stories go on and on for pages. A good book to read if you can't fall aslee 
 Ethan Frome paints a vivid portrait of the beauty that is wintertime New England. Unfortunately, that's about all it does right. I was surprised to find the lack of both interesting and sympathetic characters in a novel that appears to be a character study.  Ethan Frome, the protagonist, is selfish and cruel toward his wife's illness. At times I despised him more than any character due to his extreme self-centeredness. In fact, his only characteristic that I can almost relate to, a repressed intellectualism, is barely even mentioned.  Mattie Silver, Ethan's object of desire, is an underdeveloped character in the most extreme sense of the phrase. It is unclear what her motives and feelings are even by the end of the story. However, this underdevelopment may have been for the best. The little that we are told about Mattie only adds to the disenchanting strangeness and sloppiness of the book. Most of the time, she comes off at immature and thoughtless.  Zeena, the supposed antagonist, is actually the easiest character to feel for. But don't get me wrong, she's unlikable just like the rest of the characters.  Overall, I suggest you avoid this book if at all possible. It's a loppy book with no real purpose or message. 
 Of course Mr. Press views the abortion industry as an honorable profession.  This book is an extremely biased justification of a horrible "procedure".  I actually couldn't even finish the book 
 I have almost all the recordings of Neil Diamond since the early 70's and to listen to this is does a poor service to the artist's career as a performer. The audio remastering is poor, the musical arrangements are even worse. Even though this is supposed to be live, make no mistake this is no "Live at the Greek" or "Hot August Night" this sounds more like elevator music. If you are an enthusiast of Neil Diamond's music and passionate performance don't dissapoint yourself with this recording 
 Not bad, but contains some errors. For example on page 29 thedescription of Radial and Ulnar loops is incorrect. You can'tdifferentiate between the two types unless you know which hand theycome from 
 Little or few new bits of info concerning ways to reduce the severity of PMS related symptoms. I don't recommend buying this book without first flipping through it in person to see if it has specific info that you are looking for. 
 The play goes along very similar lines as that of the shakespear play  measure for measure as both show selfabsorbtion is a paramount factor  though it does seem like a rewrite is does has its own high points  especially Mosca a very funny character 
 This "book" by Cram101 comprises 55 pages that list terms with their definitions. There are no "outlines" as described. Half of the pages are blank, presumably for students' notes. It is not clear how Cram101 chose the terms to define because most of them are not relevant to Research Methods. In addition, many of the definitions provided are not applicable to Research Methods. For example, the term "regression" is defined as a return to an earlier stage of development, when in the context of Research Methods "regression" refers to a statistical concept. There are countless similar examples of terms that are not defined according to the correct Research Methods definition. Anyone who uses this Cram101 book as their main resource will likely flunk their Research Methods course. In addition, the Cram101 (misleading) advertising suggests that Zechmeister, Zechmeister, and Shaughnessy are the authors of the Cram101 book.  These authors wrote the Research Methods in Psychology text (published by McGraw-Hill) which the Cram101 book is said to "accompany," but these authors and publisher have nothing to do with the Cram101 book and do not endorse it 
 This book came out at the same time that Judith Miller was doing the incredibly bad reporting for the NYTimes that lead the US into the Iraq War. Much of her reporting on WMD spurred interest in her book and increased its sales. I wonder how much her incredibly bad reporting that the Times has now repudiated as false and misleading can be credited to unconscious credulousness centered on the knowledge that more WMD fear would increase her book sales 
 Oh, dear. Le Carre is, or was earlier in his career, a brilliant writer.   I have read and reread a number of Le Carre books lately and what is clear to me is that the quality of his novels has deteriorated over the years, as one might expect, I suppose. Single and Single reads like something written to fill out a publishing contract for a certain number of books.  The plots meanders and is hard to follow. You may think that this is par for the course in the novels of Le Carre, but all I can say is that his better works like Spy Who Came In and Honourable Schoolboy have elements of this trickiness, but it is not overdone.  There is a certain tendency in modern English novelists--I'm thinking of people like Martin Amis--to give the reader a hard time, and in his later books Le Carre seems to be increasingly of the school of letting the reader try to figure out on his own what is going on in the book. My interpretation is that this is due to lazy writing, and the author losing sight of the reader. Others may disagree.  In earlier novels Le Carre leaned a great deal on what appeared to be inside knowledge of the espioniage business. Well, he had me convinced, anyway. Once he gets away from that territory, it seems to me that he is much more inauthentic.  My guess is that the character of Tiger Single is somewhat based on Le Carre's own father, who was something of a jet-set conman.  The book has plently of brilliantly witty  dialog, very much a Le Carre specialty, and passages of superb descriptive writing, so all is not lost, but I would only recommend it for the diehard Le Carre fan who has read everything else and has a lot of time on his/her hands 
 I've seen much better photos/articles on Dylan and would not suggest this particular work. I will be selling my copy in the used section.  
 A better title of this book might be "Nothing Interesting to Write About".  This book was a total disappointment.  All the people the author meets and writes about are oafish, selfish and/or unlikeable, including the man she takes as a lover, as well as being thoroughly boring.  The one exception is her neighbor Lupe, however her sad and hopeless situation is common refrain in any poor area of any country.  Too many children, not enough money.  I will say that her descriptions of travel, food and medical care in Mexico have convinced me it is not someplace I ever care to travel to 
 Not impressed.  Purchased due to Jerry Douglass appearance.  Wouldn't even know he was on it.  Bought with Fiddler's Green.  Now that is a nice product, very nice.  Jerry is on it as well, w/Stuart Duncan 
 I found this book to be very biased.  I am Christian, my husband is Jewish and we are raising our children Jewish.  If you are considering converting to the Jewish faith, then you'll find this book supportive and it might work for you.  However, don't be misled into thinking it's a book for interfaith families.  This book left me hurt, more confused and even a little angry.  I do NOT recommend it 
 I started Hegel's 814 page Phenomenology of Mind 18 months ago.  I finished it a week ago.  I turn to the back pages where my notes would be to find I made none.  If anyone other than me ever tells you he read this opaque monstrosity, this Finnigans' Wake of philosophy, he is almost certainly lying.  I dog-eared the bottom of a few pages, which is my way of signaling that there is something there which may be interesting but not succinctly quotable.  Rereading those pages in preparation for the fulfillment of my promise, I still find little to distill.    From page pages 399-401: "If we put both sides of the universal ordinance over against one another and consider them, we see that this later universality has for its content restless individuality, which regards opinion or mere individualism as law, the real as unreal, and the unreal as real.  That universality is, however, at the same time the side of realization of the ordinance, for to it belongs the independent self-existence (Fursichseyn) of individuality.  The other side is the universal in the sense of stable passive essence; but, for that very reason, the absolutely non-existent, but still not an actual reality, and can itself only become actual by canceling the individuality, that has presumed to claim actuality.  This type of consciousness, which becomes aware of  itself in the law; which finds itself in what is inherently true and good not as mere individual, but only as essentially real; and which knows individuality to be what is perverted and perverting, and hence feels bound to surrender and sacrifice individualism of consciousness - this type of consciousness is Virtue."   ...   "The mood of moral sentimentalism is reduced to confusion and contradiction: but the subjective individualism in which it is rooted is not yet eradicated.  Individualism now takes refuge in another attitude which claims to do greater justice to the inherent universality of rational self-realization....  The World's course is this to owe its goodness to the efforts of the individual.  A struggle ensues, for the situation is contradictory; and the issue of the struggle goes to prove that the individual is not the fons et origo boni, that goodness does not await his efforts, and that in fact the course of the world is at heart good; the soul of the world is righteous.   "The attitude analyzed here is that of abstract moral idealism, the mood of moral strenuousness, the mood that constantly seeks the improvement and perfectibility of mankind.  It is found in many forms, but particularly wherever there is any strong enmity between the "ideal" life and the "life of the world".   A mere 179 pages later I found this gem:   "As everything is useful for man, man is likewise useful too, and his characteristic function consists in making himself a member of the human herd, of use for the common good, and serviceable to all.  The extent to which he looks after his own interests is the measure with which he must also serve the purpose of others, and so far as he serves their turn, he is taking care of himself: the one hand washes the other.  But wherever he finds himself there he is in his right place; he makes use of others and is himself made use of.   "Different things are serviceable to one another in different ways.  All things, however, have this reciprocity of utility by their very nature, by being related to the Absolute in the two fold manner, the one positive, whereby they have a being all their own, the other negative, and thereby exist for others.  The relation to Absolute Being, or Religion, is therefore of all forms of profitableness the most supremely profitable. . .   "Belief, of course, finds this positive outcome of enlightenment as much an abomination as its negative attitude towards belief.  This enlightened insight into absolute Being, that sees nothing in it but just absolute Being, the etre supremen, the great Void - this intention to find that everything in its immediate existence is inherently real (ansich) or good, and finally to find the relation of the individual conscious entity to the Absolute Being, Religion, exhaustively summed up in the conception of profitableness - all this is for belief utterly and simply revolting.  This special and peculiar wisdom of enlightenment necessarily seems at the same time to the believing mind to be sheer insipidity and the confession of insipidity; because it consists in knowing nothing of absolute Being, or, what amounts to the same thing, in knowing this entirely accurate platitude regarding it - that it is merely absolute Being, and, again, in knowing nothing but finitude, taking this, moreover, to be the truth, and thinking this knowledge about finitude as the truth to be the highest knowledge attainable."   the juice not worth the squeez 
 The title of this book caught my attention, and the first couple of chapters made sense. However, I found that most of the advice offered boils down to imposing limits with the knowledged that teens are going to do whatever they want. His general approach seems to be for parents to accept what their children do instead of insisting on good behavior. His dialog is engaging and even funny at times. He doesn't offer much hope or constructive problem solving though. The cursing in the book was offensive to me as well, and that type of language would never be tolerated in our home. Acceptance of it as inevitable is unacceptable to me. 
 The E550 is a good camera and this lens does do a good job of zooming in on the subject but due to the way the camera and lens are designed, you must have the camera's zoom fully extended in order to use this tele lens.  So this means if the subject is moving around a lot, such as my daughter playing soccer, you will miss the shots where the action has moved to close to you because you can't zoom out.  As long as the action remains at some distance to you than this zoom lens is useful.   I unfortunately have too many ruined shots because the action moved too close and their heads get cut off, etc.  Another negative is that the viewfinder doesn't show the zoomed in image, you must use the lcd screen to frame a shot, which can be difficult in bright sunlight 
 From the first pages inaccuracies plague this rather hollywoodesque book. Not much more to say. It is sad to see so many pages to bring so little new information on a subject that deserves better, more objective work. Others have written shorter, less amibitious, more informative stories. Hmong history as a part of the Lao and the Indochinese peninsula history can only benefit from serious research. And too bad if it does not fit the fantasies of some 
 I came across McCarry after reading Mark Steyn's claim that he was another real ex-spook novelist and better than LeCarre.  Well, lots of things are better than recent LeCarre, but at least to judge by this book McCarry is a journeyman writer who doesn't come close to comparing to LeCarre in his prime.    Yes, his intelligence background lends surface realism to his descriptions of a hunt from one end of the world to the other-- the part set in a remote corner of China where Kafka meets Genghis Khan is especially convincing and amusing.  But too much of this covers standard airport novel stuff-- the old (by now very old) Nazi in South America, the way-too-much-to-swallow-mystery (which covers all the ground from ancient Judea to Osama bin Laden-- by way of Heydrich's Czechoslovakia!), the band of retirees assembled to solve it all who fall somewhere between Doc Savage's Fantastic Five and one of those aging-actor-work-program movies like The Wild Geese.  The real point is that McCarry is telling a plot-- a whopper of one-- and can only tell it by sending his main character from one part of the world to the next where, conveniently, someone who we are told will tell him nothing promptly tells him everything.  LeCarre, on the other hand, uses the dilemmas of spying to explore character.  The mystery in Tinker, Tailor could hardly be smaller (one's a mole, which one is it?) yet it's vitally involving.  The mystery in Old Boys could hardly be bigger yet it's-- oh, that old thing again.  Whatever 
 My daughter purchased this book for me about 6 months ago. I know Dr. Weil is an educated man, but I'm sorry. I just cannot take seriously a man this overweight lecturing on optimum health. Look at the size of this guy. Either he is slipping in triple cheeseburgers and double malteds when no one is looking, or salmon and seaweed are VERY fattening. I would say its probably the former. I kept looking for "after" photos but, alas, there are none. This is how he looks 
 I have had plenty of pairs of Doc's but these are not the best for me........... they are not comfy and they tend to be a little tough to break in. As soon as I put them on and took ONE STEP ---- there right across the top of the shoe is a nice big crease......... It does not look nice and I am "ticked" about that...........plus I didnt expect the laces to have green and maroon colors mixed into the brown laces...... it looks dorky!  Plus I have a manufacturing flaw in them.  Inside the heel the seam isnt quite right and it rubs my skin and hurts like heck!   Hopefully the next model I get isnt like thses or they are going back....... Putting up with these for now....... 
 I have read all of this author's books that are out in paperback, and have been giving him the benefit of the doubt up to now in regard to him getting his facts wrong on each item that I might happen to have any personal knowledge about. He seems to always get his facts wrong when talking of airplanes. In the River of Ruin he has the pilot flying a helicopter from the left side seat. In others he has 737s making transocean flights, and people falling 10 feet to the ground from a 757 or 767 on the ground(its more like 20 or more feet). A helicopter flight from one city in Peru to another is something like four hours to him, when in actuality its about an hour and a half TRAIN ride. In River of Ruin he has one player in a Henderson microprene one half millimeter body suit. Henderson is merely a brand name with no significance. He means a NEOPRENE WET suit. In every area the author writes about with which I'm familar, he doesn't get his facts right, so, such all of his errors are very easily researched, I can only assume he simply is too lasy and doesn't want to bother to get his facts correct. I assume this holds true concerning the guns, etc. also. I like to think that although I may be reading a work of fiction regarding the story line, the basic items in it are true, or at least we're told by the author that he made them up. Not so here.He needs to do his research if he's going to be a real writer 
 The one star I gave this schlock is for the readability of the prose. At least that has substance.  As for the actual content . . . Take Marxist revolutionary theory, give it a plot and a timeline, and you have this book. The author actually used the word "bourgeoisie" as a prosaic tool. Bourgeoisie? Please.  Granted it was written some 15 years ago, before the events of 1989-90 played themselves out.  Still, the fact that this howler wasn't immediately recalled en masse is illustrative.  Don't waste your money 
 This is one of those CD's that are good for one song.  "Remind Me" from the Geico Caveman commercial where he is in the airport and sees his poster on the wall.  It is clear that Royksopp has done much better with their newest CD "The Understanding" it has at least 3 good songs.  I like Royksopp when they actually create music instead of certain cacophonous filler material. "Remind Me", "Only This Moment", "What Else Is There?", and "49 Percent" are their best works, 3 of which are found on the CD "The Understanding". They are pretty good, but if they really want to impress, they should continue writing songs like "Only This Moment" and "What Else Is There?". "Remind Me" is cool, but I was disappointed with the rest of the boring stuff on the "Melody A.M." CD 
 The material this book presents is very important for an engineer. The presentation of the material is very bad. It is very difficult for a student to follow. The mathematical equations are written in unaccaptable form. They are not even properly displayed. Proofs of equations and deriviation of equations do not follow an organized manner. This book is good for peaople that have prior knowledge of the material, and not for students 
 The author spends nearly half the book with criticsm of performance measurement, a technique currently practiced by the vast majority of fortune 500 companies. He then sets up a "model" for assessing performance measurement techniques and uses this to "prove" that such techniques must fail, are totally useless and have adverse impacts on any organization deploying them. He then indicates that he alone knows what's best (apparently the rest of us are fools). Having poured scorn on his competition, he then puts forward the technique of Catalytic Coaching but of course fails to subject it to the same model that he used in his diatribe against performance measurement. The truth, as any management professional well knows, is that if you don't measure it, you can't manage it! Avoiding the issue does not resolve it. This book is unscientific nonsense dressed up in the language of science in order to deceive the reader.  
 I'm appalled at this marketing.  I've read every book Mr. Woods has written and have enjoyed them all.  This type of marketing should not be allowed. It would have been simple to make the Cover obvious as to contents.  For those who have not read the novels it's a good deal, otherwise very disappointing advertising 
 Perhaps I should forgive Thompson his tender age for the grievous philosophic error he commits as soon as he puts pen to paper, to wit, neither is functional programming new nor is Haskell its foremost exemplar. (Curiously, one Dr. Haskell was my orthodontist when I was a little boy, which rang a soft little bell deep in my cerebrum.) As far as functional programming is concerned, LISP is the way, the truth, and the light. Haskell may do more by way of notational "syntactic sugar" than LISP--with certainty, it can be hard to express yourself graphically when limited to concretely mathematically grounded notations [LISP = L(ots) of I(ncredibly) S(tupid) P(arentheses)]. Notwithstanding, I contend that the more difficult exercises that Thompson introduces--putatively as a vehicle for showcasing the brilliance of Haskell--point in quite the opposite direction. For LISP allows, nay encourages, parallel top-down/bottom-up development whereby you carefully extend the language to create, shall we say, a meta-4GL atop which to code your application, whereas Haskell will have none of this: it is a run-of-the-mill 3GL with some concepts and quirks that may be unfamiliar to the less sophisticated programmer, nor less, nor more. Nay, nay, I speedily toss Haskell into the basket that houses nearly every new language that comes down the pike: a few new tidbits perhaps; a more tersely expressed concept perchance; but nothing new to the sophisticate whose grasp of computer language (not to mention compuer languageS) extends beyond the ALGOL family (and, by extension, its somewhat more capable analogues, e.g., C, Java) and the handier "scripting" languages (e.g., Python, Ruby, Perl) that attempt to marry some OO concepts into what is ultimately a procedural substrate. Kids, first learn what a computer system is; learn assembly language on six or seven processors and how it relates to their bus architecture, I/O interface (e.g., whether DMA or "programmed" [a la the R6502: an admittedly poor term]) and microinstruction decoding; study LISP, APL, FORTRAN 66, SNOBOL, and other vehicles that enable you to explore the range of man's machinewise thinking beyond simple-minded von Neumann and MIX models that calculate the contents of address 1 based upon the contents of address 2; THEN, and only then, read and comment upon a Haskell text 
 Book offers meaningless tasks to deliver. Too much time reading, and too much time wasted if applied. 
 I love this book until I came across a part where Mary Anne talks to Dawn about her parents' divorce. MA said "So what if your parents are divorced? There's nothing WRONG with it." I was furious! YES there is something wrong with it! Divorce is against God's law, and I feel extremely strong about this. I cannot believe the message Ann M. Martin is sending to readers!  
      Since we really don't have much to go on as far as factual historical accounts of Alexander, we can only surmise our image of him from what little there is written about him.  We know a lot about what he accomplished because the results are evident, but trying to put together a portrait of his "true" character and nature is at best just hypothetcal conjecture.  No one knows who Alexander really was as a person. Most people don't even know themselves.       Does this movie convey Alexander as he really was or just some Hollywood director's personal idea that has been gleaned from rehashed biograpies of Alexander.  From the ridiculous Harold Lamb version to the account of Arrian to the more scholarly Robin Lane Fox's "Alexander the Great" there isn't much that can be added to what scant information we have.  Certainly the life of Alexander is a msystery since there is virtualy nothing know about it, and what little is know wasn't even included in the film.       For example, his leading the cavalry charge at the "Battle of Chaeronea" which resulted in Philip's hegemony of Greece wasn't ever mentioned in the movie.  Instead, sensual garbage including his mother's fetish with snakes and her completely embellished influence on him, in the usual Hollywood manner, is the kind of rubbish that is fostered upon the viewer.         Obviously, his mother had and influence on him as all mothers have an influence on their children, but "give me a break".  This kind of theatrical emoting is a waste of screen time which should have been spent on showing us what Alexander did in his life, which is what made him "The Great".         Almost all of the significant things he did are not even mentioned or so quickly glossed over that they are meaningless.  And a lot of what is mentioned isn't even correct.  And many of the conclusions made by the director are purely guesswork, and bad guess work at that.  Another example of something significant left out of the movie in favor of snake slithering: At the age 16 Alexander was intrusted with the regency of Macedonia while Philip was sieging Perinthos and Byzantium in eastern Thrace.  While his father was gone, the Maedi, a Thracian tribe, revolted.  Alexander led a campaign against them, succeeded, and established a new colony at Maedi and named it Alexandros.  He was also allowed to refered to as a "man" after that, because he had killed an enemy in hand-to-hand combat, and that was the only way a Macadonian could be considered a "man".       At that time Alexander was able to start having an insight and true understanding of his father which could have only been attained from the battle field.  It was possible to comprehend his father's harsh, disciplined life which included drinking, hunting, and loving.        The rest of Alexander's life was just as remarkable as his exploit in suppressing the uprising at Maedi, but the movie, in my opinion, just doesn't do justice to Alexander.  A man who did what he did and in such a short time deserves better.  And quite frankly, except for the poorly done battle scenes, I've seen more action in "Road Runner" cartoons.  One final example which wasn't even hinted at in the movie:  On his march back "home", he encountered the "Mallians", a fierce and warring nation.  An assault was made on their major stronghold, and the men with the scaling ladders were late arriving.  Alexander, with his impatience to storm the fortress, grabbed a ladder from the first ladder bearer to arrive and personally placed it against the wall and climbed up.  Three othr men followed him up the ladder and made the top with him.  The men on the ground scrambled to follow Alexander, and their combined weight broke the ladder, and the king and the three soldiers were stranded on top of the battlements.  The men on the ground pleaded for him to jump back down into their arms and safety, but alexander jumped into the fort and attacked.  He received a serious chest wound but not before dispatching several of the Mallians.  The army broke into the stronghold, and thinking Alexander dead, killed everyone there.  That's the kind of man that this movie should have been telling the story of, not some jickjack Jollie snake juggling mishmash of psyhological meanderings that were a complete bore.       Alexander was a man of action, a great leader and general, a genius of military stratagey and tactics, a philosopher, muscian, had schooling in botany, astronomy, medicine, geography, and other various disciplines and he was a hero in the "grand tradition".  Maybe Peter Jackson should make a  movie about Alexander.  I'm sure he could get it "right".                        
 Lets be for real. What is good charlotte doing? Making a bad name for Punk. Whenever I tell Some one i like Punk, I have to hear....oh you like that good charlotte, you like that blink 182. NO I dont I listen to real punk, Bands Like the dead Kennedy's.  But it's not only punk being destroyed, other genras are too.   Just look at hip hop. I listen to real, talented hip hop groups or rappers such as public enemy, Big L, Rakim, Wu tang, but If I tell some one i like it i have to hear... Oh you like 50 cent, you like mike jones ect ect.  What you have to do is get this pop mtv crap outta hear. No matter what genra it is....MTV has a fake commercial side to destroy it.  Matter of fact, a real punk band wouldnt be all over MTV, they wouldn't have a corny gimmic of wearing piercings all over them, or running around naked (blink 182).  BOYCOTT ALL THIS POP GARBAGE, wheather it's pop-hip hop, pop-punk, pop-rock, whatever.  Good Charlotte is the same type of music as 50 cent. THEY ARE BOTH POP. end of story 
 In this classical Romeo and Juliet tale, Tita (Lumi Cavazos) and Pedro (Hunky-Marco Leonardi) seem destined to marry until her evil-hearted mother Elena (Regina Torne), forbids it because of some silly family tradition. Tita, the youngest, is to take care of Elena until she dies. So, she marries Pedro off to her daughter Rosaura(Yareli Arizmendi). Pedro's reasoning is that he can be near Tita but it presents a host of problems. Tragedies beset this family as well. The lovers though, overcome all of it and after Rosaura's death--finally have the chance to express their love for each other. But, how tragic--so enters FATE. This is a foreign film with English subtitles. And, this review refers to the 105 minute DVD. At first I gave it two stars, but it's perhaps a four star movie for drama and effects. But, Beware of Nudity 
 This is an example of a book written on a very important subject that cannot fill the number of pages the publisher required.  Fraser's previous books on Camera RAW were very good.  This one is labored and has way too many chapters that just repeat the same things over and over again.  You keep hoping that he will get to the really important stuff, but he never really does.  Look this subject up on-line, you will find much better information in a more concise presentation 
 I have a university maths degree and found the book very obvious and drawn out for the first few chapters. In spite of this I looked forward to what was going to be explained later. Suddenly from a very simple and easy to understand explanation on the EMH he starts to use mathematics in his equations that I had a lot of difficulty following. There was very little or no explanation of how these equations were arrived at and a lot of mathematics and statisics is assumed. This book does not apply the theory in ny meaningful way to the markets let alone the capital markets in my opinion. I found that I took very little away from this book and would not recommend it to anyone who has basic mathematics like myself or is looking for some deeper insight into the markets. I would hate to have Mr Peters as a teacher based on his book 
 I've had one of these for 3 years now, and it's spent the last few months gathering dust. Why? Because the case design - while nice-looking - does not allow for proper air circulation or ventilation of the drive, so that it runs much hotter internally than it ought to. I replaced the drive twice - each one lasted 6-9 months before it failed. I can't think of any reason for this other than heat. If I do use the case again, I'll run it without the stylish cover 
 This story should have and COULD HAVE been really good. It presents a great concept, but the story is just so poorly crafted. It is VERY sexist, the prose is stiff, and the plot is dull. I will concede that it was interesting at times; it kept me reading, but I really didn't get much out of it. I can only praise Heinlein for including the "intelligent conversation" which takes place after the press conference, where there is a great explantion on why the English language is so difficult to learn. The whole story is just very odd. Do read it though. It's a title to read if you wish to be considered "well read." Despite its faults, Valentine Michael Smith will be a character in literature that will never be forgotten, just as we will never forget Atticus from "To Kill A Mockingbird." 
 Interesting premise, but the plot is like swiss cheese.  This review will just be a point by point of all the major things that I found so implausable that I couldn't just suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride. Spoilers alert.  I wasn't able to make the leap to believing Sarah's sudden turn towards malicious opportunism as soon as she saw the cash. When questioned about what she would do if she found some hypothetical millions, she insists with chirpy disinterest that she would certainly turn it in. Just one scene of her looking longingly at a brochure for a holiday she couldn't afford would have established some repressed dissatisfation with her life situation, but her general demeanor seemed to suggest not only comfort, but satisfaction.  Why did Hank decide he would burn the money instead of return it if it turned out someone legitimately owned it? Surely it wouldn't be too difficult to anonymously return it without being implicated in it's disappearance. The first murder, after the old guy regained consciousness, why did Hank not try to negotiate with or threaten the old guy to keep quiet about his brother assaulting him? For Hank, finishing the job his brother started didn't seem like an absolute last resort, it seemed like he took the murder lightly.  When Hank got home apparently he volunteered information to his wife about what he'd just done. What? Like he knew she'd be understanding about it or something? Hi honey, I'm home, by the way I just killed a man to protect the money. Wtf? When Jacob shot Lou to protect Hank, why didn't Hank just give the tape back before it got to that point?  The shotgun impact on Lou's wife was cartoonishly ridiculous, sending her flying three feet into the air when the blast didn't even hit her at an upward trajectory.  And the final ridiculous flaw. Jacob taking the fake FBI agent's gun, and instead of just shooting himself before his brother had time to react, he hands it to his brother, and charges him with the responsibility of killing him, setting up the final emotional crescendo of the film. Supposedly the explanation was that it wouldn't look like the fake FBI agent shot Jacob if the shot was fired at point blank range, but why not? Why couldn't forensic investigators at the scene believe an altercation could have transpired where Jacob charged at the gunman from behind when he was about to shoot the sheriff, wrestled with him, and wound up taking a point blank shot to the head? It really makes no sense.  One inspiredly believable moment I will give them film credit for is Hank's difficulty in finding the bullets in the sheriff's office and loading the gun. A lazier writer would have just had him find the gun loaded. If the major plot developments were fleshed out in more detail to be made believable this could have been a great film. As it is, it's a frustratingly flaw-ridden glimpse of what could have been and a waste of time to watch.  
 Reading this book was like drinking warm diet coke--flat and artifically sweet. Really just  a rehash of the Abraham Hicks/Law of Attraction materials, this books  fails to motivate or inspire. Between the plugs for the author's internet program and audio products there is just flat prose.  Even the sample meditation is uninspired.  The law of attraction has been addressed countless times and this book adds nothing to the mix. If you are seeking a thorough understanding of the law of attraction and techniques to assist you in its mastery, you would be better served by works by other authors, including Esther and Jerry Hicks, Lynn Grabhorn, Michael Losier and Joe Vitale. Avoid this tired retread 
 This Skip Spence Oar cd is really bad. To hear other peoples reviews it sounded like the best thing in the world. Its no wonder why this album was a flop when it came out. Thirty five years later it is not any better. 
 No one is going to be fooled by some auspicious Austinite/pseudo-populist who charges $10,000 (ten thousand dollars!) to give sound-bite speeches to elitist effetes just because he claims to be from the 'red' heartland and grew up learning politics at his father's knee 
  I gave this book 2 stars because the first 2 fifths of it were good.The rest stunk.  As more eloquent reviewers have mentioned Galbraith refers to himself and his accomplishments almost as much as he takes cheap shots at Republican administrations. Innuendo, nitpicking minutiae drip from the pages - his rant about the inappropriateness of some administration speech writer (without input from the State Department - oh no!) referring to an "axis of evil" incorrectly because an axis must be a straight line is one example. The pages ooze with Galbraith's liberalism and elitist arrogance as he hypocritically spotlights the arrogance of others.  He writes continuously about himself. He acknowledges he feels the overthrow of Saddam is justified and then complains about the way it was done. All the while acknowledging most people are better off in Iraq today.   He actually has the balls to say that the nuclear developments in N. Korea and Iran are somehow the fault of the invasion of Iraq.   In the acknowledgements it becomes clear that Galbraith is writing homage to his dad who wrote a "little book" called "How to Get Out of Vietnam." He even admits his lecture series was called "How to get out of Iraq."   Armchair Generals and Presidents abound in the printed page. Unless you are looking to reconfirm your own administration-bashing prejudices, I recommend you save your money and check it out of the library; it will ease the pain of your wasted time. 
 While there are a few good tips, I found the book lacking in enough detail to actually use (especially in the makeup section).  Some of the tips on natural solutions for menopause were actually counter to scientific evidence.  Complete waste of my money.  I find myself at a loss for what to do with the book - I don't want to pass it along to anyone else . .  
 While I still feel that Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movie trilogy is the definitive version of the classic novels - if you're Lord of the Rings fan don't bother with this edition.  One - if you feel you MUST purchase this limited edition buy the movies individually - you'll save yourself a bit of cash (stupidly the studio released it with a higher cost to buy the box set which has NOTHING extra compared to buying the movies individually.  Two - the documentaries leave much to be desired and don't let it be believed that these documentaries are entirely composed of unreleased footage - there is plenty of 'encore' presentation of the same tired footage (Astin's shard in the foot a prime example). I don't need to see or know that there was a semi-heated discussion regarding the distribution of walkie-talkies during the production. I would much rather have seen more of the stuff while they set up scenes on the mountainside with the fellowship or at Rivendell or....  Basically - this is New Line looking for a way to pull in a bit more cash - I suspect they're missing the gobs that the movies raked in over the course of three years 
 Chirpy ideas, bad writing.  I feel sorry for the poor saps who get stuck being slaves under this motivational trash.  In your job, to "make their day" is best made by giving them a paycheck, or better yet a raise.  That's why people work.  You have to "be there" otherwise you get fired.  As for "play"?  Heh.  Who feels like "playing" when they feel like they're going to puke when they are force-fed this garbage at the office?  Choose your attitude...yeah.  Most people who work go because they have to.  Their boss chooses their attitude.  "Smile no matter how you feel or your butt hits the sidewalk."  Fish are among the dumbest creatures alive today...near the very bottom of the evolutionary scale and have nothing for brains...hmm...I guess a fish wrote this book 
 Terry Eagleton has later admitted that its a book based on rumors and on actual readings of the philosophers mentioned...i guess that says it all 
 "Heist" is, well, an heist movie like so many others. This one goes completely by the book and is uninspired at all levels. Gene Hackman gives a standart, average performance as the burglar who starts having problems with his mates. This is a "who fools who?" picture, it has some required though predictable twists at the end and the character motivations remain unclear. In fact, the characters themselves remain unclear, since they don`t speak all that much and the dialogue is poor. Acclaimed director David Mamet glues scene after scene with little creativity, so most of them turn to be boring and lifeless. This just seems like a weak episode of some late-night cable b-tv series. Dull, unsurprising and shallow, one to avoid 
 Another attempt to issue the definitive edition of the legendary Bluesbreakers album that falls slightly short of the mark. The mono and stereo mixes on disc 1 are excellently done but simply replicate the single disc issue featuring the same material released a few years ago. This, therefore, sheds no new light on this fertile period of the second British blues boom. Disc 2 features some BBC sessions along with the familiar Immediate and Purdah 45's and half a dozen live tracks, in poor sound quality, that have been available before.   This is a big disappointment and is a missed opportunity which could have been avoided if the compilers had made any attempt to research the easily available archive information from this time. John Mayall himself was known to have kept meticulous records of sessions, gigs, personnel and recording dates and I'm sure would have been more than happy to contribute his knowledge in order to preserve his legacy in the best possible manner.   Anyone expecting to hear more of Clapton's stunning guitar work from this time is in for a big disappointment. Many of the songs from the BBC sessions presented here have nothing more than rhythm guitar low in the mix. This is the case with the first three songs on disc 2 and despite the session date given being after the point where Clapton joined the band, I suspect it was actually recorded earlier with Roger Dean on guitar. The three songs from the October 25th session are from the time when Clapton had taken a sabbatical and had been replaced by Geoff Krivit. The third BBC session featured on the disc includes only two songs out of at least five, and possibly six, which are known to have been recorded with Clapton in the band, one of those missing being a rare live version of the instrumental, Hideaway. This session has been bootlegged in excellent sound quality and so it's omission from this set is inexcusable.   All in all the "Deluxe" edition does nothing to enhance the importance and excitement of this classic album and the poor selection of additional material on disc 2 turns what should have been a worthy project into a complete waste of time and money. Five stars for the original album - 1 star for this reissu 
 I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up. 
 This book struck me because it appears to address a wide issue in depth.  Unfortunately, the introduction only gives a few brief details about the authors of the book, who include mainly interested writers, as far as I can tell.  As a former history major, I have often come across examples of exhaustive research; unfortunately, this book cannot fall under that criterion.  Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln are not trained scholars and their mildly critical perspective leads to some interesting logical jumps.  Unfortunately, the authors will posit a claim with only one source to support their argument.  This sort of specious scholarship allows the writer many freedoms in terms of the conclusions he can come to, because of the lack of acknowledgment of conflicting sources which would heap contrary evidence on his weak claims.  Overall, the book is neither terribly interesting nor well-researched.  This is like if the Da Vinci Code were a restaurant and Holy Blood, Holy Grail were the menu.  It seems appetizing but there isn't any substance or sauce to entertain the taste-buds.  
 I was very surprised to learn that Helen Fremont was able to become a lawyer and knew nothing about the Holocaust. What kind of education did she obtain? How was it possible that she wasn't interested in her parent's history? Even if they were Roman Catholics. Book is full of historical errors (Warsaw was captured within hours, it was safer to be a Pole in the streets a Lvov during the German invasion)  It bothered me that the street names were Misspelled (Owacowa instead of Owocowa, Mariacki Platz insead of Plac Mariacki) The story itself was very interesting. I wish however it was written by her parents. 
 This book was disappointing. The main characters were flat. The reader cannot get to know them or care what happens to them. There are so many secondary characters that it is hard to keep everybody straight.   I also had trouble "getting into" the scene. A good book will draw me in, making me feel like I'm there, participating in it all. I could not get that from this book.   This is supposed to be a Christian book, but God is barely mentioned at all. He doesn't seem to have a place in their lives. It's like He is an after-thought.  I will not read any other books that follow this series. 
 I hadn't heard a few of the songs in a while so naturally it brought back memories. In all I'm glad I purchased the cd. It is a good addition to my ole skool collection. 
 This book for the lack of a better word was cheesy. I read my first Danielle Steel book a few weeks ago (Malice) and was really impressed. I decided to grab another thinking it would be good as well. This book was slow and the brokenhearted story line dragged on forever. On top of that the main character was such a whiney complainer and that I couldn't stand even reading about him. This book was bad and extremely predictable. BIG DISSAPOINTMENT 
 It is bad enough that this is a poor book with no balance, but to require it as a text in post-graduate studies in education almost brings on apoplexy.  It is a secular humanist apoligia for multiculturalism in education.  It is singular in point of view, never straying from the thesis that multiculturalism is good and schools must support it; hardly the sort of reference work for a university level discussion of the issues.  The philosophy behind the book is that people are hardly more or less than those cultural elements which have been socialized into them with little responsibility for their beliefs or actions.  The main text is that every culture is equally valuable in society, forgetting that "society" is essentially American culture with its own priorities.  They go into great detail on the virtues of immigrant cultures and the vices of the American culture, hardly accepting that it has a right to exist as well.  The most difficult aspect of this is the authors' almost laughable inability to get outside of their point of view and treat the issues with something approaching objectivity.  The book is unbearable in its "holier than thou" attitude.  I don't know if this is typical of the ilk but if so, it is hardly a wonder that the multicultural mavens have difficulty selling their point of vie 
 I like the idea of having all 15 books in one combined book. It seemed like it would make for some fun bed time story reading. However, the small print stopped me in my tracks. I don't feel the book is necessarily of poor quality, however, it is a paper back book, something that seems odd for such a weighty novel. My advice, consider whether or not you feel capable of reading 600+ pages (with no illustrations) of 2-column small font print before making this purchase 
 This story should have and COULD HAVE been really good. It presents a great concept, but the story is just so poorly crafted. It is VERY sexist, the prose is stiff, and the plot is dull. I will concede that it was interesting at times; it kept me reading, but I really didn't get much out of it. I can only praise Heinlein for including the "intelligent conversation" which takes place after the press conference, where there is a great explantion on why the English language is so difficult to learn.

Despite its faults, Valentine Michael Smith will be a character in literature that will never be forgotten, just as we will never forget Atticus from "To Kill A Mockingbird." 
 I was urged to finish the book in hopes that the simplistic plot took a sordid twist to shock me at the end. The book lacked thoughtful character development. The protagonist, a seemingly complex character seemed to get by on bartending, and denying himself from the world. Early in the book, Koontz alludes to something in the protagonists past. I waited until page 350 to find out, and was somewhat disappointed that the incident didn't directly provoke the protagonist's current situation...it simply made him an interesting target. Furthermore, along the killing spree clean-up, the protagonist seemed all to comfortable with protecting his innocence, to the point where I was hoping some surprise that he had colluded in the sordid details. Also, early on, the book reveals who the killer is, in such a way that I was sure that Koontz was trying to over-simplify the plot to lead the reader in the wrong direction.  I really wanted to the plot to come full circle. Furthermore, the plot lacked serious suspense when the protagonist encountered the villian. It reminded me of Hannible. The allusions to art, performances, etc. Not really original. The last thing that was overrated were the allusions to Dickenson and Elliot. It was as if a novice writer was trying to display their familiarity with the classics. The references did not really fit into the plot. Perhaps I missed the boat, but I was not at all impressed with my first Koontz read.    
 The shipping was very slow and the product really isn't worth $23 with shipping for an 11 oz jar.  The product goes on like Lubriderm where it feels like you are just smearing water on your skin.  Then it starts to feel a little oily but once you get dressed your skin just feel like you have powder all over skin.  Overall it was just ok but it ended up not being what I expected or wanted.  I was looking for a really good long lasting moisturizer.  
 You can eat when your hungry and stop when you are satisfied and still not lose weight if you are eating mostly the wrong kinds of foods.  It was only when I started eating right(lots of fruits and vegetables and whole grains)that I started losing weight!!!  I also found that when I started eating the fruits and vegetables that I didn't crave the bad things (candy and chips)so much.  
 Just outside Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, is the small township of Kezi, where life revolves around the bus that comes in from Bulawayo and the Thandabantu store, where everything can be bought and where the population gathers on the veranda to discuss the events of life. During the liberation struggle the old men are replaced by soldiers - both male and female- that take a rest here. But it becomes apparent in the book that a lot of these soldiers are quite deranged. One such soldier kills a girl, Thenjiwe, and mutilates her sister, Nonceba. After a long stay in the hospital, where she tries to regain her physical well-being and mental health, Nonceba follows the ex-lover Cephas of her dead sister to Bulawayo, where they live as brother and sister, two people forever wounded by the war of independence.  When written this way the book seems to hold a lot of promise for a very moving book. However, it took me nearly the whole book to get into the story. Yvonne Vera uses a lot of metaphors in which she couples different senses: she describes sounds in visual terms, tastes  she compares to sounds etc and the book is really packed with this. I really had problems understanding what was going on to a point that it actually got me very irritated. However, the end of the book (with the least metaphors) is a very loving description of two hurt people trying to make the most of their lives 
 This cocoa is gritty and has a bitter taste.  The dark chocolate mint is particularly bitter.  We don't care for the chocolate raspberry and chocolate vanilla flavors either.  The chocolate supreme flavor is sweeter and tastier than the other flavors, but the child in our family still remarked that his cocoa "tasted strange".  There are many non-gourmet commercial mixes that are smoother, more palatable and less expensive than this gourmet brand.  We won't buy this cocoa again.  This gift box selection is very handsomely packaged and looks great in holiday gift baskets. But the cocoa fails the taste test.   
 It is now more than a month after I was supposed to receive this book and I have not gotten it yet, what the hell is going on 
 I've been had is all I can say, after reading other reviews I really thought this would be an interesting, exciting movie. Instead, the story is lame, the acting is pretty pathetic and it is so NOT scary or at least gripping. I watched the whole thing as I thought maybe I am missing something, but no there is no twist thats worth mentioning as the whole movie is predictable from beginning to end. Sorry guys, but this is nowhere near, Audition, Tale of two Sisters or even Whispering Corridors 
 I read this book in 2002 way before the Iraq invasion seemed probable.  After reading it (and believing that I was reading thorough reporting) I supported going after the WMD in Iraq.  However, now that we've seen how Judy can manipulate facts and her proven track record with no WMD found in Iraq I strongly suggest you read this book with a skepticism to truthfulness.  Some of the non-Iraq WMD reporting was very interesting and I learned a bit from that, but how do I separate fact from fiction?  As a result of being 100% wrong in her reporting and Judy's recent comments, "the analysts, the experts and the journalists who covered them -- we were all wrong," which is not true (read John MacArthur, Ian Williams and Joby Warrick), I think this book loses its credibility.  You may want to read it just to attempt to discern fact v. fiction 
 After reading a couple of other reviews about the "quality" of transfer on this dvd, I decided I wanted this in my collection. What I THOUGHT would be good or atleast a decent enough picture quiality, I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED.THE QUALITY OF TRANSFER OF THE PICTURE IS HORRIBLE!!! A great movie a total real diaster flick in picture quality. Non anamorphic, deffintaly not remastered or digitally transfered. Picture tones are very, very bad, along with what little color that is desplayed. Almost a black & white picture with most of the entire movie too dark to make out what is going on. Even with my brightness turn all the way up on my tv, it still was so dark it almost wasn't worth continue watching.The ONLY things positive on this dvd was the fact it was in widescreen and "suppossedly" in Dolby Digital EX. The beginning Dolby intoduction was deffinatly in Dolby and had good sound but the movie itself didn't distributeand Dolby sounds that I could make out on my theatre sound system. Sounded like mono to me.Thsi dvd reproduction stinks and I suggest those that are into quality dvd and getting you money worth saty away from this "Goodtimes Video" version untill it is put on dvd correctly. Why they botherd is beyond me. Because I wanted to have a copy of this movie in widescreen, I am taping it on to VHS for my collection and going to try and return it for something better tommorrow. I suppsoe I'll have to be content that I got the widscreen version on VHS for now untill they re-release it on dvd with better quality, or they show it on tv in widescreen which I highly doubt. Heck, even TAPING IT OFF TV YOU'D GET A BETTER PICTURE QUALITY THAN THIS DVD 
 I just bought and began reading "Portrait of Johnny" by Gene Lees, and I am furious.  What a lazy book.  Page seven:  "Whether Lerner set the words to Loewe's music or Loewe set the music to Lerner's words I don't know."  HOW HARD CAN THAT BE TO FIND OUT?  Page eleven:  "And to this day I do not know if Johnny Mercer knew that Patton was his distant cousin."  WELL, DID HE EVER MENTION IT TO HIS DAUGHTER OR ANYONE ELSE YOU INTERVIEWED?  Page fourteen:  "...Mercer grew up...at the intersection of Lincoln and Gwuinnett Streets.  Street names in Savannah predate the Civil War: the Lincoln in question is not Abraham, and Button Gwuinnett was Georgia's delegate to the Continental Congress and a signer of the Declaration of Independence."  AND FOR WHOM IS LINCOLN STREET NAMED?  I read a positive review of this book and was looking forward to reading it. I am ready to throw it out the window, and I want my money back.  Kathy Moor 
 This translation is completely unfaithful to the original.  This copy cannot be prayed or medidated with.  It's attempt to use modern language and expressions destroyed the beauty of this classic.  It is not any easier to read than more faithful translations 
 Ugh.  As a seasoned reader of true crime novels this one is pointless.  The writing is egotistical, vindictive with regard to fellow authors, and full of "fifty cent" words that are obviously plucked directly and pointlessly from the thesaurus.  Loaded with useless and unconvincing personal commentary.  Sixteen pages on the boring details of a funeral - including quoted poetry!  I estimate one fifth of the text have anything interesting to do with the murderer...the rest is fodder.  I am honest enough to admit that I don't read these books because I expect superior writing or because I am obsessed with the plight of the victims...I read these books to gather facts and formulate my own opinions on the psychology and intrigue of the mind of a killer. Nothing of interest along those lines here. I will avoid McDougal's books now and forever 
 I purchased this bag because I did not wnat to spend a ton of money on a case to protect my Canon Rebel EOS digital camera. I only have 2 lenses, but the bag is capable of holding the camera and 4 lenses as well as pockets for cables, batteries, etc. I think this is a great unit, for the beginner (like me) or the pro.  
 This is where the series gets bad. The first half of the book is going along fine, but I cringed every time the plow was mentioned. This was the same feeling I got with the Xenocide ending. The characters come up with  something that they can conceive of in their minds, and so the laws of  phyisics bend to their conception. So it is with Alvin, who theorizes a  ridiculous way to become a real Maker. And because he can conceive of it in  his poorly educated mind, this somehow makes it possible. I really enjoyed  the first two books in the series, but this one just left a bad aftertaste 
 does anyone know the song thats played when Brian is chasing the guys on the dirtbikes near the end of the film? i would really apresiate it. = 
 When I first started reading this book for a few moments I thought I had already read it--that is how similar it seemed to be to Shiver. As one reviewer said--she needs to get out of the asylum and get some fresh ideas. In my humble opinion, this book was horrible. I managed to get through the first five chapters or so and then flipped through it until the last few chapters. It takes a really bad book for me to do this. I then returned it to the library where I should have left it instead of taking it out 
 This review was originally posted as a discussion topic in the section below. I have decided to add it to the reviews section. As you read below you will see that I actually think that this book, so far as the various contributors are concerned (excepting the short introductory essay by Carson and his lengthy conclusion-analysis essay at the end, and possibly Seifrid's learned but wrongheaded, in my opinion, essay), is an excellent book. The various contributors provide excellent discussions of the areas of Jewish literature that they cover, especially from the angle/questions of the law, how the literature reflects Jewish understanding of it, the identity of Israel and the relation of that to the law, identity of Israel and eschatological hope, the literature's covenantal-conception of Israel's relationship with its God, how the Judaism reflected by each piece of literature understood `grace,' etc. So, as a book discussing Judaism in the ancient world, especially early Judaism when Jesus was around (several of the essays do not touch on Judaisms contemporary with Jesus and/or prior to 70 CE and 135 CE, which makes a massive difference), this book is excellent. The one star rating reflects how I rate the book with respect to how people in general seem to perceive the book and its goal: to refute Sanders' `Covenantal-Nomism.' The one-star rating reflects what I think of Carson's summary-analysis essay at the end that claims/presents the book as a triumph over Sanders in a way that people who do not like the (?) New Perspective on Paul (as I state below, that term means something different to different people; it seems that for most people who do not like the NPP, especially the ones who have not read anything by supposed-NPP scholars, it seems to mean some understanding of Paul that does not present Paul as espousing a Lutheran-Reformed theology; this is relevant as I have lost count of how many times I have seen scholars, who are not technically NPP scholars labeled as NPP who simply try to set Paul in a first century context with his letters addressing first century issues). Please read below to see some short comments on why I think that this book utterly fails to refute Sanders' `Covenantal-Nomism' as a helpful way to designate the pattern of religion exemplified by/in the various Early Judaisms.   First off, if you respond (or post a review in response) to this please indicate how much of this book you have actually read. Now, when I read this book last year I was struck by several things. After having read Sanders, it seemed that this book was the book out there that, basically, vindicated him! Each contributor that touched upon Judaism during Jesus' time essentially said that Sanders' 'covenantal-nomism' worked as an excellent way of describing whatever segment of Early Judaism (during Jesus' time) that they were treating. The basic criticism of Sanders' concept of covenantal-nomism as applied to Judaism contemporary with Jesus was that Sanders was using protestant-roman catholic categories for discussing Judaism; categories that may not be the most helpful.  There were other minor criticisms, but please understand that none of the contributors who touched upon Judaism when Jesus was around claimed that the Old-paradigm for understanding Judaism (semi-Pelagian works-righteousness...merit-seeking-l... etc) should stand.  From here I should move onto the most interesting part of my experience of reading the book last year: reading Carson's summary essay. It seemed that the summary / analysis essay misrepresented the conclusions (import/significance of the contributor's essays for assessing Sanders' covenantal-nomism) to an amazing degree; to the extent of, basically, claiming the opposite of what the contributors wrote. I do not know how to explain this. I was astonished. Numerous scholars/reviews concur with this assessment: John M.G. Barclay, Craig Bomberg (sort of), John Byron, James D.G. Dunn, Pamela Eisenbaum, Donald Garlington, J.R.D. Kirk, David Kuck, Ian W. Scott, etc. Other reviewers note that the contributors assess Sanders fairly positively, but with nuanced criticisms; not criticisms to the extent that Sanders is so wrong that, as Carson's summary essay would leave one to believe, a `traditional approach' to Early Judaism is still an acceptable understanding.   As a side-note, it is interesting that the contributor who treated 4th Ezra (I believe that it was Richard Baukham) claimed that it too fit the broad outlines of a covenantal-nomistic pattern of religion. For those of you who have read Sanders' `Paul and Palestinian Judaism,' you will know that that is his main example of an Early Jewish writing that did not exemplify a covenantal-nomistic pattern of religion but, rather, works-righteousness religion. So, at least according to one contributor, Sanders did not really go far enough with his covenantal-nomistic concept. This is one humorous example of how the contributors do not support Carson's analysis/conclusions in the essay at the end of the book in which he tries to smuggle an old-perspective understanding of Early Judaism in the back door.  So, in semi-response to `A Reader' who posted a non-review on May 31, 2004, this book does not challenge `the (?) New Perspective' (it seems to mean different things to different people; for most opponents, especially ones who really have not read anything by any supposed NPP scholars, it seems simply to mean some reading of Paul that is not a traditional Lutheran-Reformed reading). Rather, it stands as an obstacle that challenges to `the NPP' (or at least post-Sanders understandings of Early Judaism) must overcome. Lastly, this volume is one of the main reasons why volume 2 (The Paradoxes of Paul) is, in my view, not very helpful. Since the contributors to that volume basically presuppose Carson's account of `the findings' of volume 1, they set out in a wrong/uninformed direction. They also do not touch on the places where the serious debate needs to happen, what is/was Paul's context(s)?  Lastly, (this section was not in the discussion post), Carson seems to argue against positions that his supposed opponents do not hold. From reading Carson one would get the impression that Sanders and those who follow him think Early Judaism to be one large homogenous unit, with no diversity. They would think that Sanders claims to have presented a systematic-theology of Early Judaism (again, Carson may acknowledge in some places that Sanders is not trying to present this, I do not remember. Nevertheless, from reading his negative sections; sections where he presents his findings in polemical-genre as though they are set against Sanders, it seems that he is thus presenting Sanders and his followers as thinking they have done what I described prior to this lengthy parenthetical). This, just like Carson claiming that Sanders has a Paul whose pattern of religion is also Covenantal Nomism (in lectures Carson gave concerning the NPP at RTS-Charlotte...instead, see Sanders' section dealing with this question on pages 511-515 of `Paul and Palestinian Judaism'), is blatant misrepresentation of Sanders in the form of arguing against an opponent who does not exist/implicitly (sometimes explicitly) attributing to Sanders and his followers positions that they do not hold. This is all absurd. Sanders explicitly acknowledges the diversity of Early Judaism. In fact, the whole point of his calling covenantal-nomism a `pattern of religion' is that he cannot present a systematic theology of Early Judaism because it is so diverse. In fact, Sanders does not even claim to survey all relevant Jewish data; note that his title has reference to Palestinian Judaism (lest someone, such as Carson, want to jump in and claim that thus Sanders sets up a false barrier between Palestinian Judaism and Hellenistic Judaism, etc, Sanders also notes that one cannot do this, but nevertheless he will restrict himself to Palestinian Judaism-literature for `practical' pg2 reasons). One can find all of this in Sanders' short (32 page) introduction section to `Paul and Palestinian Judaism.' Lest one want to criticize Sanders for addressing those issues in the introduction and ignoring them throughout the rest of the book, he or she should read the rest of the book and see how conscious Sanders remains of all the introductory issues throughout the book. In fact, I recommend reading the introductory section that one can see what Sanders' goals were, who he is arguing against, etc...basically to help set Sanders' book in context and thus understand it better.   I hope that this pseudo-review has been helpful. I know that it is not really a review as it does not do the things that a typical review does. Nevertheless, I think it should be helpful as it addresses the concerns and questions that most of the people who are interested in `Justification and Variegated Nomism, volume 1' have. It does not refute Sanders. It does not challenge the (?) NPP's at all as it does not challenge the (?) new (for Protestants) view of Judaism that Sanders set Protestant scholarship on the trajectory to realizing. For people who think that Carson is just `the best evangelical scholar' and `an authority in this area,' please think again. Though he may be a great scholar, my interaction with his work, limited to this two-volume series and his lectures on the NPP at RTS-Charlotte to which I listened online, showed me `a Carson' who misrepresents his opponents (most basically by arguing against positions that they do not hold in a way that makes it seem as though they hold them), obscures data and issues, twists the work/words of other scholars around greatly, and at the end of all this really succeeds in not actually addressing the issues that need to be addressed. Or, to put it another way, Carson throws up such a smoke-screen of jargon, twisting, and misrepresentation, that, with respect to this book, the questions that Sanders raised about understanding Early Judaism, other scholars' tweaking and development of Sanders (especially in terms of learning to analyze Judaism in less `protestant' categories and learning to ask better questions of the Jewish literature), etc are not touched in his summary-analysis essay. Instead, if one reads only his introductory essay and summary-analysis essay (as Carson recommends in his RTS-Charlotte NPP lectures) one comes away without any real substantive interaction with the issues and discussion of the contributors to the volume (perhaps Seifrid's essay excepted). More than that, one comes away with a total misunderstanding of Sanders, his followers in understanding Early Judaism from his `covenantal-nomism' trajectory-perspective, and the impression that, basically, all the contributors would be happy with an old-perspective understanding of Early Judaism.  So, please read this book. It is an excellent discussion of Judaism(s) in the ancient world with a specific set of questions in mind. The contributors themselves (besides Carson) do substantively interact with Sanders as well. But, if you are looking for a book to be able to simply hurl at supposed followers of `the NPP,' the reason for which many seem to look to is, do not bother. In fact, if you are using it that way, simply mentioning the name as though it stands as the great critique of Sanders, you really should stop doing that. Lastly, as I mentioned above, it is because of this book that I find volume 2 to be, largely, a failure. Some of the essays within it are very helpful, see Westerholm's essay summarizing `the NPP' over the last 25 years, Silva's essay (even though I tend to lean in the direction against which he is arguing) on the subjective vs. objective genetive reading of pistis christou in the context of faith vs. works of the law in Galatians that takes the `objective position' and supplements its previous arguments with the findings of an article published by another scholar, and Hengel's essay (which was previously published in the Tubigen symposium volume `Paul and the Mosaic Law'...Hengel is an excellent scholar). Even so, however, since the main exegetical contributions and related essays presuppose Carson's understanding of volume 1, this volume thus does not really touch some of the most important `Paul in context' issues that need to be touched in the discussion that volume 2 seeks to advance (critique it seeks to bring).   
 I had high hopes for this thing. I remember the fun of the old Viewmaster Projector I had as a kid. None of that fun exists here. The slides are hard to look at and trying to get anything resembling focus while wearing the glasses is almost impossible.  Get your child a good viewmaster and you'll be glad you did 
 This is by far the most pretentious piece of French crap I have seen in years. What bothers me are not the admittedly disturbing scenes, but rather the banality of the film's underlying idea, which the director, Gaspar Noe, attempted to convey in a thoroughly unremarkable fashion. The characters are not shown in any depth; in fact, there is no meaningful dialogue or any other attempt at all to introduce them to the viewer. Camera work is simply awful - somebody should have explained to the cameraman that rotating a hand-held camera at will for minutes at a time does not always produce art. Apparently, these sterile methods combined with shocking scenes of rape and murder are supposed to produce a new form of cinéma vérité.  In short, even though in France almost every baker is an "artiste" (think "baguette artisanale"), Mr. Noe is not a "cinéaste" even by French standards: hit someone in the face with a teakettle and call it art 
 What a disappointing waste of money, and for that matter, time also.  However I have since bought a book that ,unlike this one, actually gives RESULTS and in the first week! It's by a psychiatrist, Richard Brown, called "Stop Depression Now".  If you want results -that's the one that works. but That's just my opinion and I'm going by the personal experiences of my clients- which some have been amazing following Browns book because it's simple, effective and to the point 
 The slots for the cards are not wide enough for the card! The only way this can be used is to place the cards in lengthwise and hope they don't fall out. Lovely leather case but pretty much useless 
 Nothing new! Just a new product of Covey's 7 Habits' brand franchise. Wonder why they keep on publishing reharshed materials? Buyers beware 
 I picked this up because it's considered a classic and I knew it had been made into a movie.  I tend to think that if a book is made into a movie, then the book must be pretty good.  Not so with Howard's End.  The plot in Howard's End doesn't progress much outside of an early death and later marraige.  You have to have some interest in the characters, but they just weren't very believeable.  None of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world.  I kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting, but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance.  The story is clearly dated and doesn't hold up well so many years later.  Living in today's world, it's hard to understand what attracted Margaret to Henry.  There definately is an audience for this book.  I'm just not a part of it 
 I was hoping for a book with practical thoughts and techniques to help the reader navigate through the darker parts of life.  Instead this is a rambling essay that quotes pagan God's and assumes a level of knowledge that leaves the average reader wondering what the heck he is talking about.  I got tired of hearing about how we should embrace our dark side; and found the opinions that it's okay to invoke total lack of responsibilty for one's actions in pursuit of this darkness downright dangerous; (especially the chapter discussing women who wake up one day and no longer want to parent their children). It's no wonder his publisher released him as he states in one of his chapters.  His book is obviously meant to appeal to a very particular audience and is not for someone who wants to get out of a depression and longs to live in the light.  It's not at all what I expected from the book jacket and knowing that he is a former Catholic Monk!  I also found his writing style difficult to follow and more in the mode of a scholarly paper than a book meant to convey knowledge to a wide range of readers.  Only for those already into the occult and previously inoculated to this genre 
 Cellulose Gel, Lactic Acid, Sucralose, Titanium Dioxide, Salt, Xanthan Gum, and Potassium Sorbate.....yum can't wait to get me some more titanium dioxide in me...how great does that sound! 
 As usual, I was impressed with Dr. Sears' commentary on his Zone diet, but I was fairly disappointed with the recipes in this book. I was happy I bought it used because I never really open it. The only thing I actually use from the book is the list of mix-and-match snacks at the very end. The recipes are horribly complicated, time-consuming and call for ingredients you probably wouldn't normally have in your kitchen. I have yet to actually make a meal from this book because I simply do not have the time. I'm sure that if I did, it would taste wonderful, but because the title of the book "Meals in Minutes" is so far from the truth, I'm giving it a 2 out of 5. If you're thinking about purchasing this book, go with a used edition, and keep in mind that you won't be getting quick and easy meals ... but rather gourmet meals that will take about an hour to prepare and make 
 My greatest problem with this book was it's appearence of blaming America for the woes of Japan and excusing excesses in time of war.  The author gave me the impression that he was more willing to forgive Japanese excesses in battle while condeming America for it's methods to end the war.  I grant the author's expertise in the access to a personal source for the battle of Iwo Jima near by but I cannot accept his rationalization of Japanese atrocities as a cost of war then condem the Americans for their bombing the enemy homeland (fire and nuclear) to destroy their will and ability to wage war.  Overall the book is well written and provides an insight to the mentality of the Japanese military during the war. 
 I made the mistake of buying this, but what i got was not what is pictured. The filters that came did not have the little red indicator that goes around and shows you when the filter has reached the end of its life.  I sent it back, and the merchant returned my money but it was still a big hassle.  Again, PLEASE learn from my mistake. Don't buy this product because you won't get what is pictured.   P.S. I have done some checking and from what i can tell, PUR has discontinued this particular filter. The new one no longer has the life indicator. If so, this is the most stupid thing they could have done 
 The only reason I finished "The Transit of Venus" was the hope of any improvement.  This book took away two hours of my life-two hours that I can never earn back by reading true literature.  The story (is there a story?) is dreadful.  The sentence structures, the paragraph performances, the offered descriptions assist in one wondering if Ms. Hazzard is merely attempting to impress the audience with her self-perceived insights.  I will never recommend this book to any audience.  Ms. Hazzard and her publisher should refund my money 
 Amazon image appears to be of standard edition while text without explanation of this being miniature press is buried far below. Looks like a crackerjack prize and contains only slightly more info. Very disappointing 
 Having just paid [...] for this product, I expected the word processing component to have at least the basics.  Wrong. To me, the ability to easily format a business or legal document with "page x of y" at the bottom of the page seems pretty fundamental. Well, Works 8.5---unlike other Microsoft word processor versions or programs---does not provide that choice. Without this basic a "feature", you might as well simply use Wordpad.   I cannot comment on other abilities this program has or doesn't have, or, on the spreadsheet or database modules, because I simply don't want to spend any more time on this.   Recommendation:  Go to OpenOffice.org and get Open Office for FREE 
 I'm a huge fan of Ted Dekkar, but lately I've noticed that his books have been lacking. Showdown was a wonderful read, and I was completely engrossed in it, thinking I would feel the same about SAINT I bought it. I think the most dissapointing about this book was that it was actually a sequel to Showdown, yet you don't know it till halfway through. I found this completely rediculous, and even though the story was somewhat interesting at times, it never really seemed to go anywhere...and never really ended either. There is never any true complete ending, and it leaves you feeling like you read a whole bunch of words instead of an actual story 
 from some angles. from others, she looks like my little brother when he was really into Black Oak Arkansas.  oh, the music!  given the fact that Chan, poor thing, is on every zine cover in the world right now, it's hard to focus on the songsmithery here.  all right!  let's listen!  very very contrived--melody free, banal lyrics, superpretentious inflections.  not even "the moon," the highly touted song here, has  much brightness, as it were.    get some really solid indie rock:  THE BLACK WATCH, YO LA TENGO, ROBYN HITCHCOCK!! 
 It might be a nice little book if any of it were actually based in reality.  Yes, the author is right that if Hutton had challenged the dominant mode of thought to create a new science and been the first person to challenge the biblical time-scale and the story of the flood, that he should be mentioned in the same breath as Galileo, Newton, Darwin, and the other greats  ...BUT HE DIDN'T!  All of this had been already covered to varying degrees by many different scientists for only about oh, the last 100 years by the time Hutton showed up on the scene.  He is in no way a founder of geology, he is only an important and early contributor.  So regardless of whether the book is well written or not, the entire foundation for what it has to say is completely false, and thus completely worthless 
 I just got back from vacation where I read a handful of fun crime dramas. This one really stood out as being horrible from the very first paragraph. The writing is weak and the story was so incredibly thin that that killers were obvious from the start.   I'm not sure who the target audience is for this book, but my best guess is old guys who only read one book a year. There was a really strange mix of detail and inference. It was almost like he needed to fill space so every now and then we would get pointless detail about flying or some other random aspect of what the character was doing. And the sex scenes were just bad.   I really couldn't recommend this book any less 
 I picked up the audio book from the library, and didn't know by the title and author's name (my first Jance book) that this was chick lit. I don't feel this book was something I would've started had I known. It started real well, and Ms. Jance knows how to reel you in with her writing. Midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging  about her unfair release as a new anchor, and then about her friend who died of ALS, and then came the long responses to the blogs. It just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could've been a decent suspense drama. 
 I was unfortunate enough to receive this book as a "gift" from my mother (along with Where Does a Mother Go to Resign").  As a gay Christian (yes, a GAY Christian), I find Mrs. Johnson's writings decidedly disturbing and un-Christian.  The Bible does NOT clearly condemn gay people (if one researches historical and language origins of Biblical writings) and to base her reaction to her gay son on Christian beliefs is just wrong.  So yes, I think that makes this a bad book 
 This book is stuck in an archaic age.  Get something more relevan 
 Amazon.com should immediately cease selling this book.  It was published without Hawking's permission and is a blatant effort to ripoff Stephen Hawking!!    Go to his website, http://www.hawking.org.uk/info/iindex.html, and you will see the following admonishment:  "IMPORTANT NOTE It has come to our attention that the book "The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe" has been published. Professor Hawking would like to make it clear that he has not endorsed this book. The text was written by him many years ago, however the material has already been published in books such as 'A Brief History of Time'. A complaint was made to the Federal Trade Commission in the US in the hope that they would prevent the publication. We would urge you not to purchase this book in the belief that Professor Hawking was involved in its creation. 
  As with most other kids I thought this book was not worth writing. While reading the description it sounded fantasticly exciting. In the beginning it actually sounded like an interesting piece of history. By the end it was one of the most boring books I've ever read. Now I have come to realize that just because a book wins the Newbery Medal does not mean that it is a good book. With 1,000 good books one book can be published because it is pollitically correct or is spewed out by a good author. I have no doubts about Elizabeth Yates but I think that Amos Fortune is a book about a man that had a good life, but one that was not nessicarily worth writing about 
 I find it disturbing that John Updike can apparently find no female artist worthy of mention in his book...beyond one artist who is practically unknown. And she is included only because his family owned a piece of artwork created by her. Updike seems very dismissive of even this one female contributor.  He does find room in his book to include a nude photo of the great artist Georgia O'Keefe, but no actual artwork created by O'Keeffe. That should give you a clue what the rest of the book is like.   Disturbing, too, are Updike's dismissive comments about Edward Hopper; he claims that Edward Hopper can't paint faces very well.    So even though I purchased this book, I don't recommend it to others. Give this one a pass. 
 This book is almost identical to the Spring developer's guide available on the web site.  They follow the same chapters and format, and provide little new information, maybe some code.  But once you start to get into Spring and use it, you'll want a reference that is more in depth.  With this book, you'll find yourself struggling to find the details by browsing google and javadocs all day.  Pro Spring is a better book that gives you more insight into how Spring works.  My background is providing a services interface layer for a J2EE portal.  I'm not developing the MVC so I didn't pay attention to those parts of the book 
 I was waiting for something to happen in this book but nothing did. There is no plot, the characters described very poorly and the writing is definitely unimpressive (I would not mind the writing so much if the plot was there). Throughout the whole book all the main character does is answers the phone and gets coffee ... how exciting is that?   
 The style of the book is very dry, and it's not the kind of dryness associated with technical depth -- the book digresses constantly without much cohesiveness using a style that is also chatty and distracting, and takes liberties with a sort of philosophical poetic style that is modern to the 1950's Tweed Circuit.  Worst of all, the book tends to remain superficial and moves from one topical subject to another without analysis of any depth, in particular, it lacks any sort of mathematical rigor although it describes mathematical trends -- as a result, the book has a mushy arbitrary feel to it -- because ideas are suggested but never clarified in a mathematical context, and non-mathematical concepts are poorly clarified.  The author also likes to name-drop great scientists or great books or broad philosophical categories, and in using such tokens rather than more precise concepts, there is a sense of vagueness as you move throught the book.  The book quotes heavily from source texts, which is a good thing, but doesn't tie the topics together effectively.  The author poses a lot of questions, but then uses a style of "Before we answer that question, lets consider...", and goes on to another topic, not clearly related to the first topic, and then DOES NOT BOTHER TO ADDRESS the original question posed.  Quite annoying.  As an alternate I recommend Richard S. Westfall's technically excellent "The Construction of Modern Science", which covers similar topics, with less historical range, but in much more interesting and compelling depth.  
 There is currently a known issue with many of the Sony Camcorders.  This is being called the "black screen of death".  What happens is that the camera works great for 1-2 years then the CCD goes out like a light.  The camera will not take video again.  Sony is evasive if not downright deceitful about this issue when you call tech support.  The fact is Sony does not stand behind their product.  If this happens to you, Sony will not own the defect and you will be out hundreds of dollars.  There is a lengthy thread on CNET on this issue.  Search for Sony black screen.  Wishing you luck in the purchase of your (not Sony) video camera, Scot 
 The book tells you that friendships at work are good.  That's it.  The author doesn't address when those friendships over take the workplace and what to do when the workpplace is the only friendships people have.  The author also doesn't address the issue of diversity.  It is large type and double spaced - it is a waste of your money.  If you are a fan of the information from the Gallop Organization, you are going to be very disappointed 
 A fun book yes. But accurate? No. There are many many flaws. For a couple of examples, it says John plays lead guitar on "Dig a Pony" when you can see George playing lead in the film "Let it be" from were the recording was made. It also states that George only played Tamboura on "Within you, Without you" when it's be clear for many years even by George himself that he play the simple "Sitar" parts on it. Did John really play lead guitar on the Let it Be version of "One after 909" and "I've Got a Feeling"? A lot of real info can be found in Mark Lewisohn's book "The Beatles Recording Sessions". This is someone who went thru the original tapes. Anyway, I'm sure there is correct info here but I just don't know what is correct and what isn't, (unless it's obvious of course.) Maybe someone can write a book and correct all these flaws. 
 Purchased thinking it was gold-plated as advertised but actually is not.  Quite noisy - settled for a Monster Stereo (Male-to-Male) cable instead 
 Rio Bravo is a classic. This review isn't about that as everyone knows what they're getting in terms of the film. The movie industry is another matter. I saw a recent debate between a couple arguing about the state of things in the industry and how movie and entertainment comapanies are crying poor. The reason is simple, when you try to rip people off on a consistant basis, you get everything you deserve. There's many areas I could go into detail, but I'll just add my comment regarding the dvd's. How many versions of the same movie can you possibly release? Let's see, there's the original one, the HD version, then (like this one) there's the "special" two-disc set with all the extras they didn't include on the original. But wait, there's more. Next of course will be the new and improved "blue-ray" edition! This one is even better folks! Give me a break. It's time people stopped falling for this crap! Everytime you purchase another version, you're telling these crooks that's it's ok to pull this stuff, and you're also showing just how gullible you really are. This is a form of the oldest selling scam there is. Hold 'em ransom for better versions. No wonder the pirate market is flourishing. 
 My family thinks that this is the best toilet paper available.

 The reviews all sounded so good I couldn't resist. I was hoping for another "Memoirs of a Geisha" but boy, was I disappointed. The story bounces all over the place, never seems to have a consistent theme and finally, turns out to be just plain boring. I'll give the author some credit; the imagery is nice and having traveled to many of the same locations in Asia myself, I enjoyed her descriptions of those places set in a bygone era. Unfortunately, the budding story of a war hero's longing for a very young girl (he refers to her as the "Changeling") made the guy come off looking like a pedophile. Seriously, pretentious readers will love this drivel; too bad I can't recover the hours I wasted on this schlock.  With any luck, it'll be another 20 years before 'ol Shirley picks up her pen again. 
 As a big fan of Steven Saylor's Sub Rosa series, I was very excited by the idea of a mystery set in Roman Britain.  Alas, Ruth Downie's MEDICUS is not very satisfying as either history or mystery.  The story takes place in the Roman outpost of Deva (modern Chester) where the settings include an army base and a brothel whose employees keep turning up dead.  Ms. Downie seems to have the philosophy that people of the past were just like us except that they wore funny clothes.  They deal with an endless system of bureaucracy and bookkeeping not unlike that of the 19th Century.  The rhythm of the speech of all the characters is modern day British.  What this book really brought to mind was the old PLANET OF THE APES movies, wherein the apes have a distinctly 20th Century American sensibility and ride horses and drive stagecoaches.  The book is probably a lot more enjoyable if regarded as fantasy rather than as history.  The mystery is virtually nonexistent since the culprit is obvious upon introduction and the suspense is limited to a small section toward the end of the book.  MEDICUS has other problems besides these.  To begin with, Ms. Downie's male characters are very unconvincing.  Her hero, an army doctor, spends virtually the first two hundred pages of this 368-page tome fretting about the poor standards of housekeeping, the preparation and preservation of food, undisciplined pets and his failed marriage.  Being a man myself, I just didn't buy it.  The slow pace is excruciating.  There is very little action up until about the last 75 pages or so and the book is over about 30 pages before it actually ends (quite predictably, I might add).  There are several extraneous chapters that do not even function well as red herrings.  If I had borrowed this book from the library I would not have finished it, but since I bought it I felt obligated trudge through to the end.  I predict a short career for Ms. Downie's army-doctor-turned-sleuth.  The book is at its best with the female characters, whose roles are relatively brief, and the romantic elements.  This leads me to believe that Ms. Downie would be better off using a female protagonist in her next book and emphasizing the romance.  I'd rate the book at one-and-a-half stars, rounded up to two 
 Cast:  Harold Becker Cast:  Al Pacino, John Cusack, Bridgett Fonda, Danny Aiello, Martin Landau, David Paymer, Anthony Franciosa, Richard Schliff, Lindsay Duncan. Running Time:  111 minutes Rated R for language and some violence.  "City Hall" is one of those hopeful yet ultimately frustrating films that never really delivers toward its potential. It's as if the characters, the plot, and the pacing of the film were kept apart throughout filming, and then only introduced in the editing room.  The film begins with a lackluster conflict, the accidental shooting of a child by a drug dealer with relatives in the NY mob families who looks as if he came directly from Central Casting, and acts just as stiff. Before we even know anything about this character, he's confronted by a possibly corrupt cop ( the entire background motivation and confusion regarding the cop's rational for meeting with the drug dealer alone, without backup and without reporting in first is left completely unresolved), gunfire is exchanged, and everyone is dead, including the innocent child, who is clearly injected into this formula for nothing more than aesthetic/emotional purposes, and is treated like "cinema-chum", shot dead for instant sympathy by the audience, only to draw in the bigger fish in the water, the primary characters.  On the heels of the shooting, we are introduced to our principles, Al Pacino as the mayor, John Cusack as the deputy mayor, single-handedly managing the entirety of New York. The completely contrived setup of the administration of a city the size of New York being managed, at least from all appearances we are given on screen, by these two characters is beyond laughable, but  insipid.   The central plot of the movie springs from the reaction by City Hall to this one shooting incident, as the world is (we suppose) put on temporary pause for days afterward in New York by this event. Cusack abandons his supposed position with City Hall and becomes a knee-jerk Mickey Spilane, trodding beside Bridget Fonda on some half-ass investigation of the politics surrounding the now dead cop, suspected of corruption, and the question of why the drug dealer was ever on the streets in the first place, having been questionably released on parole years before. Everyone phones in their performances, which appears as if everyone approached the movie with high hopes, then got distracted by something better to do, (possibly calling their agents for better scripts once this movie started filming) and just showed up to through with the dialogue.  Numerous gaffs, faux pauxs regarding life in New York, cornball accents by Cusack, Fonda's character operating with the depth of a spring puddle, vanilla backgrounds, boring dialogue (save Al Pacino's impassioned, yet ultimately weak tirades toward the shooting of James Bone and his personal conversations with Pappas) make for a really unsatisfying films; "City Hall" just can't deliver and feels like a TV movie of the week 
 I love stories of life after death, I see this book as complete fiction though. She claims to have been able to read books when she was 4 years old. When she was 7 is when her dead brother comes to take her and show her around heaven, she didn't actually die like most people that have written books about the after life. Its helps the credibility a bit to have some sort of proof that you died, rather than saying "I went in my sleep and nobody knew about it". After her journey, her brother is explaining to her how to re-enter her body correctly, of all the stories I've read, I've never heard of instructions on how to re-enter. As well, while she is with her brother she is asking questions he whole time, rather than being all knowing like so many others have described in their books. I read the first chapter and decided that this author is just someone who jumped on the afterlife book band wagon and has no credibility 
 I thought "I am Legend" was a real snooze - pretty boring actually. I also thought it wasn't very well thought out. Matheson poses some questions throughout the story but never answers them. So you never really know how the plague starts or why. You never fully understand how it spread and how the main character ends up where he is. Then you never understand why the woman het meets is the way she is. Then the ending is sort of like "oh well, it's about time to wrap this up - I know, let's just kill off the main character, that'll do." I was very disappointed. I tried the next story and found it to be even more disappointing and so I stopped reading the book 
 On one hand, I give the movie credit where other movies have been unrealistic and phony, ADAM & EVE had the guts to make something very real. At times, TOO REAL. At times, unnecessarily TOO REAL.   They just had to slip in the gross out jokes to please all the immature goofballs out there. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure there is a time and a place for gross out jokes, pubes in the shower etc., but they're less funny then something that takes execution and timing. Not to mention, they alienate the audience. The people that find that thing disgusting, are put off, and won't return.  Okay... back to the movie. ADAM & EVE is about love and sex. It's about a young HOT college girl, EVE (Emmanuelle Chriqui) and a typical college guy, ADAM (Cameron Douglas). They meet, find each other interesting, Adam tries to score and then Eve tells him that she's a virgin, and is being patient with her standing.  Then, as I said before, the movie is very real. All the things that come into play: the ridiculing friends, the things you do when your girlfriend looks like Emmanuelle Chriqui and you're being made to wait, the criticisms, the other girl that ISN'T holding out, etc. etc.   Although, I question one thing. Why in the world would a girl looking like Emmanuelle Chriqui be interested in this guy? She seemed like a nice girl. Smart. Nice room. Nice, wholesome girl. Yet, Adam is a partying bum. Lazy. Lives in a pig-sty. His yard looks like a trash dump and he goes and lays in his bed all day. His friends are the epitome of bums and womanizers... but then... I thought about it, and realized... actually, when I was in college, yeah... that was about right. Women liked these type guys.   Although, I do give the movie credit for being real, there wasn't enough going on. There weren't enough side plots and not enough to keep the movies pace going. When the movie deviated from the MAIN plot, it just went and told gross out stories with Adam's loser friends, or showed little side stories that never really explained themselves.  Ultimately, the only good thing I can say about ADAM & EVE is that it was realistic. Otherwise, the movie was less than average, and pretty forgettable 
 The Greatful Dead were nothing but an infantile gang of cackling tramps.  While they fecklessly hawked their cheap ties to K-Mart, they relentlessly puked hour upon hour of gelatinized nonsense onto their pony-tailed legions of unemployed, mind-altered drones.  Now, I may not be the spokesperson for the American way, but I'm pretty sure that virulent body odor, marijuana cigarettes, and hay-seed mentalities do NOT make the world go around.  Therefore, as we enter the 21st century, let's all try to remember our common humanity, and let us categorically reject the naive and sophomoric blather that has been the ultimate legacy of the silly 1960's.  To chuck this unfortunate and ridiculous collection of nursery rhymes into the rubbish would be a good start.  Thank you very much. -DW  
 This book appears to be exactly the same as "A World History of Architecture" (Paperback) by the same authors and available on Amazon for $33.64 without the CD. The number of pages, table of contents, and intro sentence are exactly the same.  It seems more than slightly shady to me to sell the exact same book with two different names.    This book is required reading for my Architectural History class and was for sale at my school's bookstore for $100.  My stodgy old professor isn't teaching from the CD. I am not giving these people my money, I got my copy at the library.  
 From all the available evidence it is apparent to me that the U.S. Government does not have an active, highly organized effort to either investigate or conceal the existence of aliens visiting Earth.  If anything remotely "systemic" has resembled this, it is likely a few disparate individuals in power over the years acting out of fear or caution, rather than any shadow conspiracy.  The rest of it is simply the result of the "inestimable damage to the national security" test criteria that causes such information to stay compartmented, unshared, uncollated, and thus, largely unused.  The information is weird, and therefore gets tucked away by the classification system by default.  The few who have seen some of the collected intelligence have clearly been too perplexed or nervous to know what to do.  Most of those who claim a mass conspiracy either have no first hand knowledge or are individuals who are known crackpots who've made numerous claims over the years, usually with escalating irrationality.  Take the case of the Disclosure Project.  They have a few former intelligence officers and air traffic controllers who have first hand accounts of personally seeing or detecting alien craft.  Their backgrounds check out and they very well may be telling the truth.  Disclosure Project then uses a bunch crackpots with longtime involvement in various saucer groups, who keep changing their stories over and over, to "corroborate" the other first-hand accounts and to further add that the U.S. Navy has an active saucer recovery unit.  The rest of their "witnesses" are people who saw odd lights earlier in life, became believers, and have now streamed together a narrative of third-person accounts they've collected for your enjoyment.  That's certainly not a reliable witness, either.  See how this works?  Now, I'm not questioning Disclosure Project or Stanton Friedman's motives, but rather their methodology and, thus, the conclusions they come to.  With the Majestic/MAJIC story, we are finding the use of real documents unrelated to UFO's being grouped in with hoax documents.  The manual for the recovery of UFO's and all documents that mention Majestic 12 are forgeries.  The FOIA connecting documents which are being used to verify these hoax documents either have no connections to Majestic 12/MAJIC or have absolutely nothing to do with UFO's at all.  The primary document obtained through the Freedom of Information Act being used to validate the aforementioned hoax documents is an Emergency War Plan pertaining to nuclear war.  These evolving war plans were given codenames over the years such as Halfmoon, Fleetwood, Trojan, Offtackle, Masthead, and Majestic.  While in the beginning they were mostly target packages, they became increasingly complex to the point of including psychological warfare, communications, and logistics planning.   This document is real, but it has absolutely nothing to do with aliens.  So let me repeat myself: There is not a single authentic document in existence that can connect the terms Majestic or MJ-12 to UFO's and aliens.  There are some non-UFO FOIA documents that use variants of these terms.  There are some historical FOIA documents that show the government puzzled as to what is flying around.  And there are a bunch of forgeries that attempt to connect the two.  And MAJI is simply an acronym for Major Agency for Joint Intelligence, commonly referring to international intelligence cooperation and liaison, such as between the U.S. and Canada.  The only other term that comes close would be MAJCOM, which appears on certain early Project Bluebook documents.  However, this is simply an abbreviation of Major Command, often used when putting a notation at the bottom of a document such as "Forward Copy to MAJCOM-2", a designation for a specific military command.  Friedman's got nothing but a bunch of forged documents and crackpot witnesses to support his theories, and this is from an abductee! 
 Jacques Derrida is the "other" of reason. Actually, he's an inverted Kantian, nothing more. This is the sort of text his alterity-stricken fan club gets excited about. Its conversational style gives the impression that deep insights are waved at because they just never show up. The reader is made to feel that he missed something. And then the game is lost. Intangibility becomes intrinscially virtuous, and so the reader forgives the great Derrida's omissions, who is relieved of the responsibility of answering his own questions. Don't be fooled. He can't answer those questions because the special discourse he reserves for himself prohibits him from doing so in principle. That's the oldest con in the book. Derrida is the "other" of reason 
 Some of the twelve-step groups are absurd. There are groups for an amazing number of "spiritual diseases". Just the short list of the common ones includes:  AA Alcoholics Anonymous  Abusive Parents Anonymous  ACOA Adult Children Of Alcoholics  ADD Anonymous  Al-Anon  Alateen  Alcoholics Victorious of the Institute for Christian Living  ARTS Anonymous (Artists Recovering through the Twelve Steps)  Augustine Fellowship: Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous  CA Cocaine/Crack Anonymous  Calix (a Catholic 12-Step-based recovery organization)  CDA Chemically Dependent Anonymous  CEA Compulsive Eaters Anonymous  CMA Crystal Meth Anonymous  Chronic Illness  CLA Clutterers Anonymous  CODA Codependents Anonymous  COSA Codependents of Sex Addicts  Compulsive Eaters Anonymous  Compulsive Shopping  Debtors Anonymous  Diabetics Anonymous  Divorce Recovery  Dual Diagnosis Anonymous  Drug-Anon Focus  Dual Disorders Anonymous  DRA Dual Recovery Anonymous  EAA Eating addictions anonymous  EA Emotions Anonymous  EDA Eating Disorders Anonymous  EAA Eating Addictions Anonymous  Emotional Health Anonymous  Ethics Anonymous  FA Families Anonymous  FA Food Addicts in Recovery Anonymous  GA Gamblers Anonymous  GamAnon -- families of gamblers  Gangs Anonymous  HCVA Hepatitis C Virus Anonymous  High blood pressure  ISA Incest Survivors Anonymous  Marijuana Anonymous  Methadone Anonymous  MTC Make Today Count (for someone with a terminal disease)  NA Narcotics Anonymous  Nar-Anon - families of addicts  Nick-a-teen Anonymous  Nicotine Anonymous  Obsessive-Compulsive Anonymous  Offenders Anonymous -- for convicts  ODAT One Day At a Time -- pagan recovery  Overcomers Outreach  OE Overeaters Anonymous  PIR Pagans In Recovery  Pagan Sanctum Recovery  Parents Anonymous  Pill Addicts Anonymous  Pills Anonymous  Prostitutes Anonymous  Recovering Couples Anonymous  RSA Rape Survivors Anonymous  S/A Schizophrenics Anonymous  S/A Schizophrenics Anonymous  SA Sexaholics Anonymous  SAA Sex Addicts Anonymous  SAA Sex Addicts Anonymous (alternate URL)  S-Anon - family groups of sex-addicts  SCA Sexual Compulsives Anonymous  S-Anon International Family Groups  SLAA Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous  Sexual Recovery Anonymous  SIA Survivors of Incest Anonymous  Partners and Friends of Incest Survivors Anonymous  Tough Love  WA Workaholics Anonymous  Some of these groups offer their own minor variations on the twelve steps, but all have the same spiritual-religious orientation.            Notice the funny mix of so-called "spiritual diseases" there: you can "cure" some of them just by changing your behavior, like alcoholism, narcotics, smoking, over-eating, sex addiction, gambling, cocaine, or being a compulsive shopper or a clutterer. But the others are not what we might call "voluntary" diseases. You cannot just voluntarily quit having high blood pressure, diabetes, hepatitis C, chronic illness, dual disorder (i.e.: having both mental and drug or alcohol problems) or schizophrenia, so I really want to hear how listing and confessing all of your sins, "moral shortcomings", and "defects of character" will cure those diseases.   Someone would have to be pretty crazy to think that doing the Twelve Steps -- performing a searching and fearless moral inventory and confessing all of his sins -- is going to cure mental illnesses like schizophrenia and compulsive-obessive disorders.   But, come to think of it, that's just how the game works, isn't it? Go find sick, vulnerable people who are suffering, whose minds aren't too clear, and exploit their weaknesses and talk them into joining a cult religion while telling them that this magical 12-Step program will heal what ails them.    Dumb Question: Why are there three "Dual" recovery groups that appear to treat the same mental problems -- Dual Diagnosis, Dual Disorder, and Dual Recovery?  Dumb Answer: So that the people who have Multiple Personality Disorder4 can send each of their personalities to a different group, so that they don't run into each other at the meetings...      Another dumb question: Why do schizophrenics need 12-Step groups telling them to do Step Eleven, and pray and meditate until they hear God talking to them, when those schizophrenics already hear God and sundry other voices in their heads talking to them all day long anyway?     If Workaholics Anonymous people do 90 meetings in 90 days, are they still being compulsive workaholics?  Shouldn't 180 meetings in 90 days fix the problem?      Last night I joined Gamblers Anonymous. They gave me two to one I don't make it. == Rodney Dangerfield    And the oddest ones have to be "divorce recovery 
  The "Claude Glass" sounds like a very interesting topic, but the handling of this topic by the author A. Maillet is out of the limits of professional academic research. The very short chapters filled with heterogeneous thesis and arbitrary pictures and diagrams evade a clear art-historian or philosophical approach of the Claude Glasse's use for artists in the 18th century. The first interesting thesis, that you expect normally in the introduction, is presented on page 163 (of 221 pages main-Text): "The Claude Mirror... is... an apparatus that enables one to transpose reality into a melodious harmony." In the internet you find articles that give you more insight for free.  
 I have really enjoyed Ram Charan's writing in the past.  I have really enjoyed Ram Charan's writing in the past.  He is generally simple, clear, but most important actionable.  This book, however, was a real disappointment to me as it fails to deliver on it's promise:  10 tools to use on Monday morning.  I guess Ram got stuck on simple and clear but the sad fact is that profitable growth is neither and this is where actionable is left in the cold.  One point was outstanding:  look for singles and doubles (not out-of-the-park home runs) and build on those over time.  But he could have said that in a journal article or a business magazine commentary and saved us all a lot of wasted time reading 
 The game seemed to start off like any other Nancy Drew game.  My daughter has played them all.  However, after a while, it seemed as thow it was an easter egg hunt for three year olds.  Everything was easy to find and not mysterious at all.  All the other games took my daughter quite some time before she figured out the mystery.  However, this game took her two days.  All the other Nancy Drew games kept her intrigued and kept her coming back for more.  This game breezed by and and she was quite disappointed.  In fact, her words at the end of the game were, "that's it?".  Her interactive, better come out with a more interesting game next time or you'll lose the interest 
 Possibly the only time I've ever made it so far into a book and then just not had the drive to finish it. I mean, here I am only a hundred pages or so from the end, 3/4 of the way though, and I'm so bored I can hardly keep my eyes open.  There are a number of problems with this sub-par sequel to the pretty damn good Booked to Die, and I'll list them here. 1.) The masculinity of Richard Grayson: This fictional printer gets more action then James Bond in three of his movies! Are we actually expected to believe that wild and beautiful woman simply through themselves at this guy over his genius of creating fonts! And since when have beautiful women ever cared about genius anyway? Some other reviewer commented that Dunning seems to be overcompensation for a lack of personal libido with this book and while I'm not sure I see evidence of that elsewhere, at least not in excess beyond the normal male mystery writer style, it really shows here.  2.) The book moves at the pace of frozen stream: Booked to die had some power, some rough narrative drive that compelled the reader onward. This book has none. The only reason I made it as far as I did was because of a previous attachments to the characters.  3.) Where is the book stuff!? Lawrence Block's Bernie Rhodenbar series has always been a little light on book talk, considering the testicular character owns a used bookshop, but even the most meager of his offerings have more literary substance than the Bookman's wake. The printing industry might be fascinating to some people, though it sure wasn't to me, but where's the rest of the stuff? The modern first edition talks, the discussions of where to find rare books. The types of people that read certain things? All of these things were in the first book and are missing from the second.  Anyway, those were my main problems, there are more smaller ones. Just be warned, everything you probably enjoyed about the first book is absent here. Don't fall into the trap, as I did, of reading the sequel just because it's there. Read Block's "the bugler who traded Ted Williams" instead. It's the best of that series. Or maybe "the Burglar in the Library," which is a sort of parody treat for classical mystery fans.  Maybe Dunning gets better later. Maybe I'll try the third  book at some point, but my level of patience is going to be pretty low considering all the time I wasted with this one. 300 pages...sheesh 
 I enjoy reading The Years Best Fantasy & Horror but this is the first time I have ever been bored to death and pleased by my decision to borrow it from my public library. Generally the stories consist of great writing and really encourage you to seek out additional work by many of the authors featured. This collection consists of very weak and quite appallingly bad stories the worst being "Old Virginia". Many of the stories appeared in other anthology collections and it seems that the editors have chosen some of the worst works from them. "The Dark" had some great and generally creepy stories but instead of choosing any number of those they selected the story by Kelly Link which was god-awful, too long and quite confusing. I'm not sure if the departure of Ms. Windling has contributed to the general laziness of this volume but if so, please bring her back 
 Other reviewers who detail the silly political-correctness and faux-politics are right... This is Clancy-for-dummies.  Ford's Jack Ryan was sometimes a step behind, but in a believable way.  The audience was right beside Ryan, and when he put 2 and 2 together and took action, boy, did he take action.  Ben Affleck's Jack Ryan is terminally lost, pouting and confused while the audience waits for him to figure things out and do something productive (or at least interesting?).  This is going to go down as the "Star Wars Prequel" of Clancy movies--the one you try to forget exists as part of the saga you love. 
 Reading this book was as tedious as running a mile in chest-deep water. Comparisons to King and Proulx are ridiculous. King, at least, keeps his stories humming while Proulx's writing is minimalist brilliance. Harvey's story is waterlogged and interminable, leaking page-bloating, tangential backstories every ten pages and peopled with annoying, boring characters. As for his style, it's bloated, taxing and sodden, the occasional surreal touch nothwithstanding. (Sure, an albino shark barfing up a human head is startling, but it, like so much of this novel, is ultimately meaningless.) Every time his character, Miss Laracy, opens her toothless mouth (how many times do we need a description of her pink, shiny gums?) and chatters endlessly in her apostrophe-riddled, irksomely rendered Newfoundland dialect, I got so weary I could barely hold the book up in my hands. Worse, while Harvey's story is intrigueing enough to keep you reading, his climax and resolution are so uneventful and silly and, well, boring, that I actually tossed the book aside after (finally!) finishing the last page. Four hundred and seventy-one pages of over-plotted, over-written monotonous drivel. Pure tedium 
 Skepticism  can be healthy, but this book is an error-filled celebration of hollow, misleading cynicism delivered with a surprising level of shallowness and lack of detail.  Sure this book points out some "legitimate" frauds and hoaxes, but it does a lot of damage and leads people astray by suggesting that a lot of things are frauds and hoaxes that are not. It seems that Mr. Randi concludes that anything and everything he doesn't understand or have proof of is a fraud or hoax. One example: acupuncture.  Never mind that thousands,  if not millions of people have been helped and healed by acupuncture, but even the American Medical Association has concluded that it is a legitimate medical therapy. But Randi includes it in his list of frauds and hoaxes.   There are many other examples where Randi errs and misleads, or simply does not understand and chooses to cast aspersions (p on) what he is woefully ignorant about. In some cases he cites individuals who have supposedly exposed frauds or disproven claims and theories, but the reader is left with little or no details to assess the claims of the "fraud buster."    In other cases, a supernatural feat is presumed to have been disproven simply because someone else has managed to appear to replicate the supernatural feat by using sleight-of-hand or other trickery.    Not everything that is real and true can or needs to be proven by science or  proven to Mr. Randi. (A large portion of the history of science, in fact, is a history of proving that what science once concluded was unreal or unprovable is in fact real.)  If you accept on face value  everything that Mr. Randi wants you to accept, your life will be much poorer for it.   This book will provide great reassurance for people who don't want to believe in anything other than their egos. As stated above, this book is a great example of where skepticism has fallen victim to cynicism and that makes this book more harmful than helpful.  To a great extent,  I am very surprised and sorry to conclude, this book itself is a fraud 
 Initially I was impressed with this book, it seemed to be well written and to raise some interesting questions concerning architectural ideas of the present and future. As the book progresses the author's rhetoric gets a bit thin, causually citing references that are never elaborated upon leaving many of her arguements baseless. If you suffer from the ability to develop your own questions concerning the future of architectural thought/theory, whether you are an architect or from the  'outside', buy this book. Otherwise find an author that can actual communicate an idea beyond an initial thought 
 To begin with, we really don't need this kind of book, nor do we need those written by the Neo-Fats who wish to blame America for everything since Columbus sailed in 1492.  Does that mean that Mr. Prestowitz might have a point here and there? Possibly. But when the majority of the baby butchers of 9/11 were born to prosperous families like the Atta scum (daddy Atta blames America for his son's murderous tendencies) - or families like that of Vicente Fox that prospered thanks to America, to Coca-Cola, McDonalds, Starbucks and all of those evil American corporations, and still blame America for their poor campesinos (remember, Clyde, you were a trade representative), then I for one refuse to buy into this kind of fallacious argument.  Should Americans understand the world? Absolutely. Should we buy into their Hate America crapola. Not for one single second. If we do, then I will ask Mr. Prestowitz and "Compassionate Conservative" who blames an Israel for the Palestinians wanting to butcher women and children, - an Israel that recently smashed the homes of its own citizens instead of the PLO leaders, where they happen to reside. Because more than likely they live on Native American land that was taken by force. If so, kindly hand over the keys to the local Tribal council, dear sirs, and take your family back to Europe. I'm sure Clyde can find an ancestral home in Cracow or Lodz or Warsaw.  We are NOT a "rogue nation" nor should we carry a guilt trip about Kyoto, the Israelis, SAVAK, the division of Korea or any other tripe that Prestowitz or his similiar-minded friends on the Left wish for us to carry, namely Soros, Chomsky and Zinn. Thousands of American boys and girls laying beneath the soil in North Africa, Western Europe, the Pacific Islands have already paid the world's price. Not to mention those who have died in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. And if the masses of the world don't like it, too bad.  Seems Mr. Prestowitz didn't learn much from serving in the administration of a great American President. Care to blame him too, Clyde?  My Country, Right or Wrong - it does have a very nice ring to it. 
 In his Preface, Feynman admits that these lectures were aimed at "the most intelligent students" coming out of high school into Caltech.  He also admits that many students had trouble with the content judging from their performance on the examinations and said that his system of lectures is "a failure".  I agree with Feynman.  These lectures are very hard to understand.  Partly the lectures, prepared in early 1960s, suffer from being rather dated.  Mostly though this material is presented in a confusing way, with lots of complicated mathematics that often hinders comprehension.  I recommend getting a basic college textbook instead (Physics for Scientists and Engineers by Wolfson and Pasachoff is a good choice) 
 Graves goes on about scaring the student with such phrases as "plunging immediatley into frantic production of your own thing."  The entire book is a number tricks. I don't object to "tricks" if the ends result in  a good drawing. The first rule of art is ; there no rules. I agree with many of Graves' didactic, time tested academic step by step progress. However what I see here is not unlike many of the popular TV how to draw/paint....Like ME. In fact Graves' drawings are rather poor. His concepts about tone and form are sound. My fear is that is that want of the student to advance in there truest of artforms; the charcoal drawing. It is the purest of all medium. The art of drawing is the most important vehicle to which the artist can move on to painting, printmaking etc.; not that that is even important. A good drawing can stand alone and equal to any painting. If you really wish to draw well I would suggest "The Natural way to Draw" which is also very exercize driven and only people who truly want to draw well will follow this regimine. Nicholides does not present his own work as an example of how to draw; but rather chooses to present and challenge the student to work and work hard. I believe this a better way in which to convey the principles of draughtsmanship. 
 This series may be good for a laugh. Some of the writing is engaging.   But the premise is absurd.   WHY, in this day and age, should anyone accept the world-view of the Bible? A book that tells us to buy and sell slaves, stone our wives to death if they accept some other tribe's beliefs, and subordinate our minds to an absolute despot up in the clouds of Mt. Sinai?   In a sense, Bible believers have been "left behind" since the 1700s Enlightenment. Tom Paine's "The Age of Reason" showed the God of the Bible to be a cruel, vindictive monster. And what did Thomas Jefferson call the book of Revelations? "The ravings of a madman."   Read this series, if you like. Enjoy parts of it. But make no mistake: to take any of this seriously, you have to regress to a prehistoric world-view, before men learned to think, to ask questions; before logic or science -- a time when dazed, superstitious primitives believed stars could fall to the earth, if they didn't grovel humbly enough to their supposed god.   Do the absurdities and contradictions bother no one? When the "sheep" are raptured up to heaven, their clothes are left behind. So heaven is a nudist colony?   The basic contradiction, of course, lies in using worldly action (some of it exciting) to proselytize for the unworldly, the supernatural.   But why should we care whether any of the "good" guys gets killed? And why should THEY mind -- won't they go straight up to heaven? That's what they WANT, isn't it? Why even lift a finger against the "bad" guys -- didn't Christ say, "Resist not evil"?   Worried about who will win? "God" is infinitely powerful. So Jesus (who is 1/3 of God -- or something like that) is sure to win when Armageddon rolls around, in book 12 of the series. And the "sheep" -- the believers -- will happily worship him, looking just like the pictures of dim-witted, bovine people you see in the tracts Jehovah's Witnesses leave at your door.   The going price for a used copy of "Tribulation Force" is one cent. Does that tell you something?   Actually, the story-telling is worth more. The basic premise is worth less. Perhaps it averages out 
 That part alone was not a redeeming factor for the film. I'm not going to even get into the fact that the actors performances were dull to say the least, or that the plot from beginning to end was lackluster. I actually wasted $3.99 renting this schlock on ON DEMAND. Boy, do I want my 4 bucks back. Basically, all this movie was about was five crackheads running around playing crackhead games. If I wanted to see that, I could have saved my money and walked around the corner. Furthermore, I could have got a camcorder and made a movie about a bunch of fiends sitting around the house babbling about nonsense for two hours!! Would have saved millions. To sum up, I would like to advise folks to please avoid this as if it was the Ebola virus!! 
   Just because some folks don't resemble human two-leggers and only have a hickory nut for a head doesn't mean they aren't real people all the same! Miss Hickory, a doll-like plaything belonging to Ann of the Old Place, maintains her dignity and self-respect during a long New Hampshire Winter. Shocked by the news that the Brown family has moved to Boston until late Spring, Miss Hickory relies on her woodland companions and her own ingenuity to survive without her corncob house.     The relations between Miss Hickory and Crow, Squirrel, Groundhog, a cat named Mr. T., Hen Pheasant and Robin provide light reading for children of a simpler era with its gentle pleasures and few dangers.  Underlying themes include the value of friendship and relaizing when not to be hardheaded.  Prim and resourceful Miss Hickory learns to recognize her own shortcomings and to trust to trust her friends, as she seeks to make a new life in the apple orchard.  This charming story offers literary safety in our modern age with its myriad threats to childhood innocence.  
 After a night of passion with Gabriel Jones (the gentleman who had hired her to photograph his collection), photographer Venetia Milton is saddened to read that Gabriel has lost his life in a fire. Deciding to make use of this opportunity, Venetia poses as Gabriel's widow and moves her family to London, where she opens a new portrait shop. Imagine her surprise then when Gabriel walks into to drawing room many months later, very much alive. Apparently, someone wants access to some papers that they think Gabriel has, and he had pretended to play dead in order to discover who had tried to kill him. But now, with Venetia pretending to be his widow, Gabriel is afraid that the killer will come after Venetia. Venetia is stunned, and a little miffed that her plans have come crashing down around her; after all a live husband was the last thing she expected to have to contend with. But with her life, and potentially that of her loved ones at stake, Venetia will have to put her ire behind her and work with Gabriel. But can she? For Venetia has secrets that she'd rather not share, esp with the man she's so terribly attracted to...  I know that the last few novels by Amanda Quick haven't exactly been stellar ones --esp when one compares them with her earlier work "Seduction," "Scandal, etc. But there's always been something, even in her less than stellar works for one to grab onto -- a good storyline, good chemistry between the hero and heroine, suspense. This time around, however, everything seems very flat and very formulaic. The storyline is a variation of one that has been used a number of times, the chemistry between the hero (Gabriel) and the heroine (Venetia) is almost nonexistent, and the villain of the piece not only sticks out a mile (the villain might as well have carried a sign saying "here I stand, come and get me.") Who would have thought that there would come the day when I would actually give an Amanda Quick novel 2 stars?   The shame of it was that the storyline, although it was much used intrigue/mystery subplot, had quite a bit going for it. However, while one can overlook the fact that an author has much used a very familiar subplot, slightly harder to overlook is the fact that the interaction between the hero and heroine in "Second Sight" lacked sparkle. From the manner in which the first few chapters unfolded, I rather thought that I was going to like Venetia quite a bit -- she seemed intelligent and very capable. But while, thank goodness, Amanda Quick did not allow her heroine to behave in an extremely foolish manner even once, she did make her seem rather obtuse at times. Gabriel, on the other hand, was easy to like and take to, even if his character was under-developed -- and really, one has little choice but to approve of a hero who possesses a sense of humour. All in all, though, this was a disappointing read: the historical aspect was mere wall papering (and although I realize that for many readers this is not a priority. I rather like a little more detail in these historical novels), the suspense was lacking, as was the chemistry between Venetia and Gabriel, and the storyline just lacked energy and vivacity. If you are a fan, by all means read this book, but be forewarned, it is nothing like her earlier works. If you've never picked up an Amanda Quick romance novel, than choose one of her earlier works instead (esp her "S" series), you won't be disappointe 
 I am amazed at the positive reviews I have read about this book. Unfortunately, I took their advice and bought it.  The book tries to follow the approach of teaching by example by developing compiler/interpreter components and utilities in C++. Unfortunately, the book reads more like a computer program printout, and rapidly becomes too boring to follow.  There is very little theoretical background to the concepts behind creating compilers and interpreters. Attemping to learn from the C++ code will rapidly confirm that the code is of very poor quality, and seems to be a bodged conversion from C rather than a native C++ development.  Avoid this book at all costs. It is especially dangerous for C++ novices as following the code will teach bad practices and lead you to believe that C++ is just C with classes. It is useless for experienced C++ programmers who wish to learn about compiler/interpreter programming techniques 
 This movies rates right up there with "Schindler's List" . . . in terms of unapologetic propaganda.  Fortunately, Ted Turner showed some remorse for this hatchet job by making "Gettysburg," and the even better "Gods and Generals."  If you want to see a real, accurate depiction of the War For Southern Independence (aka, The Civil War), watch "Gods and Generals" or "Gone With The Wind," and stay away from movie garbage like "Andersonville."    Also watch for the extended version DVD of "Gods and Generals" coming for the Christmas season of 2005. 
 This book was a great disappointment to me.  The author has fallen into the trap of reading what she needs from her sources, whether they provide the evidence she wants or not.  I will admit I couldn't finish the first chapter and it may improve further along, but her rational for her conclusions escapes me.  The handwritten recipe books/journals/scrapbooks she studied could have provided a fascinating look at how women's lives and priorities have changed over the centuries, but her insistence on broad societal conclusions from these very personal documents left me cold.  When she directly discussed the documents and individuals she did a wonderful job, but when she tried to apply to the society at large their was a huge gap between her evidence and her conclusions 
 This guy is obsessed with vegetable shortening.  Talk about bland cookies.  Not to mention "1001" is a total lie.  Anyone notice the 'repeat' recipes with cleverly (yeah right) disguised new names?  Snickerdoodles, Nibbles and Cinnamon Balls are EXACTLY the SAME recipes...  just in a different ORDER in printing.  So are the Mexican Wedding Cakes (what a clever name for the IDENTICAL second version: in Spanish!).  Funny that the author talks about his father on his deathbed confessing his 'secret' ingredient in the 'best' chocolate chip cookies.  you guessed it: SHORTENING!  Whatever happened to butter.. 
 I have noticed that of the very few reviews written on this book none of them were writen by the actual teens that the book is written for. I read this book a few days ago and it took every ounce of my self-controll not to throw it on the ground and spit on it. Through the whole book I got the distinct feeling that the author remembers nothing of what it is like to be a teenager or if they do than they were one of those teens that I feel like throttling when they pick fights with friends just to create drama in their otherwise meaningless lives.  The charectors in this book have these totally unreasonable reactions to everything that happens. I wish that I had not read this book and I only did because I was reviewing it for a program that my mother does as a librarian. If there are any teens out there reading this review and pondering whether or not to read this book I recomend that you steer clear of this one and go pick up something a little more worth your time. You will only glare at the back of the book with a bad taste in your mouth when you are done. I felt like the author was constlantly thinking the whole time while writing 'Remember these kids are stupid scum and don't think for themselves at all, I should make the kids in my book like that.' It absolutely drives me insane when adults talk down through their writting. The only good thing I can say about this book is that it is a quick read. It took me only 3 or so hours to read, but the bad side of that is that's 3 hours of my life that I will never get back 
 One of the most socially divisive works I have ever read.  In it Angela clearly continues establishment efforts to try to guilt trip America into giving her and other minorities a free pass to commit their own form of oppression in this day and age.  Not worth the sitting required to read it 
 Conscious Acts of Creation: The Emergence of a new Physics by William A. Tiller, Walter E. Dibble, and Michael J. Kohane.  Publisher: Quality Books Inc. pages - 418  I like and don't like this book. It's billed as a book written for physics, but also applicable to people into metaphysics. But the problem is that the writing for this book is not intended for a general audience. It's intended for an audience that has a developed awareness of the highly technical language of physics and math. As such many people into metaphysics will have a hard time reading this book. I did. I had to read and reread many sections to try and understand the language being used.  A big part of the problem is that the organtization of this book's chapters is highly erratic. The authors jump around a lot. I actually understood a few of the final chapters, but only because the language was more general. I think it would have served the authors better to have put those chapters in the beginning of the text. Also none of the terms and acronyms were well defined or spelled out. A glossary would've done wonders for this book.  In defense of the book the ideas being worked with are intriguing and the authors did perk my interest and keep me reading...the problem is that while this book could interest a large audience of people, it can only have a big impact on a much smaller audience because of the highly technical language, bizarre layout, and lack of cohesion. As such the potential good this book could do is marred by the inability of the authors to write in a more accessible manner.  I did manage to understand a fair amount of this book, but I can only chalk that up to reading up a lot on physics and science. I only hope that the authors' other books are more accessible.  Regrettably I have to give this book two stars out of five and recommend to the authors that they work with an editor who can help them with layout issues and with language (in terms of making the language more accessible to a wider audience) 
 Since I have received this piece of s**t I have had to call twice because parts were either damaged or not working.  You have to call several times to get through to a customer service rep and they never answer when you leave a message 
 When I read the Constance Garnett translation of this novel 15 years ago, it became on of my favorites. But when I was reading the Larissa Volokhonsky, Richard Pevear translation I had trouble staying with the book for any length of time. So I switched to the David McDuff translation and I really began to enjoy the book again. I just think that Volokhonsky and Pevear don't write english very well. Frankly, there are frequent times when their translations make no sense at all. There was a big marketing effort behind the publications of their translations, and I bought into it. I liked the blurbs on the back covers, and tried reading some of their russian translations. But once I got into the habit of comparing translations, I saw that McDuff, Jessie Coulson, and others write much more readable translations.  These books aren't easy to get through; and I would hate to see someone discouraged by a poor translation. I recommend comparing one paragraph in two translations if you can. You'll notice the difference, and be able to pick out the translation that's right for you 
 When I heard this CD all I kept wishing after the first intros to every song was "next please" hoping that each succeeding cut would improve the situation.  Suffice it to say that the situation DID NOT improve.  
 After already reading 2 of Rachel Ashwell's books I decided the third was one too many.  These ideas already appeared in her show or other books.  I think we all know how creative Rachel is, what a great mom she is, what her pallette consists of, that she can afford to shop all over the world, etc.  Enough already!  Don't waste your time.  Martha Stewart has more creative ideas 
 If The Purpose Driven Church is the "what" and "why" of the church growth movement and all things Purpose Driven, Transitioning represents the "how." "If the thought of switching from a traditional church to a purpose-driven church leaves you with mingled feelings of excitement and fear, good! It means that, as a pastor, you know the incalculable worth of aligning your church with God's vision...Transitioning is written for you." (From the back cover). We also learn from the cover that the book will help a pastor and congregation navigate change and attain rewards that far exceed the risk. Essentially, this book is a how-to guide for changing an existing church from program-driven to purpose-driven. It is written by Dan Southerland, but endorsed by Rick Warren who says that Southerland's church is "one of the most exciting and encouraging examples of transitioning from being program driven to purpose driven." (From the foreward)  I always take the time to read the author's bio that is generally on the back cover of a book as it usually outlines the author's credentials, providing the reader with some confidence that the author is worth learning from. As if to emphasize the concerns of those who believe that the church growth movement is driven by pragmatism, the author's bio says "Dan Southerland is the pastor/teacher at Flamingo Road Church in Fort Lauderdale, Florida - a purpose-driven, contemporary congregation that has grown from 300 in 1989 to over 2,300 today and launched seventeen other churches." The author's sole credential is that he has made the Purpose Driven principles work by seeing the requisite numerical growth.  I have little doubt that this book can help many churches move from being "program-driven" (which is synonymous with "traditional") to purpose-driven. There is a logical model to follow, there are plenty of practical examples, and many blanks to fill in as part of the workbook section in the back. Those who believe that Purpose Driven churches are the wave of the future, will find much here to praise and imitate. Those who believe Purpose Driven churches are tearing the Christian world to pieces will similarly find plenty to support their belief. I am no lover of Purpose Driven principles, so allow me to point out some of my foremost concerns with the book.  First, the principles within this book are steeped in pragmatism. What works is elevated far above what Scripture teaches. If it works, in the author's view, it must be good. This is, of course, consistent with The Purpose Driven Church which is modeled as much on Peter Drucker as on the Bible.  Second, the author misuses Scripture. In a vain attempt to lend Scriptural credence to the book, the author bases the process of transition on the model of Nehemiah, who led the Israelites in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem. Many of these parallels are forced and the Scripture simply does not support the conclusions. For example, when discussing the reality and inevitability of opposition, Southerland writes about Sanballat and his opposition to Nehemiah's work (see Nehemiah chapters 2 and 4). Of course there is vast difference between opposition raised by a hostile unbeliever and a concerned believer! Southerland, though, groups all those who oppose change as Sanballats.  Third, the author does away with biblical models of leadership. One of the necessary steps in moving to a Purpose Driven church is to make the church staff led instead of committee/deacon led. Rather than having a plurality of elders, a church should have a vision team which is composed of dreamers and power brokers, so that the church becomes led by those who dream big and those who have the money and power within the church.  Fourth, the churches the author proposes are custom-built to appeal to a very limited element of society. It is not mere chance that the author's church had the average age of attender fall nearly 20 years over his transition period. The church was custom made to appeal to a certain element of society at the expense of others. Who is building and planting churches designed to appeal to the elderly?  Fifth, there is little consideration given to whether this transition is right or biblical. We are to blindly accept that it is the way to do church and to begin the process, regardless of what other church members may desire. The first step in transition is creating a vision. This teaching about vision is something that is in-line with the teachings of Schuller, Warren, Wilkinson, Blackaby and the New Age - we are to dream a big dream, call it vision, and raise that up as our standard. Decisions are made and programs are accepted or rejected based on their conformity to this vision. Yet this vision is created by a man. He may ascribe it to God and it may be biblical, but it needs to be regarded as a lower standard than the Word of God!  Sixth, the method is brutal in its dealing with opposition. There is no latitude given for those who oppose the change, even if they object on biblical grounds. Criticism is viewed as inevitable and unfortunate, but ultimately an attack on God Himself. The pastor is cautioned to remain on track with the change and not allow opposers to derail the process.  Those are a few of my concerns. Ultimately, if you are committed to being Purpose Driven, this book may help you avoid making some costly mistakes in transitioning your church, but I would urge you to spend some time studying the biblical concerns of the opponents of this movement. Determine for yourself if this movement is pleasing to God and if it really does represent the way God would have us "do church." For those who are opposed to the movement this book has little value. It does provide an interesting case study of the Purpose Driven Church in action but it will merely add fuel to your fire. There must be some better way to spend your money 
 The book does not go far enough to make it useful to most readers. It  would have been easy to provide additional information on the Constitution,  the signers, etc..., but instead the author(s) took the easy route and  simply reprinted the document! Very weak book. Not work the money 
 This was the 5th book I've read by Jodi Picoult, and the one I liked the least. I was intrigued by the subject of the book, as I have been with all of the subjects she has written about. But, this story did not measure up to my expectations at all.   This book was supposed to focus on the question of mercy killing, and could you/would you kill someone you loved if they asked you to because they were ill and had been suffering for a long time. One of the main characters is Cam MacDonald, who is the sheriff of Wheelock, Mass. Cam's cousin Jamie arrives in town and promptly turns himself in to Cam, citing that he has just murdered his wife. Later, you learn she had been battling cancer for a while and allegedly asked Jamie to kill her. So naturally Jamie has to go on trial.   Well, a majority of the book turns out to be about Cam's adultery, which is annoying in and of itself. It seems like adultery is romanticized in this novel and made to seem 'ok' since, as you discover, Cam is disillusioned with his life and is only sheriff because he inherited the position and it's expected of him. Plus, the person he has the affair with, he has known a day or so, which is ridiculous.   Interspersed throughout all of this, almost seeming like an afterthought, is content dealing with the actual subject the book was supposed to cover.   I was very bored with this book, but continued to read it, thinking it was bound to pick up eventually. It never did. As it turned out, I ended up skimming the last 80 pages. If I were you, I'd pick another novel.   
 I remember reading "The Chamber" distinctly. Somehow, this book doesnt even near that standard. The story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns. The characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out 
 I believe this book is dangerous because it DOES have wisdom in it and DOES have some Biblical teaching- but intermingled with that are false teachings and concepts that will easily lead a struggling Christian parent astray. My heart aches for all those who gave this book fantastic reviews and said it changed the way they parent their children.  One thing that tipped me off about this book was how the author uses the verses in Proverbs to justify a Biblical mandate for spanking. He says that if we do not spank our children, we are disobeying God. No one should claim to know God's will so absolutely, especially based on his own intrepretation of a few verses. I actually am not opposed to spanking, done appropriately. But I do not believe that the "rod of correction" referred to in the Bible means that spanking is the only way to discipline a child. To me the rod is symbolic of any form of godly, loving discipline.   I am somewhat suspicious that the reason many parents are thrilled with this book is because it has given them a handbook for parenting- telling them how to handle their children in a practical manner that fits with their beliefs as a Christians. As Christians we strongly believe in raising our children to love and obey God- which is why it's so tempting to pick up a book like this and believe everything the author says. It's easy that way! And also very dangerous!  Please, pray and seek God's wisdom as you read through the reviews. Please consider purchasing a different book and always listen to the gentle leading of the Lord over the teachings of man. 
 THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT THIS PUBLISHERS EDITION NOT ABOUT THE BOOKS CONTENT ITSELF.  If you want to know about the content--- be aware that this book is copyright free and in the public domain and you can actually read the entire text free, online, if you are curious about the content of the book and what it is about. I am a person who prefers a real, bound book in the hand to reading on the computer screen or printing off a book onto computer paper.  I learned about this book as it is popular with homeschoolers using the Charlotte Mason method.  This book weaves science content into a story format (narrative format).  About this edition of the book--buyer beware!  I am very annoyed. I saw that Amazon sells three different publishers' versions of reprints of this very old book, before I purchased the book from Amazon.  Of course I am mad at myself for making a mistake, but I am also not happy with the way Amazon markets this Kessinger Publishing's version of this book.  I have had issues in the past with facsimile reprints of antique books sometimes being very hard to read. I took time to research this. I wanted whichever publisher's version has a readable font that is clearly printed.  The way Amazon presently has this item (book reprinted by Kessinger Publishing) set up on their webpage, I thought I was looking inside this book. Imagine my surprise when the book arrived and the printing itself is horrible! I can't stand to read this! Upon double checking this now, I see I made a simple mistake--if you don't want to make the same mistake that I made please read on...  It appears that this Kessinger Publishing version is a facsimile reproduction of the original. The old font type is hard to read. But the more problematic thing is that the ink is blobby and uneven. Specifically, I mean that some parts of the letters are missing (there is white space) while others are blobbed so that the letters don't look as they should, they are black blobs in some parts. I would prefer a book whose text is clearly visible. A modern font is also usually easier on the eyes.  I am very annoyed as this is not even the cheapest price edition of this book which is currently in print! Come to find out there are cheaper versions with nicer and easier to read font!  I am upset with Amazon additionally as the way they have this set up to "look inside this book" brings you to the edition published by the publisher "Yesterday's Classics" which has what looks to be a great font, a nice, clear, modern font and a good printing job. (Also today I received a different book purchased from Amazon by the publisher "Yesterday's Classics" and it is a wonderful printing job and a a nice binding to boot.  I will be returning this book to Amazon. Too bad I have to pay the shipping to return it to them! 
 but this is not saying mcuh because the rest are very bad. What each of these books needs are realy thoughtful thinkers who know philosophy, who i n this case know Seinfeld, and who have sense of humor to go with insights. Writers are dull, take themselves too seriously even when they have something okay to say 
 Short Cuts (Robert Altman, 1992)  There's a chap you may have heard of by the name of Joe Frank. He does wonderful, hysterically strange radio dramas that will leave you bug-eyed in fascination at the sheer weirdness of the characters therein. Frank is a master at what he does.  There's another chap you may have heard of by the name of Raymond Carver. He wrote wonderful, hysterically strange short stories (and the occasional poem) that will leave you bug-eyed in fascination at the sheer weirdness of the characters within. Carver, too, was a master at what he did.  Then there is Robert Altman, who decided to take a number of the short stories in Carver's watershed book, Cathedral, and turn them into a three-hour film. The result is Short Cuts. It is neither wonderful nor hysterically strange, and while it has echoes of both the Carver stories on which it is based and the ludicrous extremes of Joe Frank, it cannot claim to achieve the mastery of either of them.  I mention Joe Frank because there are certain scenes in the movie, the occasional moment, that remind me of Frank's work. Altman is capable of achieving with visual techniques what Frank achieves with his dialogue-- the ability to make the viewer wonder what sort of insane mind could possibly put this sort of thing together. But where Frank does it on a constant basis, these moments are all too rare in Short Cuts. The rest of this far, far too long flick consists of a number of very, very good actors going through their paces in a stangely listless manor, talking a lot and not actually doing all that much. There are a few very good performances (Jack Lemmon, in a small role, stands out), but the net effect of putting together this many fantastic actors in one film is to dilute the whole.  Even if everyone here gave top-notch performances, however, it still wouldn't help. The movie just wanders, never settling on a single storyline long enough to do it justice (the obvious comparison here is to Pulp Fiction, which does that trick so well), cutting from storyline to storyline as fast and loose as Romero's Dawn of the Dead cuts between camera angles. While some of this movie is undeniably fascinating, and it's competently put together, it could have been so much better than it actually is. * 
 I hoped to find a great amount of content from this Catholic Priest. I have long suffered the issues of guilt in the same religion and the fear of God was about being afraid of messing up in life rather than having a healthy fear of the Lord.  Father Tom accurately describes that guilt issue. However, instead of expressing how he found the Lord to be a forgiving God and that we are in need of accepting His grace, Tom moves into a diatribe of Panentheism and peppers most of the book with this type of theology that has proven inconsistent in and of itself. If you don't know, Panentheism is a way of explaining that "Everything is in God". At the surface that sounds great. But there is more to it. It also ascribes that God is so intertwined in the creation that he cannot live apart from it. Man. That is a leap...since God is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow, and He was so BEFORE he made the earth.  OK>..so you see. Tom moves away from a real answer to the guilt issue to explain a theology that has no foundation in truth.  If you want the guilt answer...doooo noooott buy this book. Instead, buy a bible. Holman Press just came out with a great one. Read the first few verses of Romans chapter 8. Then buy a couple of great commentaries that discuss them. If you want the short answer. Hear it is. "We are not ever going to be good enough. And that is OK. God forgives all of us. Just accept that fact." Don't stop trying though. It helps others see the Good in GOD when they see it. Being good is not for going to heaven. It is to help show others that there is a good God to go to heaven to see! 
 The under read writers in this anthology should be very grateful for Peter Jackson, the director of Bad Taste whose studio franchise benefits them. But Tolkien would have found little to admire here, consider Ursula Leguin a feminist academic bandied about in the political science department at U.C. Berkley and editor of The Oxford Book of Science Fiction, which is just a collection leftist propaganda. Tolkien who disliked newspapers and barely ever read them would have found the hyper contemporizing mis-readings here incomprehensible 
 There are a whole bunch of burger cookbooks out this spring and I bought three. This one came in third; pictures were kind of bland, and recipes seemed vaguely familiar. Nothing too original here. The others had ideas that I never would have thought of. Burgers Every Way and The Great Big Burger Book are better collections of new ways to make burgers 
 I'm a Cho fan, and consider "I'm the One that I Want" to be just about the best stand-up act ever made... If you like Cho, you definitely HAVE to see that one, her first release. This second one is quite possibly the WORST stand-up act ever made. The lady definitely goes to extremes.  Where to begin? The lighting is poor, she looks like she's had a few too many, her jokes are stale reruns, and she's just plain off. I don't know what happened here, but she obviously does not understand the concept of Quality Control.  I made a special trip to Atlanta to see this one, being a big fan, and this is one of the ticket purchases that finally made me resolve NEVER AGAIN to buy movie tickets and just wait until things come out on DVD and I can rent them cheaply. Because, most movies are crap!  Two stars instead of one because of probably misguided and irrelevant residual gratitude left over from her first stand-up DVD 
 After reading this book it became obvious to me that the author has many unresolved issues with her religious life and with Christianity.  Even though she sheds some insight about whom or what MM was, she did so in a negative and sometimes condescending  way.    I was somewhat hurt by the character assignation she did on JC.  Obviously, she had made Jesus an idol of worship instead of the holy man he was and therefore took it upon herself to shatter that idol in this book.  The very thing she blames the Church in doing - making Jesus an idol - she has done herself.  The Jesus she spoke of in this book is not the Jesus I have come to know and love.  It is very easy to take words out of context and use them in a way to indicate hostility when in effect no hostility was meant.  It is easy to come to false conclusions and premises when one's perception is skewed by one's personal beliefs and emotions.  Jesus was human, but that does not take away from the divination of his being.  If Jesus was so humanly perfect then it would conclude that none of us could ever walk in his footsteps.  None of us would have a chance of experiencing heaven. That is ludicrous. 
 What do we have here? Yet another "deathcore" band that steals riffs from At the Gates, adds blastbeats, and places "breakdowns" in the music. Are people getting tired of this genre yet? My advice is to listen to the Scandinavian Melodic Death Metal bands they are mimicking, and leave this unoriginal tripe to 15 year old scene kids.  It also saddens me to hear people are referring to this band as technical. Most of these riffs aren't hard to play if you know how to hammer on and pull off, and were in essence done over a decade ago by bands like At the Gates and Dark Tranquillity. If you want to hear some death metal that truly is complex, melodic, and intelligent, stick with Nile, Decapitated, Behemoth or Necrophagist.  I'm not denying this band has talent. They are just severely lacking in originality 
 I loved living in 1910 Vienna - the book was wonderfully researched, and was masterful at portraying the characters and times.  And, the mystery grabbed ahold and held on - and seemed like it was really going to have a "whammo" ending.  But no - and don't you feel like you've wasted a bunch of time when that happens.  In this case, the read was interesting enough that I don't feel totally robbed, but disappointed - oh yeah!  Most of all, I was lured by the title and the search for the fig tree, which seemed to gain in significance with each page, only to end in a total fizzle.  We found it - so what?  This book had such potential - what a shame.  Surely someone along the way - agent, editor, publisher - read it and saw its shortcomings.  With all the glowing reviews, one wonders if anybody really read it.  Jody, fire them all and start with a new crew.  You are a great writer and I'll take a shot at your next one 
 Of course everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I suspect the people who gave this book 5 stars are either friends of the author or work for Princeton Press.  The back cover promises a book that "brings the same keen eye and clear explanations to bear on the most prevalent, and maybe the most subtle and least understood, system of visual organization". Well, maybe if you have Kimberly Elam by your side in a classroom walking you through each of the examples in the book, but certainly not if you're trying to make sense of the book on your own.  In fact, there are practically no "clear explanations" in the book. The author mentions a few basic concepts in passing but that's not enough to teach you anything. And a bunch of examples thrown at you without any sort of pedagogic scaffolding does little more than frustrate you 
 this book uber awesome. there is absolutely nothing bad i can say about it. i think every one should have a copy of this book. I have one negative thing to say about it though. it sucked, thats why i gave it one star. I hate the world!!! 
 Back in the days of poorly written, bloated, snippet-heavy textbooks, Dummies stood out as friendly, approachable, and simple. However, another generation of clearly written introductory programming books, with advanced yet well-explained code, shows that clarity and good writing supercede cartoons and wonky humor. Probably yoru best best in learning C is to borrow several C books from the library, and find the one that best suits your style. Dummies for C may be worth reading, but I selected another book to actually learn from 
 I'm facinated by business and marrying the Kingdom of God to the topic of business really captured my attention. I couldn't wait to read the book. Each chapter was dissapointing with few, new thoughts. I think college students and those new to business may find this useful but those who have already spent much time in business or considering how business and the glory of God go together may not find much new to chew on here. I believe the author is a professor and not a businessman--which may be why he didn't deliver as much as I had hoped 
 Book's key point: God will reward you 10,000 fold in heaven (in heavenly possessions and stature) for what you give up and away in this life.  If you want to learn more than a spirit of greed, "Give for what you can get from God", you'll learn a lot more elsewhere.  God won't likely give you a good return on your giving if you give from a motive of personal greed for heavenly rewards and stature, as this book came across to me as promoting. The author also came across as noting clearly more than once that his ministry would be delighted to be the recipient of your giving.  The book would have done better by instead inspiring a spirit of "love", as in "love your neighbor as yourself", as the motive for giving. That motive I'm sure God will honor and reward 
 Just rented this dvd and was quite surprised.  Normally, I'm a big George Clooney and Matt Damon fan.  However, in this film, their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script, editing, and direction which made this film quite dull to watch.  While the idea behind the movie is good, it could have been more entertaing, dramatic, or suspensful.  As another reviewer remarked, I was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else.  But, I did suffer through to the end, where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging.. 
 This was the first book by Daniel Steel that I laid my hands on....Really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers. There are so many open ends in the story...chartacters are not distinctly outlined...Tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there 
 Great premise, lousy execution.  The book just never seemed to find good pacing.  The end was predictable.  This is the second book of hers I have read.  The second I have been bored by.  
 Worst book I've read all year (this is being written in late November) and strong contender for worst book of the decade.  Flat, leaden, dull prose.  Cardboard characters with no depth.  Silly little trivial asides.  No sense whatever of plotting, timing or narrative.  The author uses a true story from the pages of the Wall Street Journal as the basis for this book, but does not realize that he still has an obligation to write well and make the characters come alive -- you can't hang your words on an extoskeleton; the book has to have internal structure.  The ending is farcial, and the subplot conflict between father and son is a genuine embarassment to read.  Avoid at all costs.  I want my money back! 
 Great book, but Amazon have made a serious mistake in the description.  They say it is "Leather Bound".   It is most definitely NOT leather bound.  It is leatherette, which is not leather.  Leatherette is fake leather made from some kind of plastic.  Don't be fooled.  IT IS NOT LEATHER BOUND.  I bought one and was very disappointed.  I told Amazon, but they didn't want to know and I see they are still advertising it as leather when it is not 
 8 hours of cd's, and a nice bonus cd holder...and you will learn about ten different pick-up lines (or, how to recognize that the woman does *not* want to go for a drink with you). After 8 hours of (granted, well-articulated) repetition, you will have the phrases down pat, but it's an awful lot of time spent to only be equipped with enough phrases to get some mythical French woman to go out with you...and then have nothing further to say to her. I'm afraid I highly regret this purchase...even at a quarter of the price I would feel the same. Not to mention the hours of listening, hoping it might somehow get better. It didn't 
 My doc suggested I read this to better understand nutrition and its impact on health.  He beleves that doctors are more inclined to treat symptoms rather than underlying causes and that this shortcoming in medical education and practive is changing quickly.  But not quickly enough.  If you have an MD degree, you could breeze thru this book.  But for the average guy its like trying to read something written by an alien.  Even if you glean a good idea, you'll have a lot of trouble putting it into practice as the foods and supplements suggested are difficult to locate.  
 Facts are facts; I presume the facts in this book are accurate, if for no other reason than the editing/vetting process should have eliminated any inaccuracies. However, the author's perspective in evaluating and analyzing the facts is slanted to the point of being almost completely one-sided, lacking almost ANY objectivity. The author's perspective, regardless of his actual age, seems to be fixated in the late '60s--early '70s, where police and the like are ignorant, goose-stepping pigs, and institutions and the government are enemies of the people. The author's lack of objectivity and fairness makes this book of little merit 
 cliched and stereotyped action movie. lundgren is a mediocre actor, trying to be a director only prolongs his mediocrity but not a new territory. there's nothing special or new of this movie and i just felt quite bored when i watched it. 
 Having heard so much about how this woman was the queen of conservatives I decided to give her books a try. However after reading this, I will say, if this is how conservatives are then I feel ashamed to call myself one. She touts on and on in the book about money, and how its every mans right to it yet no mention of how greed is one of the seven deadly sins. she goes on and on about how ALL liberals lie and how they insult each other. A many conservatives and liberals alike have lied however I see her being hypocritical (As well as childish) as she throws petty insults around in this book non stop.  she speaks of how horrible people who choose abortion are and yet when people seeking an abortion see conservatives they see people trowing bombs at doctors and protesters yelling insults, not a gentle person to turn to for support and alternatives. No wonder they don't look our way for help! All the souls I have encountered and helped in this area are not people "just looking for birth control" but people who are confused, made a mistake (though jesus forgives our sins most cannot forgive themselves) and are in need of some guidance.  Whats worse is she puts everything as a generalization of the whole entire section. ALL liberals, EVERYONE. No type of people are ALL the same, no matter what term you may group them under, and this just shows more of her predjuidcice to spread hate. ALL liberals are not the same and good thing ALL conservativies are not the same as her.  Sharing your wealth and helping the poor is just as important as personal behavior. To turn  your back on the hungry is just as much a sin as anything you might do.  Luke 12:33. "Sell your possessions and give to charity; make yourselves purses which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near, nor moth destroys."  What ever happened to "thou shalt not kill"  Jesus chose non-violence, even as people threw stones at him he did not lash back, he did not return the stones, or attack others. Jesus said "love thy neighbor" he did not say for oyu to judge and hate your neighbor, God will do that as each soul reaches the pearly gates.  I don't know where this woman gets her blind sighted views but they seem more damaging then helpful. This woman is only spouting hate and making a bad name for us, I'm sure God will judge her fairly and she won't like where she is going. Until then I suggest you save your money on a better book. 
 If you're like me, you got into Boo Radleys during the shoegazer era.  I loved the discs preceding Wake Up!, especially Giant Steps.  This is as far away from shoegazer as you can get.  The first reviewer here is right on as now Carr is totally doing the Beach Boys sunny harmony thing.  Sorry, no my thing.  They could have evolved more like Catherine Wheel whom I recommend highly.  Also try Ride (of course) and Slowdive 
 This book, which has  decent plotline and some surprisingly twists and turns, ends up leaving a bitter taste in one's mouth after a while.  The main protagonist Adeline cries almost every page she is one(not an exaggeration, she really almost cries on EVERY page).  Also, though the coincidences and twists are sometimes very well-done and clever, they are so overused by the finale to become tedious and annoying.  You begin to wonder how anyone could marry anyone since EVERYONE in France seems to be someone's long lost cousin or uncle.  If you've read any of Edmund Burke's lengthly writings of the sublime, you will see it all over this book and it is about half of the endnotes.  It is understandable why this was popular in its day but also will not appeal to a modern audience who will be far more critical of the female's over the top self pity.  A great read for those who love the genre and a pain to read for everyone else, read Romance of the Forest only if you're willing to accept more instances of crying than there are pages in the whole book 
 I approached this book with great anticipation after reading a glowing review. I found I had a hard time sustaining interest in the book. I did not find the characters to be well drawn. Ms. O'Brien seemed to be so in  love with her prose that I had difficulty understanding the motivation for  her characters behavior. This seemed more an exercise in the writing of  prose than in the crafting of a novel 
 Octave Mirbeau, The Torture Garden (RE/Search, 1899)  A new edition of a nineteenth-century classic of decadence is usually a good thing, right? The problem being that nineteenth-century classics of decadence often end up reading more like Henry James-- in his long-winded later years-- than actual decadence. The Torture Garden is redeemed in this respect only by being shorter than most.  While it cannot be argued that, along with its brevity, The Torture Garden was certainly one of the most explicit books of its time, that time is long past, and one has to ask the question of whether the book has any relevance at all to the modern reader. In most cases, the answer will be no. Today, The Torture Garden is going to appeal to an extremely select group of people-- those who both hunger for the explicit and have enough tolerance for the diction of nineteenth-century writing to be able to get the explicitness out of it.  Somewhere along the way during the twentieth century, fiction got a lot less heavy on the description and replaced what was missing with an emphasis on plot. Now, normally I'm the first person to rush into the breach, screaming about how awful an idea this usually is. It leads to things like Danielle Steel selling uncounted millions of novels that are not, one presumes, being used for their most appropriate purposes (e.g., lining cat pans). However, the parallel to this is that there had to be some sort of previous description-heavy movement, and it had to lead somewhere decadent enough that the literati felt the need to rebel against it. The previous remark about Henry James in his later years is quite an excellent example of where it had led-- bloated, flowery books that weren't really about anything, in any meaningful sense of the word. The Torture Garden is one of these, minus (thankfully) some of the bloat, and literally flowery. There is much breast-beating, a good deal of horror (in the beginning, anyway) at the thought of women showing their ankles in public, the common trope of a faraway country (in this case, China) being picked as a setting because no one really knew all that much about it, and a whole lot of description, but underneath, there's really nothing at all. Worse, Mirbeau seems to have decided to ignore such things as continuity (contrast, for example, the endless, intensely boring frame at the beginning of the novel with its final page, and wonder how the narrator got from point B to point A). To the reader of the modern pornographic novel, this will not be new. In fact, it's a mark that's branded the cheap, low-quality pornographic novel... well, seemingly at least since the turn of the twentieth century. * 
 Don't even think about gettin' this on 
 1. Not all Wiccans are Witches. (Practice Wicthcraft) 2. Not all Witches are Wiccan. (Practice the Wiccan Religion) 3. We do NOT worship the devil, the devil is a Christian concept and has no place in Wicca.(Unless said Wiccan is also, Christian. Which is perfectly acceptable) Satanism is not a branch of Wicca for the same reason. 4. We have a "Do unto others" rule which extends to animals as well. 5. Wiccans practice tolerance. (Something many people should learn to practice themselves.) 6. We are an aultruistic religion.   There are so many other facts, and things that people should know about some religions before making decisions about a persons religion. As with any religion there are people that are associated with it that are less than desirable, but you can not judge a religion as a whole based on a few bad seeds. (i.e. Muslins, Christians, Catholics)I don't believe anyone should bash anyone elses religious beliefs, or badger them about the way they choose to believe. Do more research on any given religion before making any sort of determination about that relgion or subject. That means read more than one type of research material. If you want to find out something about anything, look outside of the box. Of course, if you read only materials against a topic all of your information will be negative. I am tired of people and their judgements based on one sided information. We are all people and we all deserve to be treated as such with all of the respect anyone of any race, creed, color, gender, or religious affiliation. By all means educate your children about different relgions, but do it in a manner to where you have all of the facts both pros and cons from many sources. Religion being a highly personal thing causes many debates, step back and let your children and others decide which religion is best for them. Never push any of your beliefs on others it doesn't help your cause and only makes the person to turn away more. For example my grandma used to litterally drag my mother to church every sunday, kicking and screaming. My mother practices no religion and is not very religious at all and she says it is because of her negative experiences being a christian. It's sad but it happens 
           The major prediction   made by Glassman and Hassett in this book,written in 1999,was that"A sensible target date for Dow 36,000 is early 2005,but it could be reached much earlier"(1999,p.140).This fantastic science fiction forecast,like the similar 1999 fiction forecasts of Abby Joseph Cohen, Elias(1999)and Kadlec(1999),was mathematically and economically impossible since the single best predictor of future stock market values is the rate of growth in gdp(gross domestic product).To obtain a Dow of 36,000 by 2005 at the latest would have required continuous quarterly gdp growth rates of 7%-8% from 1999 through 2005.Starting in late 1999(Sept.,1999) through March,2000,the 3 wisemen,Warren Buffett,George Soros,and Peter Lynch,liquidated all of the stocks in their portfolios and exited the market.They transferred their cash to other assets.Unfortunately,far too many financial investors failed to follow them out of all of the stock markets and ended up losing about 8 trillion dollars.The best long treatment of stock market behavior is the 3 rd edition of C.P.Kindleberger's Manias,Panics,and Crashes(1996).His major point was that you automatically have a bubble once you start hearing  claims that there is a new economy that represents a complete break with all past market fundamentals.This was precisely the claim made by Gilder,Laffer,Wanniski,Glassman and Hassett,Elias,Kadlec,etc. Paul Samuelson's 1996 prediction-"Sometime in the next five years you may kick yourself for not reading and re-reading Kindleberger's Manias,Panics,and Crashes"-hit the nail on the head.The best short treatment is still chapter 12 of John Maynard Keynes's 1936 The General Theory of Employment,Interest and Money 
 I have not read the book but tried to listen to the audiotape version and found it hopelessly tedious. Some of the problem may be as a reviewer of the CD version mentioned, that the author has no gift for narration.   The mix of Buddhism and psychology, two subjects I usually find interesting, doesn't work, at least as far as I got - two tapes on - before I stopped listening.   The Buddhism focused on the author's near obsession with the Zen tea ceremony, which she describes in a way that makes it sound about as spiritual as operating a Mister Coffee. Whatever she gets out of the tea ceremony, she is not communicating it here. And if you are not fascinated with the Zen tea ceremony this book may not be for you.   Meanwhile, the psychological bits are mostly based on case studies of the type that an old newspaperman used to call the "suspicious anecdote." The author always seems to be a heroic therapist, and the patient seems to attain Buddha-like insights within minutes of their encounter. The stories sound like outtakes from a "can-you-top-this" contest in the bar of a psychotherapists' convention.   In the end, listening to this book felt like having my teeth cleaned by a well-meaning but ham-handed dental hygienist. The best part was the Zen silence after I stopped listening.     
 I have enjoyed many of Anne Tyler's books, particularly, "Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant," "Breathing Lessons" and "Back When We Were Grownups".  "Saint Maybe" was a huge disappointment.  The plot and characters were mediocre at best, and a bizarre religion, The Church of the Second Chance, played a major part in the story. By the end of the book, it had completely taken over.  The Church of the Second Chance fell somewhere between a strict religion and a cult.  Yes, Ian Bedloe was close to a saint for looking after three children for the best part of his life, but why the book was named, "Saint Maybe" is still a mystery to me.  One of the children in Ian's care made reference to Ian as perhaps being "Saint Maybe," but who the heck is Saint Maybe??  The closest I could come up with is "MAYBE you will finish the book... and MAYBE you won't! 
 If an author choses to write a politcally charged novel, there will be bias. What I look for is some balance in the arguments. But, like his brother Rush, David writes with blinders on and misses the obvious contradictions in his arguments. The Democrats are not like Republicans! Of course not. The current Republican party is overwhelmingly an ideological, lock-step plutocratic mob who won't tolerate open discussion of an issue. Democrats on the other hand are diverse, open minded and welcoming of new ideas and thoughts. David Limbaugh would have you believe that is chaos. Open, intelligent discussions are what is missing in the Republican party right now.  A book does not have to be well written to put across the author's theme, and the ideas he is promoting, but when it is dully written, poorly researched and obvious in its misinterpretation of issues and situations it is difficult to give it much credence.  Basically I have read this book before, several times. There is nothing new, in fact it sounds like a few days of Rush on the radio, usually wrong and overwhelmingly insulting to anyone who can think for themself.  So, all I see here is an poorly written dull diatribe of the same old propaganda from the right - "Don't confuse us with the facts we already have been told what to think." 
 I have owned this camera for ~6 months and have finally deciced to replace it. I bought this camera to replace another Nikon CoolPix that was stolen from my house. But this one does not have a view finder to begin with and is way more complicated to use. I have always liked Nikon cameras but the S9 just doesn't make it. I can not use it outside because I can not see the LCD screen. Sorry Nikon but you blew it on this camera!! So I replaced it with a Canon PowerShot A710. What a difference in ease of use and... it has a view finder. also my 1G memory card from rhe Nikon fots in the new Canon. 
 This was written in 1997, and needs to be updated. Truly a disappointment 
 This book is not even worth turning the first page!  This is one of those books where you actually feel embarrassment for the author.  The book is poorly researched, poorly written, poorly edited, and well...... words just fail me.  While I am not a great Herriot fan, I do have to give him, Herriot his due, the man could write well and could tell a great story (isn't that what authors are suppose to do?).  This guy though, Graham Lord, I suspect, has problems feeding the paper into his typewriter!  The entire book is such a obvious ploy to make some quick money on the shirttail of a "dead" but popular author it is rather nauseating.  Shame on the publisher for accepting such shoddy work!  I did finish the book though (thank God I did not purchase the thing) because each page became worse and worse and I could not stop, my thinking being with each turn of the page "well it just cannot be any worse than that last page/chapter."  How wrong I was!  If you must read the thing, borrow it or check it out of the library.  I would hate to see a person waste their money, and I certainly  would not want the author and his publisher to be rewarded for a work such as this.  Herriot's life, warts and all, could be such a fastinating subject.  I do hope someone will turn out a good study of him eventually.  We certainly did not get it here.  I just hate having to give this one even one star.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK 
 I had high hopes for Requiem of Darkness since it had a dark atmosphere to it. Also, the characters looked very unique and intriguing. Unfortunatley, the beginning is very rough, both in content and speed of the show.   The plot is about a writer who wants to create a book of horror stories. He is always interested in cursed places and people with bad omens hanging over their head. He meets up with a gang of three people with dark powers who murder the murderers, and immediately becomes their intrusive groopy.  Unfortunately, the show is not as slick as the plot sounds. The first episode immediately starts off with the story-telling. It is centered upon a man who murdered a talented child for he was jealous. Throughout the episode, you see the man going insane with guilt and hearing strange noises. The problem is nothing interesting is revealed about any of the main characters and some of the events feel rushed and confusing without the nice introductions of who's who.   The second episode I found more enjoyable since it was unique. It is about a man with a hotel protected by the willow woman. The willow womanis infatuated with the owner and killed all of his wives and children. It even has a little plot twist, nothing extrodinary but still welcoming.  And once again, the third and fourth episodes deal with insane murders. This is when the show became boring for me. I do find crazy murders interesting to read and watch about, but I like to have more variety if this is what the who show is going to be about. Also, the show's trick of using violence and paranoia to be scary lost its buzz by the end of the DVD.  I give it an extra star since one episode is decent and the character design is great. Unfortunately, the show left me unsatisfied since the main people of the show weren't the main focus of these first few episodes. Maybe the next few volumes will be more creative and give more details on the main plot, but I personally don't care to spend anymore of my money on such a risk.  One last note: this show has very intense adult content. Don't make the assumption that the rating is over exxagerated for it definitely is not. Actually, I personally thought the rating was too low for this show 
 Whenever the first sentence of any book--Faulkner excluded--exceeds 200 words, you know you're going to suffer, and suffer I did. One might claim this to be a great book, and some have; but this could well be one of those  great books collecting dust on your bookshelf 
 While Julia Barrett touches on the language "spoken" in Jane Austen's novels, it's not expressed with any feeling or wit.  The words seem to be a jumble of Austenique words placed to look good, but not sound good.  After chapter 11 the book goes into a million different directions, is narrated from several characters points of view, leaves almost no room for the main characters (Charlotte Heywood) views to be expressed, her feelings to be voiced and is just plain messy.  In most of Austen's novels, you have an opportunity to see the relationship grow between the main charactor and her "intended".  In Charlotte, you wonder how they fell in love at all.  They rarely see one another, they rarely speak and when they do, it's mostly short and nonsensible.    Then there is the plot line, or rather shall I say lines for there are several (thank you Mr. Collins).  There is the plot to save Sandition by gaining a physician, by adding a Crescent, allowing racing gentleman and their horses (and then the sub-plot to this to keep them out)and then the smuggling and bootlegging.  Dear me!  How did anything get done?  I confess, I got bored and just scanned the rest of the book!  Honestly, I was disgusted.    If you love Austen's last novel and would like to see how she may have ended it, let me recommend a book far superior to Charlotte.  Instead try Sandition.    Sandition does tend to get a little flowery in some places.  Charlotte Heywood does tend to get a little flustered and unable to speak her mind around Sidney Parker.  However on the whole, it's a much more convincing end to Austen's last attempt.  The characters actually grow.  They learn.  Here is an example.  In Charlotte: Arthur Parker is an "invalid" who learns that perhaps he is not so invalid and then spends the rest of the book remarking to his intended, also thinking herself an invalid, about how herorically he withstands his difficulties with stomach ailments.  To which she agrees and says that they only can know how much each endurs to live with this horrid desease.  And then they proceed to expound on how proud they are over their problems and attempt to live with them.  (sigh).  In Sandition:  Arthur Parker is an "invalid" who realizes that perhaps, not only is he NOT an invalid but that there are people fairing far worse then him and do not complain.  He falls for a young woman who truly is fragile but makes no complaints, only attempts to live each good day she has to the fullest.  He learns from her what it is to be healthy.  They both grow and support each other in a common goal that gets them out of a smoke filled tea room and into the fresh sea breezes.  He collects and she draws what he collects.  He learns to protect her (instead of whining over his bouts and supposed illnesses) and she learns to be stronger.    Sandition is also a book in which you can actually SEE Charlotte and Sidney fall in love.  You can watch her struggle over "does he or does he not".  It's a much more delightful alternative to all the "our herione" and "our hero" and "my herione" and "my hero"'s that go on in Charlotte (if I read one more of those I thought I would choke).    So, to sum up?  Don't Don't Don't waste your time, money or energy on Charlotte, but DO get Sandition.  It's a welcome addition to Jane Austen's library 
 I first saw the ads for this movie and I was scared to death. All I can say is... this movie is not for young children. 
 This book made me want to run to the bathroom with my hands covering my mouth. The plot is absurd, and epitomizes mediocre literature. Certainly wasn't a page turner, more of a page-flusher 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  I have been looking for ideas for my wedding/handfasting and thought this sounded like it might have some good ideas.  Boy, was I wrong!  The author has a very negative attitude towards anyone who wants a Pagan wedding and is not a Coven initiate, let alone a solitary.  She also makes very snide remarks about anyone who wants a Pagan wedding, but doesn't want the whole BWD (Big White Dress) format.  Overall, I would rate this book lower than 1 star if I could.  I definitely would NOT recommend it to anyone 
 The last release from the Wham duo isn't really a full-fledged album, and is actually more of a semi-compilation of previously-released recordings that had yet to appear on a Wham album and three newly-recorded songs.  The new tracks include the energetic hit "The Edge of Heaven" (#10 US, #1 UK), the underrated flop "Where Did You Heart Go?" (#50 Pop), and the cool album track "Battle Stations."  Also included are the three single-only releases from the past two years - the holiday-themed "Last Christmas" (#2 UK), the terrific "I'm Your Man" (#3 US, #1 UK), and George Michael's solo ballad "A Different Corner" (#7 US, #1 UK).  Unfortunately, the classic "I'm Your Man" is presented in a frankly horrible remix that drains most of the energy out of this high-octane track.  The only other two tracks are an okay live recording of the song "Blue" and a decent remix of the "Wham Rap."  Even though it really isn't a proper album per se, Music from the Edge of Heaven collected enough hits and worthy tracks to peak at #10 on the Hot 200, and is worth picking up if you're a fan of the duo 
 I read chic-lit, a lot. I found myself truly disappointed in this book. What a waste of time! 
 I like to read (or listen to) non-fiction- but not tedious, weighed down non-fiction.  I have recommended (and at times purchased) this book to numerous friends.  The book is enlightening, engaging and exceptional. A book to be relished (pun intended).  Regretably, I cannot say this for the author's next effort. I think Cod is one of the most fascinating, enjoyable books I have encountered.  One great book

 If only size were everything, this guide would be excellent. About the dimensions of a trade paperback but much thicker, Double Jump's guide for Disgaea 2 promises the moon but fails to deliver.   The first problem is, well, the dimensions of the book. It's well over 500 pages of poorly arranged information - the index in front is vague, divided up by general sections while failing to give more precise locations. There is no index in back for more specific references. And at its fairly small length and width, the printing is small enough that it's tempting to reach for a magnifying glass. The more traditional, larger dimensions used for walkthrough and guide books would be more expensive, but would be justified.  The second problem is the information actually contained in the book. There's plenty of information devoted to secrets - how to make the perfect item, how to make a character at level 999 more powerful still, etc - but skimpy information only for getting /to/ that stage. Example : the book tells you that to get to the Land of Carnage, you need all 16 treasure maps from fighting Pirates in the Item World. It gives a little bit of vague information on how to run into the pirates, how to increase your chances of it - but the information is nowhere near as specific as it could be, and it's scattered through several places in the book.  Moreover, and this is the third and major problem with this book, there's information which would be desirable which simply isn't in the book at all. The Dark Assembly, for example; there's a very brief explanation in the beginning of the book, and then nothing is really mentioned about how to fight them as a Senator yourself, or how to better get proposals passed - or denied. There are some proposals which seem on the face of it more desirable /not/ to pass (and one which if you don't get it rejected, the game ends!). Since if you opt to fight, you're going it solo against a large number of /very/ powerful monsters, some tips would be useful. So too would be information on the Legendary Senators. But you'll have to look somewhere else for that information; Double Jump didn't see fit to make much reference to these.  On the whole, if you're prepared to let this game take over your life, the guide can be of some help - but if you're prepared to go that far, chances are you won't really NEED this book. Even the kind of gamer willing to put 200 or more hours into this game will find this book only marginally useful, and anyone with less than perfect eyesight will find it only marginally legible. I'd love to see someone come out with a guide book for the game which actually covers the /game/ itself, with what you need to do to get each ending and to solve each part of the storyline with optimal results. You won't find that here, though 
 Though this book was written much better than Foundation's Fear, I wasn't very impressed. You know how movie studios always do re-makes of old movies? Well this here is a re-write, basically of the first chapter of Asimov's classic original Foundation book. What a waste of paper. If you already read the original, then you already know what will happen at the end 
 I agree completely with "Ohio Guy"........these are some of Gary Coopers best movies BUT the studio, instead of spending a little on restoration and packaging them individually, chose to go the CHEAP way and made them a set. The transfers are marginal at best and the picture quality is no where what it should be to be viewed on big screen TV's. Come on Amazon.com.....pay attention to YOUR customers and force the studios to do a better job of restoration. There really are customers out here who don't want knock-offs and who consider what is being done to these great films a true injustice and also a RIP-OFF....!!!!!!! 
 I come from a different view point then many because I belong to another church before being a member of the "OLD CHURCH" and thought that the "OLD CHURCH" was way off base.  I find that Mr. Flurry seems to be a bitter man.  He is not able to tell his story without making those who disagree with him as liars.  I find this sad.  He finds that his church has made no mistakes and that Mr. Armstrong could do no wrong except when he chose a successor.  I know personally those who have known Mr. Armstrong and while he was a great man, he was with error like all of us 
 I really NEEDED this printer.  I even overlooked the 'shaking' of the printer and table it sat on during printing.  In less than a year-the scanner errors began and the ink catridge symbols are a problem.  I have always loved HP but now will try a Canon printer 
 I have had it less than a year and charging the battery as with all the palms is a major disappointment.  They don't last very long.  Palm is great but what is great if it doesn't charge.  Thanks to service plans I have exchanged every palm I  have had due to defective batteries now they know better and don't have the plans like they used too.  My advice:  Buy something with a replaceable battery you can do yourself 
 I read this book after reading "What to Expect When You're Expecting" and was very disappointed.  I liked "Expecting," most likely because while pregnancies differ, the biology is pretty much the same for everyone, so it's hard to miswrite pregnancy.  However, after reading "First year" I have found myself overly concerned for no reason simply because a lot of what is in this book has not accurately described my child's behavior or abilities.  I know the authors put out the disclaimer that every baby is different, but I'm not talking about when kids will walk or talk.  I'm talking about their claim that babies can feel embarassment at the age of ten months or understand that I want my son to help clean up if I hand him a paper towel.  Additionally, the book does not always offer a good answer to a question...the answer usually comes in the form of "some babies will, some babies won't."  How is that helpful?!!  After noting a string of inconsistencies and claims that are simply false, I finally had to put the book down or drive myself crazy.  In long, I do not recommend this book to anyone, particularly a first time mother.      
 This book is an overview. It does not cover the details that are required for CISSP. I found more helpful resources (PDF, PPT, doc)) on the internet free of cost.  Save some money and buy Shon Harris's or Wiley's Exam Prep Guide instead. That is what I  did. 
 I love the single column verse format layout of this Bible. For many years I used the NASB in a single column format and I've grown quite fond of it.  Unfortunately, this one is published by Crossway. It is glue bound and if you've used Crossway Bibles in the past, you know they are good for about a year of moderate use before the pages begin falling out. I would be fine with that just to have the ESV in a single column format. But, the paper is so thin on this one that I find it unusable. Looking at the page, the impression is that there are actually three pages vying for my attention. It's just too distracting to consider using it.  Compare this bible to Foundation Publication's Side Column Reference edition in the NASB. The NASB is about $15 less (MSRP) than this bible in the hardback. For $15 less you get a smyth-sewn binding, lovely layout, and high-quality bible paper that stands up well to note-taking with very little bleedthrough. The only thing you don't get is the ESV, and that is what I would prefer 
 I know a lot of people liked this book, but I felt like it put too much pressure on me to pack on the pounds.  I didn't realise so much of the book was focused on diet.  It says you should plan on gaining a pound a week, and the more you gain the healthier your babies will be.  Well the first 13 weeks I managed to gain NOTHING, and I felt horrible about it, but food made me so sick the last thing I could do was eat MORE food to try to gain weight.  The book said that according to my starting weight I should try to gain 50 - 60 pounds during my pregnancy!  I decided to stop reading the book, and so far, just going by what my gut says about what to eat and when, I've managed to put on 20 pounds.  My twins are measuring perfectly and are very healthy.  This book isn't horrible, but I would check it out of a library or borrow it or buy it used, don't spend the $ on a new one... and be prepared to put it down if it doesn't sound right to you 
 This movie definitely had the potential to be gteat, the action scenes are pretty good.  But the love story in this movie seems like even the actors were dozing off during there own scenes.    The final fight did't work for me either, and the very last scene I thought was pretty unnecessary.  Did anyone really remember Joey Wong was in this movie by the time that the end came.    The commentary on the DVD was one of the better ones that I have heard from ric meyers 
 This appears to be a quality publication but I find the type a little harder to read than others I have seen.  It's a nice size, but towns are not as easy to find as other, larger maps.  I have not yet had reason to use the printed information in the front and the back 
 I guess I was expecting more of a Ferrante and Teicher thing with more than one piano going at a time ... could be that it is but, if so, am missing depth ... great family but disappointing albu 
 James Patterson created a great character in Alex Cross and I have faithfully followed the series even though the last several have disapponted me.  The plot and character development have become weaker with each book. Yet I kept buying the books, even knowing that Patterson is more of a franchise that an author.   In CROSS Patterson has Alex wonder why his daughter wants to read the same book over and over.  When I read that line I realized that Patterson is making fun of his readers.  That's it for me. I'll not buy another 
 Whyte's historical knowledge and presentation of 4th and 5th century life creates a credible and interesting background for this story. As a history buff, I am always looking for good writers in this vein. I have to say that I was disappointed by the writing style and the sledge hammer subtle plot development. The important points were emphasized and repeated ad nauseum to the point of distracting from the flow of the narrative. The romantic relationship with the principle woman was not very convincing or moving and I found myself skimming those passages rather than being moved by them. The characters seem somewhat 2 dimensional as well. Mr. Whyte has written many books on interesting subjects and time periods, but I doubt I will try any others since I was so bored with this one 
 It's not easy to criticize this book, because it is beautifully written and captures something tragic and poignant and important:  the emotional trials and conflicts of a spunky twelve year old girl who is coming of age in a world that doesn't understand her.  But McCullers' darker undercurrents taint the book.  Threaded throughout are elements of sexual perversity, terrible sexual boundaries with children, and hints at pedophilia, leading me to question strongly what in the world happened to Carson McCullers when she was a little girl.  Furthermore, the perversity often pops up in a disjointed way that adds nothing to the book's power, and thus reads largely as gratuitous.  A few examples from the book - a book which I did not finish because I didn't trust where its author was taking me:  1) The main character, a pubescent twelve year old girl who is nearly five-foot six, has spent her whole life up till now sleeping in the bed with her widowed and single father, until he looks at her one day and realizes she's "a great big long-legged twelve year old" - McCullers leaves exactly what he means to our imagination - and kicks her out of bed.  2) The girl's best friend is a six year old boy, whom she bullies and torments, and then basically forces to spend the night with her in her bed.  McCullers makes a point of showing how they change their clothes for bed in the same room - "with their backs turned to each other" - and then get in bed together.  Once the little boy is asleep the girl, who is two months away from turning thirteen, rubs his bare stomach with her hand, licks him behind his ear, and then nuzzles up to him.  (Also, imagine if their genders were reversed!)  3) The father takes a married couple as boarders in the house, but the girl - then age nine - walks in on them doing something overtly sexual with the door left purposefully open.  McCullers leaves it to the readers' imagination what her little protagonist viewed.  4) McCullers talks about the girl character, age twelve, having had sex with a neighborhood boy.  Again, she gets vague on details, but why is she sharing even this much?  If you were to remove the literary style and add a scant few more details, you would have child pornography.  5) Eventually the girl changes her name, wears an adult dress that makes her look much older - and goes out on the town and meets a visiting adult soldier.  He comes onto her sexually - though stops only because others come into the bar where he is giving her alcohol.  One is only left to wonder where the book will go from here.  Because this book was written in the 1940s the author can get away with it - and perhaps also because she's a female author - but really, it's disturbing and perverse 
 Voice is the same it always was-- The standards are not well served by her rendition of them.  The musical score on these tracks tries to hard to feature her voice and much is lost inn the meaning of the song.  Some of the new songs are pleasant to listen too, but are not that outstanding 
 A 1/3 inch split developed in the wood on the spoon's flat edge after about five uses(I hand wash and dry promptly). The same thing happened to the replacement Amazon sent. Amazon-Great!! Mario Batali- not so great 
 After listening again to it after all this time, there's only one thing that stands up (except for the original Ramones and Go Go's stuff). Check out the Bowling for Soup theme song.  This group is tight with excellent harmonies.  Check out their new album with the hit "1985" 
 under rug swept was given positive feedback upon it's release and I was enjoying the song hands clean so I decided to check out the rest of the CD. Although alanis is a talented singer and songwriter I just wasn't feeling this CD although I give it to her for trying to be more musically diverse. It sounded too much like sugary pop to me I couldn't get into the rest of it 
 This is but a short "add-on" to Timothy Kearney's excellent review of this book.  I found The Writer's Guide to Character Traits merely another textbook formula for creating wooden people.  Stereotypical.  Gives you nothing that would enable you to maximize these traits--qualify them for  inclusive fitness into your story.  At best, this book is good for (occasional) checklist purposes only.  Far and away, in my opinion, the most USEFUL book on characterization is Karen Hood's Creating Character Emotions.  #####  Before buying this book I would recommend reading Timothy Kearney's review. Re-read it. Then read it again.       
 Where is the CD version with the remake of "A Whole New World" sung by Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey?  It sounds so much better than the old original version.  Not that Peabo and Regina didn't sound good, but it's 2005, it's more pop version with Nick and Jess 
 In desperate need of a light read and curious about the multi-author approach used with this novel, I dove into "Naked Came The Manatee" with anticipation of the fun and excitement typical of Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiassen writing.  The story unravels the mystery behind two heads, both with a great similarity to Fidel Castro that are lost in transport from Florida to Cuba.  Each of the thirteen authors writes a chapter of the novel, with Hiassen and Leonard attempting to pull the story together in the final chapters.  The characters are odd and criminally inept as most characters in Hiassen's and Leonard's writing but the story is underdeveloped and lacks the immediacy of a great crime mystery.  If you have nothing else to read and this book happens to be within reach give it a try. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed 
 Grabbed this in an airport prior to a flight.  I didn't even read the jacket, figured I couldnt go wrong with a biography of an American hero.  The 'author' shamefully makes linkages between Patton and 'a series of civilian and military massacres in Sicily...'  Trapped on a plane for 5hrs, I gave it an honest chance.  I struggled through about 75 pages and had to lay it down.  I dont know if it was the laborious details of family members, the revisionist BS, or a combonation of both.  
 I purchased this mouse 5 months ago and it has been total frustration ever since. The buttons on the sides are not easy to access or use. But most frustrating is the way the two main buttons perform. When I clicked on them they end up double clicking which caused a lot of problems with retrieving my email messages. I know some may be thinking I haven't configured the settings correctly but I went over it several times and couldn't get it to work right.  What's even more frustrating is the support at Razer is non-existent. They never responded to my email questions which I submitted several times before giving up. I ended up buying a Wacom Intuos 3 tablet which works amazingly well and gives me so much more. I am a commercial illustrator so it is the perfect mouse/pen tool for my needs.   Don't buy this product. I would have given it a negative 5 stars if that were an option. At $43.65, it's a steep price to pay for the frustration and a complete waste of time and money 
 This calendar was really bad.  I was hoping for tips or at least some humor.  I took it off my desk before the end of January 
 This book was so not worth it.  There is nothing new in the book.  Also it was a little on the boring side 
  How the Other Half Lives was written over a century ago as an expose' of the appalling living conditions in the tenements of New York City. The author speaks with a crusader's zeal and with so much detail that the reader can visualize these tenements, these streets, and these people as if they were living today. This is a grim and moving portrayal of the lives of the men, the women and the children that inhabit these loathsome neighborhoods of New York City in the late 1800s.  He so graphically describes the filth, the sunless and airless rooms, the crowding, and the starvation that these places palpably exist for the reader and bring a chill to any heart.  Riis has a genuine concern for the tenement situation and understands these people's plight. His pictures are touching and meant to vividly show their misery. He, for the most part, blames the money-hungry landlords for these crowded conditions: "How shall the love of God be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man." (p. 266). He laments that the tenement is three quarters responsible for the misery of the poor. Then, after his extensive discourse, he offers three concrete cures for these dreadful conditions, something that many authors forget when they are enlightening readers.  Riis states his purpose for writing this book himself on page 297 when he says, "If this book shall have borne ever so feeble a hand in garnering a harvest of justice, it has served its purpose." The author apparently succeeded with his purpose, because in the flyleaf of this book the publisher tells us: "This book helped bring about new revisions in the housing codes of the major U. S. cities." How does this book relate to adult education? By moving chronologically from the founding of America to the slums of NYC in the 1800s, are we to understand that education took a back seat to the accumulation of money during those hundred years? Certainly Riis posits that education is one of the solutions to this problem while at the same time implying that wealth accumulation and the lack of education has been the cause of this problem.  "Thus the whole matter resolves itself once more into a question of education, all the more urgent because these people are poor, miserably poor almost to a man." (p. 147). He does not forget that this "education" is not only for the poor people, but also for the wealthy landlords. "Clearly, it is a matter of education on the part of the landlord no less than the tenant." (p. 270). Riis' almost missionary language exhorts us to never allow greed to override a compassion for humanity.  "It is a fight in which eternal vigilance is truly the price of liberty and the preservation of society." (p. 233). The relation of this book to the other units of study in this course could be explained as an example of how low mankind can descend if education is not considered one of the major cornerstones of a society. Although this book was exhaustive in its detail, it was easy to read while at the same time enlightening. I found myself enjoying the ranting tone and the fascinating lists of neighborhoods and the labels that Riis used for the different races. In a sense it reads like a Ginsberg poem; constantly hitting the reader with melodious lists of places and people from another era. Read these geographic names out loud and feel their rhythm: Jewtown, Bandit's Roost, Double Alley, The Bowery, The Bloody Sixth Ward, The Fourth, Fifth and Tenth Wards,  Blindman's Alley, The Bend, The Battery, Little Italy, The French Quarter, Hell's Kitchen, The West Side, Bottle Alley, Frog Hollow, Poverty Gap, Murderer's Alley, Gotham Court, The Old Brewery, Old Africa, Potter's Field, Blackwell's Island Asylum, Rogues' Gallery, Penitentiary Row, Chinatown. The list goes on. To someone reared in rural America, this chant sounds like a song about another country.   Riis also has something to say about all the races of people that live in the tenements of New York City:  Chinaman (he can't be taught), (Chinese (coolie--laundry business), Polish Jew (coops himself up in his den with his thermometer at boiling), Russian Jew, Jew (money is their God), Bohemian (poor, but thrifty), Blacks (like to gamble, but they are clean), Greek, Hebrews (tailors, all of them), Dutchman, Irish (like to drink and have expensive funerals), German (order loving), Swiss, Pasquales, Russian, Italian (a born gambler; lighthearted and gay), Swamp Angel (thieves), Street Arabs (army of homeless boys), Tramps and Toughs (the world owes them a living),and the Celtics. I was enthralled by the street lingo and the colloquialisms and Riis' comments about every race.  I noticed one interesting similarity between the late 1800s and the present day. Riis says that the gap between the social classes is widening everyday. I hear people talking about the growing differences between the rich and the poor often these days. Does every generation think that is happening in their time?  Not only should this book be used by people researching New York City`s tenements, but it should also be read by everyone seeking a blueprint for social change. It is a reminder to show us how hopeless the human circumstances can become when man's greed overrides his concern for human dignity.     
 "Band of Angels"  1957  Directed by Raoul Walsh  Starring Clark Gable, Yvonne DeCarlo, Sidney Poitier, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Carolle Drake  Warning! This review contains spoilers! The end of the movie will be revealed!  Plot: a light-skinned daughter of a plantation owner and a slave is sold into slavery after living a young life of luxury. A series of men attempt to rape and/or seduce her. Finally, she embarks on her "happily ever after" with a slave trader.  Where to begin. How to summarize everything that is wrong with this ugly little movie.  It must be said that this film has its fans. One can see why.  "Band of Angels" has star power: Gable, who did not age well, is 56 here, and he looks ten years older, but he's still Gable. This is your one chance to see Sidney Poitier and Gable together. Yvonne DeCarlo is a great beauty.  The film has glorious sets of the old South, lovely gowns, and a series of bodice-ripper scenes that some will find arousing.  It has a tried and true bodice-ripper, romance novel plot: a woman falls in love with her rapist, and in this case, her owner: a slave trader who bought her at a slave auction.  Many viewers will find this plot, though, icky, and Gable is too creaky here to ignite the kind of spark he could once ignite that will get us past the ick factor.  The real problem with this movie is this: the movie thinks that it is a groundbreaking, truth-telling, realistic depiction of the horrors of the enslavement of African Americans. It's not, though. Rather, it is a tragic display of white denial.  I know what you're thinking. "This reviewer is politically correct!" The thing is, I'm not politically correct at all. "Gone with the Wind" is one of my favorite movies.  But "Gone with the Wind" has tremendous narrative and archetypal power that transcends its unrealistic portrayal of slavery.  "Band of Angels" has no such power.  Its "realistic" and "truth telling" depiction of slavery includes the following:  In the opening scene, two slaves are shown running away. They, like the other slaves in the movie, are very well dressed. Even GWTW has the decency to show slaves in ragged clothing.  Read descriptions of how real slaves actually dressed. They dressed in rags, or in nothing at all.  The runaways walk tall and quick. Their body movements announce that they consider themselves to be the equal of their captors.  Again, even GWTW depicted the deferential walk and posture that slaves had to adopt. Read Richard Wright. Blacks in the South had to assume a different posture and walk just to survive, right up until the Civil Rights Movement.  The runaway slaves' owner decides to punish them -- by having them pull weeds!  Read any honest history of slavery. Runaway slaves were punished with horrible tortures. "Pulling weeds" was not one of them.  There is one bad white Southerner in the movie. Like most of the other men in the movie, he tries to rape Yvonne DeCarlo. She easily rebuffs him. Millions of real slaves were not so lucky.  Most of the white Southerners in the movie are well meaning, and most of the slaves are happy. Carolle Drake, whose dignified performance is the best thing about the movie -- it is a real tragedy that this is the only film she ever made -- plays a slave woman who is in love with her owner. She is light skinned, and is allowed to be dignified. Other, darker slaves are shown as idiotic and animal-like, or as so overjoyed by the presence of their slave owner that they burst into spirituals.  Sidney Poitier plays a slave who has been treated well by his master, Clark Gable.  Poitier repays Gable for this excellent treatment by scheming for Gable's death. It is only when Gable reveals that he is Poitier's father that Poitier realizes his appropriate love for the man who owned him and raped his African mother.  In the film's capstone scene, where Gable talks about the horrors of the slave trade, Gable describes savage Africans as doing most of the dirty work. Gable, poor, innocent white slave trader, physically fights against the Africans who are savaging their own people in order to supply him, Gable, with human cargo.  For any decent person, watching this scene of white denial is gut wrenching.  Finally, Yankees arrive. They are every bit as bad as the Yankees in GWTW. The poor, stupid slaves who welcome their arrival, Gable intones, are not intelligent enough to realize how lucky they had it under their beneficent Southern owners.  Again, if you like seeing beautiful women in pretty costumes, and if you want to see Yvonne de Carlo's bodice ripped -- six or seven -- I lost count -- men in the film attempt to have their way with her -- and if "woman falls in love with rapist" plots are your cup of tea, and if you can ignore the nauseating denial that underlies this exercise, then you may enjoy this movie.  Otherwise, it is more of sociological interest than aesthetic.  
 After hearing good things about the book I had hoped for some insight on how to change the approval seeking patterns developed from living in family where being good worked alot better than being authentic. Instead I got heavy handed criticism of "mothers" who warp their children through thier own selfish motivations. Some people may have parents who were intentionally cruel, but mine were just sad, depressed and inept. I spent so much effort defending them from this author's wrath, and perhaps anger at her own mother, that if there was any insight in this book about on how I might change my patterns of behavior I couldn't see it. 
 The only discipline lacking in this story, is the author's 
 don't waste your time let alone your money on this book. The author is so full of it and i seriously doubt he could trade his way out of a wet paper bag. I've been to his "Casino War Games" seminar and he talks the talk but he can't walk the talk or put his money where his mouth is, especially not in the casino or the markets. All he cares about is upselling his snake oil seminars etc... 
 I am only a third of the way through this book, and am already deeply saddened by it's content. After reading "West with the Night," I was anxious to know more about the mysterious Beryl Markham. How common that this book seems to concentrate on her alleged promiscuity rather than on her remarkable achievements for a woman during the 1920's. It reads more like a transcript from a British Jerry Springer episode. It's like going to an art gallery, and listening to some jealous wannabe fool babble on and on about the artist's "intent" or their "mood" during the creation of the piece of art; piecing together their indictment from hearsay. This book would be just grand for subscribers of People magazine 
 Not a bad book if you looking at the areas of Northern Baja and the Cabo San Lucas area. Out of 258 pages about 130 pages cover these area while only 58 cover the remainder. There are much better books out there 
 A bit disappointing...  I guess I expected more, because I was told when I purchased this book that it was the best of the IN THE GARDEN trilogy. And that stands to reason when you expect the last to be the best.  After all, isn't that when it's supposed to all come together? Not to mention that I did enjoy Black Rose-5-star and thought Blue Dahlia 3-star was an average read.  Several of the novels with the NR seal have been about the supernatural and I have enjoyed most of those books.  Plus, when you see the NR seal, it's almost a given to be a good read. And you'll note I emphasized "almost", because, obviously, you can please some of the people some of the time, but not all the people all the time. And so it was with Red Lily.  The ending to this trilogy was a disappointment for me, especially after the first two novels. Hayley's character lost something in this book. Maybe I was just expecting her to mature. She didn't. Therefore, I have a hard time understanding how a guy like Harper could get hung up on such a childish person. And Roz, a very strong woman, just fizzed out. Grant it, the plot wasn't, and wasn't supposed to be, centered on her.  Regardless, she just wasn't the same as I'd expected. Overall, it was mostly the plot that didn't turn me on.  This one was just a bit too far-fetched. And to be quite honest, the ending just fell flat. Oh well, two out of three ain't bad. ;-)  
 Take advice from somebody who is able to easily win over others easily.  The advice and beliefs shown in this book are just wrong.  If you want to do really well.  Do what others that are doing well are doing.  Adopt the beliefs, mannerisms, attitude,  techniques, ideas  of who you wish to be like  and you'll get the same results.  in other words.  Don't copy John Gray.  
 This book was a huge disappointment. Not only wasn't it funny to me, it has absolutely nothing funny for kids. Too bad its not worth the return shipping charges. I threw it out 
 I am a big Leslie Nielsen fan. I first saw him in the Naked Gun series, which I thought was awesome, then I saw him again in Wrongfully Accused. I was so enthralled that I acquired Airplane, which seems to be a highly praised movie with him in it.  I had thought he could do no wrong, but he really disappointed me here. What is wrong with this movie? EVERYTHING you will see in here are things you have already seen in other Leslie Nielsen comedy movies. There are times that what will happen becomes so obvious that it's painful rather than funny. For example, the x-ray glasses. My God, when that was mentioned, I just felt nauseous.  The problem with this movie is that it continues the Naked Gun-variety humor, but it does it rather badly. Most of the humor in this movie is sexual-based and that will eventually get boring. Aside from that, this movie lacks a proper plot. All throughout the movie, it doesn't seem like Dick Steele (Nielsen) did anything, but move from one area to another in preparation for a gag. Nielsen's other movies had bad plots too, but at least they were coherent.  I am sorry (mostly to myself for seeing this), but this was just a bad movie. Perhaps the director should go watch the entire Naked Gun series to see how it is done 
 Being a first time reader of Danielle Steel, I was very disappointed. The main characters "Steve" and "Merrie" protrayed the role of two lovers with complicated lives. The same plot continued throughout the book, leaving the ending predictable. Steel talked about the same idea over and over all through the book. Steve and Merrie are constantly telling people how much they love each other although they never have a free minute to be together. It was easy to tell what would happen in the end just by reading the middle of the novel. Steel needs to add a good twist to the end also adding some originality 
 This is an overly simplistic and poorly written introduction to the Arthur legend. If there weren't many better presentations of these tales for young readers, there might be an excuse for such a substandard rendering. Unless you want your kids to think that writing sentence fragments is preferable to constructing clear complex sentences, you might want to stay away from the entire "Bullseye Step Into Classic" series 
 	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens, is a story of love and compassion, which takes place during the beginnings of the French Revolution. Despite the fact that many aspects of the revolution are portrayed well in the novel, the book is still a tiring read and requires a strong liking for Dickens' writing style.  	Throughout the novel, Dickens bogs the story down with excessive descriptions and meaningless scenes. The language is relatively simple and easy to comprehend, but the extra descriptions make the novel difficult to fully understand. Most of the characters in the novel are completely unrealistic, which makes it difficult for the reader to relate to what is going on. The character of Lucie Manette, is portrayed as the perfect women with absolutely no flaws. Her character is the supposed epitome for women, but in truth, is highly improbable. Throughout the novel, Dickens' does a great job at keeping the story dry and unentertaining, giving little to no excitement to cause the reader to want to continue. Despite these countless imperfections, Dickens' does manage to be partially successful in his quest to portray the revolution.  	The book, with all its shortcomings, did reveal to the reader, the atrocities that occurred during the French Revolution, and the events that led to it. The abuse of the nobles, and the radical ideas of the revolutionists are all shown in many parts of the novel. The one other aspect that Dickens got right in his novel was the character of Sydney Carton. Sydney Carton is the only character in the story that many readers can relate too and understand a variation of what Carton feels. Carton is a lawyer who feels that everything he has done in his life has been wrong and believes that he can do no good in life. This characteristic is common among people, and Dickens manages to capture that aspect of humanity precisely.   	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, is a slow moving book with numerous flaws that cause the reader to lose interest fairly often. Dickens' overuse of description and unrealistic characters add to the book's dryness. However, Dickens does capture a time in history with great accuracy. This is a book for a reader who likes Dickens' overzealous descriptions and enjoys slow moving stories. 
 The first HD disk that I can't watch. I can't even get to the Image Entertainment website, today, to see what's wrong with it. This is the first product I have ever had to send back to Amazon ... a real Xmas bummer. : 
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 I saw this film expecting some action. The title is very undeserving for the movie I saw. I stopped watching the movie 20 minutes before it ended. It was endlessly unappealing. There was not one scene in this film that made feel or realise the emotion displayed. Direction,Screenplay,Action all lacked detail and co-ordination. I don't think  I'm a Vin Diesel Fan anymore 
 What a self-indulgent, rackety and restless life this woman has led, and she makes no bones about it!  As a young woman she was part of a bohemian set in Paris, promiscuous, often drunk, dancing the night through, almost like a caricature of a flapper.  She was quite neurotic, often had hysterical weeping fits, and her relationships were usually stormy and quarrelsome, punctuated by long sulks when she wouldn't speak to her husbands.  The first of these, Laurence Vail,  was as neurotic as she was and very violent, as often as not in public places.  But she was obviously not easy to live with either, and tactful restraint in behaviour or utterance was never one of her qualities, even with men on whom she was dependent. (The book, too, is "frank" and completely lacking in reticence.)   Her immense wealth enabled her to travel constantly all across Europe (we always learn in which motor-car), and much of this book is an account of every journey she made.  What she chooses to record seems quite undiscriminating, often jejune and sometimes positively verges on the Pooterish, not least because of its uninspired style.   She knew nothing about art or music until John Holms, her partner after her first divorce, began to teach her about it, and one always suspects that it was artists rather than art that really attracted her.  She admits that even when in 1938 she decided to open an art gallery in London, at the time "I couldn't distinguish one thing in art from another" and acted on the advice of Marcel Duchamp who "taught me the difference between Abstract and Surrealist art"! (p.161). And "in spite of the fact that I was opening a modern art gallery in London, I much preferred old masters" (p.163).  These of course were no longer sexually available, while living artists were. She slept with an amazing number of them (as well as with, for example, Samuel Beckett and the kinky Roland Penrose), so there must have been some powerful allure about her into her forties and beyond, which does not come across in the book.    She soon began to collect not only artists but also their works, making it a principle to buy at least one work of art from every show she gave (p.166), but in the whole book there is no genuine appraisal of any work of art - only an account of her perpetual acquisitiveness.  However, one has to admit that her investments were excellent in commercial terms.  She bought and gave the first showings to a number of modern artists whose work would become immensely more valuable in time, and she especially prides herself on having made Jackson Pollock famous.  She was living in occupied and then in Vichy France during the early years of the German occupation, getting out not long before the United States entered the war; but she never sets down any reflections on the war as such, not then nor after Pearl Harbour, commenting only on how bureaucratic matters (visas, currency transfers, restrictions on the movements in the United States of her second husband, Max Ernst, as "an enemy alien") affected her own activities. While France was in torment, she can write, "During the summer [of 1940] I got rather bored and started having my hair dyed a different color every few weeks to amuse myself.  First it was chestnut ... but then I got the wild idea of having it bleached bright orange... As a result of all the time I spent in the beauty parlor, I conceived a sort of weakness for the little hairdresser who worked so hard on my beauty.  From re-reading D.H.Lawrence I also got a romantic idea that I should have a man who belonged to a lower class"  (p.221/2) and we are led to assume that she had a fling with him.  "Soon this got boring, and I needed a change". (p.222).  She was as promiscuous in her forties as she had been in her twenties.  The bulk of this book - 324 out of 385 pages - was first published in 1946 when she was 48 years old.  One part of the rest she published first in 1960 when she was 62 and the other part in 1977 when she was nearly eighty.  Those parts show her in a much more sober light, when she has become the grande dame of Venice.  By that time she has no taste for what was then the avant garde: "I do not like art today.  I think it has gone to hell, as the result of the financial attitude.  People blame me for what is painted today because I had encouraged and helped this new movement to be born. In the early 1940s there was a pure pioneering spirit in America.  A new art had to be born - Abstract Expressionism.  I fostered it. I do not regret it.  It produced Pollock or rather Pollock produced it.  This alone justifies my effort.  As to the others, I don't know what got into them.  Some people say that I got stuck. Maybe it is true.... Today is the age of collecting, not of creating."  H'm!  So at the end we have a rare moment of reflection.  For the rest, this is basically a shallow, tedious and excessively long book written by a spoilt, wealthy and rather silly woman;  and it would not have been  worth persevering with if the incidents she records did not throw some light on the weird personalities and behaviour of some very famous people in the artistic world, most of whom were psychologically as mixed-up and temperamental as she was.  One feels there must have been more to her than that, and perhaps the recent biographies written about her by Anton Gill or Mary Dearborn reveal another side of her; but after having read her own book, I have no interest in reading any more about her 
 My suggestion to other readers is do not waste your time or money on this book. I saw the two authors on several talk shows when this book was first published. They seemed likable and very much like people whom I could relate. So when the big 3-0 began to approach I ordered it from Amazon. I couldn't wait to tear into it. Unfortunately, I was very, very dissapointed. The best part of this book is the cover, and that's no lie. I ordered this book thinking I would get good information. Instead all I learned was that you can string together pages and pages of quotes from other people who were published years - even decades before you, and if you are lucky enough to get it published you can make alot of money and appear on several talk shows. With the constant quoting and paraphrasing this book reads like a college term paper. A bad college term pape 
 Yikes - who edited this thing?  While there are a few gems, I felt like I was reading a book with half the pages missing.  Clearly, material is taken from his other books and recycled for this one, but he might have checked to make sure that all the referenced graphs and text were actually in the book!  Numerous times I was flipping around to try to find a chart he was talking about, only to find that it wasn't anywhere in the book.  You get the impression quickly that this was churned out to scrape in some extra dough.  Larry's writing style is "conversational" - and that's a charitable way to describe it.  Despite all these flaws, there is some good info, and some good trading ideas, but I can't recommend it 
 [the two stars here are for the audiobook only. I give the book six stars.  I loved the book. Best book I've read in years. Couldn't put it down.  But the audiobook is dismal. The voice artists are amateurish, their speech clumsy and unnatural. It's as though they're reading from a script that they haven't rehearsed and they don't know how to get "in character". The attempts at foreign accents are overdone and painful to listen to.  (I love listening to audiobooks and radioplays. I listen to many hours of BBC World Service every day. I know what foreign accents sound like. Not like these).  I strongly recommend that you find a preview of this audiobook before buying it, to see if you'll dislike it as much as I do. Or buy the book instead. Heck, buy five copies of the book like I did and give them to your friends. Awesome book 
 Let me start off, by saying that I am a huge Dean Koontz fan, especially of his work in the 80's and 90's when he really blew up. So, when you read this review, don't think that I'm an ignorant hater. Because I am not. I just give you my thoughts about this book. Here goes:  Y'all know what the book is about so I am not going to repeat it all over again. Jimmy Tock and the 5 horrible days that he will meet throughout his life.  I thought the book was awful and most of all- ridiculous. And I will tell you why. There was no credibility in the characters whatsoever. Usually DK does a great job in creating credible characters. Well, he totally blew it this time. Why? Because ALL of the characters are acting like idiot. There is NO WAY that Jimmy, his wife Lorrie, and his familly can act with so much humour in every single situation. Every single time Jimmy and his wife face a horrible situation, their worst enemies and when they are close to dying, it seems like they've got something funny and sophisticated to say. I mean, come on! That's just stupid! You're one step away from getting killed and all you can do is tell jokes and act like an idiot? That was totally annoying! All throughout the book, jokes and jokes in the worst situation. I know it's just a book of fiction, but the characters still need to be believable. Well, in this book, they ARE NOT.   The plot itself isn't so bad, but it's not good either. Especially the last few chapters, where everything is getting clearer - well the end doesn't make a lot of sense either, and it's like Koontz made an end for little kids or teenagers who haven't read a lot of books and don't know what a good book is. The end, when they meet their worst enemy is almost like the end of a soap opera - an ending that doesn't really make sense (and of course you get a lot of those stupid supposed-to-be-sophisticated jokes from the annoying Tock familly).  So, I am sorry for ripping this book appart, but to me it was a piece of trash. I just had to read it till the end, because I was on a vacation in Thailand and I couldn't find a good book at that time. Plus I wanted to see how low DK could go. It seemed (at least on that book) that he was tired of writing long books with a lot of developements and he just rushed this book with its ridiculous characters. 2 stars and that's generous of me. A waste of time. Get DK's books from the 80's and 90's instead 
 I was forced to read this, and attend multiple seminars from the Blanchard group.  Our CFO lives by the concepts, and he is running our department into the ground by following them.  The book is mostly fluff and took less than an hour to read.  There is ONE good point that I got from it, and that is when setting goals for people they should be trackable, relevant, and attainable.  I got that message in about 5 minutes though.  The rest anyone should already know -- praise in public and reprimand in private.  No kidding, learned that the first time I got humiliated in grade school.  Skip the book, and polish that resume if you are forced to read it 
 I'm a huge dylan fan - and collector  (I have around 120 or so of his albums, bootlegs, shows etc.). This is one of his worst ever - if not The worst - the only redeeming feature - the singing is not bad - even good on afew tracks. Docendo Discimus is dead right - spot on criticism - I could/t have said it better myself - so I won't try. anyone, IMH, who gives this album more than 3 stars is of his rocker.. 
 I picked this book up because the cover claimed that this author was "the master of the medical thriller." He may have been the master at one time but this is CLEARLY no longer the case.   I am a board-certified genetic counselor and have seen hundreds of patients for cancer risk counseling and testing. Dr. Cook's portrayal of this process in this  book is horribly inaccurate and patronizing to boot. He makes no mention of genetic counseling and his portrayal of the process of counseling and testing is inaccurate as is his description of the lab test (no one uses a microarray or SNPs for BRCA testing). When I find obvious mistakes in a book, I always wonder what other inaccuracies the book contains.  In addition to the inaccuracies, this book is simply too long. The editor could easily have chopped off one hundred pages. I would suggest that they start chopping the seriously ridiculous dialogue! THe characters are trite and self-absorbed and some of the subplotting is absurd (a medical doctor abdominal pain wouldn't think of an ectopic pregnancy?!?).   All in all, I found this book a huge disappointment and won't be buying any other books by this author. 
 Since writing my review of JFK: THE LAST DISSENTING WITNESS in 1998, I have been able to have my 35-page article - "Jean Hill -The Lady in Red" - included in Clint Bradford's JFK Assassination website.  The address is: http://www.jfk-info.com/sitemap1.htm (scroll down for title) 
 Beware that this is only volume 1 of three volumes, and that all three will cost you about $60, an outrageous price for a book which is not copyrighted. You can purchase the complete book in a single volume from a (non-Amazon) used bookseller for $5, or $12.49 from an Amazon listed used bookseller, which prices include shipping. You can also download the entire book for free from ebook sources on the internet 
 I can just see hundreds of nerds transfixed behind their computerscreen googling over the one thing coming from another thing. All you need is a piece of paper and a pencil, and you can do the same thing. Dawkins does not use the computer well, neither does he explain his use well. A small change in a program, can give dramatic differences, a large change can give insignificant differences. There is no rule of small steppiness involved here, much as Dawkins likes to twist the regular meaning of words to have it be so. Also Dawkins has failed to simulate intelligence in the program. Much as Darwinists like to deny intelligent design, simulated intelligence is actually required for any lifelike computerprogram. That means a sophisticated use of the computer's randomizer function. In the computerenvironment only the randomizer has the power of decision. The rest of it works in a preordained fashion so to speak, one would get the same results over and over, if not using the randomizer function. Alternatively a sophisticated use of the computerclock would also work, if the clock strikes irregularly. Dawkins has cheated, because he has introduced symetry in the program. All the forms would look awful without symetry, all the forms just reflect the lifelike nature of symetry. If you buy this, you would support turning science into a commercial enterprise, and deny peer-review 
 i've never listened to the album before to be honest, but i'm giving it one star just because everyone else gave it 5 
 Let's face it. Nothing anyone says can sway a particular fragment of this movie's viewing audience one way or the other. Those who love J.Lo will declare the greathess of this movie, in a variety of ways.  Those who hate J.Lo will counter their every point in describing how bad it is. And those who love quality film won't waste too much time even recognizing that this movie even exists. Guilty pleasure, indeed! One thing you have to admit about J.Lo, she's consistent. She sings bad, acts bad, and is merely eye candy, for thoe who find her appealing. And this movie is full of all of the above, plus awful, cliche ridden, emotionally pleading writing that should be an inspiration to anyone with Hollywood writing aspirations, since this movie demonstrates how little talent it takes. At least it's had it's short, but sill way too long presence on the premium movie channels, cause for a while this piece of garbage was ubiquitous, just like the lead starlett. Maniupulative only begins to describe this drek. But that said, it's more than enough time wasted on this movie. I merely felt compelled to warn folks. Don't waste your time. It stinks 
 I thought this book would deal only with the 2nd Iraq war but was mistaken.  About half this book described the history of Iraq.  The actual war coverage was broad and brief.  This book lacks much of the detail of previous Keegan books.  John Keegan has written many superb books in the past but this one was a disappointment 
 This book is bad stuff because it doesn't emphasize eternal damnation in Hell.  Without Hell and eternal damnation, God did not have to take on human flesh to die in a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins.  John Stott really needs to read his Bible carefully.  How could someone who doesn't understand this be saved? 
 If you have had the opportunity to see the (out-of-print) show catalogue (Giorgio Morandi: [catalogue of] an exhibition of paintings, water-colours, drawings and etchings) this skimpy overview will not only disappoint, it also will not whet your appetite for more of this insightful artist's  oeuvre 
 The continually referenced web site says, "Coming Soon." This book may be ok for a full time help author but is very time consuming to find information. CSS, DHTML and HTML Help information is scattered all over the book. The index is of little help. I'm sure someone could build HTML Help if they had years to do it as did the projects the author references. The supposed on-line files might help. I feel very ripped off that the author did not follow through on the website and example files 
 I wasn't impressed with this book for two separate reasons.  Firstly, the production standard struck me as almost 1960s' in style - black and white photos (nice 'grainy' look), big bulky monitors and a general aged format.  It is peculiar I agree, but the book looks like it was written at least 30 if not 40 years ago.  The second set of quibbles I have with the text is that it presume the reader is almost completely ignorant of any kind of presentation technology.  This assumption may have been acceptable several decades ago but the universality of TV seriously undermines its value.  Television is constantly exposting the public to new technologies.  For instance, in the text there is a piece with graphic devoted to how to load a slide projector.  How relevant is that to today's classroom?  Moreover, any decent bit of kit comes with instructions.  I accept that the authors wish to do a thorough hand holding with the reader, but the book assume too little exposure to technology which renders it advice mediocre in places. Possibly it should be retitled Instructional Media Technology for Complete Dummies. The bits on the web are small (literally bits) which is not a good sign.  Overall, the book was lightweight - possibly I am being unfair as I am not looking for the technology it covers, but for  review of current and future developments.  In any event I regret buying the book as it doesn't fit my needs and I didn't like its presentation style.  It is a tired book, more like jaded, that does not mesh well with the style culture of modern multimedia technology 
 I'm making an exception to my usual practice of not reviewing anything on amazon, due to the utter vileness of this movie.  I saw it when it came out in theaters and hated it, and then a friend purchased the DVD and convinced me to give it a second chance...  all in all, this movie ended up taking about four hours of my life that I will never get back.  The performances are thin and uneven, the plot is inconsistent, and the dialogue sounds like it was pulled from fortune cookies made by the cast of Friends.  To be fair, this movie does face several major obstacles.  It has the misfortune to depend on the "acting" of glorified Ken doll Freddie Prinze, Jr. and the vastly overrated Julia Stiles, and in addition to trying to rise above these challenges, it also attempts to survive the intrusion of Ashton Kutcher.  It fails on all counts.    I do not hate the whole romantic comedy genre; nor do I hate the "teen" movie sub-genre, under which some would place "Down to You."  (In fact, "Can't Hardly Wait" is one of my favorite movies.)  I simply hate BAD movies, and this movie is a true abomination.  If you enjoy the experience of wanting to drill into your own skull, then by all means, buy this DVD.  If, however, you value your sanity, then please do not make the same mistake I did; stay far, FAR away from this movie 
 It really is sad to see Phills Reynold Naylor's great masterpiece about a beagle puppy trampled on like this.  This film was not at all faithful to the book.  The first difference is that in the book Shiloh had a black spot just behind his left ear about one inch in front of his leg.  In the movie, the spot is way over on his back!  In the book, Shiloh's tail was a couple inches long.  In the movie, it's like a foot!  The classic "this little piggy goes to market" scene has been ommitted, and scene where Shiloh tries to hump the kid's leg was just plain unneccesary. C'mon, this is supposed to be a family movie!  Avoid this and read the fantastic book trilogy instead(which I also wrote a comprehensive review for 
 It amazes me that in this day and age, a novel about two people who remain passionately in love throughout the book, and which uses an African-American maid and a Korean neighbor for its simpering supporting cast, which uses time travel merely as a conceit, with none of the philosophical implications of how time affects relationships: it obviously doesn't have any impact on the eternally horny Henry and Claire, can be taken seriously. This book is a Hillary Duff movie, paint-by-numbers cliches( the mourning virtuoso ruined by the shakes) racist(Black maids and Asian neighbors who say cute things and always pop over with ethnic dishes) stereotypes hiding behind a "love makes the family" veneer. This book was Barbara Cartland hiding behind Chip Kidd style cover art. No doubt Anne Hathaway will star in the film 
 This book tries to convince you that by running a certain way, you're going to improve your running experience and (ultimately) your speed.  Unfortunately, there is absolutely nothing new in this book. Any experienced runner in good shape knows what the author is talking about, but sorry Dr. Romanov, you didn't invent anything here 
 This movie is simply an offensive, unreal and exploitative movie made by a Cheap Tarantino rip off, who didn't hesitate to sell out his country culture to get a shameful pass to Hollywood..  Jakubowikz is even lower than the characters depicted in his awful piece of cinematic dung.   It portraits Caracas (and Latin America by rebound) as a horrible hellhole of drugs, street violence and utterly corrupt cops with nothing redeeming, not a trace of law and order at all.   The stupid, unreal kidnappers depicted here justify their actions by pointing out that most of the country is starving, like it were an excuse to commit crime and behave sadistically.   "Gangsta" Robin Hoods, what an original idea !!  this abomination is full of cheap cliches and unreal charaters:  1.- A middle Class "Social Justice warrior" street lowlife with a "heart of gold" , associated with   2.- Two little-better-than-animals, sadistic "ghetto-Gangsta" insufferable stereotypes.  3.- The "poor little rich girl" who volunteers at a public clinic and loves the "poor and the pauper" but also likes to party wildly, swallow tons of pills and several other drugs (a cross between Mother Theresa and Sid Vicious) AND is deeply in love and ENGAGED with    4.- The incredibly shallow , insensitive, inhuman, unmoral, cocaine-loving, unlikable, stupid antipathetic upper class boyfriend.  there's some unreal and exploitative subplots (is there a plot?) and situations:  After a five year loving relationship and in a matter of few hours, Martin, the creepy Boyfriend:   1.- Goes "out of the closet" and, in a hateful and Homophobic manner, he sodomizes (and enjoys it!!)  a gay drug dealer who just saved his life (and who happens to be an old friend!!) in a middle of a death threatening situation, with his five-year-relationship-sweetheart fiancee left alone with the lowlifes.  2.-After being caught in the middle of the despicable Homo act , The creepy boyfriend is RIDICULED by his own loving girlfriend, who joins the three thugs in the mocking and a small drug party, like they were old, good  friends!!  3.- After a five year loving relationship, He doesn't hesitate to abandon his fiancee in the hands of the thugs at the first opportunity he has to escape.  4.- There are the thousand of taxis in Caracas, but He chose to escape precisely the one the thug's accomplice is driving.  What a coincidence.  5.- Absolutely all the Police force in Venezuela is utter corrupt, even worse than the criminals. And the military are all gays.   I wonder how Venezuela still exists.  The acting (and the screenplay) of this cinematic excrement consists in point guns to a head, make rape and executions threats, insults, beat and be beaten and an individual and extraordinary effort to be as unlikable as possible.  The embarrasing Ruben Blades cameo is totally forgettable.    This movie IS NOT a socio-political drama and , despite the film's pretentions to social relevance, there is nothing to be learned here and no pleasure to be had.   Just a very bad, derivative,  sensationalistic, exploitative and utter low piece of crap.  And you, latinamericans, should be ashamed to glorify and give positive reviews to this low, offensive monstruosity.  My rate Is not ONE out of five, actually is ZERO Stars out of five. Less than zero 
 I'd have put no star if I could have.  This thing is made from cheap plastic that's not sturdy enough to support a kitten, much less a full grown cat.  The rings came loose upon sitting it down onto the toilet so there couldn't be any stages unless it were taped together.  The setup won't fit onto a standard toilet without modification.  Do not buy this unless you want to know what "design flaw" really means 
 I purchased this item for use while driving my car in Oct of 2005 for $29.00 without tax.  I was told it would work for the LG phones which is what I have I see now you can no longer find these for sale and gee I wonder why... I probable used this item a total of 8 times when I drove my manual transmission car, I didnt really use it while driving my truck which was automatic.   The Jabra now does not work...and after only 8 uses, a friend of mine also bought one and his lasted about 6 months as well.  While using it the phone cuts out and the caller can not hear you at the other end and you have to constantly pull the plug and stick it back in, after a while you just give up cause it doesnt work. I emailed the company several times at info@jabra.com but have not tried to call them yet and had no results with the emails.  I have a feeling I lose anyways with this purchase. The thing is not worth the money and does not seem to last long and is not made for LG cell phones, Iknow the one I got with the phone stinks due to the fit but al least it was free and still works top notch. To bad this was a comfortable ear piece but very short lived. do not purchase this even for the 4.99 prices you may find it for on Ebay 
  At first I was real happy with this, but when I opened the case and started using it I realized how tiny this was. I could hardly fit my USB cable into it's pouch and if you put the ipod in the case that it came with and then into the travel case, it wouldn't really fit. The hole thing started falling apart after a few days and my ipod wouldn't stop falling out of the little lether so it got scatched alot. It's not really worth $30 to me. I suggest you do not buy it. 
 From the moment Celeste met her adoptive's father father...I knew there would be trouble. Not only didn't we find out if she were pregnant...which would have made for an interesting twist...she never heard from the boy she gave her virginity to again! I was really disappointed in this story 
 i am a huge dre fan but this didn't do it. tracks 3 and 12 are pretty good but other than that i didn't enjoy it. peep some of his other albums though 
 Sorry, but I have read many books on this subject and although he may have written this book for all the right reasons, I cannot believe some of the stuff he says in his book. Especially about Rock N Roll.  If it had not been for the group Petra which he blatently calls Ocult or devil worshippers, I would have never been able to embrace the Love and Grace of God.  He claims they made devil horns like what is done in Rolling Stones or Led Zepplin concerts and what he saw was the symble for I love you in sign language.  I've been to many of their concerts and that is the sign language they use for I Love You.  I would recommend however, Evangelising The New Age, Invasion Of Other God's both excellent books in this area.  Sorry, I would't be given this book again even if somebody dropped it on my door 
 This is about the worst translation of the Hebrew text imaginable. RamBam said exact translation is impossible, but a translater should try to put the Hebrew text into words as close to the same meaning as possible. The Artscroll siddur strays far from the equivalent meaning, giving the translation that the author wants to impress upon the reader, not what the Hebrew says or implies.   Also, the many directions to the davener are a bad distraction, almost all of which are customs practiced in certain locals, & have nothing to do with mitzvoth 
 This book as really good basic information, although most of the other information is obsolete.  Most texture artist(new or vetran) have surpassed this technology long ago.  It's great read for the basics, but beyond that, their are better books 
 DualDisc will not play in mid to high end players.  While I could get the DVD side to mostly play, the "CD" did not work at all.  To find out what the problem was I went to the Onkyo web site.  Their players do not support this format since the "CD" side is not actually a CD (accorning to Philips).  So if you play this disc and it ruins your player, the player's warrenty is void since this disc is not a supported format.  Beware!  Oh, what music I did hear on the 5.1 side was quite impressive 
 Did you know that Eminems favorite song is #9 on the "MAKAVELI" album 
 Crichton cobbles together a bunch of specious information from third-rate scientists to support the idea that climate warming is a hoax, and puts it all in the mouths of the most unbelievable characters to populate a novel in recent memory. The plot is laughable, the writing is sloppy, the dialogue is didactic. This is trash. Not even good trash. Too bad to see the author of Andromeda Strain sink so low. Shame on him 
 Will not play once video was downloaded. I get the error message:  "can not play file, please try again later. error# 0x80040273" I made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the UnBox department was already closed, I was told the UnBox Saturday and Sunday 6-5 hours. I have to say I am impressed with the Call back feature. I downloaded the Unbox Beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem. Thanks Amazon UnBox! I will Update again - Feb. 10,200 
 First time when I plugged in, the cell phone displayed error message that "Charging Error, remove immediately". since then I am not using this 
 If this book is fictional as even the people who are crazy about it admit, then how could they take it as historic fact? The degree of emotionalism involved by the Armenian reviewers here is phenomenal. It's almost as though this supposed genocide is a religious experience, and the truth needs to be damned.    An Ara Belian (Feb. 4, 2004) is upset at the revelations of another reviewer, whose essay made a lot of sense to me. He counts on stories by relatives as his evidence... but nobody is arguing Armenians did not suffer. The point is, everyone suffered during those tragic times. Didn't Armenians kill Turks in large numbers, that we never hear about? (Why are there no Turks in Armenia, when once the Turks were the majority?)    The point is whether a governmental extermination policy was in effect; this is the unproven part of genocide theory, and emotionalism is an unfair substitute for history.  All the "documented evidence, witnesses and memoirs of the genocide" prove is that ugliness occurred during what was a state of war. That's why none of it was admissible as actual evidence when the British attempted to try the Turks for massacre crimes at the end of WWI.    Taking the moral high road by claiming numbers don't matter is awfully ingenuous of Belian when propagandists make sure to tell us numbers do matter... the higher the number, the greater the sympathy value. That's why false numbers as 1.5 million have been created. Instead of saying he was made to "fume and filled ...with anger," why doesn't Mr. Belian THINK? Approach this subject coolly, rationally and without emotion? Instead of acting like a religious zealot who doesn't care about reason and common sense?  
 I would have rated in 5 stars for the quality of the story, but now that I know the majority of it has elements of untruth, it gets one star, and only because I can't rate it any lower.  He also left out a lot of things, like at least one marriage.  How do you forget THAT?  Based on the things that came out later, he probably should have been IN Riker's Island, not running it.  He sounds like someone who gets promoted because nobody likes them and there isn't enough on them to get them fired 
 Boring!! I was disappointed.  In fact, I disliked it so much, I only finished about 3/4 of the book.  That is very uncommon for me as I alway push through as I want to give the author a chance to turn it around.  I just could not do it with this book 
 The Gunslinger is the first book in Stephen King's Dark Tower series. It is the story of Roland Deschain's quest to find the man in black, who will lead him to the Dark Tower  On this journey, Roland travels through gritty rundown lands, often times lost in thought, reflecting on his past and all that he has lost. And thus becomes the pattern of the story. Roland travels and thinks and travels some more.  I did enjoy one childhood story in particular. He challenged his teacher and fought with a raven as his weapon. It proved that he was willing to sacrifice others, even a bird in this case, to further his own cause. This is why when we meet a young boy named, Jake, we know his fate is doomed as well.  Jake's story fascinated me. He was in New York City and the man in black ripped him from his world there and dumped him in the middle of the desert in Roland's world. He is a small glimmer of hope to an otherwise jaded story.  I had a hard time reading this book. At first I thought it was because I don't normally like western flavored stories, but my love for movies like Tombstone and shows like Deadwood have proved that's not always the case. It turns out that I just don't like the hero of the tale.  I think Jake was added to show us a softer, caring side of Roland, but it fell short. He knew he'd betray the boy from the beginning and we knew it too. Only, I wanted it to be something big when it happened. The big scene was a big let down. I remember thinking, "Wow, that's it? Please tell me that's not it."  I know heroes are not all supposed to be charmers, and I'm not one to mind if the hero is crass and ruthless. But no matter what, I found that I just didn't care about Roland or his plight or anything in his world. I couldn't attach myself to them.  What I enjoyed most in this book was reading the introduction King wrote since I always love reading when he writes about creating stories in general.  And well that's that. I have the next 4 or 5 books in this series and I haven't yet decided if I will continue it. How can I read more if I don't like the hero, eh 
 Thumbed through this book in the store... Loved the idea, and the  selection of topics - architecture, natural phenomena, etc. - really wanted  to buy it. Ran across some typos... some missing information... and  ultimately just plain bogus "mathematics": sin^2 + cos^2 =1.  Well, sin and cos of what? As written, it's nonsense... there's nonsense  all around us too, but I wouldn't want to read a book about it. Wondered  why the publisher did not employ an editor... put it back on the shelf 
 I think Steve Seim's review is excellent. The book is a famous statement of an editorial point of view, namely the communitarian claim that individualism has led to the incoherence of Americans' religious and moral claims. But like so many books, the authors dissemble to pretend they're scientifically reporting objective news rather than a kind of editorial. In this sense, the book is not substantially different from the kind of pseudo-science we've come to expect from sociologists, who, after conducting some interviews and handing out some loaded surveys, tell us "what's really going on" with the "modern American woman" or "Generation X" or, in this case, the "modern [misguided] liberal American." I, for one, view such work as social criticism vital to our society, and it makes thoughtful reading, but it is not scientific, and I wish we could get beyond this need to justify such claims with "scientific" surveys.  Considering this book represents more a kind of punditry than research, despite its claims, please consider reading the most famous response to the book, the chapters from Jeffrey Stout's "Ethics After Babel" devoted to the book. Stout, in one instance, close-reads one of the interviews, in which a guy is asked what's important to him, and whenever he talks about "being good" and "being honest," the interviewers grill him "but why? but why?" until after many replies relating to maturing and learning from his experience, he finally says something like "it benefits me to live a life of honesty" so the authors end the interview and conclude he's a rabid individualist whose only basis for his ethics is egocentric utilitarianism. They did not, for example, explore whether he has a rather rich concept of personal honor, or even a sense of Stoic maturity, either of which seems a more accurate way of describing his answers up to the point they choose to end on. Either alternative reflects a vocabulary of long standing moral traditions, which would contradict the authors' claims - ala Alisdair MacIntyre-- that modern liberal Americans have no such vocabulary.  In fact, I find it rather hilarious that they use this subject as the quintessential amoral individualist, since communitarian founding father Aristotle says repeatedly throughout the Ethics that living a life of virtue must benefit the individual, for to say the opposite would be akin to saying that giving a plant sunshine doesn't benefit the plant.  Of course this connection of virtue and human benefit is problematized in other ethical systems, but, still, it's funny to me that Arisotle could be characterized as lacking a moral framework because he connects living virtuously with personal benefit.  In any case, reading both this book and Stout, you're in a good position to come to your own conclusions 
 My daughter received this as gift from her Aunt(an Eloise fan) for her 6th birthday.  I found it to be confusing.  I would not pick this for a child. Not my idea of a childrens book 
 I bought this for my daughter.  She hardly ever played with it.  The furniture fell apart without much use.  The dolls were not fun (they didn't do anything & were ugly) & most other dolls will not fit in the house!  My daughter now wants a new doll house that is more fun.  
 This is for reviewer CHRISTOPHER FUNG. If you found Argulles' work to be a load of mallarky, you might find an alternate study of the Mayan Calendar interesting. Swedish Mayanist/authro Carl Johan Calleman has written a book on the subject and he is in strong disagreement with Argulles' conjectures (and this whole Dreamspell business). He even sets a completely different date for the end of the Mayan Calendar (a year earlier). Hope you find this info useful 
 [...]  The writer does not understand the plight of Christians in muslim countries or what in practice Dhimmitude involves today as opposed to centuries ago under the turks.  She depends on interpretations of texts rather than the life experiences of real people.  The experiences of each country under Islam has been very different.  Christianity was not destroyed in by Islamic rule in places like Greece or Bulgaria, even though they suffered terribly in all places.  Islam cannot destroy christians who stand true.  The purpose of this book and its author is to whip up anti-islamic feelings in the west to a point where a conflict of civiliations becomes a reality.  After all, for those who accept her (false) case, the only viable alternative to "save" the west is going to be to eliminate freedom of religion for Muslims.  And what an anti-islamic crusade will mean for eastern christians is their total destruction.  Christians in the middle east learned in Iraq that they have no friends in America.  The only thing the americans brought were missionaries to convert Christians to american churches.  Churches where Christ is ignored, there are no crosses and where their god seems to be the Israeli government.  If you want to read true stories of eastern christianity in english, I would recommend William Dalrymple's From the Holy Mountain. 
 We were so excited to get this for Christmas. We opened it up, put it together and low and behold it was pure and utter frustration for all of us. There isn't enough power to turn the wheel. The attachments don't work. The clay will not stay on the wheel. We finally gave up. We will be sending it back to the manufacturer with a letter. DO NOT BUY 
 This book was horrible! There was no logical order to the book because it is just a bunch of stories put together about Duveen. It is so boring, all the book does is talk about how dumb millionares were and how they were stupid enough to buy from Duveen and his crazy ways. This book was so bad, please save yourself the time and money and not buy this book 
 My son and I absolutely LOVE Chicka Chicka Boom Boom, and I was thrilled when I saw this book at our library.  I checked it out right away.  Unfortunately, it lacks so much of what made the first book so delightful.  The rhymes are not nearly as fluid as in Chicka Chicka Boom Boom, and as another reviewer says, it is confusing why Zero is the Hero of the apple tree.  There are better counting books out there.  Check it out from the libary first.  You might like it, but I would recommend trying it out before you buy it.  You won't want to waste your money 
 I still like the book, but new teachers should be careful when reading it.  Several people have written that Esquith has left out some important details.  For instance, what kind of population is this really?  There are no African-Americans on the cover, or I don't know if they are even directly mentioned in the book.  I don't believe race has any direct bearing on how well a student will do, but a white male compared to a black female teaching African-Americans in a "jungle" will have quite a different experience than a white male like Rafe teaching immigrants or Americans of immigrant families.  Also, are most of these students from single-parent households?  And when immigrants come to the U.S., don't many of them already have somewhat of a work ethic instilled in them due to their history and culture?  Otherwise, I think it is a good book and I enjoyed it very much 
 This is the worst book in the history of books!!!!! My friend said it was good and i won't tell you that his name is cory shneck. Or SMS student. But it is the worst and most boring book in the world! Never read this book even if your being tortured 
 I bought this book because I had a fear of childbirth. I was hoping to be taught methods to reduce my fear or reduce the pain.  That was not the case.  It did address the fear + tension = pain cycle.  However,I can't say I got any of the other useful tips I was expecting.  His central message is definitely it is healthier and better to birth naturally.  He does empower women to believe their bodies can handle it.  (Personally I think both Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way and Supernatural Birth by Jackie Mize do a better job at this.  I particularly loved Easing Labor Pain stocked full of things you could do to minimize pain.)  My biggest criticism was that  I think it might be unrealistic to say that childbirth doesn't hurt at all.  I particularly found this advice hard to swallow coming from a man.  How does he know?  There is a big difference between watching childbirth and experiencing it firsthand. I don't care how many labors he's observed, when he's actually been through one himself his opinion will have more validity to me.   
 Batman Begins is soooo much better than this or any other of the batman movies. Nicholson SUCKED as the Joker. Joker is a comedian who had an accident trying to pull a robbery to help his pregnant wife. HE IS NOT A GANGSTER OR THE ONE WHO KILLED BATMAN'S PARENTS!!!! HE IS A PSYCHO AND BATMAN'S NEMESIS!!! YOU CAN'T KILL HIM OFF!!! HOW STUPID IS THAT?!!! Who came up with that one. Keaton is a sissy, Christian Bale could beat him down!!! Keaton DID NOT have the physical prescence to play Batman. All in all, a joke of a comic movie..But it is better than Daredevil!!!!:- 
 In the name of science, you will try to prove with propagande; if you really want to decode how junk scientifics manipulate the world: go http://nomorefakenews.com and do not buy this junk BOOK 
 I was doing the new change series and felt something wasn't right.Found out on the internet it's a cult all the way.This book is the mildest of all her teachings.Let me tell you if you don't do it her way you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.It's all so subtle when you sit there week after week and watch the dvd's it's all about her and her son and so subtle Remnant Fellowship the only called out ones.You'd better get in the arch or you are not the true followers of the Lord.Well Gwen we are saved by Grace through faith,it's a gift from God,not of works so no one can boast! That's all she does is boast how sinless or tries to be sinless she is and her perfect Remnant.I have been talking to several people that she has judge and judged hard and it makes me sick! Just look up on the internet type in Gwen Shamblin and you will judge for yourself what this Weighdown teaching is all about.Judge not least you be judge and why do you look at the speak in your brothers eye when all the time you have a log in your own eye?I never heard anything about God's Grace it's all twisted scripture.There's fruit all right in these peoples lives well other cults have fruit too! And the really overweight people if they are totally honest with you they starved themselves to get the rest of their weight off.JUST BEWARE!! 
 I have read many serotonin-related books and I am quite confused. In his book "Beyond Prozac" Michael J. Norden, an eminent Psychiatrist, states that the much-publicized high-carbohydrate diet may actually make you depressed and overweight. In "Potatoes not Prozac" a  high-carb plus protein diet is advocated. Dr. Joel Robertson in his  "Natural Prozac" states that protein is a dopamine booster. Who  should one believe? What is true and what is not? Should one accept Dr.  Wurtman's approach as correct? O.K. she is an M.I.T. professor but the  other authors have impressive academic credentials as well 
 This seemed like a pretty slick idea, and was a pretty clock.  All it needs to do is let us know that our stomachs aren't lying, that it really is near lunch.   I set it near our front (glass) door and it apparently found a signal as it had changed time by itself and was spot on.  So I hung it in our office (no window).  Two days latter we had a thunderstorm one night.  Apparently that can interfere with the signal.  Rather than sit tight and wait for a fresh signal, this thing was off by an odd amount of time, like an hour and 27 min by the next morning.    I set it manually, and today it's off again by about an hour.    The instructions to reset which I got from Tech Support were not less than 7 steps long and included a detailed disertation on what type of battery, and what it's expiration should be.    Man, that's a lot of work just to verify what my stomach knows is true.  For $25, and the packaging being gone, this is in the dumpster.  I'll get a regular clock that only keeps time to a couple of minutes a month....but takes a month to show the error 
 The author tries to make his design methodology a science. However, the two axioms in his theory were drawn from past "good" design examples by his own judgement, rather than common sense that everyone perceives. You can easily find many design examples that "violate" his design axioms, but remain well-accepted and good designs nowaday, such as integrated design modules, side-open fridge, etc. Over all, this book provides an alternative design philosophy. Design axioms? Maybe too ambitious... 
 Normally, I find it hard to put a Sue Grafton book down once I get started. Not the case with "S". I did not enjoy the plot about Violet and her abusive husand.  The main character Violet was too much of a stereotype - boobs, red hair, just a boozing slut over all.  I didn't get the whole thing about her brother and why he disliked her. The ending wasn't clear either. I did like the development of the relationships with the young girls exposing jealousy and how it ruined relationships over several decades. Most of the characters just weren't that interesting overall.  I missed her interactions with Rosie the restaurant owner and her neighbor, the handsome 80 year old baker Henry. Usually, there is an interesting man in the picture too - not here.  I would vote pass on this one. 
 The author was obviously inspired by the best movie of 1997, L.A. Confidential, to dig into archival photos to show the "real Los Angeles." However, his ugly condemnation of the city--a city that needs to be "redeemed"--is as hysterically false as the boosterism of the "noir era" that proclaimed the metropolis as an eden of sunshine and wealth. His iconoclastic glee is a little too much. Are we really to be shocked that in a city of millions you'll find crime, gangsters, potheads, gambling joints, religious frauds and crooked cops? And author Heimann, breathless as he seems to be, is hardly the first to dredge the underbelly of the glamour capital of the world. Writers like Raymond Chandler, James M. Cain and Nathanael West did so many, many years ago. As other reviewers have noted, the photos are interesting but the text is witless and non-instructive. And his generalizations are annoying. As a lifelong Angeleno, most of the city's residents--then and now--are ordinary folks working hard to make a living and raise their families. This comes off as a smear job. I don't love L.A., but I don't think it's a non-redeemed hellhole either, now or in its history. Chronicle Books is one of my favorite publishers, but this is very poor journalism verging on propaganda 
 I have heard that this is a children's book (and perhaps there are abridged versions), but I have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense, verbose novel and understand the subtle, underlying themes Swift portrays. I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow. All in all, this book is an exploration into man's true nature and, despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge, expresses a mature intellect that reflects Swift's intelligence. 
 Since I listened to this as a cd it is difficult to comment on the book as Tony Roberts performance was so bad, it was impossible to follow the story line.  He read so slowly that it seems he received a bonus if he could stretch this little book into 7 excruciating cds which he did.  In addition to the slooooow reading, his characterization were completely over the top.  Dino sounded like a moron and "Billy Bob" well like a Texas moron.  And what about Billy Bob, that cliche name eptomized the whole weak little story.  Skip this this one or prepare to suffer 
 Atheists have a lower divorce rate than born again christians but I guess thats just a fluke hu, Ann. They must be bad people somehow. People like Ann can't be christians because they shame one person for having an affair and then forgive another that is an alcoholic because he's a republican. She speaks to people who want to believe so bad they don't care that she doesn't have a christian bone in her body. True christians don't defame, judge or claime superiority. She doesn't have any idea of what being Jesus-like is. Oh and intelligent design is not science. Science is how Religion is why- They are too different questions 
 Hoffman has offered meat in the fat.There is nothing like a good stew.Whether one agrees or not with his imagination his opinions are mind expanding.What man can think of he will probably create.One example that he points out is the lack of awareness or concern about illigal immigration.Probably the greatest threat to the security of the western world.A brainwashed western world.Who and what is the senate and congress of the US,and what, and why are they doing, what they are doing regarding immigration.Maybe we do not deserve to exist.Secret socities,the Masons seem to be the bottom line.Who was the founder,and what is the end.Maybe the old boys culbs gone berserk.The end justify the means.Maybe the apples are not here for you.Some say there can only be one king of the mountain.Somebody said let them eat cake.Symbols are all around us,just start lookind and you will see.Oswald,Ruby,Dallas.Who and what is Mr.Bush,what kind of family ties.One needs a knowledge of soial science to understand Mr.Hoffman,and one should also question is motive,for many things are not as they seem.I think the book is outstanding.

 At first glance, the book appears to be well researched, but upon digging further into the quoted studies, many of them are taken out of context (neurological conclusions taken from nutrition and respiratory journals; conclusions based on preliminary findings and other non-peer reviewed sources; conclusions taken from studies that were not the primary focus of the study with doubtful population sizes; etc.)  I was disappointed that the science didn't stand up to a rigorous examination 
 I'm giving it two stars, though it may deserve one more, to balance out the rave reviews by others.  Take warning, this book is not what it appears to be.  The cover looks appealing, the subtitle is misleading.  There are better books to help you "discover greater creativity and artistic confidence."  (One is Paint Happy by Cristina Acosta.)  This book is mostly about keeping artistic track of your travels throughout the world in the form of a creative journal.  It does also include ideas for making business meetings more entertaining--i.e., by drawing your colleagues--but many of those ideas may not appeal to  stay-at-home or housewife types of people (which I am).  About half of the activities are less exotic, but there were too many exotic or really boring ones for my taste.  The book is not set up very well.  The chapter titles are clear enough, but the pages are sort of mushy looking.  It is not easy to tell at a glance if the page is a project page or a sample of other peoples' art page; it doesn't seem to have many projects.  The main media used in the book were drawing and watercolor.  The collage section was kind of nice.  Most of the projects are for pages in your creative journal, not for paintings you might want to hang up somewhere, but she does show you how to develop some the ideas into paintings, which is nice.  All in all though, this book just didn't appeal to me.  It should have been crammed full of fun ideas and it wasn't.  My advice is to look through the book completely before you buy it because it is an expense and it takes up space 
 Crudely written. A negative hero deserves better and Wharton has written some fine books. Sadly, not this one. 
 I had a Kodak camera for years that I absolutely loved.  We took it ice skating and ended up falling on it.  Therefore, my family bought me this Sony for my b-day and I have to say this is the worst camera I have ever owned.  If you have any movement (such as action shots or small children) the picture always comes out blurry.  What a pain!  Also, the picture quality is horrible.  I will not purchase a sony again and am going back to a Kodak 
 The most memorable part of this film was the dance scene to "Night Life" which would repeat through the movie.  This version credits the song, but it was replaced with some lame disco music. I am writing MGM to complain and demand a refund.  Even the trailer has the right music playing all through it.  Demand the original 
 Delores Cannon certainly gives us an interesting view into the lives of the Essenes.  Built on the assumption of reincarnation and the possibility of past life regression, she attempts to show much detail of the times and peoples that were the Essene community, and ultimately, the life of Christ.  While it certainly is interesting reading, it is completely devoid of corroborating evidence.  She tends to agree or disagree with Archaeologists (never saying who her sources are), depending on whether they agree with her research.  Also, she supports the validity of her story as being more authentic than the Biblical account, as she claims to have an older source, a teacher named Suddi from the Essene community.  Some problems include the fact that while she claims the Biblical record has been changed, she seems to forget that the Dead Sea Scrolls from Qumran actually show the accuracy of the Biblical record, by moving the Old Testament back 1100 years, and yet with no significant changes.  It seems that her purpose is to promote her own view of reality, than to deal with any real historical evidence.  While it's an interesting story, I have to deeply question that there's anything resembling true research or evidence in this book 
 I've read every one of Iris Johansen's "suspense" novels and have loved most of them.  The last couple though have been so painful to get through. This one however, I don't think I can even finish.  I read where someone called these characters "cardboard," and I couldn't agree more.  The female heroine randomly throws in curse words in a cheap attempt to create tension between herself and the supposed male protagonist.  Whereas in the Eve Duncan Books and the Wind Dancer books we are drawn into the story and come to care for the characters, it is patently obvious what will happen with each of these characters - makes me think of a writing 101 class.  "Now this should happen here, and this here, and this here and boom, climax, happily every after."    I hope that Iris can get her groove back and begin writing novels worth my time.  
 This book was interesting at first.  It shatters what most of us think the typical millionaire looks and acts like, but that only takes a chapter.  After that, it just keeps repeating itself over and over.  "Who do you think bought the $1000 watch and who bought the lower priced watch?"  Yeah, yeah, I get it; the millionaire has a lower priced watch than the overspending, no real wealth guy.    Then some of the examples are so over simplified or exaggerated that you know they are made up to make a point.  I want real examples.  I don't care if you give them goofy code names to protect identity, but don't come up with such bad comparisons to prove a point if it isn't real.    Then there is the advice on being frugal.  I am pretty frugal, but some of what they said would put me in the crazy house if I had to live like that.  Sure, I could cut out every unnecessary expense from my budget, but then I wouldn't be very happy.  Who cares if I have a million when I'm 60ish if I had to live miserably up until then.  What is that worth?  I know not to go out and buy a brand new luxury car, but driving around my 20 year old Jeep is no fun either!  This book is good for the first chapter and if you are just completely clueless or a compulsive over spender.  People with common sense need not buy this book, just check it out at the library like I did 
 This man is another example of our over-affluent society's attempt to distract itself from existential angst via the myth that we should all be happy and feel good. Deepak Chopra has grown very rich catering to the alienation of misguided Marin County yuppies. Sleep is important, as is taking care of our bodies and minds, but do we need a smarmy swami to tell us this? Basic common sense (drink a lot of water...) is sugar-coated in pseudo-spiritual jargon, insulting the intelligence of anyone other than self-help-junkies and cult-bait. Can't sleep? Use the 17 bucks to buy a real book, and read it in bed. Or buy a vibrator 
 I cannot believe I was recomended this because I rated Love's Enduring Promise (which is decent, moral, Christian movie). I read only part of the first customer reveiw, and it sounds really, really sick. Amazon.com: take a clue. I appreciate your services, and I expect that you won't try to sell me anything else of this type. Zero stars. I would not reccomend this to anyone 
      Despite its lofty status as a revered icon of English literature, one only has to fight through a dozen or so pages to reach the painfully obivious conclusion that Ulysses is, in fact, unreadable gibberish.      The book has no plot, no dramatic arc, no message, a (literally) pedestrian structure, and sentences constructed by means of a random walk through the dictionary as well as through Dublin, Ireland.  It has no discernable central thought.  No one can tell you what the book is about, for it is about nothing.  But wait, perhaps there is an underlying theme, albeit one well hidden.      Remember the fable of the Emperor's new clothes?  Guillible courtiers were induced to beleive that a charlatan tailor had sewn garments for the Emperor that only suitably refined folk could see.  In reality, there was nothing there at all.  Jame Joyce and generations of literary sycophants have convinced impressionable students that Ulysses is a worthy read.      When the uninitiaed find the text incoherent, this failure is chalked up to insufficient literary maturity.  It can't be the fault of the book's alcohol-addled author.      "Press on," the professors say, "Ulysses' gloss will be revealed if only one perseveres past the many opaque chapters, thus developing the right sensitivities."      However, looking longer at this nonsense only reveals the glaring absense of rational content and the transparent emptiness.  The self-indulgent Emperor Joyce has no clothes.      The most damming indictment of this over-wrought tome is the fact that it is impossible to find ten people who have actually finished it.  Ulysses is one of those books that everyone has heard of, but no one has read.  Hence the market for Ulysses crib cards for use at cocktail parties by poseurs with literary pretensions or by guys with dates with English Lit chicks whom they are trying to bed.  Perhaps Ulysses has some tactical utility after all, as an example of inverse Chick Lit.      One supposes that the stream-of-consciousness descriptions of nose picking, masturbation, and sex broke ground for serious literature when published in the 1920's.  Joyce deserves some credit for expanding the gross horizons of writing, but today's target audiences find those subjects ordinary and routine.  This taboo-breaking history is hardly sufficient reason to examine Ulysses now.  To be timeless literature, a book must speak to fundamental truths about ourselves.      But what, if anything, does Ulysses tell us about the human condition?  I suggest its plot-free message is one Joyce didn't, or couldn't, intend.  That is; to trust one's educated common sense.  If, to you, a book walks like a duck, looks like a duck, and sounds like a duck, then it was most likely written by a quack.      If this stream-of-consciousness genre appeals to you, for a much better read get anything by Hunter S. Thompson.  Dr. Gonzo's book will be more coherent, make more sense, and will be better crafted.  And, your eyes won't glaze over after ten pages, as they will with Ulysses.     
 Though this book was written much better than Foundation's Fear, I wasn't very impressed. You know how movie studios always do re-makes of old movies? Well this here is a re-write, basically of the first chapter of Asimov's classic original Foundation book. What a waste of paper. If you already read the original, then you already know what will happen at the end 
 I'm a big fan of the Klutz line in general, but this one was a major disappointment.  After having much success and fun with their Beadlings and Beaded Rings books, and being both a lifelong crafter and an experienced knitter & crocheter, I thought the Spool Knitting book would be fun & easy to take on.  What a great idea, adding beads and elastic into the spool knitting craft!  However, this kit turned out to be a great idea that was very poorly executed by Klutz.  BEAD AND CORD ISSUES:   The smaller beads supplied in the kit are WAAAYYYY too small in diameter to easily string on the narrowest elastic cord supplied in the kit, and even after following the book's suggestion to dip my elastic cord ends in clear nail polish, they continued to fray and I continued to struggle with stringing the supplied beads.  It was more frustrating than fun, and I couldn't substitute my own, larger-holed beads because they'd be too big to pass through the supplied knitting spool.    SPOOL ISSUES: When using the wider elastic cord and slightly larger beads from the kit, it's hard to fit the beads between the spokes of the knitting spool.  Also, the knitted tube must be forced through the knitting spool because the spool's center hole isn't wide enough to easily accomodate a beaded tube.  The result is more fraying and more frustration.    I ended up dumping the supplied beads into my general beading stash and giving the elastic cord to my neices to make themselves necklaces by stringing some of my own beads on the cord.  Klutz should've supplied narrower elastic cord for use with the smallest beads (or if that wasn't possible, small-size beads with larger holes in them), and and a wider-diameter knitting spool.  I still have no use for the Klutz knitting spool, as it's too small for use with regular yarn.    Klutz was always my "go-to" for reliably fun, easy, quality craft kits, especially for kits to use with kids; unfortunately, now I'm going to have to check their stuff out just as thoroughly as I would any non-Klutz kit, and test their kits out myself before getting the kids involved.  
 Okay first off atreyu is awesome, i love the band. Seriously though, a best off. They have 3 albums and and ep out.  Now the music on here is good but it's missing a few tracks. For instance Rememberance Ballad, Shameful, and My fork in the road(your knife in my back).  This is clearly a Victory records idea to get as much money from the Atreyu brand while they can. and what better way than exploiting the catalogue of songs then a best of album. 
 I bought 2 charges to try and save a buck, but they are complete junk.  They worked, but never well, for about a month and then the metal charger tip totally pulled apart from the unit 
 Great cd but there is a catch..........Watch the movie and listen to "A Heart Is A House For Love"..and "Nights Like This".Then listen to the cd.On the movie these songs are sung perfectly by Billy Valentine but on the cd they  changed "A heart is a House 4 Love,"  which on the cd was sung by The Dells.I love the Dells great job but.. There is no excuse for them changing "Nights Like This" after 7 ruined that song. Billy Valentine sung it with power and I bought the cd hoping it was him I was very let down. I am still looking 4 a copy of him singing it but no luck 
 what a joke...people believe the stupidest things...do some research and you will see that this is a joke.  I hated it 
 Who's idea was it to have Victor Garber as Daddy Warbucks? Okay he is a good actor, but once they had shaved his head, did they not see how freakishly Enormal it was? or the shine? THe original Annie was awesome, it was perfect, it didnt need a cheesy remake in the 90's.The new Annie doesnt even fit the bill, no red curly hair, which wasnt the original movies idea, it was based on the cartoon. My niece saw this one first, and then the original, and she LOVES the original even though she saw it second, she said the new one isnt "as fun to watch" and i agree 
 The reading was okay, but there wasn't much meat to it. Each page has a paragraph or maybe two that tells a story. Only a handful are interesting as many explain boring stuff like where pictures of old executives are located. One of the most interesting pages told about how Disney bought up all of the FL property using fictitious companies. For the price, I was disappointed as most of it is not notable. If you're a Disney buff, get this from the library and save the $$$ - you can read it in a 1/2 hr sitting 
 I ordered this product online and received it with a broken lid. Feeling very disappointed, I returned it and asked for a refund. I used a pre-paid label, as this is not my fault. Unfortunately, the cost of return shipping has been deducted from my refund, and they said the return is not the result of their error. I'm very confused here, I paid return shipping for someone else's error? 
 I have enjoyed several books by Anna Quindlen and looked forward to her latest offering. I settled down for an evening of reading 3 nights in a row before I finally gave up. I found the writing trite and boring. I didn't care about the characters as it took too long for them to become something. I'm wondering if this was something she wrote earlier in her career and tried to make a silk purse from a sow's ear. Rise and Shine? Not this time 
 Like other reviewers have mentioned this book is poorly edited, poorly written, and clearly a simple attempt to cash in on the 3E-3.5E switch.  Do not buy this book if you like the Realms. It is full of pointless rules, poor art, and useless content.  One of my largest pet peeves about this book has to do with the art in the beginning. It has characters of different races and ethnicities labeled incorrectly. Someone should tell the editors at WoTC that there is more to editing than grammar and spelling.   
 The glossy photos in this pricey book can help spark your imagination to come up with interesting-looking starters.  I found several of the actual recipes, however, bland and uninteresting.  Also beware that many of the photos are printed backwards or upside down so captions don't match. While sometimes pretty and pleasant, the look of the food is frequently rococo and overdone--the book doesn't follow its own advice to keep the presentation simple and the decorations in harmony with the setting. .. 
 Locking your parents in the basement just to work out their marrage problems what a joke! I think my parents would be so incredibly pissed off and would kill me if I ever locked em in the basement like that with no food and treating them like they are prisoners you don't do that to your family if they want a divorce and move on with their lives that's their business. You can't change people like that it just doesn't work. this use to come on all the time on HBO and HBO is a huge waste of money nothing but worthless re run crappy movies on all the time. I give this crap 0 stars it sucked 
 Glib. While I feel for the suburban "lives of quiet desperation" angle, however shopworn, here it feels trite and slightly exploitative. Moody makes lists in lieu of description. Maybe this is a comment on the consumerism of the culture he's limning. But it comes off as lazy, as if he did a lot of research to come up with all these pop culture references and instead of integrating them just ticks them off. Even if he lived in that place and time he would have been younger than any of his characters. I was Wendy Hood's age in '73, living in a town next door to New Canaan, and I well remember that ice storm, when we were without power for a week, when a sofa caught fire in our house after using the fireplace non-stop for days. It's not that Moody gets the details wrong exactly, but they feel researched rather than lived, like the over-obvious production design of a mediocre movie. I don't remember key parties, I can't imagine my parents or their friends being remotely that adventurous. And the kids seem if anything a shade naive sexually. I came to the book long after the movie, which somehow did manage to get a lot of idiosyncratic details right. Little things like the mesmerizing patterns of the electrical wires along the train lines or white collar suburbanites using well worn trails to cut through the woods to  the neighbors'. The book was a disappointment 
 "Star Wars: Spinter in the Mind's Eye" has Luke and Leia shot down on a Imperial mining world, and then racing against Darth Vader to find a crystal with great Force power.  I guess I am a product of my time, I really didn't like "Splinter of the Mind's Eye".  It didn't make any sense in the grand sceme of the "Star Wars" universe, and it was a dully imagined story to boot.  I know it was wrote just after the original "Star Wars" was a huge success, and it was an alternate sequel if "A New Hope" was not successful.  It also was wrote well before any of the other expansion books were; but it still just dosn't fit in with the rest of the mythology, though I realize it is not anyone's fault at all.  The idea of a crystal being a Force power source (kind of like a battery) was silly; the handleing of Darth Vader and his cory dialouge was bad, Luke and Leia are acting a lot closer than siblings and was really creepy (this could have been avoided; George Lucas could have stopped it).  And where was han and Chewbacca?  But there are a few good scenes, like the breakout from Imperial jail and the duel between Luke and the primitives.  All in all; it is a book wrote way before it's time 
 For someone who never met Lee Strasberg, attended his classes, interviewed his students, or grasped the meaning of his work, the author has a lot to say about Strasberg.  The bulk of this book grinds its axe on a man who has  been dead since 1982.  It is wrongheaded, at times cruel, and a complete  misrepresentation of Strasberg and the Method.  It attributes a lot of our  ills to Strasberg, who produced some of the finest actors in America.  The  book actually ends up repeating much of what Strasberg advocated 
 I was disappointed with this book.  Yes, it does have lots of reward ideas (I tried counting them but only got to around half of the advertised 1001 ideas).  What really disappointed me, however, was that most of them required a fairly large expenditure.  I work for a small company (under 100 employees) and in a tight economic environment, we just don't have the funds to be sending people to Hawaii or some of the other *big* rewards in this book.  I needed something that recommended inexpensive reward options.  This book was not it.  (I did find another one listed on Amazon that advertises it has "101 ways to reward team members for $20 or less" -- I think that might suit me better.  I'm going to buy that one next and see if it suits my situation any better. 
 Taming A Liger: Unexpected Spiritual Lessons From Napoleon Dynamite contains a lot of unexpected things, mainly that this book is a fraud.  There is a huge difference between Spiritual Lessons and 24 chapters of Jesus.  This book is nothing by a tool to try to make you believe in Jesus.  What's next from these guys `Spiritual Lessons from Porno'?  Save your money and don't buy this toilet paper.   
 Set against the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War, "Talk of Angels" could have been provocative and sweeping, but it settles for little more than standard-issue Governess Falls for The Rich Guy romance. Vincent Perez has a smoldering presence, but the beautiful Polly Walker is as flat on screen as a Fascist protest poster. The two have little chemistry. The result: a stilted and perfunctory outing. The only saving grace is the always wonderful Frances McDormand, whose hard-bitten, love-struck fellow governess offers a sad little bit of zest 
 I agree with the reviewers who say this book is comedy and entertainment, not facts.  It should never come up on searches for books about sex for teens. Much of the content is inappropriate  and lacking medical accuracy 
 My son has had this pogo stick for about a year and has not been able to play on it because the spring is too stiff and does not compress easily.  Even my daughter who weighs 70 lbs cannot get it to work.  Our 11 year old neighbour who has her own pogo stick had no problems, but it is not for the beginner 
 The problem with being self-righteous is that, in time, people discover you're hypocrite. Way to cheat on your wife Bill. Now, go after someone who doesn't exercise your idea of family values 
 While the author does go into detail about numerous topics and informs the reader about what is necessary to survive.  What I think the books lacks is the detail necessary on all of the major topics.  An example would be that he describes how to build a leanto for shelter, but doesn't go into detail on how to tie the structural members together.  He just tells you that you need to tie them together.  What if you don't have a shoelace to use?  What other alternates are there?  This book would be great for a teenager who goes camping and may need to build a fire, but it's not enough for the serious camper 
 Please don't waste your money on this agenda-driven, ill-informed book. Anyone who tries to convince you that climate change is not a serious and potentially catastrophic problem is either delusional or receiving funding from the oil industries. There are dozens of much better, more persuasive and well-researched books out there: James Gustave Speth's Red Sky at Morning is a good place to start.   Just because something is comfortable to believe,  legitimates your current lifestyle, and doesn't ask you to change your habits of consumption does not make it tru 
 I purchased my version of El Hazard from a zShop for 19 bucks and I am SO glad that I did. That said, the first series is worth watching for two main reasons: overt lesbianism and Jinnai. The former is self-explanatory while the latter (Jinnai) is without a doubt the best character in the series (despite the fact that he is the antagonist). You can't say that any of the characters are very deep or well developed, but throughout the first series Jennai is by far the most satisfyingly fleshed-out character, as well as the most ammusing and true to his nature. This superiority is all the more appearant when he is contrasted with story's main character who is shallowly developed and in no way engaging. And this is what makes the second series (all four dismal episodes) so tragic: they nerfed Jinnai. He could never have been called a genius in the first series, but he was decidedly intelligent, cool, pragmatic, supremely self-confident and an effective leader (even though he was also manic and delusional). In El Hazard II, as if in response to the world recoiling at the sight of a humorous though competent villain, they have turned Jinnai into a slapstick-idiot persuing his increasingly nebulous ambition with foolish abandon. I suggest purchasing El Hazard through...alternate means,... watching the first series and discarding the second. Let's face it: even lesbian humor gets old when the writing sucks and the characters are empty 
 It apparently doesn't strike people as odd that Bush does not belong to a congregation and rarely goes to any church. Too busy? He spends more time on vacation than any President in history. Too disruptive? Carter not only attended a Washington Baptist church every Sunday, but taught Sunday school. Bush isn't alone; Reagan didn't attend church while President, either 
 i am still waiting for a credit to my credit card account. the item was not available and they said i would be credited. still waiting! 
 I found this DVD real cheap and bought it. I really tried hard to like the movie, but I just couldn't because the acting was incredibly bad, especially that of the bad guys causing havoc in the city. Even the guys who don't have lines display bad performances.   An hour into this movie you ask yourself why you torture yourself just to watch a bad sequal to a good movie. I broke this DVD and threw it out, something I've only done to 4-5 DVDs I felt needed to disappear off the face of the earth 
 This book was crazy and all over the place.  I would not recommend this book to anyone it was far to unrealistic.  The mother went from normal and sane Mother to crazy pysho killer mother in a couple pages 
 Yes it touches on points that affect the user experience but it is so disjointed and abstract to be almost a hindrance.    Listen, the guy may have some good ideas and probably knows how to create an effective user-experience but this book should never have been written. You can't write an entire book on user experience based on a sketch you did in 1999. 
 This was the first Tami Hoag novel for me, and it will be my last. After reading such great reviews I expected more from this veteran author. What promised to be a murder mystery was, in fact, no mystery at all. After the first couple of chapters I had surmised "who done it," and by mid-novel I had wrapped up the rest of the so-called loose ends. This detective story is Mickey Spillane gone very long and very predictable 
 Ruby Payne's A Framework for Understanding Poverty describes a personal journey, but falls short of creating an entire framework of poverty applicable to all situations. Since her evidence is based solely on her personal experience, if readers apply her theories, it will only exacerbate existing stereotypes.    Payne's book is riddled with over generalizations. It has been our experience that people in poverty do not feel a "need to beat around the bush" (30).  And by stating this, is she implying that all middle and upper class people always speak directly to the point?  The fact remains that patterns of discourse (and poverty), rely more on regional, cultural, and societal factors, which Payne simply does not address.  Furthermore, her assertion that "fighting and physical violence are a part of poverty" (37) confirms the bias of her own personal experience imbedded in her publication, and about people in poverty around the world.  The result is a deficit theory perspective that  adversely affects her approach in dealing with an impoverished population.  Even more frightening is the fact that she influences the approach of many others who read her book without a critical mindset, and assume the same biases and stereotypes which may hinder rather than help those trying to escape poverty.  We recommend future readers of this book to  read with caution, and resist her attempts to facilitate assimilation into a classist society 
 Hurriedly churned out. Pop. Superficial. Still, fun in a sophomoric way. There are many ways one might find enlightenment, even by stubbing your toe. But, stubbing your toe is cheaper, and leaves a longer lasting impression. Beautiful cover art, though. Too bad it doesn't relate to the content 
 I give him props for traveling the 'native way' and not in embassy SUVs with the free pass green plates, but that's about it.    He did not bother to figure out the differences between cultures, climates, or anything, he just took mental snapshots and wrote them down, usually with misplaced and uninformed incredulity.  The final straw for me was when he wrote about his visit to the Aswann damn and wrote about the dust on the photocopier, which he implied was due to lack of use.  I've lived in the Sahel, just south of the Sahara, and I swept INCHES of dust from my house DAILY.  That's what happens in parts of the world where there are dust and sand storms, and buildings aren't the sealed off stagnant cubes that they are in the west.  It simply happens to be like that there, neither good nor bad.  Maybe they hadn't used the copier, maybe they had.  He obviously made his decisions long before bothering to travel to the places he wrote about.  This book is insulting to the people it talks about and insulting to the people who read it. If you think critically, avoid it, you'll throw up your arms in disgust.  If, however, you like snap judgements from uninformed, pretentious 'the sky is falling' types, you'll love this book. 
 Unless you are seriously into coming of age movies you can skip this one.  Critics love this film because it conforms to the modern liberal message that you should have sex with basically anyone.  The attempt to make the protagonist Milos into a tragic hero as a resistance fighter fails because it is obviously unimportant addition to the main story, which is that a young man should have sex early and have sex often 
 I can't believe the other reviewers were reviewing the same dvd.  This is a great movie, don't get me wrong.  It's Kurasawa, after all. My one star is for the people at Mei Ah who put out this dvd.   Whoever did the subtitle translation did not speak English well enough to graduate from a level one ESL class.  The subtitles are truly terrible, sometimes bizarre, and I thought at times I was dreaming I was watching a Monty Python skit.  Alas, I was not; this was for real.  Such a shame 
 Horrible book. Islamic literature is distinct in that information can be classified into 'authentic','fabricated', 'weak', as well as many other categories by rigourously analyzing the chains of narration. The author did not bother with that and, it seems, assumed that whatever he quoted from some book of history (say, Tarikh Tabari) was authentic. Save your $$$, and buy something more credible and scholarly (e.g. Al-Bidaya wal-Nihaya) 
 Why state cans, lids, and list two sizes when it is only one can 
 This book does have lots of good information, but the author could have at least used spellcheck.  There are spelling errors on almost every page, as well as a few missing words spread around the book.  There are even a few places that the author copy and pasted an entire paragraph.  All of this left me thinking of this book as being cheap and I had to question the validity of the information if the author doesn't even bother to check for errors in his own book 
 The materials appear to be of a good quality, not that I'd know.  The software that comes with it to print hasn't been updated in years, and its the original release.  Sure enough, after spending days trying to get it to work at all it was clear the entire purchase was a waste of money.  I checked the company's website about the software, and they have no updates in three years, no way of getting support.    I expect programs to have bugs; that's normal.  The problem is this company apparently has no intention of either taking customer support requests and hasn't released even a bug patch in years, so the chances of it working on a modern computer with a modern printer is increasingly slim 
 This novel by A.E.W. Mason is an epic tale about a young soldier named Harry Feversham. After receiving three white feathers of cowardness from his fellow soldiers, and one from Ethne, Harry sets out to redeem himself. The novel is slow to start, and stays dull throughout his ventures. For being a love story during a time of war, the book is lacking romance and battle. There are so many characters in the book that none of them ever seem to be fully developed; not even Harry. Halfway through the book I found myself wondering who three quarters of the characters were and what their significant role was in the novel. I have read the book twice and I still have no clue why Harry was retrieving the letters from the wall and what their importance was to the story. If you chose this book to read at night to put you to sleep, or really like patriotic British war stories, then by all means, this may be the book for you. As far as I'm concerned, the book was extremely hard to follow, the characters had little depth, and there was no action at all (this is supposed to be a story about a soldier). The novel was extremely predictable, and like most love stories, everything ends happily ever after. After Harry's heroic acts in the desert the three soldiers take their feathers back and this also wins Ethne's heart.   
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 For you young'uns, Pauline Kael was a powerful, maverick movie critic who, aside from being a brilliantly entertaining writer, often went against the grain of your Rex Reeds and Roger Eberts and viewed and wrote about movies with a depth and clarity that seemed super-human. And smart as hell.  This movie has fooled many into thinking it is somehow clever, beautiful and enlightening.  I could not find one less-than-amazed review at Rottentomatoes.com from writers that shoud know better. But friend, think about it just a little bit, how this movies titillates mentally-restful viewers by using the cheapest of devices; by baring the breasts of doe-eyed 15 year olds -  friggin' kiddie porn in 2 scenes no less!   And the protagonist's spiritual awakening consists of smoking pot, working at a fast food joint (with a cliched smiley face logo), driving a hot cherry-red Pontiac and having sex with a 15 year old (which is a crime in the US, ja? no?).   Kevin Spacey's original and complex-toned smart-assiness is entertaining and the young girl players are fascinating and beautiful.  Annette Bening, given a straw woman stereotype role that begs to be burned, in the course of 6 seconds still manages to move us in the finale.    Another Amazon reviewer cited Ray Lawrence's Austrailian film from 1987, BLISS as the misinterpreted and maladapted source material for American Beauty.  Having seen BLISS several times, and being a huge fan of that movie, I think he is correct.  Written by Alan Ball, a TV sitcom writer, this film pushes a screwed-up message.  It entertains, that is if your brain is on stand-by.  I wish Pauline was still alive to help sharpen our movie vision

 Peter Lynch's book held me back about 10 years in my investing success.  I used to believe things I read in books because a good publisher like Simon and Schuster would publish it.  I counted cars in parking lots of companies with due dilligence and questioned managers on how things were selling.  I also avoided "reading tealeaves" like drawing trendlines on what I was actually concerned about THE PRICE of the stock!  Now I make a living "reading tealeaves" and leave the parking lot duty to those who think counting cars makes the price go up.      My suggestion is to learn basic technical analysis from a book like John murphys Technical Analysis of the financial markets.  Start there then go on to learn more advanced TA.  I also like Investor's Business Daily-BUT it is very specialized and takes reading several times and probably help from a more advanced user to understand IBD.  I also swingtrade - hold stocks for 2-5 days sometimes longer.     
 although prince is an utter genious! this cd is merely a boring contract filler. i suggest you buy one of his older albums or the new album "musicology" instead 
 If HZ's sensationalist title gives you pause, you're on to something.  The "story" Preston narrates is, indeed, terrifying.  It is a story about disease, politics, epidemiology, history, geography...  So much could have been made of this story (and so much has been, by far more capable writers).  Preston, it seems, is only capable of going for the jugular.  HZ shows no evidence of research (it lacks even a trace of a bibliography), and attests little more than a rudimentary grasp, on the part of its author, of the history, epidemiology, or politics of Ebola (no more than one might glean from any half decent article on the topic).  From its opening page stroll through the air-lock doors of a bio-containment research lab, to its closing page 'death-defying' romp through Kitum Cave (how very brave of you, RP!), HZ is in full pandering-for-the-cameras mode.  If this book was not a thinly veiled Hollywood screenplay, I'll eat my proverbial hat.  Even this might have been tolerable were Preston a remotely thoughtful observer or a marginally adept writer.  HZ is all cliches and lazy reporting.  It is an embarassment 
 I heard this author was a teenage prodigy in China, who was exposed to media from early on and renowned. If the reputation was based on her writings, and if the whole point of this publication was to introduce the Chinese teenage sensation to the US context, she might as well write in Chinese and gets it translated rather than publishing whatever she barelo got to write. I really wansted my time on this barely readable work, which was mostly attributed to her telegram like sentences that had no style. Some authors write brilliantly regardless they are using English as their second language or as first one. So it might be unfair to say that. I think that it is not only her linguistic limitation caused the fatal damage on the text;she does not simply seem to have good enough insights or views to attract and guide readers through, or to be precise, she has nothing to say expecpt her huge ego to cry out that 'I represent China!', where she has nothing but complaint about. It was hell of an experience to go over this immature and embarrasing read cover to cover. Given this text came out, the standard demand to be met in the world literature China section was to feed readers with exotism and some superficial infos on how evil Chinese government was. The market was extremely little competitive given how big the pupulation is in China. So she follow the easy formula just to publish one book without nothing she really did seem to convey through it. But how boring and immature this book read to me. Wang's half way through political observation might go well with people who do not know much about what was going on in China, who were dominant population in US market. But someone who is familiar with the literary cliche prevalent as it is eaiser to employ the affirmative action in the marketing theory, it is really questionable to keep on acceptiong this type of publication.  
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 "Four Brothers" is yet another nail in the coffin of John Singleton's increasingly moribund moviemaking career.  The director - who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty "Boyz n the Hood" - has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once-promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again.  The story, reeking of artificiality, features Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother.  When she is killed in a convenience store robbery, the quartet launches into action, seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced, through their investigation in the neighborhood, that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe.    The main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters.  By not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother (except for one embarrassingly bad Thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a first-year film student), we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith, rendering the boys' thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best.  The acting is uniformly flat, with the characters little more than wafer-thin stereotypes, and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and second-rate given the Singleton pedigree in this area.  The boys' running around from venue to venue in their Detroit neighborhood, brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother's killer, is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque.    With nary a single moment that rings believable or true, "Four Brothers" is by-the-book filmmaking from a director who has proven that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more. 
 After reading the book through one time, the cover and the pages fell apart. This does not make the book useful for travel, unless I want to carry it page by page 
 This is an essential read for anyone interested in the contemporary Argentine history. The writer is an acknowledged expert on the subject. Why then have I awarded it one star? Because the translation is appallingly bad, at times bordering on the incomprehensible. One gets the impression that it was done one word at a time, dictionary in hand. If you are not already familiar with the events and personalities of the period you'll have difficulty figuring out what's going on.  Conclusion: Only for those who are never, ever going to learn to read Spanis 
 Bought this because Logitech has a great reputation with other products. I used this for a short period due to it being uncomfortable and I never found the battery life to be long enough. I actually went back to a Jabra wired unit until recently, when I purchased a Samsung bluetooth headset that is comfortable, has good battery life, and the sound is better. I guess I prefer the in-ear style 
 This is not a grasping enjoyable read....only if you are a true scholar interested in this subject content which I was; otherwise, the item would be returned. Not for mainstream readers...which is probably a loss for the reading community 
 All of the songs except for ONE are TRASH on this one. Not worth forking over even $.01 for this one!!! 
 i was disapoint with this cd-it's style of kate bus 
 This book illustrations have a certain spartan appeal,like charles atlas ads in back of comic books.The lackluster design of about 80% of this artwork is really sad although it does add another piece to bway history for which the normally fabulous Chronicle books should be commended.The captions are also uninspired and sparse ,there is just no joy in this presentation,a missed chance to do something really worth having.I would buy it but will wait til it is remaindered,sorry 
 ... for those with any intelligence what so ever a pointless read.  Vincent points out all of the obvious connections to Kings other works.   There was no interview with the author to speak of... There was no new insight into the characters or about the worlds.  Disappointing through and through 
 I couldn't tell you who this book was about, but it certainly wasn't Elizabeth I.  Portrayed by Gregory as a dependent almost stupid neurotic, this estimation of her character flies in the face of all accepted scholarship.  And the writing isn't so hot, either.  If I had to read one more time that Elizabeth was picking her cuticles, I would have gone mad.  The Other Boleyn Girl is a much better effort 
 I picked up "Wilson's Ghost" after I read "In Retrospect" by McNamera.  The writing style of "Ghost" is different from "Retrospect", that I suspect Blight wrote most of it, leaving McNamera filling in details regarding statistics and the cold war.  The premise of the book can be summed up in one line: "Unilaterism can lead to bloodshed".  Merits must be given to Blight (and McNamera) for predicting the trend towards unilaterism in recent American foreign policy, before 9/11.  The Wilson's ghost scenario is a good starting point to illustrate the downward spiral that we may run into, however, the arguments presented in the book appear a little far-fetched at point (e.g., the "betrayal" of former Eastern Bloc and China).  Perhaps this comes from thinning out the meaning of Wilson's ghost a little too far ... when all you have is a hammer, everything else will start to look like nails.  The Afterword, written in the wake of 9/11, seems all too much like a contrived effort to justify the recent US involvement in the middle-east.  It has a good premise, but the book was too coherent to be effective.  Unlike "In Retrospect", I am not convinced 
 The title is misleading.  This is a collection of New Wave renditions of traditional songs.  Unless you are a New Wave fan, it may drive you nuts.  New Wave adults may love it.  My baby payed little attention in contrast to  BabyGenius' "Favorite Nursery Rhymes" which clearly draws his  interest and smiles 
 The author reveals himself and not the topic.  The American revolution was complex like all human dramas.  Historians give meaning when they bring to the surface the facts and attempt to place them both within the context of that time and within a philosophy.  The author certainly brings his philosophy to the endeavor, but he utterly fails to provide the context of the times.  In the end, he might as well have written something about modern times, as it would be equally revealing 
 As I read these other reviews I'm curious if they were reading the same book that I read.  I gave it 2 stars only because I have read worse books.  That is not to say that the information in the book is not interesting, or heartfelt, but I just feel poorly written.   Dirlam repeats herself in many useless issues, such as the numerous times that she metions the reavealing dress of the russian girls.  The book is also a bit scattered, it did not flow well.  I would recomend against purchasing this book, rather for an excellent book on siberia read Colin Thurbron's "In Siberia" it will delight and amaze you 
 Is there an option for zero.  The worst I book I have ever read.  He contradicts himself in his points, hoovers over stealing pears (and other evil things) and puts me to sleep.  I don't see how this piece of garbage could make anyone a saint, it should be burned. ZERO STARS 
 My 9 year old daughter is very athletic and excells at all sports but these things are difficult to master.  Very large danger of ankle and leg injuries from falling and twisting the ankle.  Maybe it depends on the body type of the kid; mine is tall and thin, built for speed not strength.  Maybe a stronger kid could do it.  These are going back 
  This book was a gift for a friend who reported "Good writing style. Rough content. Sometimes hard to take. Depressing." so I decided not to read it 
 I was so looking forward to this book, after I read James and George's book, but what a major let down this book was. First of all they kept expressing in the book the age difference between Amy and Warren which I was trying to over look but couldn't. Secondly Amy was pretty much what we would called in todays society a stalker. Third the hero and his attitude was over the top. The only saving grace for this book was the appearance of the other Malorys James, George and Tony. 
 The squadron identification letters on the side of the Avro Lancaster shown in the picture are wrong. 617 Squadron's letters were  AJ (and still are to my knowledge, as 617 The Dambusters are still an operational RAF Squadron flying Tornados). If the producers can't even get that basic fact right then how can we rely on the rest the content? My tip, watch the 1954 movie The Dambusters, it follows the true story very closely! 
 I really liked my Iogear mouse while it was alive.  However, in less than a year, it stopped working, and I replaced it with a MS wireless mouse.  I really didn't care for the hypersensitivity, but I did like the quick launch feature on this mouse.  No matter what, though, I'll take reliability over gadgets every time 
 This was my first experience with Stephen King and I made it to page 150 before I quit.  It was agonizingly slow and it just wasn't my cup of tea.  I told myself that I would quit at page 100 if it didn't seem to go somewhere but I gave it another 50 pages because it was Stephen King.  It was brutal 
 In a nutshell, this book stinks.  It's more about the trials and tribs of a 30-year-old in a dead-end job in New York than it is about Julia Child or cooking or food in general.  And the whole book is larded with profanity which serves no purpose, except perhaps to bolster the author's hipster creds.  But at the end of the read, where are we?  Roughly the same place we started, except in need of a shower.  Because of the book's great potential, I think it's fair to call the book a huge failur 
 There is a preview in Box set #2 , in which he makes a commercial like that of BrokeBack Mountain in which he says the final 42 episodes on DVD in Set 3..  Shame on you Mr. Judge.. only 120 episodes out of about 200+ are getting the DVD digital cut?  in the words of your own created characters..you suck!! Rent it when it comes out 8/1/2006 and reminisce what a great show it was despite Fart-knocker Mike Judge limiting his release of titles..  Mike Judge the ultimate tool..  huh huh, he said tool 
 I had heard some good things about Lenmar nimh batteries about two years ago - but had bought another brand. This time around, with the good price on Amazon, I gave these Lenmar batteries a try. I ordered two ten-packs. Only 4 out of 20 batteries would accept a charge. I tried an Energizer charger, a LaCrosse BC-900 charger, and a RipVan100 Lightning Pack 4000N charger. The LaCrosse is a high-end charger, including diagnostics on batteries (voltage, etc., displayed for each battery).  None of these would charge 16 of the batteries - even in the 'recovery' modes available on the RipVan and LaCrosse. Returned the batteries to Amazon 
 I would like to delete about half of the truly unfamiliar tracks and possibly add a couple of better known more familiar works 
 This is the sadest little book ever! After reading Will Clower's "Fat Fallacy", and becoming a big fan of "eating for pleasure", I wanted to find more books on the topic and came across the reviews for "The Martini Diet", in which one of the readers compared this book to Mr. Clower's- immediately stirring my interest. But unlike the "Fat Fallacy"- written in an intelligent, constantly providing scientific facts- sort of way, which convinced me to adopt the life style in the first place, Jennifer Sander's book is written on a middle/highschool level and I found it close to unbearable to read. If I haden't read the "Fat Fallacy" first, I'd have no idea what this woman was talking about and would assume that this was something she and her "big-big" friends (Her words, not mine!) came up with while sipping on Martini's.  If she's not constantly talking about "putting Martini glasses down" to engage in other activities(is she an alcoholic?), she contradicts and repeats herself over and over again: -Like stating that she enjoys the Slim Fast Shakes and breakfast bars, which substitue for a REAL breakfast. So much about a "real food diet"!  - On page 49 she even advertises calorie counting (and I thought that that was excactely what we didn't want to do anymore!) - And what about her statement, that "real grown ups" are never seen in public drinking anything, including bottled water because that would be tacky!? Hello?  Just to mention a few disturbing things.  I absolutely agree with the outline of this diet, but it couldn't have been advertised any worse than this! "Gin" Sanders seems to want to morphe herself so desperately into Jacky O. and Co., that you can't help but wonder what happened to this woman during her "heftier" day's, to make her completely want to become somebody else. If you are not interested in turning yourself into a "wannabe" socialite with a few simple tricks from "Gin", but would like a great- new approach to nutrition, explained with adult reasoning, then I suggest you read William Clower's "Fat Fallacy" instead!  This could have really been a great book... : 
 I was forced to read this book for school and literally fell asleep a few times reading it. There is no excitement or adventure in the storyline and reading it just makes you feel more drowsy with every page turn. Who wants to read about a self-centered jerk who barely gets any better throughout the course of the book? Not me! If there was a list of the worst books ever written this would remain the chart-topper for eternity!!!!!! 
 This movie lacked the luster I expect from Robert Duvall. It was an endless journey into boredom, at least for me 
 Not much there,some good ideas but really only a few chapters worth of materia 
 Although this book has a noble purpose, it gets lost in meaningless fluff and 50 cent words.  Why do authors feel the need to write books for people with degress in Literature instead of the general audience???    I guess that's why there is "Best-Selling Authors" not "Best-Writing Authors"  It was hard to read and had so much rhetoric to classical literature.  If you like reading Thesis papers, this is for you.     
 I'll keep this brief since you can read many lengthy reviews.  I feel like the characters have lost their voices.  The characters do not grow or change, and are nothing like the warm humans they were in the first books.  Even the main characters are cold archetypes here in these later books.  I keep hoping I'll open a new Goodkind book and it'll be fresh and I will want to know the characters more, but they're just gone.  I tried to start the next book, and it was worse.  Unfortunately, I'm just done with this series.  
 Although I myself confess I am no great fan of Heinlein's, I found it hard to believe this was written by the author of "Stranger in a Strange Land" which is a masterly work. The idea behind "The Number of the  Beast" is appealing: a vast number of alternative universes, endless possibilities for exploring mysteries and opportunities for a real sense of wonder. Unfortunately this is all wasted as heinlein trawls seemingly without purpose through an interminable series of unfunny jokes and mundane inanities. For example he invents a universe just like ours except with no letter J. He indulges his predeliction for creating middle aged women referred to as "Auntie" and adopts a writing  style which actually manages to parody his own already flawed and overly jaunty mannerisms. The satire is lost in a tale that is quite simply, utterly lifeless. In short , "The Number of the Beast" is a disaster and caused me to avoid Heinlein for years until I read "Stranger in a Strange Land." Even though I don't really like his works as a whole, even I was able to recognise the extent to which he has fallen below his own standard with this trash 
 The shelf itself is ok looking. What I did not take into consideration was that the back feet that support and level the shelf on the back of my TV were about 4 inches to short to work on my TV.  The feet only extend about three & ahalf inches screwed totally out. If I were concidering purchasing the shelf I would concider that before buying the item 
 No matter whether the reviewers here have liked ot disliked this book, they all agree that it's one you should pick up only if you are a Heinlein aficionado.  I can't disagree with that assessment.  Heinlein's political beliefs have always been very clear in his writing.  His characters often describe what is wrong with the world and how it should be.  However, in those stories it is a part of the narrative.  In this book, however, it is the main focus.  The story itself is thin, just a vehicle for long lectures on political and economic matters. I've read nearly everything Heinlein has written, so I'm used to his lectures, but when they last for dozens of pages, even I get bored and start flipping pages to see how much more I have to sit through.  The economy of his new world is novel enough to keep me reading through its explanation, but I do not believe the average reader would enjoy it.  If you are looking for science fiction, or any kind of fictional novel, this book will not satisfy you.  If you are interested enough in Heinlein's political and economic ideas to want to read over a hundred pages of them, then this is the book for you 
 Don't waste time if you're looking for an excellent intro text for a business ethics course.  This text has the following virtues: -reasonable overview of normative ethical theory in chapter 2 -short, pithy case studies to motivate problems  The text has the following vices: - it totally ignores libertarianism in the discussion of normative ethics (a significant oversight since it dominates the Western approach to property, contracts and other business issues) -there is a biased inclusion of primary sources.  For example, you'll find an essay in favor of unions but none opposing.  There is an essay criticizing employment at will but none defending it.  There is a defense of prferential treatment in hiring (e.g. affirmative action) but none criticizing it.  There is a quasi-defense of manipulative advertising but none criticizing it. -some of the primary sources are simply poor choices for a business ethics text.  They are either poorly argued or merely tangential to the real issues.  For example, "Buddhist Economics" by Schumacher, "Homosexuality, Prejudice, and Discrimination" by Mohr, "The Place of Non-humans in Environmental Issues" by Singer, etc.  Instead, I recommend the Beauchamp and Bowie anthology 
 It's hard for me to imagine a more silly, less absurd book than this one.  Why anyone would NEED this book is beyond me.  Maggie Gallagher is a very controversial and extreme conservative, whose comments are often insulting and outrageous.  Anyone seeking a nice book about marriage should look to a more rational, reasoned source than this book. There are plenty of them out there.  This is not one of them.  
 The number of absurd coincidences, cliffhangers, and deus ex machinas required to sustain the plot of this boy scout daydream would challenge anyone's ability to suspend disbelief.  I would rate it as slightly less credible than the Wizard of Oz.  This silliness spoiled it for me, though I might have loved it if I had run across it at the age of 12.  This book does not give any kind of reliable view of World War I.  It is a fairytale.  Also despite what other reviewers have said, I found the South African apartheid-style racism pervasive and offensive.  This kind of thought was no more acceptable in 1916 than it is today, as Gandhi made so eloquently clear at the time 
 When yours truly was eleven and in Reading class, "Incident" was required reading.  This had to be the most ridiculous book that I ever had the displeasure of reading. I mean, the boy is cared for by a badger!  Badgers are mean and ornery critters that don't much like people or even their own kind.  I did not believe it at eleven, nor do I now. Also, Eckert certainly didn't need to include some of those descriptions.  Was it really necessary to describe a mother badger eating her offspring's excrement?  What eleven-year-old wants to read about that? So, for kids who like to read long descriptive passages about things they really didn't want to know about in the first place: this book's for you 
 This text comes highly recommended as a classic by far too many creative writing and screenwriting teachers.   Want to know if this book is for you? Read this passage:  "In the second, by means of a contraction analogous to that which abbreviates a syllogism to an enthymeme, this undecided power is but an attribute of the persecutor himself."  The entire book reads this way, so if that works for ya, you'll love this book. If it doesn't, you'll need to look elsewhere 
 While it may have been well written, this book is disturbing and disgusting to put it mildly. If you or anyone you know are pregnant, or contemplating or trying to have children, do not read this book! This is one book I can honestly say in retrospect, I would rather have failed the test on than ever have read 
 I really enjoyed most of Grant Morrison's run on JLA.  Unfortunately, his work grew rather weak towards the tail end of his run, and you'll certainly find evidence of that in this collection.  My overall gripe with this run is that it reads like a big super hero story done exactly by the numbers.  It feels as if Morrison ran down a checklist of necessary story elements, checking each of in order as he included them in the plot.  The main threat in the story is a 15 billion year old doomsday weapon which has thrown Earth into peril.  Global threat of cosmic origin - check.  The bummer is, you never get the impression that this is anything more than a plot device.  It's there because it needs to be there.  As if that weren't enough, we have the formation of a new Injustice Gang.  With impeccable timing, they come together to give the Justice League a sound thrashing at the worst possible moment.  Thread of destruction from super villains - check.  The real downer is that Morrision brings Prometheus, a character who I really enjoyed in his previous runs, back into the book.  He then uses the characters in several sequences that fail to impress.  First, there is a confrontation with Oracle which resolves itself between pages.  This really doesn't fly; Prometheus is capable of taking down the entire league, yet we are to believe that Oracle is saved from impending doom that cleanly?  Later, Prometheus comes to blows with Batman - and it's obvious that the confrontation was only a means for Morrison to work in what he thought was a cool idea regarding Prometheus' helmet.  Both fights (Oracle and Batman) seem to have been put in place so that Morrision could use this plot device, and it comes across as lazy story telling.  I know that super hero stories are built on clichés.  The good guys always win; there is often some new cosmic threat which we've never seen before - whatever.  A good super hero story can have all of these clichés, but can still feel fresh.  Nothing here feels new or particularly special.  In addition to Morrision's less than exciting JLA story, there is also a Spectre story by J.M. Dematteis.  I love J.M. Dematteis.  However, I wasn't especially impressed by this issue.  It could be that I'm biased, as I never warmed to the idea of Hal Joran becoming The Spectre.  Either way, it didn't do anything to raise my opinion of this trade paperback.  Don't get me wrong, Morrision did some great work on JLA.  This just isn't it 
 Having never read a book by Danielle Steel but seen and liked a few of the movies adapted from her novels, I was looking forward to reading Answered Prayers, since I usually always find the books more deep and interesting. Sadly, I couldn't have been more disappointed... The first thing that bothered me about this novel, was the amount of repetition it has. I was just through the first few pages of the first chapter, and I was already being told things (usually insignificant) which I had just read a few lines before.  Secondly, the moment Brad is introduced into the plot, I could foresee with certainty, how it was going to unravel and how the book would eventually end. So as not to dampen my enthusiasm and continue reading, I reasoned that if the plot was going to be so predictable, the book couldn't possibly be Danielle Steel's "Number One Bestseller" as the cover proclaims...seems like I have a grave misconception regarding the criteria needed to make a book a "bestseller".  The major flaw of this novel is that it desperately lacks imagination. Even the main characters themselves and their situations are mirror images of each other. Faith is sweet and caring, has two daughters who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving her feeling lonely and sad. Her husband is cold, unreligious and gives her no attention.  Brad is sweet and caring, has two sons who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving him feeling lonely and sad. His wife is cold, unreligious and gives him no attention. Even Faith's "deep dark secret" is too unoriginal, and it is revealed to the reader at the very early stages of the book, leaving no room for curiosity and suspense.  Halfway through the book, I was so bored that I considered giving up reading it altogether. However I kept pushing on, praying that some twist to the plot would miraculously materialize somewhere, to at least make reading Answered Prayers worthwhile... Unlike Faith however, my prayers remained unanswered... It's going to require a lot of will power to attempt reading a Danielle Steel novel again...  
 I appreciate the fact that this makes 8 popsicles but the flaw is in the design.  The "dribble" base when tilted to take a bite, pours the melted liquid out onto clothes, rug, etc. Stains.  Too bad 
 The events and activities described in this book are unimportant and without lasting meaning.  Doing these things provides water-cooler chit-chat and nothing more.  Really, there are more meaningful things you can do with your life than fritter it away on self-indulgent trivia.  Sadly, most Americans are too ignorant and boorish to understand this, even as they crawl into the beds they've made.. 
 I love the Scarpetta books, but I had to force myself to finish this one.  The plot was disjointed, and the use of the English language was atrocious.  I can't believe she published this.  It is absolutely not up to par.  If you're going to waste your time on this book, get it from a library so you don't waste your money as well 
 I received this book from my brother, who in these past years has taken an interest in the Roman Catholic Church, which we were both baptized in. At the age of sixteen, I gave my life to Christ at an Evangelical Church, and have never reconsidered going back to the Roman Catholicism. I read this book because it was my first encounter of an evangelical converting to Roman Catholicism. After reading his conclusions, I was unconvinced of his findings.  I do understand that this is not a comprehensive work evaluating the differences of Catholicism and Evangelicalism; but even so, I find that his reasons for his conversion were unpersuasive. I also understand that Dr. Hahn spent several years debating and intense study of the claims of Roman Catholicism.  He states that he spent many hours pouring over texts, and for the sake of his auto-biography, does not expound upon how he reached many of his discoveries, except through distilled conclusions about various issues that have divided Evangelicals and Catholics for these past centuries. The book presents many evangelical views as mere "straw men", easily blown down by the author.   Contrary to the author's conclusion, stronger reasons exist for Reformed Theology and Evangelicalism, and are not as easily dismissable as the author presents in his book.   For those that have converted, Dr. Hahn expresses their experiences well, and I was moved by the author's claims for abandoning evangelicalism for catholicism. I became less ecumencal as a result, and have become more embedded in the Protestant faith. I gave the book two stars because it does present certain verses that support Catholic doctrines that many Protestants have not considered, and caused me to study the Patristics more.   
 This is about Socrates Fortlow. He was named that because his mom thought that naming him after a smart man would entice her son into doing smart things. What happened was, "Socco," as his friends call him, ended up in prison for thirty-plus years for homicide and rape. Nice job, Mrs. Fortlow.  Socco has been out of prison for eight years. Now he lives in Watts, California, in a small little place that is never clear whether he is living there officially or he just broke in and made the place his own. No one cares and no one asks questions. But there is always a problem with heat and he uses a portable stove to cook his food.  It's a mess when you get out of prison. You've done your time, you've seen terrible things, no one wants to hire you for a job, you're hard as nails when before - you were just cautious. When you get out of jail, there is no cautious. There is survival and there is question. Should I kill this man? Do I want to get into more trouble? Is it worth it?  I have never been to prison. But I know lots of people who have changed since I'd known them years before. This book is so true to that ideal that it is not even funny.  Socrates meets Daryll, who has killed the rooster that used to wail in the morning hours even though he was getting too old to do it. In Socrates' words, "at least the m*********er tried." When Daryll kills the rooster to try to sell it, Socrates catches him and flips. He holds the boy in his house through threat and makes him skin the thing and they eat it. It is a lesson on doing what is right and the rewards of finding gleefull justice in doing wrong. Strange, right? Well,. this is just a segment of the story.   Socrates sees Daryll again, but the whole book is built upon the various things that Socrates sees thoughout. We have to deal with several retribution stories in which Socco tells one or two people how wrong they are and how they should change. Then, we see stories about how Socco is tempted and either gives in or does not give in to temptation. It's very hodgepodge, but meant to culminate later on in a story that understands itself at the end. But it doesn't.  There are some things that are truly riveting, but they don't hang on long enough for me to feel like Mosely understands present day as well as he does the past, hence his success with the Rawlins and Jones novels. He has an argument about repspect with a married man while waiting for a bus. It's awesome! Some things aren't so awesome, like when he argues with the guy in the "restaurant" about selling out his people for money. There are little segments like these that are meant to "teach" but have nothing to do with the story. But, then again, they do. They help Socrates get his point across as a character, but that does not wholly help the reader. And you gotta help the reader, otherwise no one will read. Some people will call these tidbits short stories...but these is no reason to think so. Evereything looks like it should have been an ongoing tale.  I was glad to see Mosely get down and cover some stuff that is done in modern-day times, but he really blew it. I love this character so much, I feel that he deserved better. Instead there is a lot of this and that and other "that" which is only understood by the writer. It's pretty pedestrian, not what I expected from my favorite writer of the modern era.   I see that a movie has been made of this. Some screenwriter has made sense of this mess. I will see it, though it was made with Larry Fishburne as Socrates. I would have sent Danny Glover to the gym for two months and cast him. He has huge hands, like Socrates, and fits the age requirements. But, what do I know 
 Ethan Frome paints a vivid portrait of the beauty that is wintertime New England. Unfortunately, that's about all it does right. I was surprised to find the lack of both interesting and sympathetic characters in a novel that appears to be a character study.  Ethan Frome, the protagonist, is selfish and cruel toward his wife's illness. At times I despised him more than any character due to his extreme self-centeredness. In fact, his only characteristic that I can almost relate to, a repressed intellectualism, is barely even mentioned.  Mattie Silver, Ethan's object of desire, is an underdeveloped character in the most extreme sense of the phrase. It is unclear what her motives and feelings are even by the end of the story. However, this underdevelopment may have been for the best. The little that we are told about Mattie only adds to the disenchanting strangeness and sloppiness of the book. Most of the time, she comes off at immature and thoughtless.  Zeena, the supposed antagonist, is actually the easiest character to feel for. But don't get me wrong, she's unlikable just like the rest of the characters.  Overall, I suggest you avoid this book if at all possible. It's a loppy book with no real purpose or message. 
 As HARD as I really tried to get into this work by composer Wendy Carlos,I simply could not. 'Tales Of...' is JUST too strange. Just call the music on this CD 'weird electronic'.Liked the reissue for the 'Clockwork Orange' movie soundtrack SO much better(see my review). It's obvious that the music here is classically influenced.Two cuts here I thought were so-so are "Transitional" and "City Of Temptation". Seven tracks,duration is 57:27. I mean if you enjoy several of Carlos's other releases,you get nearly a full hour of true oddness here. Just might appeal to patient fans of Tomita,Kraftwerk,Mother Mallard's Portable Masterpiece Co. and Carl Craig 
 i dont know why people like broken social scene, they are boring boring boring. i listned to this entire album and it was difficult. i wanted to turn it off really bad, but i had to go through it all to prove to myself that it is not good for anyone. for real though people, there is tons of music outthere that is not boring. you should check it out 
 For me this book has only the most superficial connection to The Smiths, namely in the form of a few cheap references to the bleak cultural landscape of 1980s Reagan America and a bit of teen angst on the part of the narrator, who spends much of the book pining away for a series of girlfriends while people he knows commit suicide in scenes that feel vaguely reminiscent of Heathers (except with none of that movie's redeeming humor). I came away with the feeling that Pernice wears his adoration of the Smiths much the way some Williamsburg scenesters used to declare themselves anti-establishment by way of a trip to Domsey's, i.e., he has no real understanding of, or empathy for, the outsider to whom so many of Morrissey's lyrics are clearly directed. Even worse, the book reeks of the worst kind of straight-guy homophobia, the type where they think it's cool to talk about all the sex he wants to have with his imaginary girlfriends while he buys into every gay stereotype about effeminate-acting boys and men, even going for laughs by sharing his terror at the concept of anal sex--ha ha--as if the mere words are the funniest thing ever. Which might work in another context, but is pretty sad in a book about The--Is It Really So Strange?--Smiths. In short, this book should be reprinted with "That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore" after pretty much every sentence. 
 I thought the title was interesting so I bought this book.  Wow, what a disappointment.  This is sappy and poorly written.  How does Mitch Albom keep  getting on the best sellers list 
 The problem that I have with this book is that often the words that it defines tells me to go look up another fine.  That would be fine, except that I go to the word it said to look up and discover that I either have to look up another word.  This book is not helpful in that respect, and given that a lot of PCs run Windows, it doesn't really make sense to release a hypertext version for the Mac but not one for Windows.  So the Windows users are stuck with a book that really isn't that good 
 This music bridge is obviously a product that should not be in the market.  I spent at least 10 hours in three different chat and phone sessions with technical support until they asked me to return the unit (got a used unit in exchange).  After upgrading firmware in the router and downloading the utility from their web site to replace the one in the CD, and three more sessions with the tech people, my PC can finally ping the bridge, and every now and then the utility can even find it.  No way to play music through the bridge though.  Tried changing WMP speaker settings, turning firewall off, uninstalling and installing the utility, everything I (or tech support) can think of.  Also, when the bridge is powered my network becomes unstable and the PC's connectivity goes on and off. I have Linksys router and phone adapter, but if I had done a google search before buying, I would surely had gone for a different product, such is the number of negative comments I've found afterwards 
 Tha Dogg Pound - Cali Iz Active (KOCH, 2006)  And another entry in the long list of this year's disappointing albums from veterans is Tha Dogg Pound's Cali Iz Active. Kurupt and Daz still got that chemistry together, though; it's too bad that they're rapping like it's still 1992.  It's really a shame because in the 90's, Kurupt used to be really dope with his and Daz used to rhyme tight and produce tight jams. But on this album, Daz doesn't produce anything (which is already a one-star deduction) and his and Kurupt's rhymes are both uninspired. Overseer Snoop Dogg shows up a few times on here and though I can say the same about his deteriorated rhyme prowess, he steals the show from the Doggs. You can even look at the song titles and tell that this album would be unoriginal ("Sittin on 23z", "Keepin it Gangsta", etc.).  The saving graces on this album are productions by Battlecat (who is still severely underrated) and Soopafly (him too). Also, the Ice Cube-assisted "It's All Hood" adds some life to the party. "Fakina** H**s" featuring and produced by David Banner would also be good if the beat didn't sound like a rip-off of Jay-Z's "Dirt Off Your Shoulder".  If Cali is active, this album should not be proof. How did 2Pac say it? "All you old rappers tryin' to advance/It's all over now, take it like a man." -EJ 
 Bah, this skirt looks weird and cheap. It is not sewn on the bottom, just cut. 
 The late Julian L. Simon who decimated (and won a bet) with Paul Ehrlich summed up Mr. Gore's effort quite nicely: "The book is as ignorant a collection of cliches as anything ever published on the subject."  And, "Just about every assertion  in the book points in the wrong direction - suggesting that  conditions are getting worse rather than better, which they are."  Mr. Simon then discusses the following subjects on which Mr. Gore was WRONG:  soil erosion; hardwood trees; DDT; Agent Orange; Love Canal.  Finally, Mr. Simon states:  "And the entire book is filled with this sort of environmental gossip, backed by no sources, and contradicted by solid data."     These quotes are from Mr. Simon's "Hoodwinking the Nation" which has some excellent chapters on "media shaped opinion" and the mis-use of statistics, sampling techniques and data which every citizen should read

 Bought a no-name subwoofer cable off eBay, took it over to my friend's house.  He owns this Monster cable; we switched back and forth between the no-name ($6 shipped) and this one, and guess how much of a difference the Monster cable made?  ZIP.  ZERO.  NADA.  Thhhhhhpt!  God bless eBay, and God help all the suckers who buy all the Monster Cable advertising hype 
 My hsuband and and decided that I would nurse Hailey her entire first year.  I work at a school and was able to pump twice a day.  I didn't like doing it in school though because there wasn't space for it.  SO I would go in my car and do it.  All I had a first was the battery pack.  I would go through 10 batteries a week and half way through the week I would loose strength/suction.  Once I got the adapter I never had a problem again.  We could go anywhere and I would always have access to power Including when we drove from VA to GA.  My husband would drive and I would pump.  It is great.. 
 Good-but not very relastic Dixion really should have bothered to look at the state of the world in the last 65 million years, because their are events that would still have happened. For example, birds would not have become extinct, neither would the mammals, both were doing very well. Also, the Pterosaurs would be extinct, or close to it 
 Seems to be just another ideologically based treatise and not serious economics. Although everyone that thinks has some degree of plotical bias, this piece appears to be more written to provide talking points for the far Left. Disappointing. 
 This book is just like watching the evening news you get lots of jingoism, and little in the way of factual documentation. Barkun's chapter on Black Helicopters for instance takes the most extreme views such as linking cattle mutilations to black helicopters and does nothing to address the topic of UN Military units operating domestically within the USA. Black Helicopters operating out of Fort Hood Texas are real, yet Barkun never bothers to tell his readers that Black Helicopters operated by the UN are real, and have even been involved in law enforcement activities here in the US. Shame on Mr. Barkun for his highly distorted take on historical events and people such as the Rockerfellers, the Council on Foreign Relations (which publically states they wish to destroy the US Constitutional Government and replace it with a UN Style world Government). If you want the truth listen to Alex Jones.. 
 A dissapointment. Sadly, neither of these actresses were wearing masks in this film.What in the hell happened to Kelli McGillis? Don't expect to see anyone even closely reminiscent of the sensual Top Gun actress of long ago. McGillis is simply wooden in this role. Susie Porter is somewhat of a toad who appears to be wearing the same outfit throughout the movie's entirety. The acting is poor, the frequency of obscene language is distracting, the storyline is silly and the actresses chemistry is as romantic as a mud sandwich. Don't waste your time with this one or you'll end up feeling like a monkey 
 My title is pretty obvious, but this film is garbage.  I love dark cinema, but I just hated this tripe.  It has an overriding smugness and self satisfaction (very typical of the 1990s') that overtakes any comedic elements in it.  The hysterical performances (especially Daniel Stern) end up being unintentionally hilarious, because they are so ridiculously over the top, and I don't think that was the point.  It was like Peter Berg went out to make a really vile, disgusting film, without any taste, substance, class, or intelligence.  Berg did an interview where he said "yeah, throw things at the screen.  I know it's horrible."  It reminds me of when Jerry Springer used to say "I know my show is trash", thinking that excuses him for making it.  It doesn't.  Trash is trash, even if you know you're making it.  You can have the most heinous subject matter in the world, but if there is intelligence and sincerity behind it, it can work brilliantly as a comedy (Dr. Strangelove is the greatest example of this).  The Belgian film Man Bites Dog is more similar in tone to this film, and that film is hilarious, because there's intelligence and real wit behind it.  This is just an attempt at cheap shock value.  It's not funny, and is definitely not worth your time.        
  Having seen and enjoyed the movie years ago, I was intrigued to get the whole story.  Books usually tell it so much better.  This one doesn't.  So, if you're looking to read a better version of the movie, this isn't it - go buy the script.    There's no drama, no character development, no humor, no love story!  It's just imagery, imagery, imagery.  BORING.  It was good for putting me to sleep, but that's about it.  Here's the cliffsnotes version of the book:  Two professors go to Italy, buy a house, fix it up, visit it every summer and Christmas and serve lots of dinners to lots of other people, all who have no story to tell either.  You also get a lot of descriptions of doorways and vegetables.  There, you've read it!    Whoever wrote the script for the movie was a genius to find a way to make something interesting out of this SNOOZEFEST!  Save your money, go rent the movie 
 The printing is of poor quality, some pages are genuinely difficult to read. Since I was unable to view pages on the website I was unaware of the print quality. I would choose a different edition, if I had it to do again 
 maybe it's because he is such a stright shooter(pun ment) or something but clint doesn't do cold war thrillers very well(remember firefox). while well directed and acted this spy thriller is dead most of the way through and while the climbing scenes are good they don't cover up the fact that it was a good book that doesn't watch as good as it read.some may like it but i found it to be a let down 
 The collection of historical facts in this book is very useful, and I think it serves fabulously to prove that religious diversity has come to America.  At the same time, I was often unable to read this as an objective history book because it is so permeated with her religious pluralism.  The book feels more like an implicit apology for her own religious views than a work of history.  I sighed, yawned, and/or rolled my eyes more than once while reading it.  On the grounds of its historical content only, this book deserves a higher rating -- three, maybe four stars.  Its main problem here is that Eck is so concerned with celebrating various religions that she says little to nothing negative, which is a crucial component of all religious history; it feels like some kind of Pollyanna-ish naivete.  (Its minor problem is that there are a lot of anecdotes but not enough broad-scale statistics, etc.)  I do not want this to eclipse, though it does inform, the fact that the positive things she does say are very informative.  However, the methodology set forth is so revolting to me that I had to lower the score.  Okay, she's a religious pluralist, I accept that; when she's writing an apology for religious pluralism, or maybe even when she's writing history for other religious pluralists, I'd love to see her write this book.  It's even OK to see her pluralism color her writing, which is only natural.  However, this book is supposed to be a general, objective historical account, rather than a subjective, personal explanation about why she feels like no religion is exactly true but all religions are true when sanitized.  If you're aware of these problems in advance and feel like you can look past them, read this book; it will be informative when read with a few dozens grains of salt 
 So, when did Maya Angelou received the Nobel Prize for literature? pg.12 
 Who knows why Ruelle felt compelled to write this book?  He makes a lot of sweeping statements about fields he doesn't have a mastery over.  Only  tangentially does he bring in chaos, and he doesn't bother staying on any  point long enough to add any insight on any of the issues presented.  It's  such a weak book that it doesn't even have "brainstorming value"  -- the collection of ideas is limited in breadth and depth.  Perhaps in  1991 it was fashionable to come up with books like this; having read it in  1999, I found little of value 
 Great ideas if anyone can find government workers or teachers who know anything or care about ...budgets. Focus on getting workers engaged in the planning process first before introducing even the word BUDGET or PRICE of Government. Also, using the terms PERMANENT and CRISIS in the same sentence does absolutely nothing except cause eyes to glaze over.   
 I have to say I truly hated this book. The premise sounded interesting so I decided to give it a try.  I've read all her other books in the series and found the characters to be quirky.  This time I found her usual friends and co-workers to be boring and self involved caricatures. The groundwork was there for an interesting serial killer with complex motivation but it never developed that way. The constant head hopping was annoying and the ending came out of nowhere.  Cromwell has obviously gotten bored with her characters and it shows.  This is my last Cromwell 
 R. Stockwell was right on in his review. Bryson comes off as a spoiled hypocrite in this book, constantly sprinkling on virtually every other page his disdain for anyone not as educated as himself. His favorite targets are Southern whites. A typical description is " ...loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantities of impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex." !!! How would a reviewer (of the NYT, for example) respond to a travelogue of our inner cities by some ruralista who describes inner-city youths as "... crazed blacks destabilized by gross quantities of crack and generations profoundly obsessed with having sex with a white woman."  --- Neither of these passages are acceptable but Bryson belongs to that ilk who's motto is: "Bigotry for me but not for thee." BYTW, his earlier book, "Lost Continent" is even more egregious with his kind of self-righteousness.  It's a shame he tarnishes himself and his writing with this kind of stuff.    
 I agree with the reviewer who describes Ms. Wells as overly generous to certain bistrots, brasseries and cafes, and I would strongly suggest getting a second opinion before choosing one based on her recommendation alone. That said, with respect to high end restaurants (i.e. 1-star+), she's generally dead on 
 This is not a book about art, but an analytical philosophy of History. For those familiar with Danto's art criticism, the one star should warn you that art criticism will not be found here. For those curious to read this book for its analytical philosophy, you have a four-star endorsement 
 The author has gone to a lot of trouble to explain the seriousness of Satanism's lure for young people on today's society.  But instead of rooting out the evil in youth - why not focus more on the good inherent in their young souls?  And by the way, an upright pentagram is the symbol of Wicca - a completely different religion that doesn't even believe in Satan!  Do more homework next time, thanks 
 I gave this book a 100 page chance and still could not get hooked.  After reading all the reviews, I thought it would be an outstanding read, but for me, it was plain old B O R I N G.  Since it didn't pick up by page 100, I figure there are plenty of other books out there worth my time.  Sorry.  I vote two thumbs down on this one 
 the measurement is not accurate. The reading is lower than the real temperature (compared with my other theromometers including the traditional one)  if you take 2-3 times consequently, the reading will vary a lot(around 1-2F). I have to believe the highest one. It is very confuse.  I think the problem is not from incorrect using. Since these problems happened in adult as well as children 
 This "pamphlet" is about as deep and meaningful as an empty glass of water.  There is absolutely no analysis of the quatrains and no reasoning of interpretations.  Your money is worth spent on a psychic or palm reader.  The upside: the book is recyclable 
 First off...the Pink Spiders are in no way punk. Secondly, this music is so polished and poppy it lacks any type of genuine feeling to it. Third, the whole "pink" gimmick can only take you so far...even Pink had to change her hair color.   I guess for fans of pop music this band will make you excited, but for me it just makes me ill 
 This is just stupid.Now the first one I'll give 2 stars because it's so bad,it's good.But this is beyond that level.This is so bad it's... [...] BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 so i buy my parents this brand new Canon mini-dvd camcorder for Christmas and look for some mini-dvds on amazon for them to record on.  i figure, what the heck, they don't need RW discs, but why not go for quality ones the first time around (as opposed to mini-dvd+r).  my parents are excited about this gift and we pop in the discs to start recording, but the thing can't read the discs for some reason.  i read the back of the dvd package and it says some formatting may be required.  so i pop the disc into my computer and try to format it, but my computer can't read the discs as well.  i just bought some mini dvd-R's and my parents will be getting it soon.  i'm pretty sure the camcorder itself wasn't the problem, but if it turns out to be the case, i'll re-evaluate this product.  but for now, it's no good.   
 As a really big Dick Francis fan, I would be really sad if someone heard all these great things about this author, picked up this book, and then never tried another book again. It's not a very good one. The premise is good, the characterizations as usual are very nice, but the plot goes nowhere and stays there from about halfway in until the last, disappointing page. Changing narrators in the book was a nice risk, but it ruins everything. Having the book be about computers and then putting in a 14-year gap was also not the wisest thing. If you want to start off on the right Francis Foot, try PROOF or WILD HORSES or ENQUIRY, and there you're neck-deep in characterization, plot and thrills. Francis is a master, but even masters have an off day 
 I think I made myself pretty clear with the title.  But, if further explanation is necessary: Theroux is exactly what he claims to abhor about tourists & travelers.  He's an egotistical, self-centered racist who has paddled aimlessly around the world in lieu of actually parenting the children he chose to have and be a husband to his original wife.  The only reason I kept reading is bc I was traveling to many of the places about which he wrote.  Additionally, I lived in HI and was interested in what he had to say about it.  Ultimately I was embarrassed that I had to share Oahu with him.  And if he mentioned one more time about his claim that scads of Japanese brides throwing themselves off hotel balconies...I mean really.  If you're looking for a fact based book about Oceania, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for a self-indulgent POS about a man's traveling mid-life crisis, you can have my copy.  Thank God I only wasted a quarter on it 
 I haven't read the two preceding books, but I sincerely hope that they are better than this one.  I'd like to think that a federal judge would have better sense than to keep an obviously raped 6 year old in the woods for a week "until she learns to trust him."  Meanwhile, her poor mother is searching town after town with no indication from him that she is even alive.  I feel very doubtful that said mother, on discovery of the man with her suddenly verbal child, would say to him, "I would have done the same thing in your shoes."  Even knowing that he wasn't the original kidnapper, I'm pretty sure I would have sent my daughter out of the room and shot him anyway.    No thanks to Ramsey, the kid hasn't died from internal injuries, and now that the mother (who is far, far more clever than every incompetent law enforcement agent in Colorado) followed the only solid lead that the police "blew off" and is back with her daughter, I think I'll leave them to go on the run without me.    Lazy writing -- it wouldn't have been hard to create a situation where Ramsey and the child together made sense.  
 Joe Carpenter lost his wife and two daughters when the plane they were traveling in crashed. A year later Joe is still grieving, he quit his job, sold his house and is thinking of suicide.  He visits the graves of his wife and daughters to find a woman taking pictures of the graves. He wants to know what she is doing, she says she was on the plane and survived. Men start shooting at her and then start following Joe. He wonders how anyone could have survived the crash.  Joe goes back to visit some of the people who lost love ones in the crash. The greiving family members are happy now that a woman named Rose has visited them. Joe can't figure why they would be so happy. Then the family members start commiting suicide.   Joe decides to go back to the place where is plane crashed since he has not been able to face it before now. He meets a family at a ranch near the crash site. They tell him a woman and small girl visited them the night of the crash and her name was Rose, and she had a small girl with her named Nina. The same name and description of Joe's youngest dead daughter. Could Rose and his daughter be the sole survivors of the crash?  Joe finally meets Rose and she tells him that his daughter is alive, then she tells him the story behind her surviving.  Enter the twilight zone!!!!    I thought that this was one of the worst books that I have ever read. I started to quit reading so many times, but I figured the story would get better. But instead of better with a ray of hope, it got weird, unbelievable, and down right dumb.  The story could have been so much better with a different ending. Most of the things Rose talked about were so out there you had to be a scientist to even comprehend them.  First the book was sad, depressing, hopeful, then weird.  This is the first book of Dean Koontz I have read, I know a lot of people like his books, but I will not read another one. 
 It troubles me to read that many non-Muslims are learning about Islam via THIS book. Westerners who wish to understand Islam shouldnt read popular NYT bestsellers, but rather, scholarly pieces. [...] for instance. Irshad Manji doesnt substantiate many of her claims and her book really only serves to upset Muslims and convey to non-Muslims ideas about Islam which are entirely untrue. Ive struggled with Islam for a long time. And I HATE certain verses in the Quran, i.e. Surah 4, Verse 34-- which argues that men are the "maintainers" of women. But the truth is, it's been 1400 years since the Quran was revealed. And it was generally passed down verbally. Ive played Telephone. I know there's a good chance that the word of God was altered (maybe unintentionally). And even if the Quran has been passed down perfectly, look through its verses... it really can be interpreted more liberally, in the same way that the Bible and the Torah can be. I dont believe in wife-beating, persecution of homosexuality, veiling, or whatever other traditions were/ are practiced by those who claim to be Muslims. But I dont just toss my religion out the window either. We are so critical of Islam because its at the forefront. Jews in Israel are practicing many of the same persecution as are Muslims around the world. And Bush isnt the ideal Christian either. It is human nature to justify poverty, reject modernity when we cant have it for ourselves. I just think we should give Islam the benefit of the doubt... and work to SOLVE the problems, rather than aggravate them. [... 
 This is supposed to be a good book, a life changing book, but its a hard read. A hard read. I find it boring myself. 
 Ok, Cichoke is not wrong. But here is the BIG problem. He repeats himself constantly. He cuts and pastes the same exact phrases over and over and over again on almost every page. The sloppiness and pure laziness of this book defy the mind. It is immoral to say so little and repeat it so often to make a book look big and fat. This entire book could have been written in about 20 pages. If I had seen this book before I would never have bought it. Buy any other book on enzymes. There is a caveat, if you can not remember what you have read as you turn from one page to another, then you will love this book. Every page is a near repeat of the page before. On the plus side, the info is accurate. I am not accusing him of being wrong. An additional problem is his zealous plugging for specific brands of enzymes, for no reason. Does he own stock? Lazy author, not much info, repetitious. Makes all health enthusiasts look like opportunists. SHAME 
 I bought this book about a month ago and have really tried to read it. However I write this to vent my frustration for wasting my money. Easily the worst book I have bought and read in my entire life. If you want to read a book by somebody with little insigt trying to be politically correct this is the book for you. Not worth the paper it is written on 
 Why did I by this book?  Because I gave a look at the first pages using the "view inside" option. The first pages seemed great and in the index there was a big chapter on string theory. I thought: "ok, great, it seems I've found one more book covering string theory. If the formalism is the same as in introduction it it a good book to have to add to GSW and Polchinski". The formalism is not the same. If fact each chapter seems to be disconnected to the others. And last but not the least: the last chapter is a copy/paste version, really copy/paste version, of green, schwartz, witten. Even the images are the same! How could it be connected to the previous chapters... And the author dares to say in the intro: "this book grew from the author's conviction...". No. At least the last chapter, it grew from copying another book. And that is not mentioned in the intro when the chapter is introduced. Only in the awknoledgments schwartz is cited among many others. In the string theory chapter where everything is copied from GSW the green book is not even cited! I was never so escandalised in my live. At least never in a matter related to physics. 
 If you have a mobile home built more than 25 years ago - this book can be helpful. The first edition of this book was done more than 30 years ago.  I found it mostly useless for a contemporary mobile hom 
 This book is very poor and I would recommend against purchasing it. This guide is seems to be written by seminar teachers, full of simple one-liners and cheesy analogies that don't really add that much to your understanding of strategy. Possibly a starter guide, but not recommended if you have already read anything on strategy 
 I had these canisters for a few months in my kitchen, then they started wearing - pitting, staining, - the finish simply wore off. They do not seal tightly, but keep mice and bugs out. Don't waste your money. The photo may look good, but the product is garbage, which is where mine ended up this week 
 So not at all what i was expecting. I had heard a lot of good things about this movie over the years and when i finally sat down to watch it,i was terribly disappointed and confused.  
 I read with interest this book because I am a neurosurgeon and our hospital recently went to computerized records. While this book was mildly interesting,it is obvious that the author has a personal ax to grind with his former chairman at U of W. To a non medical person this book is crap. 
 The buyer was great but this product didn't help at all. The light shined in a circle pattern. No light at the middle. I returned them and I got notification of a credit to my credit card 
 This album was largely responsible for a lot of nu metal, and it was the last gasp of this once great band. It's just not enjoyable. I actually like a lot of world music and tribal music, but if you want to hear tribal metal done right, listen to Neurosis.  I have a some Brazilian relatives, and I've heard from them that, in fact, a lot of Brazilian natives took issue with Max and the other members of Sepultura claiming Indian ancestry. Most of the guys in Sepultura are 100% Portuges 
 it contains very little practical info, and is primarily an ad for their own kayaks and videos, and a medium to broadcast what heroes they are - "commander soares" indeed! they dont go "paddling", they go on a "mission"! these guys are doubtless good paddlers, but they cant write. to class the concluding poem "kayak brother" as ... would suggest it has literary merit (ie pathos), but it is just the stuff of cringe. guys, try understatement as a style for your next book, and put some useful info in it 
 The only GOOD thing about this is that its small.  Its totally confusing to follow AND there isnt any rationals.  Make sure you get something with rationals.  Makes charting easie 
 Sorry to see a good idea executed so poorly. The author relied on limited and questionable sources, leading to many mistakes in the history of the company.  There are also several misspelled names, typos and incorrectly identified photos, although the photos are quite good as are some of the old ads.  That's really the only reason to consider the book, for the photos and old advertising.  Just don't waste time reading it as there are other, far better accounts of the company's history 
 Readers are led to assume that this book will deliver more information than it does 
 I use Plone a lot in my job and I bought both this book and The Definitive Guide to Plone by Andy Mc Kay.  I find this book to be confusing at best, maybe because it tries to cover too much ground. When it describes the portlets, it goes on for SIX pages describing each portlet, with a screen capture for each portlet! It talks about REST for over a page, although this architecture has really nothing to do with Plone. Etc. Etc.  All in all, it seems to me that too many technical editors have worked on this book, making it overly technical and complicated. Even the font they use make the content look cluttered! It is very difficult to write something clear and simple, especially for a very piece of technical software such as Plone. In my humble opinion, this book has failed in that regard.  I almost never use this book on my everyday job. Get Andy Mc Kay's book, you'll get a much better value for your money 
 Detailed autobiography (though 3rd person) of the celebrity she thinks she is. If you can get through it - good luck 
 I am a very big fan of Denise Austin and was highly disappointed with this video. I thought it would round out my yoga/pilates workouts. Right. The only thing I'm more upset about is the fact that I can't get my money back.  And yes, the woman looks absolutely possessed in the video. 
 What a waste of time, money, and talent. If its Murder you want well this one has plenty of blood and guts to fill the bill. Sorry I wasted my time viewing such trash 
 nothing more really needs to be said.I'm running a 3GHz P4;256Mb ATI Radeon 9000 series PCI express video card and 2Gb of RAM and the game still hangs,lags and locks up on my computer. I tried uninstalling & reinstalling-same effect.DO NOT BUY THIS GAM 
 Lindsell appears to believe that true Christianity requires (regardless of its date or provenance) a belief in a modern doctrine of inerrancy. Perhaps of some limited use for those wondering how the biblical text could be taken in such a way (quite creative at times) but otherwise just grim stuff 
 I love Koontz but this book fell far from the mark.  It started off slow and I found myself thinking, "Where is this going?"  And, in the end, I felt it took me nowhere.  And, the T.S. Elliott quotes got a little annoying.  If you're a fan like me, I know you'll read it despite this review but if you're a first-time Koontz reader, don't start with this book.  It is definitely not his best work - try Odd Thomas or even (going way back here) The Funhouse instead 
 Galactic decided to go with a big-name producer named Dan the Automator.  Dan the Automator took an amazing, explosive, quirky funk sound and gutted it of any soul it had.  I'm sure these songs sound good live, that is without Dan the Automator's overproduction and mixing (Drum machines over Stanton Moore?  For shame!  The horror!).  The album itself is flat except for a few high points - "Paint" is good, "The Beast" is funky enough, "Never Called You Crazy" is good, and "All Behind You Now" is a great song, or would be live.  That's about it.  The rest of the album varies from so-so to outright boring, and considering the amazing amount of talent Dan the Automator had to work with in Galactic that's a crime.    Crazyhorse Mongoose and Late for the Future are both far superior records 
 I bought this for my mom and had it sent to her address.  It worked for two days and then it stopped.  On my last visit I fiddled with it for an hour, but it only worked intermittently.  She didn't keep the receipt so I'm writing it off as a waste of money.  When you think about it the inexpensive Softsoap brand push pump dispensers make more sense.  You can see when they are empty and you don't have to keep up with batteries.  I don't buy the argument that the hands-free dispenser is more sanitary than the hand pumps because after you touch the hand pump you wash your hands 
 A good story with strong characters lures the reader's imagination, inspires excitement and anticipation of what happens next.  This is not one of those stories.  It's not a bad book by any means.  Shining moments appear.  However, Taita is a character hard with which to sympathize.  All the other characters are as translucent as the page held up to a strong light, and the heaped action reaches a point of banality in its lack of specificity.  Did I mention it's predictable?  You should have expected that.  Pick up a Clavell or Jennings instead.  This is Soap Opera history 
 In case you didn't know already, Cecily von Ziegesar is no longer the author of the Gossip Girl books starting with this one... the front cover says "created by" not "by," so this book is written by a ghostwriter so that the original author can work on other projects. I don't know whether it's the ghostwriter or the series going even longer (there were only supposed to be 8 books) that is making this series grow dull, but whatever it is, "Only In Your Dreams" fails to meet the other criteria that made the other Gossip Girl books so great.  First of all, this book starts off after graduation; thus, everybody has graduated and is beginning their summer. Blair goes to Englad to see her boyfriend Lord Marcus, but is annoyed to see that she'll have to share him with his cousin Camilla. Nate goes to work for his high school lacrosse coach in the Hamptons and meets a girl named Tawny. Dan meets a girl named Bree who teaches him to be more spiritual and their "dates" consist of going to yoga classes. Serena is starring in a movie, and Vanessa is also involved in it. Basically, the book flips back and forth between all thse characters and tells about what goes on with them; the most annoying part is that nothing interesting happens. I basically kept on reading to get to the end to see if anything good would happen, but no. The ending was dissapointing and kind of just left you hanging.  Basically, not the best GG book, the series seems to be going downhill. All of the cattiness, backstabbing, and juicyness that made the other books so much more interesting is gone. Instead you're left with a boring storyline that makes it hard to finish the book 
 This book is pretty much standard for undergrad analytical chemistry but it is not a great text.  It provides a very basic introduction to analytical methods in a poorly organised fashion.  The information is presented in such a way that it calls for you to memorize rather than understand.  The mathematics presented confuse the reader more than they help.  I recommend you buy this used.  If you plan on pursuing analytical chemistry, this book will quickly be shoved aside to make way for much better books, each specific to a particular instrumental method 
 As a fan of zombie movies and as someone who enjoyed City of the Living Dead and Zombie, I was very disappointed with House by the Cemetery. Fulci manages to create a good mystery in the first two-thirds of the movie, only to squander it on some poorly executed scare scenes.  House By the Cemetery is about an researcher (whose work is never specified) who moves his wife and his kid into a house in Massachussets in order to finish out the work of a colleague who killed himself and his mistress. The titular house is the only place they can really find for the moment, so Dr. Boyle, his wife Lucy and their son Bob move in despite a lot of bad signs, like the boarded-up door to the cellar and a tombstone for a Dr. Jacob Tess Freudstein in the front hall. Bob has little red-headed girl for a friend who keeps warning him about how bad the house is (though no one else sees her). Furthermore, people keep claiming Dr. Boyle has been in town before with a non-existent daughter (which he denies, not totally convincingly). He also seems to have some secret relationship with the babysitter, Anne, who starts unboarding the cellar door in the middle of the night. And Lucy seems to either be recovering from or suffering from serious psychological issues.   Got that? Good, because half of that stuff never gets explained. The only things that get worked out are the little red-headed girl's identity and the identity of the killer (neither of which are that hard to figure out). There are some nice visual moments in the earlier parts of the film (the fact that the killer has one normal hand and one rotting hand, the photograph that changes with each viewing, a mannequin that gets beheaded and starts bleeding) but Fulci's ability to handle the gore moments disappoints. He lingers too long over some deaths, makes the killer so ridiculously slow that a snail could outrun him and bits like the babysitter's head falling down the stairs come off as funny rather than scary. Compared to the injury to the eye scene in Zombie or Christopher George chopping through the coffin in CotLD, Dr. Boyle's chopping through the door around his son's head feels like self-parody.  Fulci's other films have incoherent plots , but rarely in a way that seems to work against the plot (the dream-like nature of City of the Living Dead seems appropriate given the prophetic dream the heroine gets and the mystical nature of the threat) and the execution of the setpieces is usually fantastic. House by the Cemetery has neither thing working in its favor. It's not Hell of the Living Dead-level bad, but the fact that it has some genuinely good acting (especially Paolo Malco, who plays Dr. Boyle) and an interesting set-up almost make the flaws worse.  Also, this version has a "never before seen deleted scene", but it has no sound and is just an extended reaction shot after the bat attack 
 That is what this book should be used for--target practice. Not a single tale is remotely bloodcurdling. More than a dozen yawns went unsurpressed while attemptly with foolhardy optimism to complete this pedestrian compilation. Why stifle a yawn, that'll kill ya. STAY AWAY 
 I bought this blender because I liked its retro design, and I thought it would function well.  Well, every single time I've tried to use it has been a disaster.  Even for very simple tasks, like blending soft avocado, the blender has not worked. The blades spit big chunks onto the sides of the glass jar and then spin around without blending anything... It's horrible.  And I even threw away my old, ugly blender when I bought this one... and the other worked just fine. :  
 I guess Mike Batt can't get it right each time.  Vanessa-Mae... fantastic.  BOND.. Absolutely GREAT  The Planets?  ....CRAP  This is just sad.  If you want to hear crossover done right, get Vanessa Mae's best of and bond's born, shine, or classified.  
 Unfotrunately Shantaram did not grab my imagination at all.  Nor did I find it emotionally satisfying.  I realize Shataram is meant to be a kind of Bollywood story - over the top, flowery, cliched etc. but the Bollywood movies I've seen have been engaging and strangely satisfying, despite their soppyness etc.  Shantaram was not engaging because the poor writing and shallow characters spoil the story.  
 The book did hold my interest most of the way through; it definitely was a fast-moving story.  I enjoyed the detailed descriptions of the setting and the characters.  It started out to be a pretty good mystery, but didn't deliver in the end, and here's where I differ from previous reviewers.  The blurbs describe the book as full of plot twists and surprise endings.  I didn't find this to be true.  I figured out fairly early on what Bridger was up to, and it didn't take a genius to guess who his secret accomplice was.  So much for surprise endings.  In addition, I found the dialogue to be clunky and awkward at times; AND, I wonder, does anyone proof the book drafts before they go to print?  Does the author get to see a proof of his book cover synopsis?  I wonder because on the back of this book it says, "When an explosion kills the NIGHT WATCHMAN at wealthy industrialist Karl Lindstrom's nearby lumber mill..."  As anyone who has actually read this book knows, it was NOT the night watchman who was killed, but another individual.  Just another example of shoddy editing.. 
 This book is about Dave's late high school years, while he was in the foster care system.  This book talks about some friends that have helped him through some tough times.  I thought this book would talk more about his experiences and feelings about the foster care system, which we were initially led to believe.  But the book turned out to be more of a "guy" book, talking about his adventures and mishaps with his friends.  This might be interesting to teenage boys, but for a broader audience, this book didn't seem as interesting.  The experiences in foster care didn't really seem to come through as much.  The book seemed to ramble on and on about certain points and seemed to go off in a tangent at times.  As a result, the book became a little boring.  I also didn't care for some of the foul language in the book, which to me, often detracts from the point that the book is trying to get across.  About the review from the lady from New Zealand...it was not necessary to single me out in your review.  The point of these reviews is to review the book, not the reviewers.    Secondly, I did not like the book.  Plain and simple.  That is OK.  Not every book jives with everybody.  I don't feel that people who are grateful for the simple pleasures in life are boring.  I said that the book itself was boring and to me, it seemed to lose focus.  You do not have to agree with me, as I don't agree with you.  I am free to express my opinions on these books.  And yes, I read "Lost Boy", but the book initially led me to believe that it would have more in it about the foster care time period in Dave's life.  You see, I was in 3 foster homes as a kid, and to me, reading about foster care experiences from other people is always interesting to me.  So please, just focus your reviews on the books, not on the reviewers.  I had a legitimate opinion on the book and I expressed it.  I'm sure I'll lose helpful votes on what I've just said to "Gingerwoman", but it's important that we focus on reviewing books and not each other 
 This one will help you go to sleep for sure. This is my second attempt at Ross MacDonald and I give up. Endings are a given, no surprises here 
 I heard of machinima about a week ago in the Economist magazine which also featured comments from Paul Marino, this book's author.  A week later and I've got the book, but I'm a little let down but what the book has added to my knowledge. I'd say someone who has only heard of machinima and hasn't designed their own level in a 3D game would get tons of gems from this book.  Whereas poor me with a week's worth of Google searches looking for tutorials on UnrealEd 3.0 and so forth - well I only got enough information to round out my status as a serious machinima beginner. In fairness, however, after a couple of hours with the book I was able to get the finishing touches I was looking for and successfully burned my first machinima movie to DVD.  So it was a small boost I got but a very welcome one (the boost included my spending $29 for the full version of Fraps).  So, yeah it will give you the tools in one place to get a finished product. I am disappointed that Marino ends the book with a tutorial on character modeling.  The tutorial is well-written  but by its end you'll be looking at a cute character cast in concrete (no words on skinning or rigging, etc). Worse this character will be stranded in a program called Silo (by the way blender from blender.org seems just as good and is cross-platform and a free download) with no hint of the challenge of getting this spaceman into a 3D level designer.   The machinima community would be better served with a tutorial on how to get custom sounds and meshes into UnrealEd et al, and how to do lipsynching. In short too much time spent teaching you how to use tools (tools generally come with their own instructions and tutorials anyway). I was also disappointed to find no samples of machinima movies on the cd.  These are such a pig to download after all.  How about including one and then some kind of analysis about what makes that one sample special.  The book is called the Art of Machinima but it seems more like the Activity of Futzing with Tools 
 We bought this set for our 3 year old daughter and the foam heads on the clubs were broken within days. She wasn't even playing roughly with them. The balls and mini-golf goals are cute and colorful but I would suggest buying a different set 
 I purchased this book with good intentions and have never written a negative review on a book, but I had to go out of my way to make note on this book. Although I can see how others could find value in the book, the author lost his credibility with me after two chapters of me underlining statements he was making that he stated as fact when they were just his opinion. I won't get into every detail, but for example he classifies real estate investors as short-term, mid-term, or long term and then states "the long term investor won't care about purchase price" (what is he talking about?) and then fails to understand the fact a long term investor can capture appreciated gains through monetizing the asset (i.e. the house) through additional equity lines or refinances, rather than state this simple fact which is very important as it would allow a long term investor to avoid transaction costs and tax implications but still receive cash from the appreciation he states the long term investor will hold the home not very leveraged; that is totally untrue many long term investors are highly leveraged and continually borrow against their properties and appreciation. Anyway, not a big deal but atleast he didn't call his book the "Bible to Real Estate Finance" or something like that because it is not. It is a great subject matter and topic and he stated he may be one of the few people to have written a book on this narrow topic for a lay person, but the book lacks a professional polished work; take it for what you can get out of it and question things 
 I thought it would be really cool to be part of a society that wore red hats in public.  Being part of a club where one could identify another club member because they are wearing a certain item of clothes while in public, fascinates me.  But then I started reading the book.  I found the characters non-believable.  The rules of the club, do overs and make overs were just too restrictive.  Life is not about squashing dialogue with your friends because you are too uncomfortable or too polite to say what is on your mind.  The scene about catching Harold in the act truly stretched my imagination.  The amounts of money thrown around boggled my mind.  And the ending?  It reminded me of the last episode of Seventh Heaven 
 mustic river is the worst eastwood movie ever well the acting is very good over all but the movie is very boring long and very disturbing it sucks  
 Although the book presents itself as a grammar guide, it actually only contains pages of mostly worthless rules on the gender of nouns. If you want excercises or to actually learn grammar, then don't buy this book. I would recommend "501 German Verbs" 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 I ordered this product relying on the picture. I got the wrong one. Shipped it back but never got any credit back yet. Am still waitin 
 Rising Sun was a terrible read.  Crichton uses one device throughout:  the old hand knows everything an hour before the young guy and slowly reveals it to him.  It's tiring and monotonous.  Never mind the even more monotonous lectures on the differences between American and Japanese business cultures. 
 This is not like the "Knit Stitch" or "Purl Stitch" books of Melville's, which I love.  I found no patterns that I cared to knit, and few that I felt I would even want to attempt.  It's promoted as having patterns that get rid of your stash, but most patterns do this by weaving in small amounts of various colors.  You will still need to have large quantities of a basic color for many of these patterns.  I will be getting rid of my book, unfortunately.  Check this out a library first to see if these patterns are what you like 
 Not a bad little unit...  wish it remembered where you were on the CD when you turn it off like other units I'm used to especially since it doesn't really "shut off" but goes into "stand-by" mode...  Not as much power as I thought it would have for 30 watts...   Would be nice if the aux (ipod/mp3) jack was on the front not the back...  speaker 2 output would be nice...  simple little unit, works fine so far.. 
 I have never been a fan of Danielle Steel's books and have only read a couple in my lifetime, and those many years ago.  I'm not sure what motivated me to pick up Toxic Bachelors -- extreme boredom? insanity? -- but I slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer's work.  Actually, I think I was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was.  The writing was completely repetitive and superficial, and I rather felt that I was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself.  It read like a poor book report:  "...and then he did this, and then he did this, and after that he did this, and then he laughed."  We are TOLD that the bachelors -- who struck me as commitment-phobic, a little neurotic, and fairly immature despite their (middle) age, but not necessarily toxic -- are decent, likable guys, but we never really see too much proof of that.  When the "proof" does come, it's so ham-handed as to be laughable:  Charlie's eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother, and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character.  Yeahsurerightwhatever.  Most of the story is told through narration, with little bits and pieces of ho-hum dialogue.  The author adopted a third-person point of view, but there's certainly nothing omniscient about it, and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters.  Throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls, and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable.  THIS is how men behave and relate to one another?  I find that hard to believe, considering that none of the men I know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other.    I liked the female characters of the book initially.  They all seemed to be strong, capable, independent and emotionally healthy women.  But my opinion of each diminished greatly toward the end of the book, as each woman seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man.  And the conflicts Steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous:  mountains out of molehills.  For instance, Gray, the 50-year-old artist who has always been phobic about family, refuses to meet the ADULT children of the woman he's been with for several months and whom he claims to love.  Nevermind the fact that he's known about the ADULT children since the very beginning.  Nevermind the fact that the ADULT children live in England and Italy, while Gray and Sylvia are New Yorkers.  Nevermind the fact that they have their own lives and are independent, self-sufficient ADULTS who maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent phone calls and less frequent face-to-face visits.  Evidently Gray can't see beyond the fact that they are "kids" and therefore "family" and therefore not to be tolerated.  Sorry, but whatever sympathy I'd developed for Gray by this point disappeared altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of immaturity.  Dump the weenie, Sylvia.  You can do better.  The other two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness, and of course everything was wrapped up magically, with sudden capitulation, as if the men had just suddenly come to their senses.    Considering what little time and effort was spent on these characters, their conflicts and resolution, I have to wonder why Steel even bothered writing this book.  And why I bothered reading i 
 On the positive side, this book contains an enormous quantity of well-documented detail and scholarship.  On the negative side, the writing is colorless and, to my eye, devoid of any unifying theme.  Even someone seriously interested in the history of the period will find it soporific.  Having struggled to the end, I still cannot decide if the juice was worth the squeeze 
 I have derived many hours of pleasure from this author. My favorite is Ivanhoe. I wouldn't recommend this one, though. It is boring and confusing 
 I have thick coarse hair and was looking for something to make it softer.  I Used just a little bit and it was really greasy.  I am currently using Lanza Anti Aging Plant Serum.  It works much better 
 I have a Dell laptop.  This inverter provides sufficient power to recharge the battery while I drive.  But it 'cuts out' if I try to turn on the laptop to use it in the vehicle.  The information on Amazon.com doesn't make clear the limitations of this product 
 I just received this book. I find it quite outdated. The drawings and illustrations are poorly done. There are only a few black and white pictures. Just beware that this is a 1998 book and I am sure you can find a more updated horse book than this one. 
 Okay.  Don't get me wrong.  I like imaginitive things.  There's nothing wrong with a little fantasy or anything.  This DVD set, however, claims to be based on science, but seemed rather incredible to me.  Sure, it started as a fun little romp through a possible future, but as I watched more and more of it, it became harder and harder for me to take in.  I didn't make it to the last few episodes, because it was just so fantastic.  Next time I want to see or read about strange hypothetical creatures, I'll turn to sci-fi, not a supposed documentary 
 I had hoped that there would be a fair amount of vegetarian recipes in this book but was very disappointed to find precious few 
 I never received it so it's hard to review beyond the suggestion that you try ordering it somewhere els 
 I rented this on a whim and it brought back a lot of memories from my 1970s days in elementary school.  This video made its rounds in the public schools.  The songs are catchy and the film quality is good.    But make no mistake, this is propaganda aimed at children.  I will not be showing it to my kids.  Despite the freewheeling title, the message is that girls will find happiness only if they mimic boys.    Case in point:  Atalanta, a princess, finds happiness when she competes with men in a footrace and when she rejects marriage so she can travel the world (on her father's horse).  She also designs and fabricates rocketships in her spare time.  Juxtapose that story with another cartoon where a femine girl in a pink dress and curls is devoured by tigers when she follows the custom of "ladies first."  The tigers abide her request and throw her into a boiling cauldron.  The narrator advises us that the boiling girl makes a very tasty meal.  Our "hosts", infant puppets voiced by Mel Brooks and Marlo Thomas, are revolting.  There should be a law against using Mel Brooks' voice for a baby.  Apparently, I repressed memories of these creatures, but seeing them again brought back the horror.  Needless to say, I fast forwarded through the disturbing puppetry.  Overall, this DVD is fun for thirtysomethings but should be kept away from children 
 Nice product before they decided to save a few pennies - I have purchased seven, but now it is made with out the handle - so if that was part of the atraction of this case, note that the discription says 'sturdy padded handle' -- NOT! 5 STARS if it still had the handle or if you don't need one 
 While my three year old son recognizes his favorite Thomas characters, this book is poorly written and edited. The first story, "Cranky Bugs" is especially annoying because little sensitivity was used to match the pictures with the text. It is bad enough that the text is taken straight from the video tape, but some editing would greatly improve the stories. How sad that the Britt Allcroft empire has reduced the original, wonderful stories from Rev. Awdry to such rubbish 
 When I was a teenager Watergate was in full swing.  I had an incredible urge to hire CIA operatives to bug the Dems.  According to Jason, the president is nothing short of the spiritual leader of our country.  My bad 
 As a fan of historical mysteries, I was looking forward to starting this popular series.  I was deeply disappointed.  First of all, the character of Amelia Peabody is not appealing, and through her the author reveals that she has only a very superficial understanding of Victorian values and thinking.  (Although if you don't mind an author sticking a character with modern sensibilities in period dress, maybe this is for you.)  Furthermore, the mystery was simply not that interesting.  I found myself reading only to finish the book, for I had little interest in finding out who committed the murders. The success of this series and the acclaim the author has received truly baffle me 
 This book is boring.  Contrary to what some of the reviewers say, there is no substance.  I mean, you be the judge and see if you can get anything from this: desire + belief + action = success.  If you are looking for an inspirational read, this could work.  But there are no specific ways on how to become rich.  The substance portion comes in in the chapter on real estate since that is what Allen is known for but those techniques are old school.  Why don't you try to buy property no-money down right now (2006).  I don't think I'll read his books again 
 I ordered this item with the hope of finding a new home for my ever-growing collection of credit cards, grocery store cards, insurance cards, club cards, hotel cards, airline cards... you get the point.  I was disappointed to discover that placing more than one card in the wallet prevents the "Accardion" from collapsing enough to zip close.  I can't imagine how such a defective design would ever have made it to market.  Unless you want a really large leather case for a single credit card, I would not recommend this product 
 Gave lower rating because didn't have detailed info on replacing laptop harddrive.  Other info OK. VM 
 I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the  "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me 
 I couldn't even get 2 chapters into the book. It is that boring to me! Might try and read some other time but for now, going back to the library it goes 
 This book was required reading my first year in college. It eneded up consuming the entire year in a depessing and dire atmosphere. Every class we talked about the book, it's themes, it's techniques.  Never once did anyone dare to say they disliked the story. How could you say you disliked a personal story about the Holocaust and the ending in which she relays to the entire world that she is homosexual. You couldn't voice an oppinion against this at the risk of being "A Nazi" or a "Homophobe".  I'm risking that to tell every person here that this story was terrible. It was about the author harassing her Holocaust surviving parents over and over again about their terrible ordeal. They wanted to have it in the past, over with, gone, and forgotten. The memories were too hard to dredge up and frankly they were none of their daughter's business. BUT the author Sherlock's the information and writes this book. She then said in the end that she was homosexual when this information had nothing to do with the story. The entire book was a way to "come out" with all the stress on her parents and none on herself.  This indeed was a sad story, but because of the desparate and self centered needs of the author. It's easy to have a best seller when you make your subject matter a taboo subject to disagree with.   Read it if you want and form your own opinions. This is just mine. 
 This novel is confusing, melodramatic and contains too many improbable developments.  Its main character, Verloc, considers himself as an anarchist, although his role is 'the protection of the social mechanism', because 'protection is the first necessity of opulence and luxury'. As an 'agent provocateur' for a foreign country, he is forced (otherwise he looses his job) to organize a terrorist attack, which should 'waken up the middle classes' against 'unhygienic labour' in Great-Britain. He is also a spy on revolutionary activities of a small club of leftists fanatics (a combination of marxists and anarchists).  Conrad's superlative style is everything except subtle: 'the shallow enviousness of unhygienic labour' and 'the poor, pathetically mendacious, miserably authenticated by the horrible breath of cheap rum and soap-suds', seem to contradict a 'bad world for poor people'. The writing is sloppy. One time, an organization is called the Central Red Committee, another time, the International Red Committee. A 'Central' Committee seems rather bizarre for anarchists ('I depend on death, which knows no restraint and cannot be attacked. My superiority is evident.')  A dialogue between a police chief and a pure anarchist ('looking for the blow to open the first crack in the great edifice of legal conceptions sheltering the atrocious injustice of society') seems improbable, as well as the short love story between Verloc's wife and another anarchist, at the end.  However, certain aspects of the novel are very actual, like the use of 'a weak-minded creature with carefully indoctrinated loyalty and blind docility and devotion', to carry out the fatal terrorist attack. Also actual is the following sentence: 'the existence of secret agents should not be tolerated, as tending to augment the positive dangers of evil'.  This book has not the same high standard as Conrad's masterpieces like 'Hearth of Darkness' and 'Lord Jim'.  Only for Conrad fans 
 I'm glad I have other sources re Zen, because if it were only this book I checked, it would be history.  The editorial review at the beginning said:  "You might want to digest this book slowly, a few pages at a time."  Otherwise, you may want to toss the book across the room.    It seems very circular and unclear to me what point he's trying to make, and that isn't the case with other authors 
 Can it really only be two years since Mr. Studwell wrote this oft-quoted book?  Only two years since he bravely confronted and slayed the "myth" of a profitable domestic Chinese market?  Two years ago, we were told about a "long period of slow growth and stagnation" for the domestic Chinese economy.  This experienced China-hand, claiming 8 years of personal experience and a wealth of economic insight, assured us that there would only be a few isolated cases of economic success.  He mocked GM for its economic investment, and lumped them into the group of so many other misguided CEOs that falsely believed the Chinese could afford to buy anything the West had to sell!  As a previous reviewer pointed out with great self-satisfaction... GM would have to wait until 2025 to meet their target of one million in annual sales!  That prediction certainly seems comical when we realize that GM will reach 600k in annual sales this year: 2004.  GM, with its over-optimistic and poorly planned investment in China, made an eye-popping profit of $875 million with its Chinese partners from China in the year 2003.  That's actually *more* than what GM earned in North America ($811 million for Canada, Mexico, and the US combined).  We can only hope Joe Studwell will be contributing a sequel shortly explaining the lack of a consumer market in North America, as well.  Ah, how things have changed.  Mr. Studwell wrote for the Financial Times this month (December 2004), and while his melody remains the same, he has certainly changed keys.  We're now told that, "while" the Chinese economy is "certainly doing well" (surprising understatement from a man that wasn't shy with rhetorical bombasity a few years ago)... it's not doing *that* well.    How so?  Well, it seems, the Chinese domestic market will "only" be returning $8 billion in profits to foreign investors this year... a pathetic sum that's "only" comparable to the returns found in...  South Korea and Taiwan?  For a man that didn't think much of China's economic prospects 2 years ago, he sure has placed it in hallowed grounds this time around.  Two years ago, Mr. Studwell had a 50/50 shot of getting it right with this book.  He found anecdotes and statistics supporting his conclusions at the time, but he conveniently ignored the comparable evidence that just as surely contradicted his point.  In a world of conflicting facts when informed experts were unsure about China's future prospects, he decided to trumpet his own truth to the world.    Well, he's been caught with his pants down: he was as wrong as you can possibly be.  
 It's unfortunate that so many talented artists employ such abilities in such a degrading manne 
 The blurb for this book suggests a scholarly analysis of the effect of law on an emerging culture. It is anything but. It is better described as a muddled attempt to justify the modern political movement that elevates the descendants of 18th century Hawaiians to sacred victimhood enjoyed by Indians and Eskimos. The title should be a warning that this author cannot tell the difference between a colonist and an immigrant. She displays a less than adequate understanding of Hawaiian history and misses the significance of early leaders, both native and immigrant. Queen Kaahumanu, probably the most important force in creating the Hawaiian monarchy, is barely mentioned, and then denigrated as a sort of tool of the Christian missionaries. Sanford Dole, chief justice of the monarchy, head of the provisional government, president of the republic, and governor of the territory, is ignored.  The biggest problem with this book is that too many readers will take it seriously 
 Because of the award nomination and short-story format, I bought this book.  I found it boring, honestly.  I thought this might be the case because I'm a man and this is about women (though that's not stopped me enjoying books by Amy Tan, Joyce Carol Oates, Jhumpa Lahiri, or Sandra Cisneros but I was thinking there I must be reading something wrong).  However, I felt vaildated when my mother - an avid reader - read it and complained about the pace and characters as well.  Fortunately, it's a short read so it wasn't a long waste of time 
 I have always been a huge fan of Kris Parker.  I like what KRS has done.  I like what he is doing.  I like the fact that he has never looked to what the masses are putting out and has instead tried from day one to promote positivity.  Therefore, I find that this effort is laudable in its attempt to bring KRS's spirituality to an audience that has been listening to him for decades.  Unfortunately, it falls flat on its face.  The songs on this album do not manage to live up to the message in the lyrics.  KRS is best known for bringing a message to all people by writing about things that could be understood by all people.  That aspect of his work is forgotten on this album, and his work comes across as his preaching instead of his teaching.  It's almost like he's forgotten the experiences that brought about his spirituality, and instead focuses on the goal without paying attention to the trials and tribulations that got him there.  Musically, the beats are mostly just plain terrible, and feel devoid of warmth or personality.  The lyrics feel forced and while his delivery is excellent, the writing is not up to his usual high standard.  Most rappers these days are known for the beats they put together, or the hooks of their songs.  Few are known for true lyrical ability.  KRS has never before fallen victim to this trap.  The reason Criminal Minded, Boom Bap and Necessary did so well was the mix of good writing, excellent delivery and beats that worked with the material presented.  Everyone who listens to hip hop can quote lyrics from those albums (and many, if not most, of KRS's other offerings) - the same can't be said with this album, as he didn't find the right mix to present the material.  Pick up this album if you want a complete KRS ONE collection - otherwise, leave it on the shelf 
 I must say I bit into this Senheiser scheme. I paid a lot of money on a product that should not cost that much. First of all I should say that I only paid 65 dollars for it and I still think it is much more than it is worth.  Now the problems: 1.	It is called open air design or something like that, bottom line is everybody in the room and the neighboring rooms can hear what you are listening. What is the purpose of the headphones then? I could play my games using the speakers and have a better experience. 2.	The highs are too high and the lows are too low. First time you use them you say oh it sound great but after a time it gets annoying. 3.	These are supposed to be audiophile ones. I play my guitar sometimes at 2 at night, this was the reason for the new headphones (I got tired of my old ones - they had a very short wire). Now the problem is I use a lot of distortion and because the highs are too high and so on they are horrible. I went back to my old ones and I am only using these with my computer during the day or when nobody is at home. Anyway my opinion is that I should have bought the $20 Phillips model that I used to have before these 
 76:14, Remotion, Pentamouous Metamorphosis...THOSE are Global Communication albums. This is pure drivel comprised mostly of (C)rap and trendy house music that has been remixed. My biggest complaint is that I didnt buy this CD to fill my house with the shameful vulgarities that normally accompany (c)rap music (and I use the term "music" here very generously) and that appear here in a few of the "songs". I bought this CD because the title of the group on this album is GLOBAL COMMUNICATION, not Gun Master Nig*er Bit*h F*!ker!!!   There is NOTHING here that resembles the music that Global Communication has released under the name GLOBAL COMMUNICATION in the past! Knowing that Mark Pritchard and Tom Middleton release music under other names makes me wonder why they didnt do so in this case? I dont expect the same old stuff from them (I was hoping that they actually had something new and interesting to COMMUNICATE) but packaging this GARBAGE into a CD released under the name GLOBAL COMMUNICATION is like packaging porn into a movie entitled  DISNEY'S BAMBI RETURNS....It just isnt right and quite frankly, is SUPER OFFENSIVE.   TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY for anyone expecting to hear Global Communication do something worthy of recording. Through ALL their releases (even the ones under other names) this is the most shameful, vulgar and deviod of anything remotely worthy of musical attention, thought or reflection 
 I got this as a Christmas gift. I found it extremely hard to use. Cueing or skipping songs is easy enough, but hitting the "mode" key is very awkward. I can't store it in my pocket or bag because the "power" key will inevitably get hit. I went through 3 batteries in 2 weeks. Even the directions (on CD and in writing) are very confusing. At first, I thought I couldn't use it with Mac OS.  On the plus side, I had no problem loading songs onto it or getting them off (with Mac OSX). The backlight is easy on the eyes.   This is basically a gussied-up flash drive, which is fine. I'm not looking for something that plays vidoes. However, it shouldn't be so hard to play a  podcast or some tunes. On the whole, I'm disappointed. 
 I was surprised to find this book very unhelpful in my new tutoring business. It mainly discusses the relationship between the tutorer and tutoree and provides no information on tutoring techniques, etc.  A real  disappointment 
 This book is a brief introduction to cycles and how they are used in trading.  But it does not have info on how cycle lengths are determined; it appears the author uses a computer program.  It might stimulate more  interest in cycles, but by itself, won't help your trading, in my opinion 
 This book is beyond mildy boring. It's easy to spot the 'plot twists' several chapters before they occur. All her jokes center around one-theme that isn't funny from the start. I recommend it only if you're looking for a cheap read that doesn't require any thinking. I was very disappointed 
 ...then you'll see how easy it is to give good customer service. I noticed most of the reviewers are managers and Human Resource trainers, not the people actually on the front line. Just try getting screamed at, cursed at, things hurled at you, and called all kinds of different names from an irate customer. Also try wading through the asinine company policies that tie your hands and keep you from helping the customer the way they deserve. Along with a lower than you can live off salary, and you have the average customer service rep and what we have to deal with every day.  This book misses the mark in so many ways. It caters to people living in a dream world and have high enough positions that they dont have to deal with the public. But I'm sure they think this book's ideas are "neat-o 
 I subscribed to Cooks Magazine some years ago, back when it  began publishing again.  I had problems with issues that failed to arrive, and wrote to them about it - never received a reply or any note of concern.  Since that time, I occasionally glance through it at newsstands to see if there are any articles of interest.  Even by dint of casual glance, I've begun to tire of the formulaic articles in which some drone tirelessly adds or deletes ingredients in order to finally come up with the "perfect recipe" for something or other.  I now skip right to the "perfected" recipe, and decide whether its worth committing to memory.  Some of the explanations for the success or lack thereof of the inclusion or exclusion of a particular ingredient are hare-brained at best.  There are also two other areas of this magazine that have disappointed me:  1.  Product Reviews:  They range from just plain wrong to idiotic.  The KitchenAid Pro 600 was hailed by Cook's as the best in its class for many mixing chores.  Yet, the Amazon reviews tell a different tale - one of a short lifespan when used to mix bread dough because of a plastic gear cover that deforms and finally comes apart, allowing the metal gears to separate.  Christopher Kimball (the editor) once performed an evaluation of cookware in which he calculated the price of the cookware per pound of its weight.  No, I'm not joking.  In that evaluation, Le Creuset came out on top simply because it was heavy.  All-Clad, even though it conducts heat very evenly, suffered for not having as much heft, and therefore was judged pricey, on a pound weight basis.  One issue of Cooks boasted on its cover "Unsweetened chocolate -supermarket brand beats others".  Apparently, Hershey's was designated best.  Not too many months later, Callebaut was recommended above all others, and Hershey's was judged barely acceptable.  Feeling manipulated yet?  2.  Finally, there are those dreadful editorials by Mr. Kimball.  Rambling, painfully written, and punctuated with a picture of Mr. Kimball wearing a bow tie, and looking very much as if his head were being held on by it. Mr. Kimball is a humble man, with much to be humble about.  He writes as if he were chanelling Helen Gurley Brown, but in red and black flannel watch-plaid and without her sense of play.    Time to re-vamp this magazine, folks 
 Being the shortest of Shakespearian tragedies, Macbeth would be the logical choice of play to receive the graphic novel treatment. This book, retelling a somewhat truncated version of "the Scottish play," is one of the more recent attempts which capitalizes on the metaphysical elements, while transposing a unique futuristic setting (the opening caption puts the tale in "Stardate: 1040," the King's men ride dragons, and even the Weird Sisters appear as androids).   However, there is a definite sense that the finished product does not live up to the initial aspirations. Though the text is wholly comprised of critical lines gleaned from the original text (including a few superfluous but wholly memorable ones, such as Macbeth's "We have scorched the snake, not killed it" and the witty dialogue between MacDuff's wife and child), the story does not retain the proper flow of the original play. In adapting the story, too much has been lost for the sake of brevity, and thus are the characterizations fatally flawed. One feels little sympathy (much less empathy) with the tragic hero because his transformation from nobility to barbarism is almost immediate, allowing no opportunity to be drawn into his formerly held virtue. In fact, the only portrayal whose death I felt was that of Banquo (and Shakespeare's Macbeth is rife with such unjust murder and assassination)!  Likewise, Mr. Tamai's artwork is competant at best, if inconsistent. The lush style of illustration remains intact for all of 55 pages before degenerating into a completely different one, as if the pages were incomplete at the time of publication. The expressive eyes and astute detail return some twenty pages later, but soon dissipate back to the "new" style. It could be argued that this sharp shift in drawing style is a microcosm representative of Scotland's descent into madness, though for such a purpose it is sadly ineffective.  Together, both the text and the illustration occasionally work against each other, providing not so much complimentary story-telling techniques, but distraction. This is, unfortunately, especially prominent in the first few pages of the book, where the witches deliver their opening lines and the King's fighting men speak poetically during a complex, heavily detailed battle. The beauty of Shakespeare's words are combined with Mr. Tamai's fantastic rendering of a futuristic skirmish, yet the two provide such a juxtaposition as to render a steep mount of confusion.  Helpful would be some form of "spacing," or the use of separations signifying the breaks in the play's Acts (the short book's "chapters," if you will). Also, a brief description of the cast of characters would aid the reader in discerning who's who (since the book does run shorter than the play upon which it is based, thereby creating a minuscule window of opportunity into which the uninitiated reader may enter). Finally, a well-versed knowledge of the original play would assist the reader in getting through the entire book, as the book by itself neither involves nor moves the reader.  It is a lofty aspiration for Penguin Graphics to attempt such an adaptation, so it is especially disappointing that such a valiant effort should fall so short. 
 I used to tell everyone what a great trimmer this is!  I took very good care of it and probably used it on my face or eyebrows only two or three times a month.  Then about ten months after receiving it, the plastic head portion that holds the blade fell off and will not reattach.  I guess if I want to continue using this trimmer, I will have to figure out a way to tape or glue the head back on the unit.  It comes with a one year warranty, but because I received it as a gift, I did not have a receipt.  I contacted Emjoi and they refused to replace it, even though I have used it less than a year.  I asked if they would repair it at my expense and was told that they did not do repairs, only replacements.  So, here's another expensive little gadget that the company does not worry about keeping its customers satisfied.  Obviously I will no longer recommend this Emjoi product to anyone.  Save yourself a lot of money and buy the $10 version at the discount/drug stores.  Then, if and when it breaks, you won't feel so badly about throwing it away 
 Aren't people getting bored and burned out with this stuff? Its the same old mythology being re-hashed in another "magickal" book! It gets very old very fast 
 This is probably the worst war related movie I've ever seen. I am particularly incensed by several actors who are featured as being in the film are present for as little as a single minute or two. Time spent watching this film is time you'll never get back and have nothing to show for it 
 I am an avid sports fan and I love football, but sorry, I didn't enjoy this book one bit. I kept waiting for the Grisham who writes compelling dramas (The Broker, King Of Torts) to pop out, but realized midway through it wasn't gonna happen. As someone else here summarized - "it's chick lit about guys who played high school football" 
 Wendell Berry is one of my favorite poets; I highly recommend 'Entries', 'The Timbered Choir, and his various collected and selected poems to anyone interested in language that is alive and powerful in evocatively imagistic and spiritual ways. But 'Given' left me a bit cold. These poems would be better suited to Berry's excellent agrarian commentary work; but as poetry they failed the genre a bit, coming off like bland polemics in a language all too flat. The work is not without some merit, but I would certainly give Berry's other collections a much higher priority 
 I have Jennifer's Crunch Salsa Dancing DVD, and it was my first dance exercise DVD.  I loved it so much I've been ordering a lot of others and ran across this one by the same instructor.  I find the moves too difficult and frustrating.  By the time you are close to having one step down, she's moving onto the next one, and it doesn't seem like you get to benefit from the repetitous moves that I enjoy in her Crunch video.  In that one she started out slow, repepated it several times, then did it real time, and then added another combination the same way.  The end result was putting the two combinations together, so basically repeating four moves over and over, doing about six dance routines all together, which was good enough for me.  When I do it now, I just go right to real time and ignore the slow start, so I haven't been bored at all.  She looks great in this video, but I agree with another review that they do not focus on her feet at all.  Basically I ended up watching her dance and kept marching in circles.  But if I was a good dancer, this would probably be a lot of fun.     
 Don't get me wrong Meatloaf fans.  I have nothing personal against you, your music, or the artist who performs it.  I'm sure Mr. Loaf is a fine, outstanding citizen that anybody would admire in person, but as for the style of music he performs?  Attrocious!  These bombastic, over the top, pseudo opera epics sound more like a Broadway musical than rock n roll.  The songs are boring and tell long winded stories with involved plots.  The production is over the top and bombastic.  Meatloaf took everything to the extreme and the result was one of the most pretentious albums ever made.  
 A triumph of crass commercial misinformation and hyperbolic dilettantism over actual learning. Bragg and his handlers, in their rush to make a quick buck, seem barely to have skimmed a few shady amateur websites for their facts. Those readers with any education will find their eyebrows rising with incredulity to read that the Indo-European languages stem originally from India; that English is a rarity among languages for not being controlled by a French-style scholarly academy; that Shakespeare, apparently in need of even more credit, invented no fewer than 2,000 new English words; and that Bede apparently had a time machine, since his quotation of the then 300-year-old letter to Aetius is related as if Bede were the author. Beyond the unblinking confusion over basic facts, the story-telling style ham-handedly anthropomorphizes English itself, alternately "wanting all the space it could claim" or growing "confident enough to take on newcomers", as a "battle-hardened" hero with mysteriously unique qualities, smacking of manifest destiny, that could only be perceived by an author who has never read the history of any other language or heard of the concept of sampling bias. For example, English is characterized as having an almost superhumanly unique "capacity to absorb other" languages, in a breathless description requiring the support of no fewer than three sinister adjectives - "cunning", "subtle", and "ruthless" - just in one sentence. Telling, then, that the guileless five-star reviewers' praise emphasizes such qualities as "easy to read". The less undiscerning will balk at hunting out the residue of actual knowledge from among Bragg's galloping storytelling, unless as a parlor game, and will find far more profit with any of a large number of excellent, slightly less easy alternatives. And by the way, the English translations from Frisian omit entire clauses 
 Mark Twain's Pudd'nhead Wilson (1854) is a short, episodic novel which continuously promises to flower into a small work of genius but never succeeds. Densely packed with socially explosive themes and literary devices--including two apparent sets of twins, switched identities, transvestite episodes, an emotionally biased stepparent, a scheming heir, a dramatic court room scene, and a mysterious murder--the book is too obviously calculated throughout, and thus, despite moments of genuine power, reads like the awkward concoction that it is. Since Pudd'nhead Wilson is essentially plot-driven, Twain's frequent apparent lack of confidence in his narrative doubly dilutes the novel's forward momentum, leaving the reader uncomfortably aware of the author's somewhat forced creative decisions. Even locally misunderstood lawyer Pudd'nhead Wilson himself--a secondary character--never really exists as a three dimensional figure and seems present throughout only to serve as a deus ex machina at the story's conclusion.   All of which is a shame, since Pudd'nhead Wilson, in terms of its themes, had the potential to be Twain's greatest work.  The novel is the story of Roxana, a slave who, being "only one-sixteenth black," can pass for white and who switches her own light-skinned child with the child of her master while both are in infancy, thus hoping to spare him the horrible fate of "being sold down the river." But Roxana's child, now known as "Tom" and raised as the future lord of the manor, becomes a bully, an ingrate, and a secret criminal, while the real heir, raised without any advantages as a slave and called "Chambre," merely fulfills his role as an illiterate piece of property.   The novel's most significant problem is also its most obvious one. Pudd'nhead Wilson would have been far more compelling had Twain not allowed the text to take the overt position that blacks raised as whites will turn out to be as shiftless, loafing, and inherently worthless as the prejudices of the era defined them to be. This is especially true since "Chambre," the genuine white heir, remains offstage for most of the novel and thus his lack of development as a human being under the slave system is never explored.   Nothing hammers Twain's error of judgement home as much as the fact that the initially sympathetic Roxana develops into a morally compromised individual as the story proceeds, not because it is essentially believable for her to become so, but because Twain needs her to falter to further his rather cumbersome plot. Ultimately, that Roxana is only "only one-sixteenth black" and "Tom" "thirty-one parts white" and both thus essentially caucasian, is neither here nor there, since Twain repeatedly reinforces the notions of the era that both remain "negroes" regardless.   Though only 120 pages long, the meandering Pudd'nhead Wilson reads like a book twice that length, and, as its audience will begin to suspect as the narrative progresses, the story's climax is pat and predictable. Twain might have succeeded at leaving his racially charged themes deliciously ambiguous and prismatic, but simply does not. Few things are sadder than a work of art that attempts to be clever and fails to be, of Pudd'nhead Wilson is an fine example.     
 I didn't even finish the book.  By the end of the first chapter I was disgusted by the completely one-sided portrayal of women, particularly minority women, as abject victims of white men.  I agree that this book has its roots in truth, but I think that a more evenly assessed account could certainly have been written.  I didn't like the attitude of the author.  She seems to think that black women were the only ones who suffered.  What about black males?  Or white women?  Or Native Americans?  Just because I didn't see them in the first chapter doesn't mean they aren't discussed at all, but it didn't set the right tone for me 
 The benefits may be great, but the exercises are so boring that it is way too much effort to do them on a regular basis 
 I expected more from Disney I guess they are learning and now are doing better with what they have put out.  But do not waste your money on it.  Look for a more recent one which has lyrics as well as graphics.  The songs on it aren't all that - I bought if for my daughter and even the music sounds a bit off when it goes without words.  Really - save your money on this one!  :0 
 These dishes look very nice on your table, but they have many problems. After about a year, my plates started cracking, directly above the ridge on the bottom.  Same with the bowls.   I have never been able to use them in the microwave because the item becomes very hot while the food is lukewarm. If they bump each other while running the dishwasher, they chip.  At least, when I put them in they are ok, but they are chipped when I take them out 
 What a beautiful hunk of toaster. But alas, all style, no functionality. First the lever which helps lift up the bread stripped its gears (approximately 3 months into use), then the inside heating elements ceased to function (4 months into use), and finally we tossed the unit when it began to smell like burning wires.  Incredibly disappointed with T-Fal service - they do not stand behind this product.  
 Steve Vai is easily one of the top five most versatile and technically gifted guitarists this country has produced. It's too bad you can't find a whole band of first rate musicians like this here. I think the problem with America not producing great "progressive" rock bands is that when a prog rock artist such as Steve Vai comes along, he wants to run the whole show and be in a band that features his name rather than simply being one of five or six permanent members of a band. In other words, there would be no Rush if Geddy Lee just wanted to be in the Geddy Lee Band, or no Yes if Rick Wakeman  just wanted the Rick Wakeman  band. Such is the problem with this CD. Everything goes in the direction Steve Vai wants it to go to suit his mood, whether you get it or not. You know how in movies when two people are walking side by side talking, and one of the characters is talking all the way and the other guy just keeps saying uh-huh until finally he stops in his tracks with a puzzled look on his face, silently muttering the last sentence the first guy said while that guy just keeps on walking and talking, not knowing his buddy has stopped because he was thrown for a loop at the last thing he said?  That first guy is supposed to notice that his buddy has stopped keeping up with him, turn around and wait for him or wait for the guy to catch up with him and then move on together again. The problem is with Vai, he doesn't turn around - he  just moves on to the next project without looking back at you to see if you get it and you wonder if he cares. Now, there is some burning and imaginative guitar work on this CD. Firewall is a great barn-burning power song even if you wish someone else were handling vocals. Building the Church is a great instrumental that is wonderfully constructed and could become a Vai classic.  The rest is esoteric and you have to have a tremendous amount of patience for it. On the next album, Steve, please turn around and see if your fans are keeping up with you, otherwise you may lose a few. 
 "I was disappointed with this book. Dr. Crabb states that a man's greatest need is significance and a woman's greatest need is security. My understanding of the Bible is that the single greatest need for both men and women is salvation and sanctification. Not only is the assessment of man's need wrong, he says that this must be dealt with BEFORE Biblical principles can be applied. A better approach would be to apply biblical principles to the lives of men and women and allow the Holy Spirit to work in them so that they will find their security and significance in Christ alone.&quot 
 The book is only worth about $5.  It has only a hundred or so pages that are more of the author's cartoons than any practical advice.  On the last page of the book, the author points out all the mistakes he made in the book but decided to leave in so that he could point them out to us.  I'm interested in cartooning/comic strips and I feel that I am no closer to being able to do that than I was before I read the book.  I don't understand how this book got all great reviews.  Don't be fooled like I was 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 This woman, Kathleen Sullivan, gave birth to me.  I wont call her my mother, as that is something she is not. For the protection (mentally) of my family, I had to cut her completely out of our lives several years ago.  This book is ALMOST complete dilusion/fantasy/fiction from cover to cover.  I just suggest anyone that has read anything she has written, be careful.  Do not assume these things to be truths.  My own therapist thinks she's "nuts" (knowing the whole story).   Look in the future for "Emily's story... 
 It's entirely unfortunate that Garrard has come to be considered the be-all-end-all of Gentilleschi scholarship.  While the hefty opus features a wealth of research and a moderately well-illustrated span of pages, Garrard's feminist arguments do not line up. Citing the artist's "rape" by Tassi as a motivating force in the creation of her paintings featuring strong female characters, Garrard corners much of her argument on the Susanna and the Elders Gentilleschi painted a full year before the encounter with Tassi.  Further, Garrard casts a 20th century feminist eye, and an accusatory one at that, upon the artist and her situation. She hardly considers the psychology of the 17th century, nor the legal definitions, where "rape" and its current emotional and psychological ramifications were hardly present. Indeed, court documents and statements show the artist and her father suing for marriage to save the family name; not once is there a mention of emotional hardship, but instead purely economic. Other sources depict a heated, smitten Artemisia, who continued her affair with Tassi for a year before discovered by her father, exposed, and forced to bring legal action against tassi. Conlusion: 400 years ago, forced sexual acts had not the same social identification of today, the psychology was different, and, honestly, Garrard neglects to illustrate the other sides of Artemesia and focuses on one event defining a life of artistic creation that, while reasonable for a 20th century situation, is unfounded for a Baroque 
 Several of the disks had physical defects which ruined the experience.  I requested a replacement and received a refund.  Who's stearing the ship? 
 Expected more from this movie - although DeNiro was good as usual 
 Arthur Ashe made many fine contributions to America, but this isn't one of them. Not up to the standard set by the other books in the series 
 When I first discovered the Stephanie Plum series (I started with Four to Score, then backtracked), I was delighted with the character of Stephanie Plum.  Although she was down on her luck, she was plucky, endearing, and canny enough to make the best of any situation she encountered.  In earlier books, Stephanie was kind to her family and friends even though they drove her crazy, held her own in her on again/off again relationship with boyfriend cop Joe Morelli, and walked a fine line during her curious encounters with Ranger.  She even showed some attitude with her smarmy cousin Vinnie, her ex-husband, and her nemesis Joyce Barnhardt.  But now, Stephanie Plum has morphed into someone who is selfish, stubborn and just plain stupid.  She has develped a childish mean streak and displays little regard for anyone but herself.    In Ten Big Ones, Stephanie is stalked by a gang hit man and, being the intrepid bounty hunter that she is, Stephanie walks right into the eye of the storm.  Deciding that Joe's concern for her safety is too oppressive, she moves out of his house and into Ranger's unoccupied apartment.  In one of her silliest schemes yet, she wrangles Lula and Connie into helping her kidnap a gang member, putting them all in jeopardy.  And as her sister's nuptuals approach, Stephanie becomes more and more obnoxious.  All this is played for laughs, but it misses the mark.  The plot is deja vu, the characters predictable.  Sadly, the loveable characters created long ago by Evanovich are now stuck in a time warp where they never grow up, never change and they go through similar events again and again.  Come on, bring back the old Stephanie and give Morelli something to do other than walk his dog Bob and answer his cell phone.  I'm taking a vacation from this series.  Bring on James Patterson, Laurie King, Lisa Gardner... 
 This book is a crock. It's about a guy having a mid life crisis and doing what all of us do after we have somewhat "made it," gets tired of the grind, and begins to wonder if its really all worth it. The authors cite how many people turn to fads looking for answers when the authors  are really just plying another self help book in an attempt to create a new fad with their footprints on it 
 If you enjoy being dizzy (and I don't mean with delight or excitement) then this is the book for you. It constantly is hopping you backwards and forward in time, not only that, but you are constantly hit by a slew of new characters (all peripheral and mostly unimportant) aunts, uncles, friends, sons, dentists, doctors insurance sales men...MAKE IT STOP! Enough is enough. I read this book and it would end up irritating me to the point of putting it down. I like an interesting and complex plot line as well as the next person, however, this seems self serving and written just to show you how damn clever Mr. Straub is and how stupid you the reader are for being unable, or unwilling, to follow along with this meandering and endless tale.  I normally like most things but I really hate this.  Very disappointed 
 This book is more about feel good stories of people who started a business and they liked what they were doing.  If you liked Chicken Soup for the Soul, you will probably like this.  I was looking for a book to give some  ideas of what good businesses someone could do part-time and make some  extra money.  These stories covered various set up costs and barely gave an  idea of what is needed.  The book basically sums up to be: Find out what  you like and make a plan.  If you already figured that out, don't buy the  book 
 There are only 17 songs in this entire book! NO fiddle music. All the notes are much smaller than all the other books, hard to read. There are finger numbers above all the notes, so you don't learn to read the notes, you read the numbers and make mistakes because you don't know which string you should put the finger on. The accompanying CD is way too fast to play with! The other books give you more to play, to read and contain twice the melodies which are from all different styles.  Just don't get what all the fuss is about with this method if you don't learn to read right and don't play any worthy exercises 
 This is one of my favorite romantic comedies.  It is funny, touching, and has some of my favorite actors in it.  And it doesn't only center around the main characters but has a great ensemble cast of very interesting people! 
 Like "Jurassic Park", this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters. My reasons for such an accusation: 1. Crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts. And while these can be quite interesting, they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline (Dan Brown, for instance, is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity). As a result, the book comes off as slow and stumbling. 2. The plot isn't all that interesting to begin with. (Vengeful gorillas? Talking gorillas? Misanthropic gorillas? Come on.) 3. The book's ending is utterly terrible. 4. Cricton's writing is weak, and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing.  Sorry, Michael, but this book just didn't do it for me 
 Let's face it. Nothing anyone says can sway a particular fragment of this movie's viewing audience one way or the other. Those who love J.Lo will declare the greathess of this movie, in a variety of ways.  Those who hate J.Lo will counter their every point in describing how bad it is. And those who love quality film won't waste too much time even recognizing that this movie even exists. Guilty pleasure, indeed! One thing you have to admit about J.Lo, she's consistent. She sings bad, acts bad, and is merely eye candy, for thoe who find her appealing. And this movie is full of all of the above, plus awful, cliche ridden, emotionally pleading writing that should be an inspiration to anyone with Hollywood writing aspirations, since this movie demonstrates how little talent it takes. At least it's had it's short, but sill way too long presence on the premium movie channels, cause for a while this piece of garbage was ubiquitous, just like the lead starlett. Maniupulative only begins to describe this drek. But that said, it's more than enough time wasted on this movie. I merely felt compelled to warn folks. Don't waste your time. It stinks 
 Sometimes, reviewers on Amazon give the reading public a great disservice ... and this is one of those times. I don't know what Preston & Child's game is, but their writing seems aimed at the junior-high crowd. Nothing wrong with that, but it would have been nice if there had been a disclaimer on the cover: "Warning - lame plot, bad writing, juvinile characters ... scratch that - no character development whatsoever 
 The title leads one to believe that this might possiably be a wonderful page turner, filled with "erotic Poetry", but as I read through these poems, I was very disappionted. I own many erotic poetry books, and found this one "not" erotic at all. These poems didn't grasp my intrest, nor provoke thought. This to me, is indeed the one of the worst displays of erotic poetry I have ever read. The poetry having no meter, nor rhythm 
 I ordered the towel for a present for my husband and was extremely disappointed that the hem came unraveled after the towel's first washing although it was not in a bag with or washed with anything that had a button, snap, zipper, catch, or anything else that could possibly have snagged it.  It was not nearly as soft as I expected for the price either. It was better than what you'd expect from your standard hotel towel, but it wasn't any softer than my towels from the JC Penny Collection.  The redeeming quality is that the size is great for larger people and those who simply want to be completely wrapped up in a bath sheet 
 I admired Scholl's singing on his "Gramophone Award" winning Vivaldi CD, and later heard him on various occasions cooperating with Jacobs, Herreweghe and Christie, but - to my ears - with much less success.  There were moments when I was thrilled: recently with his and B. Bonney's  "Stabat Mater" (under Christophe Rousset) and  Solomon (with  Mccreesh), but a recital is a different matter. Here you have to built a  dramatic tension by singing alone (well if supported by a good orchestra)  and if you cannot achieve that, the recital will turn into a sequence of  pleasantly sounding songs. And that's what happens here - Scholl's  "Heroes" are bland. I haven't been able to listen to this record  more than 2 times, with the exeption of two tracks devoted to Gluck, this  however only because Gluck is my fairly recent "discovery" and I  have been waiting impatiently for a delivery of CDs with some of his works.  What else could I do than listen to what I already had? For that matter,  von Otter's Mozart/Gluck/Haydn disc with Pinnock gave me not only more  Gluck, but also much more pleasure (as did Mozart and Haydn).  Scholl's  Handel disappointed me. I think that his success with Solomon lies in the  fact, that there Scholl was put in the particular dramatical context and  did not rely exclusively on his famed voice. Here he cannot make much out  of his "Heroes". The orchestra is not of much help, neither is  quickish tempo, especially in more reflective passages. You simply hear  that the artist has no time to take a breath! Can you contemplate while  gasping?  This is not a CD that I will listen to very often, I do not even  know, if I will ever come back to it. It will sit in one of the darker  corners of my CD racks and wait for better times.  By the way, PR people in  the classical music market are really messing things up. I believe that  excellent artists - and Scholl certainly IS one of them - do not need PR  publicity and completely unjustified releases like this one. But maybe I am  just spoiled and eager to hear more previoulsy unrecorded music, from  composers I have no idea about. With all respect to my beloved Handel.. 
 Neil Mcallister's review says it pretty well, but I have to go on a tirade of my own here, if anything, to let off some of the steam built up from my anger at how dissapointing this book is.  Let me start by saying that you are probably a 30 something skater.  Yes, Phillips had an art career pre and post dating SCS, but face it- the screaming hand, the Indy  logo, that Grosso toy box deck you wanted so badly but by the time you saved your money up, the shop was out and you went with that Lucero instead... this is what we we all know and love the man for.  And, it's us who is going to be buying this book.  But, now before you buy, let me tell you that only a tiny portion of it is devoted to his SCS days.  There are some generally small reproductions of a few of the decks and other assorted graphics, and a few words which amount to not much more than random blurbs.  The portion on him in "Disposable" is way more insightful and comprehensive, this is just totally sparse.  As for the rest of the book- yes, page after page is devoted to his concert posters, and the bulk of the writing was about his early days- stuff which I didn't really care about, and I'm certain you as well aren't overly concerned with.  Yeah, I'll take the man's life story, but make it short and devote the meat of this to his experiences at Santa Cruz.  This book totally fails to deliver.  Really weak.  I think as well that it's just another money making scheme for someone.  Us 30 something skaters are a nostalgic, passionate lot, and there are many out there who would take advantage of that and try to rip us off.  Don't get taken for a ride by purchasing this!  Just reread his chapter in "Disposable", ride your Jessee reissue and leave it at that 
 I usually read through one of Coulter's novel in a few days, exspecially her FBI/intrigue plots. I bought this as soon has it was released in paperback and still haven't finished it. The plot was slow and the main heroine a little too likable. Spoiler: Neighborhood teenagers diving on her body to protect her from bullets?! Talk about a work of fiction. No one expects a romance to be on our plane of reality, but in the same solar system would be nice

 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is..

 Back in the '90s,the Dave Matthews Band was considered the next Grateful Dead,with Dave Matthews as its clean-shaven Jerry Garcia.In my college days,the DMB was praised for blending world music,jazz&rock.It was The Next Big Thing.There were Daveheads.But then came "Everyday" produced by Glen Ballard (who also produced Alanis Morrissette's music),which was seen as a sell-out.  "Stand up" was the last gasp.When this album was released,a local Bay Area radio station was mocking the DMB as "annoying"&saying that having the ubiquitous Black Eyed Peas (who are now collaborating with Sergio Mendes&Michael Jackson)open for them made the DMB "doubly annoying."  This album has a few highlights- 1)American Baby,intro&song-Despite the use of the African kora (harp),this song sounds Asian with its pentatonic scale.It's quite electrifying.It's danceable&shows the brilliance the DMB once had.It's powerful in the use of acoustic instrumental music,like REM's "Losing my religion." 2)Louisiana Bayou-Very jazzy,you could say it evokes the New Orleans sound.Again,the DMB plays to its strengths. 3)Finest Hour-This song is catchy despite Dave Matthews' politics.Great as a song,not great as a protest song. 4)Out of my hands-Reflective with the use of piano,like REM's "Nightswimming."  Can the DMB make a comeback?It's hard to tell.In a decade,they've managed to go from being the Next Big Thing to Has Beens."Stand up" made the mistake of being produced by an R&B/hip-hop producer who tried to make the DMB sound like any other group.DMB isn't 50 Cent;it isn't Justin Timberlake.Whether the DMB returns to form remains to be seen 
 Philip Slater puts forth with vehemence and passion his opinions on the trends of hyperconsumerism and overindependence that are driving rifts between the people of our nation and diverting much-needed resources from  instituations designed to create health and well-being. His observations  about how middle-class Americans are alienating themselves by placing far  too much emphasis on material possessions, individualistic thought ("I  am different from all of you"), and an economy that is powerfully  rooted in the need to simply consume and produce goods rather than increase  the quality of life are interesting, though a bit dated, and still hold  much relevance to the current situation today.    Still, the phenomena he  rages against are nothing new to the conscientious among us, and there are  many other views on the problems of loneliness and hyperconsumerism that  prey on us. Slater makes powerful points, and he clearly has a deep desire  to see change and the end of the injustices that characterize our century,  but I found his writing style and thought process to be scattered and far  too extremist to inspire me. His book seemed less of an empirical analysis  of the problems facing our nation and what we can do to solve them and more  of an emotional rant about what he personally feels is wrong and where he  feels we all went wrong. Nothing bad about that, it's just he seems so  angry and hurt about it all that he didn't come close to capturing me  (though the chapter about Vietnam and the last chapter were coming close).      It was a good book, but there are far better books written by far more  inspirational people. Carl Rogers ("On Becoming a Person") was a  psychologist who spoke beautifully and wisely for the healing of the  isolation and misunderstandings in our relationships with each other.  Barbara Marx Hubbard ("Conscious Evolution: Awakening the Power of Our  Social Potential") writes convincingly and with an uplifting sense of  hope about the problems we face as a people and a culture and what we can  do in the coming decades to move in the direction that Philip Slater longed  for. Both these authors, and many others, rationally describe problems we  all face, then offer warm and well though-out advice about what we can all  do. Slater seems like something of a ranter, and reading his book only  depressed me. But hey, read the book, then move on. Good luck 
 I have only walked out of a handful of movies, and this was one of them.  Everything about this movie was contrived and stilted. While Blake Edwards has produced some classic movies, this simply is not one of them.  I recommend S.O.B if you're looking for a truly excellent Edwards fil 
 i really do not know why mallory wanted to join a club with that pack of nerds. who's with me??? they are, right? maybe she had nothing better to do with her time, i guess, besides writing and watching after her snot-nosed sibs. oh well. the book is completely stupid, by the way. but read it anyway. it's a bsc staple 
 I had read with interest the reviews offered by other readers, thought this would be a great beginners guide to Runes.  I will agree it is an incredible in depth look into the Runes and rituals.  I would not however recommend for beginners, slow read and hard to follow.  I would encourage, from a beginners stand point, readers find an easier and less in depth book to start out.  I would also recommend a large dictionary if you intend to purchase... 
 The bubbles are great, but the heater does not even keep really hot water warm. The water cooled down to cold in about 5 minutes 
 Once "The Very Best of 10cc" was released in 1997, it was the collection to have.  That collection included 15 tracks that spanned 10cc's career, ending with the Godley and Creme hit "Cry."  So why would this CD be released, especially since the only thing it offers over the prior CD is "Channel Swimmer" and "Don't Hang Up?"  Buy the CD "How Dare You" and "The Very Best of 10cc" and you will have three times the music you have on this CD for only twice the price.  An unnecessary addition to the 10cc portfolio 
 Well, I was really prepared for something special.  Not!  This is a book for Cityfolk.  Those of us from the Heartland know how to do these things or have a pretty good idea and know where to go to learn.  There was nothing special for me 
 I hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction. If thoughts are that powerful, they need to be resrained earlier. I don't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive. Logic can be quite painful when left alone, but sometimes it has to be 
 The liberation of Paris was a coup de grace for the Allies.  Paris did not suffer the fate of Berlin or Stalingrad, to name a few cities, in becoming a contested battleground.  Nor, as the book pointed out, did the German commander follow Hitler's orders to destroy the city's major monuments, bridges, and other sites.  It is interesting to note his actions in view of other German officers' claims that they were "only following orders".  However, this book is written by two journalists rather than historians, so it does not have the academic research nor analytical insight that a serious work might have.  Cornelius Ryan comes closer to the style of writing that might have made this a heavier book.  This is understandably difficult, in some ways, given the relative sparcity of combat and drama; or so this book would suggest.  Again, a better writer and researcher would find more material to include.  Some material that might be considered, for example, are Allied intelligence estimates, Axis intelligence estimates, operational orders, etc.  It is not clear to me, for example, how the German commander could fail to execute Hitler's orders in August 1944 when the Gestapo and SS were omni-present, especially after the failed July plot on Hitler's life.  Moreover, good research might show to what extent the Allies knew of Hitler's intentions.  The Allies had significant intelligence capabilities, not the least through Ultra.  And if they knew of the plans to destroy large parts of Paris, why didn't they send in commandos and special forces to disarm any explosives?  Indeed, the French themselves seemed to put a higher priority on erecting road blocks rather than disarming explosives.  This is an easy, enjoyable read; and one of the few on the subject in English.  However, it's about time someone else updated and added value to this book 
 This book has the same old information you have already heard.  I really did not like this book.  It had several items that are false in it, like gorillas eat meat, which they do not.  It has lots of negative information on various foods but offers no suggestions on where to buy an alternative product.  I just do not see the point of adding this book to your library or collection.  No new information whatsoever 
 In the chapter about South Asia, the authors have written quite a lot about the "Kashmir problem" but not once have they mentioned the ethnic cleasing of 350,000 Kashmiri Hindus that took place in 1990. I just cannot believe that they don't know about this 
 very confusing, non-focusing writing style plus author's splurge of mathematical demonstrations everywhere in the book makes this text book very hard to understand and offers no help for people to grasp the beauty of the economic theory. 
 I don't believe in global warming, based on my own studies on climate and pollution over the past 30 years. But this guy Singer is a complete joker.  He completely misses the point and addresses issues which no proponent of global warming has ever raised. He tackles dumb subjects, and ignores the very complexity of the issue which he claims to discuss. An example: Singer talks about the earth getting warmer, and says being warm will help poor people, as less fuel will be needed to keep people cosy. RUBBISH. The issue is not about the CLIMATE getting WARMER, its about climates everywhere CHANGING in either direction. Climate change proponents claim that cold places may get colder, warm places wramer, or anything in between - their arguement is that nobody knows and the risks need to be managed. Yet Singer has completely ignored the science and the political arguements - he claims to have studied them, but he's either a crap student or he's lying.   I can come to no other conclusion except that this prat has decided to write a book to make money and make a name for himself, and he risks destroying the hard work which other climate scientists are doing to disprove the climate change theory. What a complete loser. It makes me furious 
 This ambitious poetry book is based on a little known poetic style known as a crown of sonnets, used historically to honor great kings.  In this unique book, author Marilyn Nelson tries to apply it to an ordinary kid named Emmett Till whose name became household when he was brutally lynched, and outrage over his murder fueled the early flames of the black civil rights movement.    Nelson is admirable to tackle such a brutal and tough subject matter, however admiration is not enough to cover the fact that her poems are often hard to follow due to the ridged style, in addition to being tangential and lacking in any strong dramatic or emotional punch.  She writes about Till's murder as she would weave it into a floral wreath, and sometimes that leaves the reader bored and wondering why we should even care about Nelson's pretty flowers.  Her stated goal is to write about Till but he rarely makes an actual appearance in these poems, and her attempt to tie his murder into a larger history of lynching is poorly executed.  At one point she ties Till's murder to the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center, which comes out extremely contrived and tacked on, since the events, issues, emotions, and circumstances are completely different.  She expands considerable ink wishing he had never been killed, which although very admirable, doesn't give her much space to explore the national impact of his death or the good that grew out of his tragedy.  In addition, her lengthy and complex notes at the end of the book are absolutely necessary to understand her many intellectual allusions and symbols.  I could not imagine giving this book to anyone under 16 and having them get it at all - I'm finishing my undergrad in two weeks and I was overwhelmed.  While the poems pick up pathos towards the end, it really is not enough to save the whole set.  The illustrations by Philippe Lardy are nice but unremarkable, and given the poignant and brutal subject matter they are severely disappointing.  Many of them are simplistic and pretty paintings of flowers and birds that fit the wreath theme but entirely loose the tragedy and power of Till's death.  Like Nelson's poems, you need the complex notes at the back of the book to understand the many symbols in the oft-abstract illustrations.  Emmett Till himself is only shown once, and the artist attempts to make him look like an EveryChild (even to the point of giving him no real facial expressions) which makes him look generic and dull.  The art shines best when it is the most simple, such as when it is a textured background for the text itself, with simple shapes instead of complex allegories.  When the best thing you can say about the illustrations is that they make nice and non-imposing backgrounds, you know the art is in trouble.  A Wreath for Emmett Till asks the reader to "bear witness to the atrocity" and take responsibility for this murder in our collective memory, but otherwise is not a call to any action or awareness.  Unfortunately what sticks in the memory is a book that falls short of its lofty goals.  
 wow, where do i even begin with this one?  i've been wanting to write a review on this book because it's been bugging me for weeks!  i picked up this book with high hopes.. who wouldn't??  i'm overweight, i don't mind lifting weights, who doesn't want to get strong AND thin working out around 30 minutes a WEEK?  well remember the saying "if it sounds too good to be true.."  if this advice were true, everyone would be thin already.  so what's wrong with this book, really?  well, you might want to start by googling "cardio vs. weight lifting weight loss" or something like that, and prepare to have your eyes opened.  it's been scientifically proven that gaining muscle mass DOES NOT MAKE YOU LOSE WEIGHT!  that's right.. it helps you burn a nominal amount of calories, like 20 extra calories a day!  there are STILL only TWO ways to lose weight: diet and (cardiovascular) exercise!  the guys writing this book are living a pipe dream..  the ideas in here are wonderful fantasies, but there's only one problem:  they don't have any research to back it up.  they're countering every fitness expert and scientist in america, and that's fine as long as you can prove your case.  instead, what do we get?  tons and tons and tons of unfounded, unproven statements.  is it true that many magazines etc. claim that muscle mass helps you lose weight?  yes, that's true.  however, they're uninformed.  like i said, google it and learn for yourself - find out yourself how many calories a day gaining muscle will help you burn.  losing weight is about caloric intake - if you eat 2,000 calories a day, you have to burn more than 2,000 that day to lose weight.  that's the hard, bitter pill of the truth, right there.  now that i've joined a gym, i've noticed a very interesting phenonomenon:  i can tell you the second someone walks in the gym where they're going to work out!  if the person is skinny, they're going to cardio.  if they're fat, they're going to lift weights (or if they're already skinny and just want to look strong).  every fat person in that gym goes straight to the weights.  why?  because they hate cardio.  they can't stand to see themselves sweating like a pig and working hard.  me?  i don't care, because i'm willing to do what it takes to get thin.  do yourself a favor and get a diet book or spend all that extra time doing cardio.. heck, i don't need any further proof than myself!  i can lift a lot in weights now, but i'm still fat!  if you want to be fat and strong, read away, but take this into consideration:  look at the  book "my big fat greek diet."  how did a guy go from 467 pounds to 220 pounds?  HE DIDN'T LIFT WEIGHTS!  what did he do?  he stopped eating and drank protein shakes so his caloric intake was drastically reduced, and then he RAN!  that's right, cardio!  and he's a doctor.  not enough evidence?  watch the show "the biggest loser."  they lose tons of weight... by gaining muscle?  NO!  by dieting and doing CARDIOVASCULAR EXERCISE.  also i'd like to address a couple of things.. the guys in this book say cardio exercise is of NO BENEFIT!  wow.  a lot of scientists would disagree, saying that cardio is good for your heart.  but no!  these guys say YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR HEART HEALTH.  i'm serious! i'm not exaggerating their claims!  this is what these guys are saying!  where's their proof??  they also say the only reason a person can run longer and harder is because their leg muscles get strong, and their heart isn't actually getting stronger, it's some biological fluke where you just don't get out of breath!  well, maybe all those doctors and scientists know a little bit more than these guys about what's good for your heart.    i wish it was true that gaining muscle made you lose weight more than anyone, but do the research yourself instead of believing it just because these guys say so 
 I bought into a subscription of this magazine sight unseen.  That was a bad decision.  After having received two issues, I continue to be disappointed.  The quality of the art & design, and products displayed overall are dreadfully amateurish and in most cases incredibly tacky. I would be hard pressed to think that anyone in pursuit of help with romanticing their home would be inspired by this magazine.  
 Disney blew it this time.  No real fencing scenes, tried to hard to be funny.  Zero humor.  As a child I read this Tale with great joy, and I was whisked away to a time and place which provides the setting for this adventure.  Then there were the movies which were made well before my time, but reflected some very good renditions of the book.  Somehow I do not believe the producers of this movie had any idea about how to reproduce such an adventure.    Pity, once upon a time Disney was the king of Fairy Tales, and Adventure.  What has happened to that Disney movie making magic?  The magic is no longer there, and the actors, well I really wish there had been some effort put forth by the actors.  The acting was drab to say the least.  The costumes were the star of the movie, at least they seemed to have gotten that part right.  The film's settings and landscape were a pretty good dipiction as well.  This was something of a dark tale, and far too much of this movie took place in the daytime.  Disney needs help, any takers? 
 FOUR whole episodes... What is this, 1997?   Sony has no concept of how to release a decent DVD.  Look at how they recently treated the live action GB franchise with their crappy reissues and horrendous looking box art. They are completely clueless.  When the release was first announced, I was prepared to pick this up on street date... until I found out the specs.  Either send these properties over to your Classic Media division or auction them off to a more apt studio because save for the recent Pink Panther films and cartoons (which conveniently tie in to promote the new Steve Martin movie), your releases the past couple of years have been entirely insignificant 
 When I looked inside this book I was stunned and disappointed. No where in its description does it mention that it is of little use to those not teaching in a Christian/Bible/Sunday school. The ideas for moving bulletin board items away from the background are not new. The graphics are done in a style appealing to children but are useless to most teachers. Obviously, I did not read the reviews further down the page or I would never have bought the book 
 Peter Sellers as well as Peter O'Toole and all the beautiful women: Capucine, Romy Schneider, etc, make ot his movie an extraordinary satire of the 60's. Was really that world that mad? Of course! You couldn't stand life without a psychonalist. Thus, the film reflects precisey that. The lack of self-confidence, the incapacity of accepting the values of that decade, till -happy ending, of course- O'Toole and Schneider get married and lived happily everafter. And everybody has surpassed their personal crises. Good for the movie. The humour is just wonderful. I recommend it most enthusiasticall 
 I bought one of the custom tile #7's (loaded with options) from California and was able to use it for less than a year before it started to self-destruct. I tried to get it replaced under warranty for two more years, until they skipped to Mexico. Tiles just didn't fall off, they spalted. The fire box broke, etc. When it got too bad to use and look at, we had to throw it away . . . a $1500 mistake.  If there was a really good ceramic cooker out there, I would try it again. They cook like a dream 
 I have never been able to see what the big deal was about this band.  All of their records, in general, sound exactly the same, and this one is no exception.  Post-Velvets guitar/organ drones, lackadaisical vocals, blankly uninteresting non-lyrics (they could have recited their grocery lists and it would have been more interesting), and a dramatic lack of energy; all of Yo La Tengo's trademarks are fully represented here, and if you can stay awake through it, you're a better man/woman than I.  A surpassingly boring record, even from this usually very boring band.  If you've heard the Velvet Underground, Neu!, Stereolab's early records, and Sonic Youth, you've heard Yo La Tengo in total.  If you're a big enough fan of those named bands, YOU could probably write songs that sound like "Painful." But you would probably write better ones. Avoid this like the plague unless you suffer from insomnia 
 I would refer anyone who would take this author seriously to James Randi's comments on his behavior. He represents the modern version of the crystal ball reader and his claims should be eyed with an appropriate degree of skepticism. This would be a benign phenomenon but that his success depends on the suspension of reasoned thought on the part of those who grieve for their lost loved ones 
 I admire the way that dj yella nobely took the stance and stood up for tha E. But this album was a disapointment. Yella isn't a very good rapper and the beats were just too basic. I wish that he could have got somebody else to write the songs and all because the quality of this album just disapoints me 
 I bought the yellow version of this step stool - my grandma used to have one just like it, or so I thought.  This is not the step stool I was hoping for.  It's clunkier, cheaper, and not the same "shiny" vinyl that my grandma had.  The step stool mechanism on this new one is just cheap plastic that allows the steps to "slide" in and out.  I had a little bit of trouble putting it together.  Oh, and on the instructions, you're told that you'll have to periodically retighten the bolts!  What - is this thing going to come apart with use?!?!  Overall, a disappointment and not worth the amount of money I paid for it.  Nice idea, but I want the REAL thing, not some cheap imitation 
 If Tess is going to continue to write books like this, she should switch her publisher to Harlequin Romance, it will give the unsuspecting buyer a "heads up."  It is not possible to describe the many short falls of this rather long boring novel without giving the romantic subplots away, let just say that the ME does no pathology as she is way too busy whining about an unatainable romance and the detective does no detecting as she is totally wrapped up in her parent's pathetic lives.  There is a bit of a mystery bouncing around in the book, but it is hardly worth wading through all those pages.  Come on Tess, you can do better than this 
 I purchased this book because it was recommeneded to me. I started the book and quickly stopped because it was tough to read. I then went on to read other books such as "Adventure Capitalist" by Jim Rogers that involved world travel on the ground. When I came back to this book, I discovered what the problems were. Perhaps it's best if I quote other reviewer's here: Kaplan is "very well-grounded in historical and contextual reading" and "he is well-read". That's the problem. Kaplan spends most of his time telling us what other people think. He goes off on tangents and leaves me wondering what it is that Kaplan himself thinks. Another reviewer wrote "sometimes it is not quite the easiest read". It is tough reading even if you are familar with the places Kaplan is talking about. And finally, "IT IS NOT HIS BEST. THE MEANDERING, STOP AND GO, RABBIT TRAIL PROGRESS OF THE BOOK WAS A BIT DISTRACTING AND FRUSTRATING FOR ME" sums it up for me. So, if you found the fact that I quoted other people distracting then you'll understand what it is that I didn't like about Kaplan's book. I suggest "Adventure Capitalist" as an alternative 
 The authors talk about your "inner child," which should be a red flag to the discerning reader.  Dr. Young talks about writing a letter to people in your life that mistreated you, dwelling in a patient's childhood minutae, etc.  First of all, nobody really knows how much your childhood seals your fate.  Yes, some people have incredibly difficult childhoods, but not all of them spend their life being miserable.  And who knows how accurately people remember events from their childhood?  And even if you can precisely point to a defining moment in your childhood, what does that accomplish?  We should never forget Dr. Albert Ellis, the founder of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT).  {Dr. Ellis' REBT preceded Dr. Aaron Beck's Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) that this books is loosely based on}.    Dr. Ellis was trained as a psychoanalyst, in the tradition of Freud, but he discovered that having clients become aware of things they didn't want to be aware of didn't really accomplish very much.  It still took a lot of HARD WORK on the part of the patient and the therapist to make significant improvement.  This book may help you, but I wouldn't bet any money on that happening.   I think the authors are sadly mistaken in their beliefs about "schema therapy" for emotional issues.  Instead of reading this book, check out "Feeling Good" by David Burns, and "A New Guide to Rational Living" by Albert Ellis and Robert A. Harper.  They don't talk about "inner child" nonsense.  No matter  how you got where you are, that's where you are, and you have to start from there.  No need to hash out your childhood.  The best thing is to adopt the Stoic approach championed by Drs. Ellis, Burns and Beck 
 Ethan Canin is a great short story writer, but when it comes to novels, he misses the target.  His short stories are great because they are brief, and are told through actions and conversations, not sentimentality and excessive introspection.  Blue River, like For Kings and Planets, are undisciplined works, perhaps too ambitious, with overwrought language and too much filler material.  A much better story with the same theme appear in the Palace Thief, called Batorsag and Szerelem 
 I bought this book because I had read and enjoyed some of Phillipa Gregory's historical novels. This one did not fill the bill for me. As a supposedly independent-thinking woman of spirit, I found Julia to be incredibly naive. Love is not an emotion that any female could possibly feel after being raped - especially after suffering abuse since childhood at the hands of her brother / playmate / husband.   I found her  characters to be either psychotic or dazed by all that laudunam (sp) they took. After reading THE FAVORED CHILD, I have no desire to read the first or the third in this trilogy. 
 I would have given this book *five* stars, had it not been for the shoddy - literal translation from Italian to English.  Being an Italian speaker, I sometimes had to re-read certain sentences with my "Italian" hat on to discern the meaning.  This would have been an excellent book if the translation had been both literary and cultural but it is neiter.  This, unfortunatly, detracts from the book a great deal as some references are not explained to the english-reading audiance who may not be familiar with Italian history.  Since Italians use a great many words to describe something that would only take a few in English- the literal translation makes them read like run-ons and often leaves the reader lost at the end.  If you are able to overcome all these obstacles, the content of the book is enlightning and educational.  I learned that industrial olive-growing in Greece was implemented when they were under Venitian rule and that the fork, was originally a small spear that eventually became the four-pronged utensil that we now know with the development of newer, longer, slippery pasta shapes 
 I felt this book was to much like other ghost story collections and really embelished a great deal of facts 
 Unfortunately, this book is only going to help you if you're a fat nagging religious close minded wife who's let herself go.   For the modern woman with common sense (and who doesn't have her man beg her for sex, for instance) this book is completely useless. I can think of a few women who'd benefit from it (church ladies?), but most of the things on this book are common sense to a well educated wordly woman. I also found Shaunti Feldhahn's way of writing very anoying...at the beggining of the book, it feels like she goes on and on about respect forever. I get it, respect the man, there's no need to say it 30 times with different words.  It was definitly a waste of money.   
 In 'Gold Warriors' by Sterling and Peggy Seagrave claim that materials seized by the Japanese military from across Asia between 1895 and 1945 have been used to finance a range of ethically and morally questionable political activities with the United States government acting as the leader of this cabal.  These valuables range from cultural items through intellectual property, industrial materials and equipment and precious and semi-precious gemstones to massive quantities of gold and other metals. The Seagraves claim that much of the materials seized between 1942 and 1945 were secreted at 175 sites in the Philippines; this country being used as the transit station.  The authors go on to state that much of this treasure trove has been recovered by a loosely linked collection of groups including the US, Japanese and Phillipino governments, various crime cartels and treasure hunters. In the case of the US governemnt, this wealth was used to finance anti-communist and/or right-wing agenda groups.  When I considered how to rate this book, I was conflicted. As fiction, it is clearly worth a five star rating. As non-fiction, that is to say the truth, I have to give it two stars...and that's generous.  The problem is lack of documentation for many of the claims. Now, before the Seagraves or you say, "Check the CDs!" (the authors tell you repeatedly of the wealth of information that is on three CDs you can get from them...sort of like the hunt for the gold and other valuables in this story:  "The wealth is there, surely you must beleive me!")  I have to say, "I purchased this book on the assumption the story would be told with backing documentation attached."  Documentation is few and far between this work. Some other critques have cited mis-spellings of place names and technical inaccuracies related to volumes of gold in the world. To them, I want to add:  Battery Crockett on Corregidor - cited as a location where looted gold was hidden in the remains of a power room hit by a Japanese shell - was neither a mortar battery, nor was it damaged by a major explosion caused by the Japanese bombardment. The explosion happened at Battery Geary.   In addition, the site of Post Theater - where a small quantity of gold was hidden in a bomb crater that a treasure hunter was able to locate because he was able to find two aerial photos of the site that were taken minutes apart with one showing the crater and the second showing the crater having been filled - is also mis-identified as to location on Corregidor. For those who care, the Post Theater was on Middleside, close to the major set of enlisted barracks, not on Topside near MacArthur's so-called headquarters and the 'Mile-long Barracks'. In fact, while the Post Headquarters was at Topside, MacArthur's HQ was in Manila until he evacuated the city. Then it was in Malinta Tunnel, well below the surface of the island. In fact, it was his using the tunnel that resulted the troops calling him, 'Dugout Doug'.)  All this simply builds the case for not just shoddy research but a questionable truth about what is being said as a whole.  As I have not seen the CDs (BTW, I don't intend to pursue getting them) I don't know if they contain information that may provide proof for many of the statements contained in this book. You see, if they don't, we are compelled to believe second and third hand accounts of what deceased and/or unidentified individuals have claimed.  Or at least it is a statement that the authors claim was made. My concern is that validity is not automatically granted by placing a statement in quotations; an activity that occurs frequently in this book.  It is in that aspect that this book falls into what I call "heresay history," a circumatnce where the opinions of an author or authors are presented as documented evidence.  In fact, as I think about this story - which I'm sure contains any number of truths like Japanese looting and hiidng of valuables and killing of POWs - my overall impression is 'Gold Warriors' great similarity with other questionably documented stories such as Roswell, The Philadelphia Experiment, The Montauk Project or Project Phoenix, the Kennedy Assasination Conspiracies, etc. etc. etc.  But, it is a heck of an entertaining read on a long airplave flight 
 I guess we can thank the global population for making Rob Schneider a  leading actor by continually buying tickets to that Deuce Bigalow fiasco.  I could only sit through about thirty minutes of that before my head started to hurt and my eyes started to burn.  I guess I have sheer boredom or desperation to thank for actually watching this abysmal feature about a thief who finds a magical earring, which transforms him into a blonde teenager overnight.  This body transforming-opposite sex switcharoo has been done time and time again, but not this badly.  If the dwarf size Schneider makes you laugh because he looks like he's been on a narcotics binge for months on end, you might like this film.  I can cut the guy some slack because the script is so horrible that it would be hard for Lawrence Olivier to be convincing.    The majority of scenes intended to make you laugh are physical bits that aren't remotely funny.  Girls having pillow fights where Schneider overpowers them and sends them flying through the air with each blow (literally), the standard overweight character that dances sexy even though it's the most vile thing you've ever seen.  Schneider falling down bleachers, smashing his face against every seat, a cross dressing eight-year-old boy...  Adam Sandler has been stealing money for years because this same movie going public has made him a superstar.  He makes a cameo, talks so low you can't understand a word he's saying and wears quite possibly the worst wardrobe ever assembled by a costume designer.  Two things make this film at least worth watching if you're as mind numbingly bored and desperate as I was last night:  1)  Whoever the Foley Artist was for this film should never work again.  Pillows making contact, Schneider falling down, rear end slapping..it's all the same sound.  It's exactly like someone stood on a third story balcony and dropped a suitcase full of bowling balls onto the street below.  (2) Anna Faris...I can't decide whether I think she's really cute or if she's just a Plain Jane with large eyes...but when I'M thinking she's pretty cute, she's nice to look at.  
 Just like Ibnu Warraq or other writers who skewed the facts of Islam based on their assumptions; I cannot comprehend why in the world that I bought the book in the first place. I'm a muslim but never never in my entire life that I had been taught about Jews as potrayed in his book.Remember, I was taught of Islam by the so called orthodox scholar. And never in my mind that I should convert all Christians to Islam in the same way the author did; by downgrading the teaching of other religions.If us Muslim hate Christians or Jews so much, then I wonder why there is no single book by Islamic scholars that I come across which depict Christians or Jews as people that need to be wipeout from this world. The only books I come across are this kind of book which should be titled'Teaching of Islam From The Terrorists Perspectives'    Again, please don't generalize that all muslims are terrorists. Some wrongly taught Islamic sect may want to kill the author, but most of us muslims are loving people just like the Christians. There is nothing wrong with Islam as a religion, just the believers who wrongly define its true meanings.   Again, totally biased and inaccurate.  
 Last summer we bought two of these cruisers and both of them broke after only one month of normal use.  The water squirt function quit working after only a week.  My kids LOVED them, but for the price these cruisers are, they need to be built to last 
 This book may be written about a fascinating literary figure at an interesting time in our history, with a potentially atmospheric setting and an intriguing mystery to boot--but it all adds up to nothing when the prose is so bad. I listened to about half this book on tape, but found I just could not bear another minute of it. It was stilted, repetitive, and trite. The language used in dialog and at moments of high drama was just plain embarrassing. Some suggest that the author was trying to emulate the way people spoke in the 19th c, but I don't believe anyone in history would've been this ponderous or repetitive in everyday speech; if so, such conversations are best forgotten.  I love mysteries and historical fiction, but have read boilerplate novels in these genres which are far less agonizing and more entertaining to read. 
 The book is well-written.  Most parts of it I can agree with.  But there is a crucial mistake in Parson's message --- oneness likes to play separation.   I can say clearly that oneness does not play separation.  Duality/ego is simply a mistake/illusion caused by mind-evolution.  Saying that oneness plays separation is giving reality to this illusion.  Also, his message that we can not do anything still gives one a feeling that one is under the "mercy" of something, and this is clearly very dualistic.  Without ego, both doing and not doing are actions of oneness, to intentionally emphasizing not doing is a mistake.  There are many illuminating sentenses in this book, but be aware of the neo-advaitan trap.  In my life, it was understanding, especially of the process of ego-illusion-image helped me to come to oneness.  The one who is doing the understanding is still oneness.  There is no duality in doing and not doing.  At right this moment, you can chose to continue to read this review or to stop.  Of courses, you make choices in daily life.  If you really understand what is meant by "nond-duality", you will not make such statements such as "there is no choice".   
 I have never liked the character of Nefret.  I wish it had never been introduced to the Peabody series.  I hope the future books are better than this one 
 I too was required to read this book in the 6th grade.  I couldn't understand how this book could be an award then or now.  I'm a huge Eckert fan, but this story just doesn't cut the mustard.  For a better Eckert book, check out Johnny Logan 
 The first time i heard this band was when i stumbled upon their song "speakers push the air". I loved the song so much i decided to buy their album. Well, unfortunately i bought the wrong album and got Elan Vital instead of Good Health. The first song started off with some reggae beat which was cool with me. As I continue listening to the whole album, it didn't quite capture my attention as I had expected. It seemed too mellow in a way. Where was that "umph" that i heard in speakers push air? they have probably tried to evolve from their previous albums. Well, it didn't work out in this one.  
 Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12-in-1: Lexar and SanDisk. I decided to buy Lexar. I bought this reader to use mostly with Memory stick. I have 2 cards: 128 MB and 1 GB. I had no problem with 128 MB card.  But I could not insert My GIG card into this reader. It just did not go. I tried hard trying not to break the card - no success. It was a surprise for me. May be because my card was made not by Lexar - by SanDIsk...? I contacted Lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem. Any way I had to send it back and buy 12-in-1 SanDisk Reader.  
 Mr. Lomas & company takes another crack at the Hiram Matrix, among the trilogy of Hiram books he has written [The Hiram Key] and [The Book of Hiram]being the other two, this one is not as good as "The Book of Hiram" however it is much better than the "Hiram Key". I guess it comes down to opinion and conjecture with a dash of conspiracy, at best. Maybe Mr. Lomas and company would like to tackle another aspect of Freemasonry, perhaps with better results. Two recommendations on the subject would be "African Origins of Freemasonry" (2005) by Zachary Gremillion and "The Huevolution of Sacred Muur Science Past and Present" (2005) by Noble Timothy Myers-El 
 To me, this book was far too long for the plot. I became so bored just waiting for something to happen that I quit the book right in the middle; skimmed to the end to see who the killer was. The plot would have been a good one had she not drug it out so long 
 I WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT!  I WAS GIVEN THE SHAMPOO FOR CHRISTMAS WHICH WHEN WASHING MY HAIR MADE LITTLE TO NO SUDS.  WHEN TRYING TO COMB OUT MY HAIR AFTER SHAMPOOING IT WAS LIKE A BEES NEST AND I COULDN'T POSSIBLY GET A COMB THRU IT.  THATS WHEN I ORDERED THE CONDITIONER WHICH WAS LIKE CAKE BATTER AND COULDN'T GET IT TO COME OUT OF THE CONTAINER WITH REALLY QUEEZING IT WHICH MADE THE LETTERING COME OFF ON TO YOUR HANDS AND I FOUND SOME IN MY HAIR. I SQUEEZE AND BANG UNTIL I FINALLY GET A BIG LUMP COMING OUT.  I HAD WATCHED ALL OF JONATHAN'S REALITY SHOWS WHEN HE WAS WORKING ON CREATING HIS PRODUCTS AND COULDN'T WAIT TO TRY THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL NATURAL. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!  I RECENTLY SAW HIS SHOW BACK TV WHERE SOMEONE CALLS HIM UP AND SAYS THEY TRIED HIS PRODUCT AND HOW HAPPY THEY WERE AND JONATHAN GETS ALL CHOCKED UP.  I WAS SCREAMING AT THE TV I WAS SO UPSET.  THE PRODUCT WAS NOT CHEAP AND CAN'T BELIEVE I CAN'T USE SOMETHING I SPENT SO MUCH MONEY ON.  
 Imagine someone combining the scripts for Zardoz and Independence Day and letting a troupe of inebriated special education students control the acting and directing....then you would have Battlefield Earth.  It is so bad it actually has some entertainment value which elevates it to two stars.  You become mesmerized as you sit back and consider that this is the end result of John Travolta putting his heart and soul into a project.   Just awful. If Battlefield Earth and Pluto Nash were humans they would deserve to be executed 
 I got about 40% through it, but couldn't make myself finish this one, since I just couldn't care about the protagonist. Grace Archer is a control freak. That causes her to make foolish decisions. She has trouble accepting help when she's in over her head. If she were family, you'd stick by her. If she's only a character in a book, you might just close the book and say, "Enough!" I did 
 If you are looking for good book to read to young children at Thanksgiving, this isn't it.    Not only is it not a good read-aloud, it argues against the traditional telling of the Pilgrims story.  In fact, at the end of the book the author, Kate Waters,  talks about how the traditional turkey-pilgrim-indian autumn feast is a mythical occurrence.   She says that while historians don't know what `really' happened, it wasn't what the present day holiday conjures up in all of our collective memories.  Instead, what we should know is that European fishermen and traders brought plague that killed whole villages.   And that it was just a coincidence that there were any Native Americans at Plimouth (alternate spelling of Plymouth) on the day there was to be a harvest feast, an event that was, in fact,  rather a rare occurrence of celebration for the Pilgrams as they did not deem it appropriate celebrate *any* holidays, not even Easter and Christmas.  (ho-ho-ho)  Which brings us to the substance of the book when considered for older readers (older tweenies or teenagers perhaps).    It is an attractive book to look at.  There are pictures of re-enactors in a colonial setting, but  it basically centers around a time where all the houses are built and everybody is fat and happy.  No Mayflower.  No hardship.    And ironically, while the author argues that you won't find the `true' story of life in early colonial times in other books, you won't find it here either  because the author's own re-enactors - pilgrams and native americans alike-- are incredibly clean and tidy individuals.  Everyone in crisp linen and wool or deerskin.   Even the children!  LOL  Two Stars.  A terrible book for young children.  It might hold more interest for older children as the pictures are interesting.   See Amazon's "Search inside this book" feature to judge for yourself.  Example of text:  "I throw the ball but miss the stool broadly.  It lands near the feet of an Indian boy who is standing at the edge of the forest.  He throws the ball back to me.  I know him not but I give him greeting.  He answers back in his tongue.  I see him surveying our men at arms and the cleared field.  I run to tell my friend Bartle, but when we look back, the boy has disappeared into the forest.  I wonder why he watches us?   [Note:  My children and I suggest you take a look at  "The Pilgrim's First Thanksgiving" by Ann McGovern. 
 Mr. Haqqani has dubious credentials as he has served in a number of very corrupt governments in Pakistan's problematic history. Although I agree with some of his views overall he has vested interests that do not allow him to be a honest contributor to Pakisan tumultous history 
 I had the opportunity to examine this book.  As someone in the food industry I was disappointed by Food Chemical Safety.  Only one chapter deals specifically with the United States.  Food safety is food safety; but when you buy a book on the subject; you want one which is applicable to you.  The book is narrowly focussed on the U.K. food industry. Beyond the geographical location;  the book lacked depth.  Short paragraphs (which made for an impressive Table of Contents) provided no substance.   If you are reading about food chemical safety; you want information beyond a  short paragraph which assumes you know nothing to begin with.   As the book is written, I could see its only use as a text in a library for college or high school students with a paper to write 
 The book is slightly bigger than the manual that came with the camera, but most of the content are simply paraphrasing what is in the original manual.  i was looking forward to learning advanced skills or tricks that are not discussed in the camera manual, but i'm sorely disppointed, even the few sample pictures in the book are in black and white only.  i personally don't find the book useful.  
 I love vintage Andre Norton Science Fiction (also fantasy), especially her series such as The Time Traders, Solar Queen, and most of the previous Beast Master books.  But this book came as a big disappointment.  I thought the previous volume (Beast Master's Circus) was quite good, and enjoyed the new character Laris and her alien cat Prauo, who are the main characters in this new book.  However, this latest book soon degenerates into a number of teenage temper tantrums, and had me gritting my teeth instead of enjoying the book. The plot was interesting to begin with, but the juvenile personal interactions overshadowed everything else.  Possibly a (young) teenager would like this book, but I have other suggestions for Norton fans.  I've been reading Andre Norton since the 50's, and have over 80 of her hardcovers, dating as far back as 1944, so I have a lot to compare with, and this one I'd rate as one of the 3 worst of her books.  Since all three are fairly recent and were written with co-authors, I suspect that Ms. Norton did very little of the plotting and writing herself, and of course, she passed away almost a year before this book was published.  If you want some good, recent Norton, try the Time Traders and Solar Queen books co-authored with Sherwood Smith, or the "Mark of the Cat/Year of the Rat" pair, which was a total and delightful surprise to me--hearkening back to the vintage "Star Man's Son" in some spots 
 It was difficult to follow the instruction in the book, nearly impossible if you ask me. I have other books about massage that I found to be a lot better than this one. It could also benefit from new photos, preferable in color and clearly showing what people are doing. 
 We bought this product so that I could see my 6 month old son from the front seat.  But everytime I put the rear view mirror on the back window it would pop off and hit my son in the face.  The blinds don't stay up either. Their suctions don't stay if there is any moisture on your windows and when you shut your car door.  
 I picked up this book because I've read two other books by Anne Tyler that I greatly enjoyed, but I was disappointed by this one.  Maybe it was written before she really hit her stride as a writer.  While entertaining,  the book seemed somewhat empty.  I didn't find the characters' actions very  believable, and the "surprise" ending did not follow from  anything earlier in the book (as all really good surprise endings should).   The virtue of this book is that it can be quickly read in one evening.  I  do recommend Tyler's books "A Patchwork Planet" and "Earthly  Posessions.&quot 
 American Pastoral was repetitious to the Nth degree. I read the Human Stain a few years ago, and it was good.  But, in Pastoral, the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the Swede and a psychoanalyst, and between his daughter Merry and a psychoanalyst, but absent the psychoanalyst: Roth is our psychoanalyst. What he misses, however, is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control. The Swede never failed as a father; rather, he failed because he couldn't let go of his sense of responsibility for her 
 Maybe it's just the geek in me crying out for mercy, but I find a lot of the details of this book pretty far-fetched.  Plus, after we figured out whodunit and such, it just seemed to drag on forever.  I ended up skimming the last 30 pages or so just to get it over with.  I thought it was OK, but it definitely caters to a less technically savvy audience than I : 
 Examples are few and offer little explaination. I find this book so hard to follow.  On a good note: algorithms are clear 
 I bought this and shortly after I started using it the sides of my noise started swelling up and peeling. I didn't know what was going on and I stopped using it and it immediately went away.. as soon as I started wearing it again the swelling and pain came back. I am a person who doesn't break out very often and I can tolerate many products. I now have a permanent red mark on the right side of my nose and it hasn't faded yet. I tried to take it back to nordstrom and they wouldn't exchange it. This product sucks and as it was the only one I was using I know thats what caused the swelling.  
 I wonder if bad subtitles ruined the film but it was SO PAINFULLY SLOW I found it impossible to sit through. I wonder if it picked up but I couldn't tolerate it. It's also unbelievable past the normal suspension of disbelief. OK there's one guy with deep thoughts but everyone else has deep thoughts and/or is a maniac? Can't anyone have a blank mind like Homer Simpson 
 Extremely difficult to dig through the excessive examples in order to find the relevant theorems and results. Because of this, the problems at the end of each chapter become exercises in tedium, as more time is spent searching for the necessary theorems in the text than in actually working out the solution.   I do not recommend 
 I was VERY disappointed with this gem-care book.  It has nice pictures, but contains very little information about gem-care that isn't obvious already.  The book does not address any of the more unusual gems and stones either.  Do not buy this book!  It's a waste of [money] 
 One would have to be a glutton for punishment to sit through this many Oliver Stone movies in a row.  But, I see Stone is artfully packaging himself these days now that he has nothing new to offer, unless you count his homage to Fidel Castro.  The only movies worth watching are his early movies, Salvador and Platoon, which for some reason didn't make the cut. Instead, you have the insufferable Born on the Fourth July and his conspiracy theories on the death of JFK, with a whole lot of filler in between 
 After reading Natalie Angiers' book, "Woman: An Intimate  Geography", this book left something to be desired.  As a primer for  women who are over 35 and either want to be or are pregnant, it was not  bad, however, for a woman who is over 35 and wants to be pregnant and has  read a good deal about her body and her possibilities, this book was sort  of more the Reader's Digest variety.  This book might well serve as a  resource for all the different tests an older mother can have to ensure  fetal health.  It also however, stressed a little too much on all the  various reasons that older women have a higher risk of  conceiving/delivering unhealthy babies.   Once I had finished it I had a  hard time convincing myself that it was 'going to be ok' to conceive at 37  and deliver a health child to term - not the sort of feeling one wants at  37 before her first child.  In any case, the key to understanding the point  of reference for this book was the fact that the author was a doctor (hence  all those tests) and had had her first child at 41 
 Philip Jenkins has passed off a supposed academic book with blatant lies. Without exposing myself to legal action, I find his use of clergy sex abuse as a travesty for the survivors of pedophiles. This piece of fiction is not  a critical examinationof objecctive academia. I am a 30 year survivor of a  priest who has not spent a day in jail and was bailed out under the  discipline of a cowardly Bishop. I feel very sorry for the true priests and  Christians. My book will be coming out shortly and will cause controversy.  I seek no money but only the truth. For those intersted in my story, I can  be reched at my email. I may sound bitter, but we have thousands of these  pedophiles. Yes, the media may have blown it out of proportion but I think  they are just reporting another holocaust 
 The only explanation is that James Paterson churned this dog out to make a buck. I've read a number of James Patterson books and while I'm not a hard core fan, I've enjoyed most of them. I know this will outrage some Patterson readers but I'm not much of a fan of Alex Cross who frankly I find boring as hell.   As mediocre as Patterson often is as an author, readers should beware, London Bridges is especially bad. The novel reads like an abridgement, moving at a frantic pace without ever generating any suspense. The premise is ridiculous - super criminals with silly names join forces to blackmail world leaders (sounds like the plot for an Austin Powers movie - without any of the humour).   Patterson is not remotely qualified to enter the international terrorist thriller market. An author who churns out 3 or 4 novels a year doesn't have time to do the kind of research that is needed to produce a plausible terrorist thriller.   The twists at the end - "he's the wolf - no, he's the wolf - no, she's the wolf - no...." by the end, I just didn't care.   James Patterson has written some decent crime novels but his fans should beware. Quantity, not quality seems to be Patterson's priority these days. London Bridges is a mess from beginning to end. 
 I'd give Sony an F for allowing this product out the door. My Sony regular memory stick always worked fine in my Toshiba Satellite P25 with built in memorystick slot.  Now, I used two of these Magic Gate Sticks to document an overseas trip and I'm stuck because the notebook cannot read the Magic Gate format. I'd avoid anything that says magic Gate.  
 Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry, by Mildred Taylor was a very disappointing book. There is no particular story; the book starts rising action here and there and down again here and there. There is no specific climax. Basically, it's like there's no story. What I also hated about this book was the ending and the fact that there was no moral in the story. The book was full of cliches from every chaper by chaper. Each chapter was too long( this is not a dumb complaint). Instead of just starting a new chapter, Taylor just skips a line to basically start a new chapter. I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense to you.   Like any novels that have to do with early 40-50s racism, in my opinion, there should ALWAYS be a moral,  stating that racism is wrong and people could just get along regardless of their skin color. This book had no moral. The ending was an ending wrapping up what was only a minor part of the story. I see a lot of positive reviews around here so maybe I am the only one who dislikes the book. But regardless of the reviews, I highly DONT recommend this book to any reader. 
 Beware!  This CD is only the background music from the movie, none of the good songs or even vocal overlays.  It is a supreme disapointment 
 Sorry to say this but this booklet is very superficial and incomplete and not always correct.  Its 'all-encompassing' title is misleading, as it only lists a snippet of the thousands of old magazine titles that were published.   The titles mentioned have no description, like what publishers published each magazine, what the content is focusing on, for what market/customer the magazine was meant, what happened with the magazine (sold/discontinued). No frequency nor numbers of copies issued are mentioned.  The only information that is mentioned for each title is: - title (not always what changes of title) - years (but incomplete) - price ranges (but usually too modest, on the low side, so inaccurate).   What do I mean by the problem with the mentioned prices? An example illustrates it best:  Harper's Weekly journals from 1866-1899 have been known to fetch much higher prices than the stated $6-12 (well over $50), sometimes because of engravings by Frederic Remington or of Winslow Homer being in them, sometimes just because of important historical events first being mentioned in those issues.   There is no mention on where and when these prices where realized, nor for what condition of magazine the price was paid (all this influences the price enormously).  Some cover images have been added, but only in b/w and randomly, so without method.  Conclusion: One can do much better just by browsing on the Internet 
 This was my first time reading Kellerman and I'm not sure if I'd ever pick up another book by him.  
 The Unbearable Lightness of Being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason: the point of Kundera's writing is not his plot - or even his characters - but his style.  For instances, his endless digressions about history, politics, and philosophy.  For the movie, we are left with nothing but plot and character.  OK, what is one to do?  That in itself wouldn't be so bad if I didn't watch the film with the constant thought: I could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie.  This is a SLOW film.  It takes an hour-and-a-half story and takes three hours to tell it.  I can't recommend the film 
 I am not saying dont buy this one. But beware that this is a only 128 pg book and all of the foldings and designs are basic. I believe a good graphic designer can create the same die-cuts and designs in a very short time. No trade secrets or big creativity involved 
 Michael Savage is obviously a very angry man. Some of the things that make him angry are Kwanzaa ("one more gimmick to stir up racial hatred in this country"), the "wrong kind" of immigrants, perverts, the people of "Turd World" countries (many of whom wear "dirty night shirts", apparently). He thinks it's Hillary Clinton's fault that young boys are prescribed Ritalin for displaying "symptoms of masculinity."   It is difficult to imagine that the author can maintain in normal life the intensity of indignation he manifests in this book and presumably in his radio broadcasts without suffering serious medical consequences. To some degree, it has to be an act. As such, it seems to be a cynical way to make a living: praying on and inflaming his audience's insecurities in order to deliver them to his sponsors.  As I get older, I find anger to be a less and less attractive option. You don't feel good when you're angry, the consequences of the things you do while you're angry rarely turn out to be good. That's probably why most spiritual teachers advise against it. If this point of view is enough to define me as a liberal, so be it. I prefer to think things through and listen to opposing points of view. That's why I picked up this book in the first place. Unfortunately, there's not much here of any substance of interest to anyone but those true believers who prefer their invective unleavened with facts, and perhaps a clinical psychology student or two looking for a subject for their theses.  For some odd reason, the author reminds me of the character Dan Preston in Wayne's World 2.   Del Preston: Alright, ladies and gentlemen. It takes two people to run a concert: one back stage, and one out front. One man alone cannot do this. Wayne, you will run the backstage team. Milton, you are my liaison between Wayne's backstage team and Garth's front-stage team which includes myself in the booth. To the left and right of the stage are machine-gun pillboxes, M-60 Browning. Now these babies tend to heat up so shoot in 3 second bursts. In the event of capture I will personally distribute these cyanide capsules to be placed under the tongue like so.   [Places a capsule in his mouth]   Del Preston: Any questions?   Garth: Yes, I have a question. When did you turn into a nutbar? 
 I'd give this movie a negative star if I could.  AVOID this movie. It's terrible. Not one positive thing could be said about this movie 
 Wonderful example of how undisciplined, muddled thinking can create unsound arguments, based on invalid premises, that yield conclusions that will confirm one's biases.  Perhaps in a follow-up book, the author will "prove" that the world is flat.  An early mistake:   She declares that it is (mostly) false that stockholders fund major public corporations, noting that shares trade in secondary markets.  Accordingly, she draws the conclusion that there is no reason that corporations should maximize the interests of stockholders and minimize the interests of shareholders, and that it would be just as appropriate to put the interests of employees first.  In fact, clear economic thinking reveals that successful corporations do make the interests of employees a high priority, because a corporation with unhappy employees has difficulty retaining employees, which makes for an unsuccessful company.  Further, when a corporation raises capital, it often does so by means of a public offering of securities, which is really an agreement between the corporation and the stockholders where the stockholders give the corporation money in exchange for the right to an ownership interest in the corporation.  Whether the shares stay in the hands of the original purchaser or whether the purchaser sells them in secondary markets is not germain; whoever holds the shares holds the right to the ownership interest, which may yield value through appreciation, sale or dividends.  If you think her argument that it would be equally appropriate for a corporation to maximize payments to employees and minimize the interests of stockholders, just try this little exercise:  Form a coproration and attempt to raise capital to run the corporation (including to pay employees).  Then tell the potential investors of your plan to minimize value to stockholders.  Then count how many of these potential investors actually invest their money in your corporation.  (Hint:  if you guessed more than zero, you're too high. 
 I've read all of Flynn's books. In fact, I just picked up Act of Treason. As I'm reading it, I'm reminded of how disgusted I was with his last book, Consent to Kill, only giving him the benefit of the doubt on this one.  Without giving away the ending, Consent to Kill is but an amateur attempt to keep a tired saga alive for the sake of a bestselling serial--that being the Mitch Rapp saga. To any real fiction writer, what Flynn resorts to in the book, in terms of Mitch's personal relationship, is quite sad; it's simply designed to keep Mitch "hungry" and "emotionally tattered" so as to allow Flynn to continue cashing in on the only story he's capable of writing.  The book started out to be intriguing, although I did ask myself how Flynn intended to keep Mitch going with the seeming direction our star spy was headed via the last novel. But, the story read like a tenth grader wrote it, a tired cliche designed for the sole sake of keeping Mitch Rapp and his million-dollar franchise chugging along.  By far the worst story Flynn has written to date. Skip this one 
 I have been through a year and a half of pastoral counseling for a mental disorder as well as secular psychotherapy.  I thought buying this book would give me a spiritual perspective on how to deal with my mental disorder but instead it scared me.  Anderson talks about people with mental disorders as possessed by demons.  In his chapter on how to treat your disorder he has the reader recite prayers that deal with evil spirits and demonic possessions.  He also believes that relaxation practices such as yoga are evil.  I am a very spiritual person and get my strength from God, but not in this way.  I do not believe that I am possessed by demons or under the influence of demons and I certainly do not want to think of my mental disorder as being that way.  This is a book I would never want to read again, and wished I had never purchased 
 I don't know what book the other reviewers read but it certainly wasn't this book. About half-way through the book I closed it, put it back in it's packaging, and asked amazon for my money back...It was just that bad. I don't call myself a singles expert, but I have read plenty of books on the single experience, and this, by far was a joke. The author seemed to have a problem with staying on the subject. She'd begin with a really great point then drift into a story about her friends or some wierd experience she had. It left me literally dazed and confused. I just didn't get it. How did the story relate to the point she was trying to make? At any rate, this book proves the saying once again, never judge a book by it's cover. The cover of this book has some really good key points to draw you in. The inside, however, is a hollow catastrophe. 
 Three times I picked up this book and started it. Three times I put it down and read something else instead. Since I let myself run out of reading material I picked this up again. It is truly one of the worst Iris Johansen books ever written. As the previous reviewer said "It's far fetched and a lot of drivel." After reading the first hundred pages or so I finally flipped to the last chapter and read through that, skipping entire paragraphs. This is really a no brainer, no suspense, most repetitive book I have ever tried to read. I give it a MINUS 5 star rating. I have purchased my last Iris Johansen novel. Save your money. Buy Stuart Woods, James Patterson or Lisa Gardener. 
 Shrewish. Prude. Judgemental. Blathery. Catty. Disjointed.   What a shame. There's a lot to be said about female sexuality and feminism in general, but Levy doesn't bother with the core of any it. Instead, she spends her time interviewing the flightiest Spring Breakers she can find, criticizing successful women for acting manish, and obsessing about fringe cultural fads.  I was disappointed to see so many prejudices in Levy. She is one of the worst FCPs I've read. And a stick in the mud, to boot 
 I have never returned a book to a bookstore until I purchased this one. I truly hope Lauren is experiencing health and happiness but this was one of the most boring reads upon which I have ever embarked 
 If I was going to be locked up for 10 years and they let me choose just one book to take with me I'd grab Siddhartha. So when I read the reviews of Narcissus&Goldmund I couldn't wait. Now I find it hard to believe the same person wrote both books. N&G is lacking in all respects and there is no ending - throughout the book there is a poorly defined attempt to create or illuminate a conflict (which is sloppy) and there is no resolution at the end. What an empty book. If this is Hesse's work then I wonder whom he stole Siddhartha from.   
 I got this book after I married the son of one of the climbers killed on K2 in 1986 because I was interested and curious about his father.  This was a waste of my money.  Eiger Dreams was much more informative 
 I have always eagerly awaited each Clive Cussler novel and this was no exception.  The story is classic Clive Cussler and by itself is fascinating, however, the writing is boring.  To me, Clive Cussler did not write the book, his son did.  The women "gush" and the men "snarl".  It was so predictible!  I even knew who the person was who was in the boat before they were even rescued.  I suprised myself when right in the middle of the rocket launch, I didn't even care if I finished the book.  Here's hoping the writing will improve in the next book 
 I have read many books relating to ads & advertising and found this one to contain no value, no guidance, no tips and NO SECRETS.   Many old tales and short quotes that offered no insight to modern day marketing and advertising. There are many good books out there, unfortunately for me and my pocketbook this is not one of them 
 So the truth was stated finally by William Dembski in this popular account explaining the origins and principles of "Intelligent Design"; in which he admits that there is  indeed a religious link to what he claims is primarily a scientific hypothesis (But a scientific hypothesis proposed originally by William Paley hundreds of years ago, which was rejected soundly by leading scientists afterwards.). There is nothing in this book which explains how science works, by careful observation and rigorous testing of ideas (hypotheses). Those ideas which are accepted through this rigorous scientific method are either incorporated within longstanding scientific theories, or may themselves be the incipient idea(s) of a new scientific theory which replaces an outmoded one (Most notably, in exactly the same manner that Einstein's Theory of General Relativy and the Theory of Quantum Mechanics replaced Newton's theories of physics, known now as classical mechanics; the latter are now subsumed within the two 20th Century theories forming the core of modern physics.). Dembski clearly doesn't understand how modern science works; he pretends to have such understanding via sloppy logic and intellectually dishonest statements which occur frequently throughout this book.  Intelligent Design is not scientific since it does not adhere to any of the long-established tenets about science itself (Intelligent Design has been judged correctly as the latest flavor of creationism enjoying some popularity amongst fundamentalist Protestant Christians; one notable biologist has referred to it as "reborn creationism".). It can not be tested, simply because it does not generate any testable hypotheses. Moreover, despite claims to the contrary, I have yet to see any peer-reviewed articles testing Intelligent Design; instead, every single book and article published in praise of this idea is merely an attack on the Modern Synthesis Theory of Evolution; this evolutionary theory is itself the central underlying theory for contemporary biology as much as General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics are for contemporary physics (Any current scientific controversies about the Modern Synthesis are related to understanding the tempo and mode of evolution as seen from the fossil record and the relative importance of random genetic drift as the primary means of causing evolutionary change; they, themselves, do not mean that the Modern Synthesis is in trouble as the successful unifying theory it has been for nearly a century in explaining biological phenomena.). And Intelligent Design is not a new idea at odds with mainstream science, but rather the latest incarnation of an idea dating from the 17th Century regarding a "Great Chain of Being" which was subsequently tested - and rejected - by Enlightenment and later scientists, most notably naturalists, leading up to of course Darwin and Wallace, who almost simultaneously came up with the Theory of Evolution via Natural Selection (The Modern Synthesis Theory is its direct descendant, and includes its principles, as well as evidence from biological sciences as diverse as genetics, molecular biology and developmental biology, which were unknown to both Darwin and Wallace.).   The arguments presented by Dembski are not only intellectually dishonest, but now, irrelevant, as determined by Republican Federal Judge John Jones in his landmark, historic decision for the Kitzmiller vs. Dover Board of Education trial; Jones concluded that intelligent design is a religious doctrine masquerading as science (His decision is posted online at: htttp://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/all_legal/2005-12-20_kitzmiller_decision.pdf). Furthermore, thoughtful, reasonable conservatives like Charles Krauthammer and George Will have written lucid, brilliant columns praising the theory of evolution via natural selection, and condemning intelligent design for being an unscientific, religious doctrine.   There are other, more important - and intellectually sound - books available on the so-called "creation vs. evolution" controversy, which I regard as more worthy than any of Dembski's self-serving defenses of Intelligent Design. Philosopher Robert Pennock's "Tower of Babel" is a splendid historical overview and philosophical deconstruction of creationism, including the best written rebuke of "Intelligent Design" which I've come across (He also covers Dembski's "explanatory filter", and demolishes it too from a philosophical perspective.). Philip Kitcher, another philosopher, published "Abusing Science: The Case Against Creationism" back in the early 1980s, but his arguments are still quite valid today. My friend Ken Miller's "Finding Darwin's God" has an eloquent critique of Intelligent Design, focusing on Michael Behe's mousetrap model of irreducible complexity which claims to bestow validity on Intelligent Design. Distinguished American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) invertebrate paleobiologist Niles Eldredge offers yet another brilliant critique of Intelligent Design in his book "Darwin: Discovering the Tree of Life", the elegant companion volume to the AMNH Darwin exhibition which he curated, soon to embark on a tour taking it to many of North America's and Great Britain's finest science museums. And last, but not least, Eugenie Scott, Executive Director, National Center for Science Education (www.ncseweb.org), has written a fine textbook on this issue, "Evolution vs. Creationism". All of these books are more desirable than Dembski's "Intelligent Design:The Bridge Between Science & Theology". Otherwise, if you insist on purchasing this book, then perhaps you might choose to acquire instead a splendid text devoted to Klingon cosmology (Neither Klingon cosmology nor "Intelligent Design" can be regarded as scientific, since both depend on faith, not reason, to validate their principles.). 
 Normally a huge Shannon Drake fan - this book dragged on.  Contrary to another reviewer I didn't start to enjoy the book until some familiar characters came back into play.  The main charcaters in this book did not have enough to carry this story on their own.  This was a big let down 
 I like this author, but this story falls apart under the weight of a not too well thought out mystery. Plus the characters are so diverse it seems impossible that they would be in the same story, and have no conflict 
 I'd read good reviews about this book, but I found it very disappointing.  I didn't find the black and white particularly advantageous to the book or the story.  Dull is the word that comes  to mind for the story itself.  The cover is the best part of the book--the cat is cute.  I purchased this for a gift but now I'm sorry that I relied on reviews before the purchase.  If I'd seen the actual book and read the story, I would never have bought it 
 With no index and no maps, it's hard to find information in this book.  Consequently, it's a waste of money 
 I read Min's Empress Orchid earlier this year and I adored that novel, so I decided to give Becoming Madame Mao a shot. I wish I hadn't. It took me forever to read this novel because it was so boring. Not only was it dull, but Min used a multi-voiced narration that was confusing and unnecessary. I would have enjoyed the story much more if it had just been from Madame Mao's point of view. The constant changing, every other paragraph, to a different voice was jarring and really made me dislike this work. It had potential to be such an excellent novel but it completely fell flat 
 The author of this book was obviously not applying "emotional intelligence" principles when writing this book.  The points were all there and really proved why emtional intelligence is important, but it was just not done in a good manner.  I do not typically shy away from long books, but this one was impossible.  It was assigned to me and about 30 other people in my organization (we were to discuss and present ideas found inside the book), and can I tell you that no one finished it because of repetitious and dreadful writing?  Just know that to be successful, you HAVE to exhibit emotional intelligence and be a intuitive, kind and generally good person to work with. If you don't believe me, save yourself the time/energy and buy the Cliffs notes 
 I went back to read this book and follow some sources and was surprised of what I found. I compared it to another book being sold here on Amazon, here is what I found. Now that the KGB has exposed their own double dealing in  putting out admitted false facts to under mine American freedoms and  society, I think Oliver Stone owes us an explanation! I mean, I guess he  never thought the Soviet Union would fall and files would get out showing  why and where false rumors were placed to attack our institutions'  creditability, did he? Well, in another book listed on this forum,  "The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret  History of the KGB" by Christopher Andrew, Vasili Mitrokhin has done  just that with verified, factual, papers taken from the KGB by KGB. All of  sudden KGB Agents working in America are coming out being exposed for the  first time. Oliver Stone fell for much of these rumors when making JFK as  shown by his own sources in this book. I think his reputation,  creditability and trustworthiness should not only be questioned but avoided  for incompetence, to say the least! Why would anyone want to promote  Communistic rumors about JFK's death in America. Oliver Stone did, but who  cares why! "The Sword and Shield" is written by a History Scholar  of the highest credentials while this book is written by a drunk driver,  that is all that needs to be said. I wonder if the films of  "Nixon" and we already know that Stone changed "On The  Fourth Of July" from what happened at the Democratic Convention to the  Republican Convention which was a total faslehood in an alleged biography.  It seems most of Stone's films are based on similar shoddy work by a  storyteller claiming he filmed history. Based on this book and knowing the  other book Oliver Stone should be ashamed of himself. After reading both  books I can only say, Oliver's last name is about what his life and  perceptions of life are all about, being STONE blind whne making reality 
 This magazine just dares people to pick the most boring, pretentious, or ostentatious feature within any given issue. "Town & Country" is an extremely old money venture, and while it does have some good and useful articles (and lovely advertisements for things that virtually nobody can afford,) much of the magazine is essentially centered on a very elitist worldview that grows very tiresome rather quickly.   "Town & Country" was initially recommended to me because of ostensibly good coverage of travel and architecture, two areas I have great interest in. As an applicable aside, when I read a list of tips in the offshoot "Town & Country Travel" publication on ways to ease the stress of long range flights, I realized there was a reality check due when one of the first tips was to always fly in first class, ignoring the fact that the vast majority of readers would rather buy a car with what a typical first class ticket to Europe or Asia costs.  As I mentioned, there are some good articles, and there are occasionally better and more useful offshoot publications like "Town & Country Travel" that are eminently more readable (although they still insist on advertising things like seven million dollar vacation homes on the coast, etc.) I will say that the photography is always good, and you can believe that if it appears here that it is the finest and most fashionable available: Hyacinth Bucket would, no doubt, like to be seen reading this magazine.   Despite having occasionally worthwhile features, I find "Town & Country" to be excessively pompous, therefore I recommend finding another publication focused on whatever area of interest you have, whether it is fashion, society, or travel. 
 I enjoyed Separation Sunday tremendously, an original (although not for everyone) album full of hard rocking music and raucous lyrics to match.  As a thitrysomething, I found the lyrics on Sep. Sun. to be a clever look at the party scene and the passage of time, with both the highs and lows of growing out of the mayhem and into adulthood, or reaching your own "resurrection".  This new album (Boys and Girls) is much more drab, with less of an in-your-face delivery of fairly lame lines that I would be emarrased to listen to if I were older than 20.  These are juvenile songs which sound aimed at the MTV generation, with cheesy lines and hooks.  I had thought this band was the real deal, and had argued as such, but after hearing this it is clear they are a bunch of posers. 
 As I read this "mystery", I wondered many times if Sue Henry really wrote this. It seemed like more of a travel guide for Taos than a mystery.  I found it a struggle to get through this one even though I have read and enjoyed all her Alaska mysteries and the first Maxie and Stretch.  The actual mystery didn't start until about half way through and there wasn't much time spent on it until the surprise quickie ending which wrapped it all up.  I hope the next one is better 
 I really wanted to love this book. It's beautifully designed with gorgeous photographs, inspiring poses, and lofty prose. My wife and I pored over it's pages with anticipation, but when we attempted the positions, we were frustrated by scanty instructions, repetition, and fluff. Both of us are experienced in yoga, though not advanced, and most of the poses were either too tame or too difficult.  The book looks nice on the coffee table, but we're still looking for a good book on partner yoga 
 This book includes a number of random multiple choice questions.  In fact, that is all it includes.  There is no feedback as to why 'answer A' is the correct choice.  The information is outdated and uses obsolete wording. Took the test, passed with flying colors but it wasn't because of this book! Learned more from one of the CLEP recommended websites than the questions included in the text.  If Amazon had a Zero Star rating, this book would get it from me 
 Yeah, i bought this CD because i heard she is one of the better Drum N' Bass DJs....and she's really damn cute.  Problem is...this CD isn't very good at all.  Trying to go too main stream popish, some of the lyrics are laughable, there isn't a single song on this CD that would make it into one of my sets.  I'm sure she's a very good DJ, but someone led her down the wrong road this time 
 If you're looking for a novel with accurate historical reference, this is not it. Not only does he claim George Custer was killed in the Civil War, he places Lee's surrender at Monocacy Church, Maryland on August 31, 1863 (something I'll bet would have been welcome news to those that fought until 1865). The book is riddled with mistakes and omissions. Not what you would expect from a former Speaker of the House and a professor of history 
 This was given to us about last christmas to replace our old one... not worth it... a couple months into our ownership of this item, it stopped working properly. The right burner remains on at all times - we have to actually unplug it when not in use because even though the dial is turned all the way down it is very very hot when it is plugged in and turned off. So the right burner remains on hi all the time, and the left burner is either lo or hi, there is no concept of temperature control with this device... if the knob is a centimeter below medium on the left burner then the heat will be very low too low to cook most things... if it's a centimeter above medium it's hot - if you want medium heat to work, good luck. It worked ok until it broke, however it was never especially powerful. I can't even tolerate trying to cook with it anymore, I just go to the apartment downstairs and cook on my boyfriend's mom's gas stove for nice even heating. But a ministove that they are dubbing 'professional' should not be breaking after like, three months 
 I went into this film not expecting a lot other than a dirty gross out comedy.  It had plenty of raunch, but no laughs.  The jokes just didn't hit the mark at all.  The story itself is so recycled as well.  I mean the rich evil frat against the outcast frat that just needs someone to pull them together.  The first Van Wilder wasn't great, but it at least had some moments and a little heart.  I would avoid this one 
 As a musician who's dealt w/ opening many CD packages for many years, let me save you some money.  You don't need a special tool to open CDs.  Just run the bottom edge of the CD against any solid, rough surface (like a sidewalk or concrete wall) a couple of times.  The plastic wrapping will break up easy as pie, allowing you to take it off effortlessly.    Getting that pesky sticker that seals the top of the CD off is easy, too.  Again, no tools required.  You'll notice that the CD cover is "hinged" at the top & bottom in such a way that you can easily slide the front cover off the back.  It just pops in & out, held in place by a little bump on one piece that fits in a hole in the other.   Gently pull the front cover out of its sockets at the top & bottom, then bend the whole thing back, toward the top of the CD case where the sticker is affixed, so that the sticker becomes straightened out.  This will let you easily pull off the sticker in one piece.  (Try peeling the front cover off the sticker, rather than vice versa.)  And you're done!  All you have to do now is just pop the front cover back into its hinges and enjoy.   The whole process takes under a minute, and you'll still have the money in your pocket that you didn't spend on an iffy CD opening tool, to buy another CD with 
 OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story.  The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters.  The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!?  Peter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics 
 Two people recommended Karen Kingsbury to me as an author.  So I checked "Forgiven" out of the library.  I found it hard to finish.  I ended up skimming through the last half.  The dialogue was uninspiring to say the least: "Hey, how are ya?" "Hey, you doing okay?" "think I'll go hang out with so-and so", etc.   There seemed to be too many characters: the only difference in most of them is that some were "Baxters" and some weren't.  I couldn't feel sympathy for any of them because they weren't developed by the author.  She calls Katy "beautiful" but doesn't really describe her.  Peculiarities, mannerisms and personality traits of any of these people are not really fleshed out to enable the reader to connect.  The same applies to the physical settings in which the story takes place.  There is no description of the church where the children practice, or the countryside (except a nature trail when it rained) or anything else that would add a realistic "recognition" dimension to the story. Rather, the author depends on up to date technology,(her characters spend a lot of time flipping open their cell phones, clicking their computer mice, etc.) current buzzwords, movies, plays (like mentioning the musical "Wicked") and world situations to give her story "authenticity".    Katy spent an inordinate amount of time practicing her little play with the children - to the point of yawning repetition..  ( And by the way, I wondered why she felt so "called of God" to do plays like "Annie". Harmless little piece of course, but what's so spiritual about it?)  Then, in the end, the "movie star" goes back to his Hollywood world, even after his life-changing "commitment", and Katy continues her "sacred calling" of directing her little theatre.  I've read too many "Christian" novels like this: with colorless characters, plodding dialogue and contrived situations that are supposed to bring a lump to the reader's throat.  This is just another one of them 
 This slim volume of the lives and stories of Amish women is a pleasant work. It is a small collection of interviews and anecdotes of Amish women.  The book is a simple, cleanly written work, giving the reader a taste of  what life is like for Amish women. It is, however, just that: a taste.  There is no depth to this book. It almost seems as if it were a work  published by a vanity press operation. It is more like a book one would  write and then have printed up in order to give it to friends and family.  There is really not too much to it, and it has a certain affectation about  it. It piques one's interest but does not satisfy an appetite. It is too  bad, because the author herself was raised in an Amish household.  Obviously, this gained her entree into this interesting, though narrow  world. It is unfortunate that she was not more insightful in terms of her  material 
 This is the biggest joke on the planet. No doubt, it is scary, but c'mon people. I guess it's to scare the sh*t out of you. My comment has to be the first serious review that has been made for this item.  Think about it . . . the toilet. One of the best places for germs. And you want to attach some rubber device to it. I'll do you one better, and you'll get just as good a laugh from it. (Also, it'll be a lot cheaper) Go buy a roll of Saran-Wrap. Cling it tightly to the top of the toilet bowl. Wait and watch as your guest visit the bathroom to use it. I don't think no one will die from this type of trick 
 I think Jenny McCarthy is pretty funny, but not in this DOA stinker. Poorly shot and with a terrible script, this movie is the equivalent to watching paint dry...BORING. I hope she fares better in Scary Movie 3 
 I RENTED THIS TO WATCH WITH MY SON.  WE BOTH KNOW IT'S GARBAGE.  ANY WAY YOU LOOK AT IT.  PRINCE... WHY DID YOU LET YOUR TUNES BE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CORNBALL STUFF?  STRAIGHT GARBAGE.  READ A BOOK OR GO TO THE PARK WITH YOUR KIDS INSTEAD.  AS FOR THE ADULTS...  IF HAPPY FEET REALLY WOKE UP OR ASSISTED YOUR REALITY WITH IT'S "MESSAGE"...  I DON'T EVEN NEED TO SPEAK ON THAT...  DO YOUR THING.      
 I expected more from Wayne Wescott, Ph.D., who is often quoted by fitness magazines.  His name is well-known in the area of health and fitness research.  The book did not address sodium intake or give any recommendations for daily fat intake.  Caffeine was also not addressed.  It seems like these areas would be covered to some extent, given the book is about reducing cellulite.  The weight-training program did not advocate changing one's routine every 6 or 8 weeks to avoid plateaus.  I was excited to buy this book, but very disappointed at the lack of thoroughness on the part of the authors.  It just didn't seem to cover everything it should have, leaving this reader with many unanswered questions 
 Two previous reviews, "World-class hype - ordinary book", and "Good Concept, Amatuerish Writing" sum up the situation well.  None of the characters are complete, and we learn nothing of the character's "internals".  They simply move about, do things, and talk to each other while the author blandly describes their surroundings.  The book reads like a screenplay (and perhaps that's what it is).  There's not much I can add to those two reviews, but I wanted to add one more cautioning voice against the numerous blurbs within the book and those found here.  There's a caveat: I bailed after just under two hundred pages and I suppose it's possible that this thing turns into a real marvel at some point beyond that, but I don't see how.  I will say that any comparison to Neal Stephenson, however, is just ridiculous.  "Snow Crash" eats this thing's lunch without breaking a sweat.    
 I found this book impossible to use! The photos and illustrations were so detailed, with lines traveling everywhere, that I couldn't transfer what I saw on the page to what I saw on my hand. I was disappointed 
 This book has everything to do with cheating your money out of your pocket in whatever way the "master" can manage. It has nothing to do with actual financial market investing/trading. Beware of "master" of DECEIT!!!!!!  Give it a minus 100 stars. 
 This designer clearly aims for exclamations of surprises from viewers. She has an admirable eye for color. But for real class and style, refer to and study truly great and original minds like the late David Hicks, Madeleine Castaing, Jacques Garcia, and the highly intellectual Jacques Grange. Then re-interpret to suit your life and add your own sense drama for a real originality 
 I was a little disappointed in this book because of the limitations in sizing.  Although it is well presented, some of the projects are elementary enough that you can figure them out for yourself.  But the two girls I was going to get the book for, one is an XS and the other is XL, there wasn't much in the book for either of them.  And not a lot of direction on how to alter a pattern.  "Teen Knitting Club" implies that is for ages 13-19 and there are quite a range of sizes in those years.  
 This looks better on TV than it actually works.  The cable that the ball is connected to is very rigid and you have to really hit the ball hard to get it to wrap around.  When it unwinds it does so VERY slow and loses it's momentum and sinks to the pole before you even get a chance to hit it.  Plus they advise you not to use an aluminum or wood bat to hit it with?  What are you supposed to hit it with then?  These things you don't find out until you get it out of the box and set it up.  Don't waste money on this item 
 Well, i picked up this novel because i was intrigued to see Guenevere portrayed as a strong-minded young woman.  And was only mildly disappointed.  She was strong, but maybe i had built up her image so big that the character just couldnt reach.  Ummmm, overall it was good.  The flow lacked and occasionally i put the book down because i was bored with the repetitiveness of it all.  Yea, i would recommend this novel, but only if you're on  a long road trip or stuck in detention 
 I am in a graduate program and this is the first time in 16 years of education that I have ever come across such a poorly written textbook! As a previous rater stated, "The presentation of the content assumes that the reader has some knowledge of this content area and at times leaves him/her confused as to what was discussed, making it difficult to understand. Examples that are used are often incomplete and do not provide a complete picture of how statements are generated." I second his sentiment, "Too bad I could not give it zero stars." I would love to contact these individuals and their publisher and recommend they never write again. I need a book I can use again and again when my class is finished, not one I would sooner burn 
 I will admit that Paula is inspirational BUT she doesn't give you enough time to "learn" the move before putting you in full gear. I loved the music and Paula's upbeat personality but felt it moved way too fast. This video will definitely get your heart a pumpin' 
 To cover all the problems with continuity, logic, theology, geography and plain common sense in _Left Behind_ would take a whole book.  One hardly knows where to start.  Perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to Christian religion by this trashy novel.  As such, it isn't even a decent trashy novel; instead of steamy sex scenes, we get sanctimonious sermonizing.  Worse than that, what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the Bible into a cheap comic book, ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self-centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it's too late.  The comic book aspect can not be overemphasized.  Even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario (an idea with virtually no scriptural support), little in the characters' actions, thought processes or dialog rings true.  One gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student.  God ends up looking like the ultimate villain, demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side Or Else.  Whatever happened to the inspiring Christian writers of yesteryear?  Who is the present-day equivalent of C. S. Lewis, or Catherine Marshall, and why aren't they getting more attention?  These were writers who actually made you THINK.  LaHaye and Jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing God wants us to be doing; they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought.  They show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non-believers in such a world might ask.  One wonders if they have ever met a non-believer at all, or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter.  These days, it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of Ann Coulter or Pat Robertson, whose mission seems to be to turn Christianity into a twisted, bigoted caricature of what it once was.  Perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured.  If _Left Behind_ is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from Christian writers, then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind 
 I'm sorry to say that this product failed to meet my expectations.   Pros Tight connection to laptop  Cons -Too easy to accidentally change the combination which makes it difficult to set the combo and remove the lock. -This product is built to fit on the right side of a laptop.  If you're laptop is like mine where the plug is on the left side, you have to turn the laptop around in order to unlock it (unless you don't mind doing it backwards) 
 Huggins is a hippocrite and writes a book that is completely irresponsible. This book does little to provide guidance to a new nursing mom. Rather it makes you feel guilty, helpless and like a failure. I was a successful nursing mom for 14 months despite this book. For the birth of my second child, I did myself a favor and used it for a coaster for my water cup while I nursed my baby.   Do yourself a favor and get the AAP or the Good Housekeeping books instead 
 This review is of the short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" only.  This is the first story I've read by Washington Irving, and it'll most likely be my last. I grew up watching the Disney cartoon "The Legend of Sleep Hollow" from 1958, which was narrated by Bing Crosby.  It was the only thing that helped me envision this story, as I found the writing very bland and needlessly wordy.  It's as if the author just liked seeing his own words on paper.  I found the narration to skip, rendering it muddled, and I was at a loss if it was an unseen narrator, the author himself, or whomever.  I didn't get a sense of any character, and the horseman was nearly nonexistent.  I can see why the 1999 movie "Sleepy Hollow" with Johnny Depp needed much revamping, as this story is very mind numbing.  I do not recommend 
 If you were only to read the first chapter, where Wieviorka explains his psychology-based theory on the evolution of terroism, this book would seem like an excellent source on the psychology of terrorists.  Unfortunately, the rest of the book only serves to validate a hidden agenda.  Reading closely, you find that the theory he so carefully lays out in Part 1 is used throughout the case study analysis to invalidate the groups being studied as "terrorist organizations." -- in short, he says that they're not terrorists because they don't match his psychological work-up of terrorist groups.  These groups include: Hizbollah, PLO, ETA, and RAF/Red Brigades 
 I ordered it on 9/9.  At the beginning it would come middle of October.  It was OK.  However, delivery schedule had been changed.  It is not arrived yet, nor I do not know when it will come.  Amazon knows this delay.  However, they asked me to send a review of it.  What does it mean?  I rated this item as  1-star; it is not for the item, but for the seller, Amason. Amazon is generally good campany, I think.  However, I cannot accept my situation for this.  Honestly saying, I want to rate 0-star for this order 
 If you went to a dictionary and entered "stereotypes in chick-lit", this book would be pictured.    To start with, the main character, who is "supposed" to be so smart, and has a background in Washington politics, gets drunk and takes her shirt off at a work function.  The book lost me after that.       Los Angeles is pictured as a ditzy town where nothing important happens except for movies being made and people having plastic surgery.    The plot is predictable and lacks originality.  If you really want to read a "girl gets great job and it stinks" book, read the Lauren Weisberger ones - The Devil Wears Prada or Everyone Worth Knowing.  They do a much better service to the subgenre.  There is so much good chick-lit out there.  Anything by Sophie Kinsella or Gemma Townley, for example.     
 I continue to marvel at "men" like James Dobson who blatantly ignores all the solid statistical evidence that children brought up with love and without violence function better in life.  Dobson is also an anti-porn crusader, and he also ignores the fact that anywhere porn has been legalized, rape statistics have dropped dramatically. (Source: the book 'Porn 101' 
 I didn't like this book.  Truth be told, I still haven't finished it, and I bought it over six months ago.  The characters are boring; the situation (while ripe with potential) drags; and the recipes don't even sound good.  I am supremely disappointed, as I usually love what Nora Ephron does.  Bummer 
 A poor excuse for a children's book. It is a blatant sermon that beats the reader over the head with Christianity. There is no real plot, story or intrigue, only a thinly veiled version of the writers belief that there is only one true religion and Christianity is it. 
 The 9/11 commission report should be found in the fiction section of your local book store.    The current US administration has no qualms about "creating its own reality" and this is the most perfect example of this practice.  It was crafted to ignore any and all evidence that contradicted their fabricated "reality" and then used the conclusions of this report to support the current foreign policy.  I urge you to do your own research and not blindly believe what this report tells you.   Here are only a few of the many examples that prove that the 9/11 commission report lacks any credibility:  1.  NORAD changed their story about their actions on 9/11 significantly at least three times.  The report (or NORAD) does not examine or give any explanation why this happened.  In any case it is standard NORAD procedure to intercept a jet anywhere in the US within 10 minutes of a possible aircraft problem and yet none were intercepted in the 80 minutes following the first confirmed hijacking.  The report does not examine why standard procedure was not followed. It also claims there were no NORAD flights until after the pentagon strike.  Why not?      2.  Several of the "hijackers" are still alive and have been interviewed by the BBC claiming that their passports were stolen, and the report makes no mention of this fact.  3.  The book claims that the WTC towers had "a hollow steel shaft, in which elevators and stairwells were grouped".  This is outrageously false as the buildings had 47 massive steel central columns to support the building.  4.  World Trade Center Building 7 completely collapsed at virtually free fall speed and yet this building is not even mentioned anywhere in the report.  This building was the third in history to completely collapse due to fire in history.  The other two were the WTC twin towers which also collapsed near the speed of gravity.  Straight-down collapse at free fall speed is scientifically impossible unless controlled demolition is employed.  The fundamental law of physics "conservation of momentum" proves this fact.      5.  The report blatantly ignored prolific eyewitness testimony of multiple explosions in the WTC towers.  This includes an explosion in the North Tower basement before it was struck by a plane.  This event was tape recorded in a nearby office meeting along with dozens of eye witness reports.  The testimony to this fact was simply ignored and left out of the report by the commission.  See also the firefighter tapes that were blocked from being released to the public for years by the government as well as news footage from the day in question.  In the entire report the word "explosion" is not encountered one single time.  6.  The report also fails to mention that Marvin Bush (brother of the President), was in charge of security at not only the WTC complex, but Dulles international airport and United airlines.  The report fails to reveal who was involved in the massive insider trading just a few days before the attacks took place, only to claim that they had "nothing to do with Al Qaeda".    Philip Zelikow, the author of this report and executive director of the 9/11 commission is a member of the current administration, a close friend of Condoleezza Rice, and a co-author of the current terrorism policy "Catastrophic Terrorism: Elements of a National Policy".  Could there be a bigger conflict of interest here?  Need anything else be said?    In conclusion, it's not worth the paper it is printed on.   Anyone who still takes this report seriously should read: Dr. David Ray Griffin - "911 Commission Report: Omissions and Distortions"  Dr. Steven E. Jones - "Why indeed did the World trade center buildings completely collapse?"  Or watch these videos (currently available for free on Google video):  "Improbable Collapse: The Demolition of our Republic"  "9/11 Press for Truth"  "911 Mysteries - Demolitions 
 Briefly, I have four stations and they never really worked right, I presume because of the need to be on the same circuit. I want to replace them now but I'm not sure I'd buy this brand again. 
 Whilst I normally try to stick with the WW2/cold war era naval stories, a friend of mine suggested I read one in the series of H Jay. Riker. My friend, who served on board a submarine for 20 years and later as military advisor (and stand in) on the movie Hunt For Red October, thought that I might enjoy Riker.  He was partly right.  Riker has written many books, mainly naval SEAL and submarine orientated, and I selected one of his later issues, about the Virginia Class submairne. The story line is set mid 2006 in the post WTC era. A Chinese submarine has been staffed by Pakistanie Al Queda nationals who engage several civilian targets around the Spratley Islands. Lt Garrett and the newest submarine the Virginia, are rerouted to pick up a Navy Seal team and investigate. During the underwater passage, two Kilo class submarines are in the water at the same time, one the Al Queada sub, the other Chinese. A battle ensues and well...the good guys ride off into the sunset and Garrett gets himself another woman.  On the shelves at any good store, titles are filled with Al Queda related subjects. The truth of the matter though has been that terrorism has been around for centuries, it was only the events of September 11 that thrust it's significance upon the USAmerican people.  I'm not a great fan of authors that capture an "media frenzy" and translate it through to their stories. In the back of my mind, I am almost sure that at some stage I have played a PC submarine game centred around the Spratley Islands which paralleled this story (might be a Tom Clancy story)  Whilst enjoyable as a read, it's somewhat future setting offset against current affairs wasn't enough to burst my bubble this time 
 Presents the traditional mainstream theory that the GP was a tomb, a theory that fails to explain any of the interior features of the pyramid and a theory that has no evidentiary support. If thinking for yourself is difficult for you, you may enjoy this book. On the other hand, if you have the capacity for independent thought, this book will be a disappointment. Read Christopher Dunn's The Giza Power Plant if you're capable of thinking logically 
 I had used some of the earlier books in this series to teach my children and had enjoyed them.  In this last book, however, the author is writing about history that many of us have actually lived through.  I was disappointed and surprised to find that her writing was so biased and opinionated.  I really wish she had just stuck to the facts.  Although she is entitled to her opinion, and these opinions gave us a lot to talk about, because of her own bias she emphasized certain issues and people, while barely mentioning others.  Towards the end of the book I found that she had some of her facts simply outright wrong, and this was disheartening as it cast a shadow on all the information reported in her other books.  I found it very surprising that a history book for children would have errors in the facts, and that it would be used to so shamelessly support someone's personal political agenda.  Again, there is no reason why someone can't write and publish a book like this, but it should not be presented as an unbiased children's "history" book, because this book is certainly not that.  I was quite disappointed 
 This was the second book that I have read of the authors (after the readable Body Double) and I would strongly recommend that readers unfamiliar with Gerritsen (a talented writer) avoid this book and look at the later books.  This novel centres around the events in a small Maine town where the local kids have started random acts of violence. The town doctor notices the acts and works out the correlation between the violence and the strange happenings at the local lake.   I found that this was a poor mans Michael Crichton, made worse with the authors leaning towards adding the romance element into the book. It may be just me, but the book seemed written more like a movie script than a novel.  A readable book if you can suspend disbelief 
 The first books by John Ringo were gripping tales of interstellar war and invasion, liberally laced with what he himself calls carnography. By the time his third book was published though, he seems to have learned the all too common skill of filling pages without providing any content.  "The Hero" tries to tell the story of a military special operations team a thousand years in the future. All the characters are totally forgettable, and indeed the authors proceeds to kill most of them off quickly enough. The story consists of the teams travails slogging around a hostile countryside playing Blind Man's Bluff, while some of the members try to kill each other. The situations are arbitrary and meaningless. The authors introduce strange fauna, and then mostly ignore them except when convenient. The equipment carried by the soldiers is shockingly primitive for a culture with a millennium of uninterrupted technical civilization.  The only minor points of interest are that Ringo finally includes the English pronunciation of his Bane Sidhe (for those who hadn't figured it out), we learn a little (very little) about the Aldenata, and there is confirmation that the Posleen were bioengineered, like that's a surprise 
 Based on the novel The Big Arm by Clark Howard with a screenplay by Robert Roy Pool, this drama directed by Ben Bolt feels like an adaptation of a large canvas novel with all the detail left in, so that everything reads as subsidiary. Set in the Chicago of the 1950's, Matt Dillon stars as a dice player from Indiana seeking the big time. However, when you're juggling at least 4 plots it's only natural that not all of them will come together for a satisfying conclusion. The most promising one concerns Dillon's Hustler-like competition with Tommy Lee Jones as the owner of a strip club, with Jones having the same spot between the eyebrows as Dillon. The problem with filming dice is that the actual game is monotonous, so the best Bolt could do is create tension by delaying the next roll or the raising of financial stakes, though he does provide an early montage of Dillon with David Marshall Grant on a winning spree and falling dice and money to the sounds of Shake, Rattle and Roll on the soundtrack. The only other visual trick is the sparks of an overhead train on it's tracks as Dillon and Diane Lane as Jones' stripper wife kiss to Fever. The best of the screenplay is a laugh line of sarcasm and forboding given to Meg Hogarth as Dillon's mother re his dice mentor's funeral "I nearly got crushed in the crowd", and Cherry Jones as a Patsy Cline-like singer who sneaks up behind Dillon, covering his eyes with a guess who? Dillon says her perfume gives her away and she replies " Aint nobody gonna give me away but my daddy". This use of eyes and the eyes of the dice are also parallel with Bruce Dern as the husband of Lee Grant, Dillon's employer. Dern is a former dice champ who has been blinded, but unfortunately this plot point gets no payoff. Dillon is also given two romantic partners in Lane and Suzy Amis as a mother of a child out of wedlock. The madonna/whore dichotomy is rather obvious, and the symbolism worse, with Amis' child scoring points for her and the way Lane is presented so unflatteringly scores points against her. Lane's fan dance doesn't help, since the focus on the scen is more Dillon's twisted attraction/repulsion. The 1950's period works for Dillon's razor etched beauty, the perfect locale for his photographer Bruce Weber appeal, and he even gives a Method touch to the way he hits his own face with a restaurant menu. Watch for Lolita Davidovich as another of Jones' strip club entertainers 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 The main characters are here: Stavisky, Daladier, Reynaud in politics, Sartre (very briefly), Picasso, Dali in the arts, Chanel, Coty, etc.  Several rather minor artists, such as the photographer Brassa, are also presented in an interesting, anecdotal fashion. So much space is devoted to James Joyce, Henry Miller and others, however, that it should really be titled "Expatriates in 1930s Paris." Numerous American preconceptions about the French are repeated. The book is also seriously compromised by the many mistakes in French ("C'est moi qui EST l'artiste," "pas DES histoires" --  The words "et" and "est" are not, as Wiser implies, pronounced the same) and by factual mistakes (The French Academy does not edit the Larousse Dictionary; The obelisk in the Place de la Concorde is incorrectly identified as 'Cleopatra's Needle'; Chaplin's the Great Dictator was not made in the early 1930s, etc.).  There is such sloppy chronology, one wonders how much of the other details the author has simply invented, or embroidered 
 I could sum up this book very quickly:  1) Trust in God for everything  2) Read the Bible  3) Attend church  4) Ask your husband, church, other Christians for help  The book is full of fluffy ideas like: "We need to know ourselves the way God knows us" "Find a Christian counselor" and advice for single mothers to simply attend church if seeking help.  The book primarily revolves around the Bible and its interpretation of parenting. Why not cut out the middle-man and just read this "wonderful book?" It's not like the Bible is a work in progress.   This book is more about proselytizing and keeping Evangelicals reading "inspired" books rather than competing viewpoints. And with America being one of the most pure Christian nations in the world ( US is more Christian than India is Hindu and Israel is Jewish ). Anything published by Zondervan should be looked at skeptically.   I also dislike how males are stilled deemed unworthy parents in the Christian community. They can assist and help , but cannot be considered primary parents. But given this books lack of true substance, I doubt it would have made any difference 
 Be aware that this book is no longer in copyright and anybody can print and sell this book. I bought this book at Amazon and the print is small with poor font clarity. My zeal for the Lord could not overcome the headaches from trying to read this book. The small "a" is usually filled with ink for example. Buy Clarence Larkin books published by the Clarence Larkin Estate which still keeps all of Rev. Larkins' books in print. They still produce the books from plates instead of a copy machine that needs cleaning. May the people of Sun Publishing join the lake of fire yaht club as galley-slaves for Apollyon 
 If only they'd put as much effort into sound processing as they do the computer graphics, this would be a great disc.  As it is, it sounds like a bootleg-quality ripoff made from a videotape.  At least someone could've flipped on the Dolby switch.  Perhaps they're saving that for the "remastered" edition 
 there are few more excruciating experiences than sitting thru a work of "art". this pretentious overblown (lame pun intended) tripe from 40 years ago is almost as painful to watch as "zabriskie point"; i daresay that i wouldrather sit thru "mchales navy joins the air force" than this! why would anybody take antonioni seriously? but even more irritating than the movie itself is the commentary track by some purported antonioni "scholar". david hemmings career is non-existent nowadays, and vanessa redgrave has managed to live this down (hey, if you can survive "camelot" you can survive anything). if this was swinging london in the 60s, im glad i was in new york! 
 Where to begin? I have now read all of Brad Thor's novels and have to say, even though this is his latest, it is absolutely not up to expectations. In his other books Scot Harvath, the country's star super covert operative, is for the most part, sharp and on the ball. In Takedown, he has to be led by the hand and even pushed to "get it". At every turn I figured out what was going to happen way before it did, no surprises, nothing. Scot's buddy Harrington was built up to be another "super agent" and in so doing made Scot look incompetent considering he was the best we had. It made me fear for our country. It seemed to me writers block had set in and the author was desperate to keep the story line going. There were many questions in the story line never asked and/or answered. What also disturbed me was how the local or Federal governments,especially the tactical parts of it became  inept and frozen with inaction just to maintain Scot's feeble attempt to have progress, and then he has to rely on some stranger he meets who " knows someone who knows someone who knows someone who has the answer or solution to that problem". In this book even that was expected. The ending was also disappointing and predictable. I loved the other books by Brad and now wished I hadn't read this one, because the next one I'll pick up with trepidation 
 Believe it or not, I had actually expected to hate this because it just doesn't suit me for the good kind of music. It sounds just the way I thought it would sound: crappy. It isn't hard enough to be all that good if you ask me. It is just too calm. {And now you probably think I'm a hypocrite because I like Enya}. At least Enya doesn't sound like someone who sounds like they are in a garage band attempting to record bad music. Not my style. 
 I purchase this product specifically to scan slides after a glowing review I had read. No matter what I try, the image quality is horrible; curved lines are jagged and the image is grainy. I have never had the patience to wait for the higher dpis, for four slides at 4800 dpi, the time frame is 252 minutes. 2400 dpi looks exactly like 800. The color adjustments don't seem to make any difference either. Other functions seem OK 
 You charge too much for shipping and handling. I would have been better off going to a Retail Store 
 Dr. Loftus, et. al., as a participant in the false memory hysteria, has managed to combine initially poor research on a totally different topic to support her beliefs in memory in trauma. She utilizes adult eyewitness testimony (using poor, non-valid studies) and blithely applies it to childhood memory without any consideration of childhood developmental, dissociative and traumatic issues, and without having any experience in clinical practice (either adult or child)!!  This is not only a bad book.  This is a dangerously manipulative, unethical and destructive book.  There are superlative works written about the limits and realities of memory in trauma. Try Lenore Terr, MD, any of her books, but especially "Too Scared To Cry. and Unchained Memories" and get an even handed view of the role of memory in traumatic events 
 Anyone who's read this book, or is considering doing so, should consider what has come to light about Judith Miller's reporting in the build-up to the Iraq war (simply do a search on google for "Judith Miller" - see, in particular, the articles in Slate). Miller was regularly writing front page columns for the New York Times which contained sensational claims (now known to be wildly inaccurate) about Iraq's possession - or efforts to obtain - WMDs. One telling detail to the quality of Miller's reporting can be gleaned from her concession in May of 2003 that the now-discredited Ahmed Chalabi provided most of the scoops (aka lies) for her front page stories on WMDs.   Based on the sheer extent of errors in her pre-war reporting, I think readers of Miller's work need to utilize a heightened degree of skepticism when assessing her claims. 
 Thurbon's book got me very excited when I found it in the bookstore (sorry Amazon) as I had recently decided that I needed to know much more about the region than I did.  After reading it, I have to say that Thurbon's book seems to follow a predictable pattern - Thurbon has his main point, which is that Siberia is a rotten place, and he finds locals to prove his point over and over again in a depressing manner.  It doesn't seem to do justice to the region, nor is it very informative 
 Words need not even be wasted on this product. Besides each character having a different voice than that in the movie, the audio effects are terrible, as well as the actors and script. The one good thing about this product is its availability is limited. Save your time, save your money. Don't let Lucas put his hand in your pocket 
 This new monograph has been released to coincide with the Whitney's retrospective.  Both the long over due retrospective and the new monograph are lacking in quantity and depth needed in doing justice to  this  amazingly prolific and important artist.  Abrams' previous Neel  monograph  had many more images and excerpts of  important interviews with Neel   throughout the book (provided by the forsight of Patricia  Hills.)  The new  book, under the Whitney museums' auspice, includes interviews with some of  the sitters.  While these anecdotes are interesting it doesn't make up for  the total superiority of the 1983 monograph (reprinted in 1995.)  If you  can find a used version of the previous monograph, you would be wise to  aquire it.  I also recommend Pamela Allara's "Pictures of People,  Alice Neel's American Portrait Gallery"  which puts Neel's work in a  cultural context (from the depression through the feminist movement. 
 The Weekly Standard is just more of the same.  It's not, strictly speaking, journalism.  But I imagine you'd like it if you enjoy reading articles that set out to promote a very conservative point of view.  If you like Rush or Fox News, you'd probably like it.  If you are looking for a serious media outlet, this is not it 
 Do not waste your time or money, see the original. Once in awhile, a remake of a movie from another culture works; for example, Seven Samurai becomes "Magnificant Seven" -- Most of the time, the remake is trash. The original "La Femme Nikita" is a great movie: exciting with a strong political viewpoint; this version is simply Hollywood pablum 
 The animal rights issue is a tricky one, because it touches on really deep questions about what it means to be conscious, to have rights, and to experience suffering.  So you might expect a philosopher to be able to sort through the ethical issues and suggest a way forward.  If so, you would be disappointed by this book.  The first chapter lays out the philosophical foundation of the book.  Singer argues that there's really no basis for assigning equal rights to all humans, since different humans have different abilities.  Therefore equality must be based on the recognition of another person's interests.  Since animals have interests too, they deserve equal treatment.  That's it.  It's not terribly deep, and frankly not even rational, but Singer doesn't bother to elaborate.  So if animals have interests, then they obviously have an interest in not suffering.  How do we know animals are capable of suffering?  According to Singer there are two signs:  they seek to avoid painful stimuli and they have nervous systems that bear a superficial similarity to those of humans.  He doesn't say how he came up with these criteria, but they seem awfully generous to me.    In fact, based on those criteria one would conclude that monkeys are capable of understanding spoken language and that humans are capable of echolocation.  Monkeys do in fact respond to certain vocalizations, and they have all the relevant physiological structures for understanding speech.  And humans actually can echolocate (with a lot of practice).  The point is that you would never seriously compare human echolocation to bat echolocation, and the ability of monkeys to process speech is negligible relative to that of humans.  Could this also be true of the capacity for pain and suffering?  I don't think anyone knows, and Singer doesn't shed any light on the subject.  The next chapter is about animal testing, and a lot of the chapter deals with the use of animals in scientific experiments.  This is the weakest part of the book.  Singer finds some of the most gruesome experiments in science history, and juxtaposes them with out-of-context quotes from the researchers to make it look like the research was useless.  He mentions in passing that the vast majority of animal experiments don't involve pain, but by the end of the chapter he suggests that all medical experimentation should eventually be stopped.  Part of his justification for ending medical experiments is the notion that such experiments don't actually contribute to medical or scientific progress.  This idea is unfortunately quite common among people who don't know anything about medicine or science.  However it's completely incorrect, and most of Singer's arguments regarding the scientific value of animal testing have been completely debunked.  For example, he continues to exploit the thalidomide tragedy, even though it was already known at the time the book was written that that incident was unrelated to animal testing.  In addition to being totally confused about science, Singer seems uncomfortable with the scientific method itself.  He repeatedly suggests that animal testing should, in the short term, be limited to experiments that will lead to rapid advances in medical treatment.  This is like saying you should look for your lost car keys where you left them.  Science doesn't work this way.  At one point (p. 47), Singer complains about a series of experiments that were shown "first to prove a theory, then to disprove the theory, and finally to support modified versions of the original theory."  This probably sounds ridiculous to a philosopher, but it's actually a pretty good description of the scientific method.  The next chapter deals with factory farming, and here Singer is on firmer ground.  As in the previous chapter, there's no philosophy, or even rational discourse.  It's just page after page of description, in this case of the conditions of animals on a large farm.  However, in contrast to the chapter on experimentation, the conditions he describes are standard practice for the majority of farm animals.  Here it would seem that there's plenty of room for improvement with comparatively minimal consequences for humans (although I imagine the situation has only gotten worse since the publication of the second edition of the book in 1990).  The next chapter deals with vegetarianism, calling for a boycott of meat and dairy products.  Again the appeal is basically emotional, and if you were moved by the arguments of the preceding chapter, you will presumably find this chapter convincing.  Curiously Singer doesn't call for a similar boycott of medicine or medical treatment, even though the argument would be identical.  Even if you belief that animal experimentation is useless for human medicine, you have to admit that the purchase of such medicine directly pays for more animal research.  Anyone who's receiving treatment for cardiac problems or diabetes, or who has ever had surgery, or who takes prescription drugs, is contributing to animal suffering.  Maybe Singer deals with this in another book, but given the chapter on vegetarianism it's a rather obvious omission.  The next chapter is a strangely out of place history of human attitudes toward animals, going back several thousand years.  It might have made sense to put this at the beginning of the book, but perhaps his editor was afraid of losing readers.  The last chapter talks about some popular animal rights movements and their accomplishments.  Singer doesn't draw any line between violent organizations like the Animal Liberation Front (which the FBI considers a terrorist organization) and organizations that actually help animals in a peaceful way (like the ASPCA).  He speaks positively of PETA, which in addition to other extremist activities, supports violence and arson.  I don't know why he would do this.  Ultimately this is a bad book.  It trivializes a serious issue by  substituting emotional imagery for rational argumentation.  The fact is that humans can benefit greatly from actions that adversely affect animals.  In the realm of science, there is no serious doubt that the length and quality of human life have been improved through animal testing.  With other behaviors, such as meat-eating, the benefits are more subjective and the suffering is probably greater.  How we assign weight to these costs and benefits is a very difficult question that Singer doesn't even attempt to take seriously 
 ... apparently his magic wand was malfunctioning.  To Baldacci's credit his writing style is his only asset when it comes to keeping readers interested and wanting them to find out who did what and why. That's why I gave two stars. But all throughout the book I constantly felt that I was reading yet another "blockbuster" garbage. The book did not add any meaning, I did not care for the characters at all, and Baldacci did a great job ruining the ending 
 Come on people! Even Jack Vance's zany Dying Earth novels (Cugel in particular) have more substance than this lackadaisical tour-de-force. Skip out on Burroughs, if you want quality sci-fi read the Demon Princes by Jack Vance.. 
 This book is simply the sheet music to accompany their album by the same name. 
 In typical passive-aggressive fashion, Canada has registered their unmitigated displeasure with the US's war-for-oil folly by unleashing two of the most overrated bands in recent memory on the all-too-eager music press literati.  Coupled with the country-fried fiddle hoedown (Quebec style) of the Arcade Fire, Wolf Parade rains down with sheer chutzpah as they ape and mimic every freaking current cliche in today's music clime.  Synths?  Check.  Bowie-esque warbling?  Check.  Boring and more boring?  Check.  
 I bought the cassette of this when I was in high school.  To be honest it only took a couple of listens to see that it was all one long song with different words put in at intervals.  I was a big Barry Manilow fan before this album.  Give me "Mandy" or "Read 'Em and Weep" anyday over this stuff.  
 This book delivered a big bunch of idiotic information serving no purpose exept to point out a restaurant or maybe two.  
  I read this book for a project two years ago. I wasn't about to finish this book and had to move to another one. First off, this book lacks emotion. This character is so boring. She doesn't seem to ever feel sad or mad and to me, a book without emotion is just unreadable. I hated this book, but I don't like most Scott O'Dell books. Just go read another book 
 I found reading this book to be a waste of time.  It's a very light book and can be read cover to cover in an hour or two.  The whole book reads like an ad for eHarmony.  Everything in this book is geared toward how to fill out your profile on eHarmony.  Just like most online dating sites, this book makes date/mate selection sound like your shopping for a new car.  It makes it sound like all that is needed to find your soul mate is to figure out what you like and don't like in a partner, enter it into the computer, and poof, your soul mate will magically appear exactly to your specifications 
 The title of this book is misleading. I expected to find a detailed analysis of Viking warfare, but found a rather unprofessional rant on Scandinavian culture in the Viking Era. It is easy to see how a perception of history can be slanted, based upon the bias of the author. This insight is useful, however, in the review of latter-day protagonist saga writers or antagonist monks. Little more can be learned from this text 
 If Lifetime switched from showing crappy dramas about wronged women to showing crappy horror flicks about wronged women this would one of them.  This movie was not scary.  It would have been suspenseful if I cared for any of the characters.  You know what the best part was?  When it was over.  Few movies compel me to write reviews, good or bad.  This one obviously did 
 I did not buy this book, but gave it a cursory review. Some reviewers complained about some absurd examples that this book uses. I think the problem is that the authors wrote this book as if the readers were all going to be dummies. It is common sense that anyone who is interested in an in-depth study of any subject, or anyone who just wants to try to understand the basics of a subject, will not buy a book with such an inappropriate title. In any case, I have been studying grammar for a while and the best books available for studying grammar are The Grammar Bible by Strumpf, The Elements of Style by White, and Grammar Smart by Princeton Review. The difference between these books the one written for "dummies" is that the authors don't beat around the bush with useless stories and sentences to try to retain the reader's attention; instead, all their comments are incisive, insightful, and very interesting. And let's face it, if you are not so interested in grammar, you might still buy this book for dummies but it's unlikely that you'll ever end up reading, or retaining (which is more important), the information contained within the book. In my opinion, anyone who wants to learn grammar but doesn't want to spend too much time on it is far better off getting a book that is as succinct as possible. Here is a hint: just the usage of the myriad of extra words in this book for dummies is already a bad lesson in grammar. It teaches one to use many unnecessary words, whereas an author like White relentlessly emphasizes the importance of brevity. His book so small that one can put it in a pocket, yet the information contained within the book is anything but too little 
 I read this book for my European History AP class...actually for the summer work. I chose it because it seemed short and easy to read. Boy was I wrong. I did not enjoy this book at all. My recommendation is to choose another play. Each scene was totally different, which I did not like. The language is a bit confusing. Overall, I do not recommend this book...sorry. 
 Was hoping to read an unbiased history of the conflict in the Middle East.  Instead entire book is so heavily slanted toward Israel that had to put it down after a few chapters.  If you are genuinely trying to educate yourself about this important region, don't bother purchasing this book.  Just more pro-Israel rhetoric 
 Robin Hobb deserves praise for her fresh input of ideas into the Fantasy gender.  I have enjoyed her previous series to a great extent.  She does have two faults though:  The overall storyline in all her books is pretty predictable; a conflict in setting that comes about due to a lack of dialogue and understanding, an unknown/misunderstood consciousness in tree/ship/stone/dragon, and a down trodden main character.  This is nothing unusual, as the saying goes "An author is always writing the same book".  Her major fault though is her character build-up, and Forest Mage is her largest failure.  She is very good a forming nasty and inhuman characters whose main purpose is the utter destruction of someone due to a minor lapse.  But the inconsistency of personalities behaviour and interactions is appalling.  One minute a character is utterly malicious, and the next they are completely the reversed and the best friends of their victims.  A good example in Forest Mage is Carsina, Nevare Burvelle's fiancée.  She tries to utterly destroy him, as far as put him on the gallows, because she is embarrassed about his weight (talk about overreacting), but is completely accepted and forgiven by Nevare before her death. The worst character build-up though is Nevare himself.  A supposed officer cadet who has trained as a soldier from the moment he was born.  Yet despite this he has none of the determinations of survival instinct of a professional soldier, that ex and current military personnel would recognise.  The primary requirement of an officer is that he makes decisions.  Yet Nevare is a character that is incapable of making any.  He would be much more believable as an ex monk or similar, rather than someone with a remote familiarity with the military.  I'm left wondering if Hobb made no attempt at research for this book? This is overall one of the worst books I have ever read.  The storyline hardly exists, embarrassing character build-up, and an endless physical and mental persecution of the protagonist who has the reactions of a plank. I forced myself to finish this appalling book and put it down wondering where the publisher's editors were when this was sent to print.  It's a waste of paper and time.  If you liked the first book, skip this and hope for the best in the third instalment.  If you do, here is a summary:  Nevare is kicked out of academy, travels to the Specks, destroys the plains people's magic and becomes fat (due to Speck magic), disinherited, stupid and incapable of decisions. Everyone hates him and now they think he's dead.  Dead Speck's souls become part of trees that Gernia want's removed for a road.  Nevare ends leaving Gernia for the Specks.  The End. 
 Great movie but CD not perfoming in the last few scenes.  It gets stuck or restarts itself.  Very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new CD 
 To begin with, Nock makes an eloquent case for natural rights liberty and the criminality of the state.  His principles are wonderful, but his historical analysis is horrible.  He bases most of it off the perverted  works of "Progressive" historians, among them Charles A. Beard,  whose "Economic Origins" serves as the main basis of his  commentary on the Constitution.  Together with his mistaken history, he  also devolopes a misleading and destructive form of social class theory.   Despite this, the last chapter and essay in the appendix serve to redeem  the book somewhat.  I would recommend the work as a source of strong  libertarian principles and a solid indictment of the state( remember the  difference between the state and government).  However, I would suggest  that you might wish to supplement Nock's falacious historical view with  those of historians as  BernardBailyn, Gordon Wood, Pauline Maier, Carl  Bridenbaugh, and Forrest McDonald for a true analysis 
 Sadly this second book left me unsatisfied. For one, Wouk's misgivings in the first book were well exaggerated in the second. Of course, once one has read through the first book, its hard to stop. Yet, by the end of War and Remembrance I was thoroughly sick and annoyed by Wouk's characters. It's hard to relate to super humans, who constantly do super human feats. Most of the characters in the book come from superior stock, graduate from the top universities, have extremely good looks, and seem to harbour traits that make superman look normal and mundane.  I guess after spending endless hours reading the book I am somewhat frustrated. Perhaps you will be like me, and by the second book without pausing. But, for the sake of saving some time, I recommend you consider parting with the characters in book one. Don't make the mistake of buying book two just because book one was so good.          
 I used the feature of searching and reading to check it out right here, online.  I searched for their write-up of amazon.com.  And it's there, on page 60.  Read those pages first.  If you think the authors give an intelligent and insightful perspective on Amazon's role in the internet bubble, then by all means buy and read the book 
 The charger I got did not fit the Motorola V188, wrong connecter. I was offered a full refund 
  I haven't seen a movie so one-sided since the Contender. They didn't even try to make good arguments for the pro-gun side. I hate to use the term Liberal Bias but in this case it fits like a glove. The cards in this movie were so stacked against the defense team that by the end of the movie I felt like the gun companies were the underdogs. Pure garbage.   
 So this T-Pain guy is a "rappa ternt sanga", as explained by the album title.  The spelling alone shows off such remarkable eloquence, which is in even deeper supply on the album itself.  Apparently people have gone crazy about this guy and his remarkable pipes, as they have made his first two singles massive hits.  They're all astounded by the deep, thought-provoking lyrics that he writes - you heard right, T-Pain writes these lyrics himself!  No help from song doctors here, as this guy clearly proves his status as a member of Mensa with his ode to falling in love with pole dancers, otherwise known as "I'm N Luv (Wit A Stripper)".  Unhappy with the current direction of R & B, T-Pain pioneered a style that he calls "Hard & B", and it shows because it sounds so drastically different from any R & B music you've ever heard!  T-Pain recruited virtuoso musicians from across the globe to play the meticulously crafted grooves, melodies and improvisational jams that he wrote himself!  He even plays some of the instruments himself, including the track that he received no outside assistance on, the astounding, appropriately named "Blow Ya Mind"!  I don't think I need to prove this guy's genius to you, as it comes across very clearly on all the songs here!  And that voice!  It's like honey on the ears!  Trust me when I say that you've never heard anything like it!  You've never heard anything like the soaring, mellifluous vocals of T-Pain!  And I bet you're all wondering how he does it, right?  Well, I'll tell you.  He does it with the help of his best friend, the vocoder.  It's been around for decades and was featured on tracks by the likes of Kid Rock ("Only God Knows Why") and Cher ("Believe") among others, but it has never been featured as prominently as it is on T-Pain's debut, Rappa Ternt Sanga.  It's used enough here to suggest that T-Pain is not capable of singing without it.  And it's on every single track you'll find here, helping T-Pain reach tones and pitches that he would never be able to reach with his own thin, often monotone voice (which is pretty obvious during the parts where he ISN'T using the vocoder).  The vocoder is essentially the only thing that makes the "Hard & B" style any different from the rest of contemporary R & B.  Don't believe anything you hear from T-Pain, and take the first paragraph of this review in jest, because the music here is dull and synthetic, the lyrics flat and generic, the guest shots uninspired (Hey look, it's Mike Jones, hip-hop's answer to Timmy from South Park!), and the singing, well, the singing speaks for itself.  In summary: Rappa Ternt Sanga is every bit as weak as the title is misspelled.  T-Pain promised fresh air with his debut, but instead a huge cloud of smog came rolling in.  There's some decent voices in the R & B genre, and some solid throwbacks to classic sounds (Van Hunt comes to mind), but unfortunately the public is choosing to embrace mindless sex appeal over substance, which is why the vocally challenged likes of T-Pain, Chris Brown, Christina Milian and Ciara are huge stars.  But I've heard that T-Pain is planning to move back to a more rapping-intensive direction in the future.  Judging by this weak effort, I don't expect much from his abilities as a rapper - I expect it to be far closer to Nelly than N.W.A 
 I received this as a gift and at first I thought it was great, but then I realized it would only display 142 images. I worked with technical support for several months (they are not the speediest or most helpful). I resized, renamed, restructured the photos, tried them on different media and finally they admitted it was a bug. I RMA'd the unit at my shipping expense of course, only to recieve another with the same problem.  I wouldn't recommend this purchase 
 I am a 38 year old adoptee and adoptive parent.  I was adopted as an infant, as was my own adopted daughter.  As others have pointed out, this book is clearly both overly negative and overly dramatic.  I would like to add that following the advice of the author could even be very harmful to your adopted child.  In particular, I was taken aback by the author's suggestion that you should essentially tell your child that he or she must have unresolved grief issues and help him or her uncover them.  That is just plain wrong.  Please understand that it is entirely likely that your child, especially if he or she was adpoted as an infant, will never have any significant feelings of loss or grief.  DO NOT CREATE THOSE FEELINGS OUT OF SOME MISGUIDED EFFORT TO HELP YOUR CHILD "UNCOVER" SUPPOSEDLY SUPPRESSED FEELINGS.  In my own experience, I have always known that I was adopted and that I have been loved by my parents.  I simply have no negative feelings regarding my own adoption.  None.  However, if my parents had read this book when I was a child and decided that they needed to tell me that I must have those feelings and we had to find them and focus on them, I undoubtedly would have needed years and years of therapy.  The advice in this book might have some helpful relevance to those who are adopted as older childen.  However, for those adopted a infants, what you should do is tell them early and often that they are adopted and loved.  Let them know that you are always available to talk with them about any feelings or questions they might have.  If they have questions, answer them matter of factly.  Do not burden them with negative feelings that they probably do not have and will never develop 
 Other than for the stars that were in the cast, I never would have bought this DVD 
 I started the Full series a few years back when I needed an Evanovich fix between Plum books. I loved the first 3, after that I can't say they have lived up to my expectations.  This latest is the worse of all, it reminds of the 180 page romance novels of the early 70's, you know the ones you'd 6 of every month in the mail? Juvenile and unrealistic, sorry Janet but this one is a stinker for those of us used to the great Stephanie Plum novels and even the Barnaby series. Lorelei King does her best, but even a great reader can't help this book 
 This is a great book for someone who is getting a new cat or has a cat but doesn't understand him/her.   I was expecting some new information about a "secret language".  There was no mention of the latest research in feline behavior and the author describes training a cat like training a dog; so what's the "secret"? I agreed with almost everything in the book except the comment about cat owners who leave on a trip.  The author says that cats do not get lonely.  Well, that's wrong.  He also says that a cat will go to the home where the best food is served.  How does one explain cats who live with homeless street people?   The title was deceiving 
 Let me start off, by saying that I am a huge Dean Koontz fan, especially of his work in the 80's and 90's when he really blew up. So, when you read this review, don't think that I'm an ignorant hater. Because I am not. I just give you my thoughts about this book. Here goes:  Y'all know what the book is about so I am not going to repeat it all over again. Jimmy Tock and the 5 horrible days that he will meet throughout his life.  I thought the book was awful and most of all- ridiculous. And I will tell you why. There was no credibility in the characters whatsoever. Usually DK does a great job in creating credible characters. Well, he totally blew it this time. Why? Because ALL of the characters are acting like idiot. There is NO WAY that Jimmy, his wife Lorrie, and his familly can act with so much humour in every single situation. Every single time Jimmy and his wife face a horrible situation, their worst enemies and when they are close to dying, it seems like they've got something funny and sophisticated to say. I mean, come on! That's just stupid! You're one step away from getting killed and all you can do is tell jokes and act like an idiot? That was totally annoying! All throughout the book, jokes and jokes in the worst situation. I know it's just a book of fiction, but the characters still need to be believable. Well, in this book, they ARE NOT.   The plot itself isn't so bad, but it's not good either. Especially the last few chapters, where everything is getting clearer - well the end doesn't make a lot of sense either, and it's like Koontz made an end for little kids or teenagers who haven't read a lot of books and don't know what a good book is. The end, when they meet their worst enemy is almost like the end of a soap opera - an ending that doesn't really make sense (and of course you get a lot of those stupid supposed-to-be-sophisticated jokes from the annoying Tock familly).  So, I am sorry for ripping this book appart, but to me it was a piece of trash. I just had to read it till the end, because I was on a vacation in Thailand and I couldn't find a good book at that time. Plus I wanted to see how low DK could go. It seemed (at least on that book) that he was tired of writing long books with a lot of developements and he just rushed this book with its ridiculous characters. 2 stars and that's generous of me. A waste of time. Get DK's books from the 80's and 90's instead 
 I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.  But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books 
 Outdated, declasse and so preachy/stupid.  You'd be better using the internet to find out the real deal on international adoption than reading this insipid book 
 I'm going to go against the grain and say this disc is better suited for a hi-rez on-hold playlist for a bank.  I am not a huge smooth jazz fan, but after reading the reviews about this DVD-A disc I figured I'd give it a shot.  Yes, from a fidelity standpoint this is top notch.  But I couldn't get past a minute of any of the songs.  Long story short, there are tons of great DVD-A and SACD discs out there.  If ultra-smooth jazz is not your thing, don't bother with this one 
 Despite the opinions of other reviewers on this site, this is not a well written book.  I am speaking of the Future Interests section in particular.  In order explain concepts, the book uses terms that are defined later in the chapter, and simply gives examples without clarifying.  I think the authors are capable of explaining these concepts in an understandable way, but fail to do so.  This is evident once you use the Gilberts outline written by Dukeminier, where concepts are well defined.  Perhaps this is a ploy to sell more Gilberts.  Regardless, the textbook leaves much to be desired 
 Not what I was expecting. Very hard to read as it was written back in the dark ages and the english used is tough 
 For some reason, as i listened to this album, I kept picutring David Drainman from Disturbed's less evil twin as the vocalist for this band. I also expected the singer to break out into the chorus of "Stupify" at any moment as well.  Oh well.  This band is pretty much like any other hard rock band out at the moment. The usual quite verse followed by a heavy chorus. Nothing new or to write home about 
 Waste of money... This book is good only for school projects and absolutely not useful for artists, restorers or woodworkers. Very amateur...Featuring stone age techniques, which can only discourage the follower. Don't give any choice of supplies, don't warn about possible mistakes an failures during the process and do not say how to avoid or fix those mistakes.  Anyway... Following this book amateur will only get frustrated: Spend a fortune for supplies and sabotage there treasures... Professionals or semi-professionals - simply don't need it... Businesses  which  selling supplies and gold leaf  offer a seminars and comprehensive guides "how to" for gold leafing. Much more useful... About restoration - still searching for good info... 
 What? They aren't the best rock band in the world. The only rock songs that rock are Start Me Up and Shattered. What's the point? They used to play punk back in the 60's. They were never the best rock band in the world. Or maybe they are, they are a great band but they are way better than the Who. The Beatles suck 
 This book belongs in the genre of what I call Grouch Books: extensive  laments about costs and consequences of technology, but with no attempts at  syntheses or solutions. At every turn, the author paints a "no  exit" vision of the internet: if it's freewheeling and unregulated,  it's "chaotic" and "disorganized"; where it's  centralized, it is overbearing and freedom-robbing.   The author makes it  seem as though the people concerned with hardware and software development  are thoughtless, greedy, naive, or some combination. Any hint of  libertarian ideals in the shakers and movers of digital culture is  dismissed by Rochlin as naive and illusory, and every tendency of this  culture is, in his vision, toward loss of humanity and the replacement of  art with artifice.   This book is single-track thinking at its worst. And  to anyone who has experienced the benefits of digital culture and design,  the complaining tone grows tiresome and monotonous.  On those very rare  occasions when he begrudges some possible benefits of the internet,  Rochelin immediately qualifies them out of existence. The increased  information made available by the internet, for example, is seen as all  right for those who use it for "social development," but not for  "conversation and entertainment" -- as if mere conversation had  nothing to do with social development.   If readers want to read about the  costs and consequences of technology, they would be far better advised to  go through a book such as Neil Postman's *Technopoly.* While just as grim  in his assessment of the current state of affairs, Postman has a much  greater range, and at least has the intellectual stamina to propose a  solution 
 Don't bother with this unfunny, predictable, boring, pedestrian, fingerpainted drivel.  The piggy stole the show 
 This book came highly recommended and got some great blurbs, but in my opinion is quite overrated. The writing isn't particularly good, and there really isn't much meat. There are actually no REAL descriptions of most of the action. For instance, we know she and her two pals hated turning to cannibalism, but that's all (compare/contrast to "Life of Pi" by Yann Martel, which if full of gory detail of being stranded at sea, but that's what makes it real!). By the way, when one starving animal eats another starving animal, they still starve to death, because of the lack of essential fatty acids. Most mainstream fiction editors appear to have little if any knowledge of science, unfortunately. I came away from this read with very little in the way of vicarious experience and only a few (repetitive) visual images. It reads like a pretentious but untalented teenager's diary 
 As is typical with software claiming to be "topo", it is not. Expecting that the buyer of topos will typically be someone looking for USGS quads this software is not as advertised.  Since I own the other major competing program (for which you need to buy each state in order to get Quads (and for which I can not seem to find Wyoming)), I was eagerly awaiting this package.  In five minutes I realized Delorme is essentially useless to the backpacker/mountain biker (et al). You can order quads very simply using the package, but at the zoom level appropriate for making an ordering decision the wonks at Delorme decided they would make the map blank (apparently to force you into buying electronic quads at $2.50 a piece).  So, you need to actually know the quad you want before you order it.  Well, if I knew that, I would already own the quad, and certainly wouldn't need to buy an electronic version.  For 2.50 more I could get it laminated.  Yes, this is a flame, but it is deserved. Delorme might be great software if you know the quad you want; it is ridiculous software if you are trying to explore and area in order to decide where you want to go (and then download, and pay for, the appropriate map).  All in all, a complete waste of money--I only feel it worth my time to write this review so that the suppliers of such software get a clue and discover a more appropriate business model (versus selling blank maps, with a 100 dollar credit for maps that you don't even know will work)  Cheers. 
 If you'd like to enter Dennett's Fantasy Land of self-satisfied, materialist reduction then this is the book for you.  If, however, you're looking for a work by a philosopher who can critically examine and defend his own theories and presuppositions then this book will probably strike you as a monumental waste of time.  To be sure, Dennett knows how to construct arguments -- the problem is that they're question-begging arguments.  And unless you share Dennett's materialist presuppostions you're going to find almost every page of this book filled with question-begging naivet.  Dennett, of course, has his reasons.  He claims that Cartesian Mind-Body dualism leads to unsolvable problems, hence we should resolve such dualism in favor of the tanglible Body and think like good (that is, consistent) materialists.  (And never mind philosophy prior to Descartes -- especially Aristotle, for whom the word "body" necessarily implies an informing and organizing "soul" or "form".  Such a "form" is, in Aristotle's account, precisely the reason why bodies are organized and not simply inchoate matter.  But never mind all that.  Dennett isn't really interested in the history of philosophy, the meanings of words, or an opponent that isn't a straw-man.)  But, despite Dennett's insistence on materialist consistency, the book is plagued by an inconsistent double-think which brings back the Mind-Body problem in its full force.  We have (or seem to have) immediate experience of our own minds or consciousness.  Dennett encourages us to reductively translate such experiences into neural processes.  The problem is, that we have experiences without being directly aware of the neural processes that are correlated to them.  That is, what we experience is not a neural process.  We infer the neural process and assume its correlation to what we experience.  Hence, the correlation of a particular neural process to a particular experience is purely speculative or hypothetical -- or at least it's speculative and hypothetical when Dennett doesn't simply present such correlation as a dogmatic belief.  Such dubious correlation calls into question the validity of the Mind's reduction to (or "translation" into) the Body.  If such translation is purely hypothetical or speculative, then Dennett hasn't moved one step beyond Mind-Body dualism (his materialist rhetoric notwithstanding).  Or put it this way.  I have an experience.  Someone may use MRI to try to determine what neural processes occur during my experience.  That person is not going to know the contents of my experience (or mind).  For that, he or she needs to rely on my own immediate or immanent account of my experience.  In other words, the observer of my neural processes simply grafts my own immanent account of consciousness onto those neural processes and assumes their correlation.  Dennett apparently fails to see that such a procedure assumes the immanent validity of a Mind's immediate self-experience (contra materialism) and that he himself relies on this assumption in order to attribute significance to the observed neural processes.    Basically, Dennett tells us that ordinary ideas about the mind or consciousness are naive.  He then proposes to replace our supposedly mistaken ideas with his own naive and question-begging ideas about Mind-Body correlation.  Bottom line: don't waste your time with this book 
 Casualties?For pussies this band is no street punk band they are posers, all their songs are easily put together(anyone can write better songs), and they got a bunch of posers buying their cds, keep your money for something valuable(experiance the power of ska 
 Do not, I repeat, DO NOT read this book, as it is totally biased and the author is not an expert on the Middle East as she proclaims. She is not even fluent in any of the common Middle Eastern languages, thus has to rely on either translations or translators, which too are subject to biasness. There is nothing scholarly about this book 
 "The Man Who Sold the World" is an album that established a reputation-- David Bowie, pop songster and pyschedelic folkster, did a dramatic about-face and reinvented himself as a dark metal rocker.  In 2006, this sort of reinvention of Bowie is something that was expected, but in 1970, this must have been rather unexpected.  Influencing this change was no doubt the presecne of guitar hero Mick Ronson, whose embracing of distortion and feedback made this entirely possible.  The results of this change, quite honestly, are a lot more mixed then most Bowie fans would lead you to believe-- "The Man Who Sold the World" has been elevated to cult status and truthfully it's not that the album is bad per se, it's just that it's not particularly exciting.  Bowie lets us know right away that things have changed-- "Width of a Circle" is an extended cut drenched in feedback and distorted guitars with a galloping bassline (played by producer Tony Visconti) and a rambling vocal from Bowie.  No doubt it woke a lot of people up as to the change of direction, and it proves to be a decent number.  But Bowie seems incapable of really sustaining this and seems unsure how to integrate it into his idiom-- "All the Madmen" starts as a bleak acoustic ballad before overdriven guitars and a downright irritating synth line get in the way, "After All" ends up being a dull Lou Reedish ballad, and many of the metalish pieces are pretty much unmemorable ("She Shook Me Cold", the lyrically fantastic "Running Gun Blues").  The album closes on a high note, with the bizarre folk/metal fusion title track (made famous decades later by Nirvana's performance of it on MTV) and the fractured, paranoid, and downright bizarre metal churn of "The Superman", but the album is a bit too inconsistent to be a completely satisfying listen.  There's enough on here to make it worth a pickup for those exploring Bowie's catalog, but he'd do siginificantly better work in the very near future.  This one is more a curiosity 
 My overall recommendation is to read Bryson's brilliantly funny recent works, then go back to less recent works, then stop before you get to this one.  As other discerning reviewers have noted (especially Amer-Aussie, whose spot-on review you really must mark as 'helpful'), Bryson looks for the worst in America and, surprise, he finds it.  Sure, there's much that's funny here, but the humor gets swallowed up by the mean.  Let me add one more observation, which amazingly seems to have eluded all:  one of Bryson's worst habits--even worse than his penchant for telling you where he is politically (he hates Republicans)--is his smug disdain for and ridicule of religion, particularly Christianity.  Happily, Bryson's later books show a maturity absent in this one 
 OK, the rating is based on the description, not on the product - but how should I know if this is the right product if I can't tell what size it is 
 My bought this for my 3-year old daughter, she played for a few days and got tired of it and went back to her Dora's doll house, which is much much more durable and fun than this. 
 Please save your money! The so called "Heroine" was so annoying I sided with the bad guy. Enough said. 
 Somehow, everyone connected with this film managed to make a biopic about Cole Porter, one of the 20th century's greatest songwriters ("Anything Goes," "You're the Top," "Just One of Those Things," "In the Still of the Night"), into a hackneyed, boring, and overly sentimental cinematic equivalent of boiled tripe. The film focuses too much on his closeted struggles and romances with women, but to reduce Porter to this treatment is silly and salacious. Kevin Kline comes off as so blase as an aged Porter reminiscing about his life and legendary career, and it was difficult to empathize with someone so worldweary, emotionally distant, and lacking in any depth of feeling for the people he hurt throughout his life. I realize that being an artist involves a lot of time spent in isolation, perfecting one's artwork, but still, I would have preferred to see more of Porter's struggles as an artist (although he came from a wealthy Episcopalian family in Indiana, and was considered to be a millionaire dilettante by many songwriters on Broadway and Tin Pan Alley). I also would have liked to see more insight into his creative process instead of this "greatest hits" paean that, unfortunately, seems intent on killing off any younger viewer's budding interest in the man and his work. He wrote some of his best songs when trying to "write Jewish," as he reportedly explained to Richard Rodgers, in trying to imitate such successful songwriters as Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, and Rodgers. This film was a squandered opportunity 
 I wanted to like this book---I really did. In fact, I wanted to like it so much that I kept plodding all the way to the end despite the fact that I found it boring most of the time. I love books about cross-country travel, but this one had so much of what I considered just "padding" to fill pages. There were a few gems in the book, but not enough for me to recommend it to someone. It's as if he felt a compulsion to record all of his thoughts regardless of how inane they were or how meaningless they would be to the reader. The book represents a great concept poorly executed. 
 Ruby and the Rails framework (Ruby on Rails) have gotten major attention in the past year, primarily as an alternative to the complexities of using Java and J2EE APIs for typical N-tiered web applications using a Model / View / Controller framework.  "Programming Ruby" is supposed to be a combination of primer and reference for the Ruby language.  Compared to some of the "classics" in programming such as "Programming PERL" (Larry Wall), "The C Programming Language" (Kernigan & Ritchie) or "The C++ Programming Languate" (Stroustrup), this book falls way short as both a primer or reference.  First of all, if you're interested in Ruby at this point, you're probably interested in using the Rails framework built using Ruby.  This book provides NO information about Rails at all.  This isn't a fault of this book, it's just something you need to know because many code examples you'll find on the web aren't "Ruby" examples per se, they are examples of using APIs within the Rails framework.  Another book by this author is due out shortly covering Rails but based on the organization of this book, I would browse it in a bookstore before buying.  I've learned multiple programming langues over the years (Pascal, C, C++, a bit of Assembler, UNIX shell, PERL, Java) and I think most programmers expect any book on a programming language to tackle the material in the following order:  * installing the language * running or compiling a basic program * data types for the language * variables, assignment and data structures / objects * conditional expressions / control structures * unit / module organization for source code * advanced class / object concepts * standard libraries for DB, network, security functions, etc.  As another reviewer stated, this book doesn't explain the Ruby language's use of symbols (:somesymbol) until page 323, even though it would be logical to explain symbols at the same time Ruby's hash type is explained.  The difference between thisvariable, @thisvariable and @@thisvariable is explained very early but seems out of context because the scope of these variable types isn't clarified until the reference section.  I think most experienced programmers will find the sequencing of chapters in this book confusing.  You can definitely learn key aspects of Ruby from this book but this will definitely not be the only book you'll want or need if you are learning Ruby to use Rails.  Rails itself definitely shows some promise for simplifying some aspects of web development but I presume it will take another 2 years or so for the framework to stabilize and useful documentation to emerge.  It definitely isn't clear from this book how Ruby as an underlying language for the Rails framework was a better or needed choice over implementing something like Rails with PHP or PERL that have already achieved wide familiarity 
 Being a big fan of information, I was very interested in the book. But the contents were a huge disappointment. The writer spends too much time about telling stories of personal relations to the people behind the models, and the role of "information" in various parts of the book is lost quite completely.  There are, however very interesting and informative (sic) parts of the book. Noise in the Shannon-Weaver -model is described in a way that really tells more about the concept, both in the respect if information theory and everyday life. The effects of noise are brought up in several parts of the book, in various fashions.  The book is well-written, and easy to read. But title is misleading, and the contents are quite thin for somebody interested in the subject 
 I think there are two major problems with this tape. First, in no way it is suitable for beginners. Instructor cues  for breathing are inconsistent, about 50% of the time there is no cueing at all. Her cues for poses are very poor, she mostly mentions if the pose is hard to do or not. You cannot follow her without looking at your TV screen, and if you do not know which muscles to flex or stretch, 50% of the time she is not going to tell you. The program does contain two levels, for more and less flexible. Yet, transition from one pose to another is so quick that you can barely get your balance. Try Jane Fonda Yoga instead, or (and) Kundahlini yoga 
 Having read a few of Anne Tyler's books in the past, I was looking forward to reading her latest novel.  At best, I found the book to be wholly forgettable.  At worst, I found her bottom line premises, upon which the book is based, without much merit.  I say so with some personal insight.  I was born in America in 1944, the first in my family to be a native born American.  And yes, my parents spoke a "foreign" language at home, among themselves and with their friends and relatives.  I was schooled in the local public schools, and interacted with youngsters who came from all sorts of backgrounds.  This remained true as I went on to college, and then graduate school.  My family did not feel like it was outside of the American mainstream because they had their roots in Europe.  To the contrary, they felt blessed to be here, and never missed an opportunity to praise America and all it stood for.  While our parents spoke a concocted language to us (we called it Germglish), we fully understood their native tongue, while we (the children) only conversed in English (to them as well as to others). Our experience was not unique;  infact, most of the people we met came from similar homes and backgrounds.  Now, perhaps growing up in New York City is different from living in the Baltimore suburbs, but I don't really think so.  I think that the greatest thing about this country lies in the fact that ALL of us came from somewhere, either recently or once upon a time.  And while we may choose to interact with people who share similar backgrounds, I really can't imagine that most of us are embarassed that we are not the American stereotype...white, protestant, having ancestors who came over on the Mayflower.  For this reason, more than any other, I found the book to be based on faulty premises, and when the central feature of a book doesn't ring true, the whole book ends up being less than fulfilling. 
 Slow, dry, and dull. If you are really into Zen it might be for you, but if you are you will want more. If the reader is Catholic they will be dissapointed. This is a typical book of its period, post Vatican II and during the greatest phase of experimentation. 
 Ok I bought this as the download version instead of the cassette because I thought I was buying the version that alan rickman reads. instead there is this awful robotic voice that you can hardly understand. I've read the book myself before and loved it and figured it would be that much more incredible hearing it read by someone with a brilliant voice but I was of course mistaken in thinking this was it. Buy the cassette version and don't waste your money on this download 
 This book's findings are pure fantasy and have been repudiated by the work of Norman Finkelstein.  Bard's a biased author to start with AND claiming the Palestinians are not native to the land even though they speak a unique Southern Levantine dialect is patently absurd.  Not recommended either for its simplicity or deliberate duplicity.  Take a college course or use the web for comparative information.  Otherwise, getting your info. from Bard will have left you as clueless about the region as before 
  Hello,  (I trully hope you don't lose your money, because it trully hurts to buy something so expensive with high hopes).  =( trust me, this doesn't work, i sadly bought both of them Body Bare and LAdyfair. I spent over $300.00 including s/h and boy was i dissapointed.  I would like to say, that if you would like to purchase a personal trimmer or private area shaver you should think about it, i would like to tell you so that no one else is fooled by the looks or sites. I also bought everything with it! i got the entire combo and more. Since i wanted to be completely shaven without having to go through brazilian waxing pain i researched for over 2 weeks!!!!  2 weeks! none stop to make sure i bought the right product. Body bare or Ladyfair are the same. These trimmers don't do anything, sadly a normal shaver is better than this. Plus it leaves BUMPS AND RASHES!!!! 
 The review is too detailed to be a review.  If I wanted to retake the Euro course, I would suggest this book.  Moreover, the "practice tests" are extremely different than the actual AP test, making the "six practice exams" effectively useless 
 this book needed more meat, it was not helpfu 
 Frued was an interesting figure in history but a very troubled individual. He theorized based on his own feelings and beliefs about things (i.e. - Oedipus Complex, a son wants to kill his father and marry his mother) and also made a lot of generalizations from a handful of case studies of equally troubled individuals. When held up to scientific scrutiny, Freud is little more than an interesting appearance on Jerry Springer. He was addicted to cocaine, smoked dozens of cigars a day, and in the end took his own life. He should be surplanted as "the Father of Psychology" by B.F. Skinner or possibly Watson. They have done much more to make Psychology a science. 
 Hard to install, ridiculously confounding installation directions, and when you're done, it's flimsy. Don't waste your money 
 I feel I must be missing something as there are so many positive reviews for this book. I did not even finish it. All of the reviews say it is smart and funny. I suppose I'm not bright enough and don't have the sense of humor it takes to appreciate this book. To me, it appears to be nonsensical stream of consciousness dribble. Just writing with no real clear direction or organization. I am a fan of Vonnegut's other works. Unfortunately, this one was not for me. I'm not sure what others saw in it that I didn't. Maybe they're just very loyal to Vonnegut. I don't know. I cannot recommend this book. 
 Badly written book 
 "Con Express" has lots of action in it, which is great because this hides the poor writing and uninteresting characters. Unfortunately, the action isn't enough, and in between stunt pieces and shoot-outs, the audience is tempted to doze off. City Heat Productions isn't really known for producing films of the highest quality, so usually I go easy on them. If this were a big-budget company producing this, I'd be inclined to pan it entirely. But I wasn't expecting much and got a little more than I bargained for. The action is, for the most part, pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action movie. Flanery and Vosloo are perfectly casted, but everyone else seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie. Vosloo especially appears to be enjoying himself as an over-the-top bad guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals. The film moves fast and contains shades of better movies like Under Siege 2, Con Air, Spy Game, and Speed. If you liked those, you probably won't mind this one too much. Just go easy on it 
 I just bought these to compare to my pair of V20s, and they just suck in comparison.  The Bass is non existent in comparison, and the highs and mids sound absolutely tinny. Any sort of Equilizer work resulted in immediate distortion.   I'm usually a fan of Altec Lansing products, but... These look nice and are compact, but the sound is not good, at all. The fact that they are more expensive than the competition is just appalling... 
 I do video work and was attracted to the sale price and extra height of this particular tripod.  Come to find out, this model does not have a fluid head, meaning, if you do any panning with a camcorder, it won't be as smooth as you'd probably like it to be.  Also, at the end of a pan the head tends to "unwind," causing your panned image to back up a little ways.  Thus, I think it's rather misleading to label this as a "Photo / Video" tripod.    Additionally, I don't really care for the cheap feel of some of the plastic knobs and adjusters.  Finally, mine came with a few, very minor cosmetic blemishes, almost as if it were used.  Instead of video, I'll be utilizing this one as a microphone mount.  If you want to do video, please buy a tripod with a fluid head.  You'll love it, I guarantee that.  That's why I give this one 2 stars 
 I love Georgette Heyer's books, particularly her later ones.  This book was such a disappointment.  It was tedious, with unlikeable characters and no romance.  The book never seemed to build to a climax just dragged on.  Do not buy this book - look for The Grand Sophy or The Reluctant Widow 
 There's plenty of raw energy here, and this would have made a good 50-100 page novella.  Alas, it's 350 pages long! The astonishingly randy protagonists make love three or four times a day, and we hear about it every time, along with what they have for breakfast, how they get dressed (and undressed), etc., etc., etc. The style can be most charitably described as pedestrian.  Sample sentence: "They quickly put the dishes in the dishwasher and zoomed to the theater in Scott's vehicle". And the book (self-published) is full of errors of grammar and spelling.  Annoyingly, this is really just the first half of a book: several themes are introduced (coming out to family and classmates, the homophobic Joe) which apparently get resolved in the so-called sequel, which is really the second half of this book. Maybe I'm just an old grouch.... late teen readers may enjoy this book (and quite a few did, judging from the reviews), but you can do better elsewhere 
 I wanted to like Block Party. I dig Chappelle's comedy, I like most of the musical line up, and have read lots of great reviews of this film; so, I expected to enjoy this movie more than I did (anticipating maybe 20-30 total minutes of Chappelle doing new stand up material between the music sets). I found the Block Party's paucity of its host's performance disappointing. Given, it's called "Block Party," but it's still reasonable to assume that the "Dave Chappelle's" part indicates that Dave will actually give a performance during it. Maybe "Dave Chappelle hosts a block party featuring mostly other performers" would be a more apt title.   The musical guests gave great performances -- those watching mostly for the music aren't likely to be disappointed. Those watching for the comedy, however: be prepared for a lot of music and a few human interest clips with locals in Dave's Ohio town and at a Brooklyn daycare -- not Dave performing any new stand up material or skits.   The great reviews this film got in most media aren't for new Chappelle comedy material, rather for the movie's concept, message, and music. 
 So you may be wondering why the 1 star review...  It's because I bought the Audio CD and the recording stinks!  I mean really stinks, as in, it was recorded in computer dragon speak and you can't understand it at all except for the occasional "so says poor Richard".  This has been a great lesson to me in purchasing audio books from unknown publishers.  I feel ripped off.  Don't make the same mistake yourself 
 Here, presented in a gentle Earth mother (or stoned-out hippie?) tone, is a lot of interesting information about self-medicating with herbs, especially as related to sexual, pregnancy and birth issues.   However, am I the only one bothered because the author not only promotes combining sexual activity and psychedelic drug use, but specifically suggests that some pregnant mothers-to-be consider ingesting LSD so they can "trip out" with their fetuses?  Here is the author's quote about LSD from page 81,  part of the same paragraph where she writes about the difficulties of "planning those orgiastic trips at infertile times of one's cycle":  "If you feel comfortable making the decision to trip with your baby (baby getting a magnified dose due to her tinier body weight or mass), then make an informed decision. Refer to science, your own experience, and information coming from any channel. LSD is magnificent and for a fetus, it must be ultra-magnificent-but is it dangerous?"  The author never answers her question about the dangers ofpsychedelicizing a fetus, the implication being that women should trust their "feelings" on the matter (with no indication if it matters if you are stoned or straight while tuning into those "feelings.")   I'm not square, (to answer Jimi Hendrix's famous question, yes, I am experienced) and you can blame it on me being male, but first off, never mind it being illegal, LSD is not an herb, and second, isn't it a little irresponsible to suggest to young, pregnant mothers that it might be a "magnificent" idea to dose their fetuses with hallucinogenic street drugs?  On the very next page the author writes about peyote suppositories and  women inserting slices of the hallucinogenic cactus "high in their vaginas like a cervical cap." If such things are appealing to you, hey, far out. But can we leave the children and fetuses out of it, please. Thank you.  And what exactly is the purpose of including, on page 12, a full-page close-up photograph of the abdomen and bare genitalia of a prepubescent girl?   File this book under "What The Heck Were They Thinking (or Ingesting)? 
 While I've had the pleasure of hearing Don Campbell speak, his information is, sadly, quite flawed. As others have rightly noted, the "science" in this book is simply horrible and there are many with his comments concerning classical music. The fact that he also copyrighted the term "Mozart Effect" is also deplorable. Finally, this type of book is responsible for placing music and sound on the backburner at many research institutions as it falsely implies that the use of music and sound belongs to "new age" nonsense. As a rule, I cringe when I see that someone else has used this book as a reference to back up other poor research. 
 Caring for perennials is often a gardening area that many people either avoid or misunderstand . Just because a plant is " scheduled " to re-appear for another year, there ARE certain conditions which should be provided for plants to ensure that event. This book clearly and concisely, does that. It assists both novices and master gardeners with wonderful information. Highly recommended for ANY gardener or level of ability. Carl Kokes- Peru, New York  ( very northern NY State 
 I thought the plot, storyline and the key characters were interesting. But what turned me off completely was the Jesus and God references. After what I felt was one too many, I gave up.  This is definitely my first and last Brockman novel 
 The foil is abrasive and can cause razor bumps. Also the shave is not close and will missed areas around my rear jaw line that my Remington gets fairly easily. Overrated and overpriced eurotrash. 
 perhaps it's a bit unfair because lucinda engenders such high expectations, but i was really disappointed with this record the songwriting is weak, the singing is weak, and the arrangements are dull  something kicked all the life out of the music--the songs are not all the same, but for some reason they all sound the same--and embarrassingly, you can sing most of them after one listen, they are so simplistic and cliched 
 "You saw nothing in Hiroshima. Nothing" is what he said. Hiroshima Mon Amour depicts the reality of the bombing of Hiroshima, which took place on August 6, 1945.  The story begins with two bodies against each other with multiple clips of the results of the bombing.  When I watched this movie for the first time, I realized this movie was far from a fairy tale.  Instead, this movie captured reality and could be described as the "fiction" aspect of history William Gass explains in "The Nature of Narrative".  Throughout the entire movie the main character, a woman from France explains the hardships she went through back at home.  It was disturbing for me to watch the movie as it went back in time where she was taunted for have been in love with a German soldier.  I felt it violated a person's right as to whom he/she may date.  It was also unbearable to watch the clips where it shows the end results after the bombing of Hiroshima.  The fact that this movie was made in 1959 the black and white picture made it difficult for me to read the subtitles.  Lastly, the one thing I must question about this movie is the fact that it was told in French.  I couldn't help but get frustrated that the movie started from an awkward stage of the overall story.  It seems as though it skipped the introduction and went straight into the rising of the climax.  I didn't like that they both speak of the war with no clear explanation as to what they're really talking about.  If a person who was completely oblivious about the history of Hiroshima were to watch this movie, he/she that's watching would have a hard time comprehending the overall point of the movie.  
 Mathematical Methods for Physicists can be seen as a reference on the mathematics that appear in physics. The style is brief and most topics are scattered throughout the book, which is designed to allow readers to catch up at any point. On the back-hand side this implies that the provided information will be brief and does not make use of the mathematics that should be explored, examples will follow. Chapter 3 Determinants and matrices fall short of the jordan canonical form, which is at the heart many areas in physics, such as dynamical systems. Also, due to the theoretical applications of this form, such as in proofs, the discussion of linear algebra remains very unsatisfactory at best. The next chapter is on Algebra, the discussion is mostly in terms of examples, that the book discusses differential forms, considering the prior technical discussion in chapter 4 can, and should, be questioned. An alternative, and good, reference for this topic is Peter Szekeres A Course in Modern Mathematical Physics. Chapters 5-8 are considerably better, although if new to calculus of residues the reader is advised to refer to eg. Sadri Hassani, Mathematical Physics.  Chapter 9. Differential equations is very informal, mostly examples, and actually almost no theory is developed, and systems of differential equations remain untouched. The Frobenius method, although important, is only briefly discussed, which is hardly enough to anyone. All above also applies to PDE, almost no methods are developed. Fourier series and Fourier transforms are almost non-existing here (appear only later, in chapter 14.), although very important and should be appearing alongside the theory of PDE. Chapters 11-13 are devoted to special functions, and the approach of generating functions has been largely adopted. On the positive side this simplifies a lot, but again many will feel the discussion too brief and glossy. Chapters 14-16 are adequate, but again remain mostly apart from the theory of PDE, which is a clear downfall. Chapter 18. Nonlinear Methods and Chaos is in terms of examples and not much, if any, understanding can be gained. This theory relies much on differential geometry, linearisation and theory of ODE, which are not presented in this book, making the entire chapter more or less page filling.  All in all, the book has more short-comings than strengths, and the linkage between the chapters, such as integral transformations and PDE, is unsatisfactory at best. As such the book fails as a good reference. Also, a large amount of important theory is missing. 
 I agree to the term "out-of-ear" ear buds/headphones. None of the 3 sizes ear  buds worked for me. Whether I moved or not didn't matter. Just after 5 seconds I start to play music, the ear buds get out of my ears and bass sound has totally gone.  Indeed, this item is for a few "chosen ones". For instance, my girlfriend did like it, and that's why I purchased this. I realized I am not a chosen one. 
 The book was supposed to be a translation, but the author has ended up publishing her biases in the garb of presenting it in narrative form. A quick search on the author reveals that she is a controversial character and that Encarta removed her contribution after investigating her scholarship.   As someone interested in learning about Hinduism, I was looking for someone who could just give me the facts instead of a polemicist. The book was a huge disappointment. I wish I had known about Encarta yanking her piece on the grounds of poor scholarship before I embarked on reading her "translation. 
 Use Maxell or Fuji disks.  They work flawlessly 
 This movie was loaned to Me, (Thank God I did'nt rent it) and is the biggest waste of a few hours of My life ever! The acting is so horrible it made Me cringe,and the cuts in the movie were done to where it seemed like it had been edited for tv.This is supposed to be a black comedy? It's NOT funny, and the so called violence in it made Me yawn, seriously, I've seen more gore on the Simpsons. There are so many things in the movie that are AMAZINGLY unbelievable, K. Sutherland walks for miles to a hospital with a bullet through His neck, head,and two in the back.R. Witherspoon overpowers Sutherland (For the second time) and strangles Him, pretty good for a 90 pound teenage girl huh?  But, I do think Everybody should watch this movie once so You can see what a movie should NOT be.(Besides, misery loves company 
 I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the  "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me 
 I am a fan of Shillington and I expected more from this book. His effort to glorify African leaders and condemn Europeans makes this text biased and inaccurate. I would recommend Blaine Harden's "Africa: Dispatches from a Fragile Continent.&quot 
 One of the few Anna Riva books that I own, this one actually does contain some useful knowledge and instruction.  (There is also a lot of garbage too.....just have to sort it out!)  I am ambivilent about recommending it.....buy it or don't....either way, you are not missing much 
 This pocket guide has several APA Style mistakes. The example paper is the most misleading.  The text says one thing and the example shows another. e.g. putting the short title on the figure page.  My students were very frustrated with it 
 This movie must be restored--the quality of picture is unacceptable beginning with Bloody Mary's singing Bali Hi. I tried to purchase a completely restored, digitally remastered DVD of this musical and could not find one in 2007.  I returned this DVD to the seller 
 Tao is frequently translated as 'reason' in this translation and I personally believe that this is a folly and a fatal flaw. Tao can be reason, following tao is a reasonable thing to do. However Tao can also be instinct which is almost the opposite of reason. Most translations do not attempt to replace the word Tao with another, Tao is the indescribable, the formless, the nameless - to try to define it with a restrictive English word such as 'reason' is ill advised. Clearly defining Tao takes 81 chapters of philosophy and common sense, it cannot be abbreviated into two syllables 
 NOTE: MY TOPIC IS ABOUT THE WIND DONE GONE AND NOT SLAVERY(which I hate)!  Not liking the negro portrayal in GONE WITH THE WIND,Alice Randall therefore created her own version, a parody of the acclaimed southern classic.Therein lies the problem.  The trouble with parodies,it so intertwind with the original that it can be used as a sequel,a retelling or a new story with characters copied from the original but this time superior while degrading the original.So much so,readers begin to accept these false truth as the true truth.Not openly but in disguise, words like "what if" & "perhaps".Why?Because people always like scandals to famous chracters fiction or not.When that happen, a novel,even w/ the purest intent and purpose,gets butchered.  Here are some cases to prove my point & where the book failed:  1.THE PARODY/CONCEPT ITSELF-The whole purpose of this book is to show negroes aren't dumb and capable.If you read GWTW,as others call it"White-washed"&"Romantized",is in fact a love story.Plus Mitchell was trying to show how a civilization changes after a war,what better way to illustrate it than the old south?  But why portray negroes like that? Obviously these fools didn't see Aunt Pitty,Hugh Elsing or Ashley.Aren't they white,helpless,pathetic and idiots?  If you read GWTW, What about the courageousness&modesty of Pork,The industriousness &loyalty of Dilcey?What about Uncle Peter who single handly raised Charles&Melanie,who looked after and Protected Aunt Pitty?What about Rhett and Scarlett declaring Mammy as a smart old soul?Aren't these persons Negro and admirable traits?  2.MAMMY KILLING THE 3 SONS-In p.663 GWTW, a yankee tells Scarlett "do you think i can trust my babies to a negro?" She thought otherwise,and now Mammy kills Gerald's sons.Its thesame as saying negroes can't be trusted and they kill white babies and Randall was trying to show Negroes in a different light.This damages her&the book's credibility.Noble as her intent,but no good can come out of evil means.Its better to kill 10 people than 1 baby,as the saying goes.  3.GERALD/MAMMY-Check the background story of Ellen/Gerald.There can be no doubt of his fidelity.It takes a great deal of emotion for a person to get unhinged after a loved one's death.  4.CYNARA-She is an exact copy of Scarlett even their ages are thesame but this time she smart,beautiful,brown,a good mother compared to Scarlett.She even has Scarlett's strength & Rhett even prefers her.Ridiculous!if Rhett likers her than Scarlett he would've married her instead,or divorce scarlett after he have is way with her,Rhett boast of being ill-bred so his rep. wont matter.Why this nonesense of mistress and after death marriage?  The book,despite being well-written,feels like a parasite after reading created by a first-time author who wants instant fame,fortune making others accept and embrace that her work is better while destroying others hard work. If you want a book about the attrocities of slavery then buy UNCLE TOM's CABIN which is BETTER than this one.  NOTE: MY TOPIC IS ABOUT THE WIND DONE GONE AND NOT SLAVERY(which I hate)! 
 about metal working than this terribly mis-titled book.  Read the other low rated reviews.  They cover the problems well enough.  Only thing I can figure is all the 5 star reviews are friends of the author or something.   One guy mentions how much he learns about metal shrinking.  My question is how?  It is mentioned many times.  In one place they have a photo caption saying heat shrinking works by heating a spot and then blasting with air to quick cool it.  As for mechanical shrinkers, they never tell you how they work.  Or give any info on how to figure out how much or how to really shrink metal.  You will learn it can be shrunk and pretty much nothing else.   For someone wanting to learn metal work, it isn't useless.  It is pretty close to it.  You honestly can learn more by watching some Biker Build Offs as metal is worked in the background.  I haven't been this disappointed in a book in many years. 
 I thought I was going to get a thriller when I first heard of this.  Instead I got a pseudo-sequel to COLD MOUNTAIN set in 1980 Texas, and I have rather low opinions of COLD MOUNTAIN.  It was difficult to follow the story due to McCarthy's decision to not only avoid using quotation marks to identify dialogue (a move I've always considered to be a pretentious affectation), but also commas, apostrophes, and proper spelling, such as not capitalizing "English" or using "livingroom" instead of "living room" and "mam" instead of "ma'am."  I don't know if this is something McCarthy does in all his books or this was a one-time deal, but it was a major turnoff and made the experience grueling rather than enjoyable.  I also didn't see the relevance of the italicized monologues of Sheriff Bell at the beginning of each chapter/section, as he tended to ramble on about life after  World War Two and how it wasn't uncommon to see 22-year-olds as ordained ministers or 25-year-olds as sheriffs of counties the size of Delaware.  Hopefully its movie adaptation (which I legitimately pity the Coen Brothers for having to wade through) is more accessible 
 I purchased this device for my Windows 2003 Home server in January 2007.  I did not notice that the box says supported systems were Win XP, 2000, Me, 98SE, NT4.0. Rarely do consumer level goods list Win Server 2000 or 2003 as options.  In all cases, drivers for these other OS can be found on the vendor's web site.  Not the case with Netgear.    I installed the card and proceeded to load the drivers (from CD).  The CD said it required XP, etc, so I went to the vendor's web site to obtain the most current ones.  The most recent driver for WINXP was from 2003!  I was not able to use the dreivers form the vendor's web site, but another comment here about Netgear using RealTEK chipsets sent me on the right path.  I was able to install the drivers for the RealTEK Gigabit adapter w/o issue.  I've sworn off D-Link due to multiple issues with rebates that they have refused to pay.  I'm now adding in Netgear to the list due to poor driver support. For me, it's Linksys only.  Why mess with others when you can have Cicso (owner of Linksys) in your corner.  
 This "book" is 30 pages of general information about Hashimoto's, and a couple of vague pages on diet, all of which is easily available on the web. The poor writing, lack of content, and the 80 pages of worksheets in the back of the "book" were disappointing. This information should be published as a pamphlet, not a book. Don't waste your money here, just Google "hashimotos.

 While the author is certainly knowledgable, the tone of the book is decidedly pedantic and offensive. He lumps all free trade skeptics together, from GreenPeace to Pat Buchanan, from Joe Stiglitz to Chairman Mao. And even throws Al-Qaeda in for good measure. People opposed to market worship "fall rather into the category of spoiled children" who are blissfully ignorant of reality. This is the starting point of the book, and this attitude continues throughout.  If you want to reinforce your market-oriented convictions, and have a tremendously belittling view of people who don't agree with you, you will love this book. If you want a measured, unbiased and well-reasoned discussion, keep looking 
 Don't buy this book, it refers to applications written in early '90. Today it is completely a different story 
 Apart from the fiddly nature of the charger it does all it says apart from the one main thing if you intend to have it connected to your car whilst driving the charger is not shielded thus a ridiculously loud hum can be heard through the sound system as it charges for the sake of a cheap shielding mechanism to prevent this problem could be easily solved buy at your own peri 
 I got the dreaded "E18" error after owning this (naturally) for just over a year.  Repairs will be at least $100, and REPAIRS ARE ONLY GUARANTEED FOR 90 DAYS...even if the exact same problem occurs again!  This is clearly a design flaw (just read how many users had the same problem).  My first PhotoShot broke after about a year and a half, and since I liked the ease of use and basic design, I chalked it up to bad luck and bought another.  Big mistake 
 I read A is for Alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series.  Years later I read S is for Silence and was hooked. I started to read the series--backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning.  I have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine (and forgiven Ms. Grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6" frame).  However, I agree with the other readers who feel like this is not Grafton at her best.  You just can't believe that Kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions---belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating, remaining in an incredibly (and unbelievable) dangerous situation, to name a few.  The dialogue is weak,the sexual situations seem gratutitous, and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics.  But even with these issues, I did finish the book.  Grafton at her low point is still a good read 
 This is a disgraceful garment. I am not kidding when I say that the "sweater" is less than 1 MM thick. The best description that I could give you is tracing paper. It is virtually see-through. When I put it on for the first time, all of the tags ripped off as it is poorly constructed. There is also an obnoxious "Z" on the left chest area. Very tacky. This will be in the very back of my closet until I get around to donating it or throwing it away. Miserable, Miserable purchase. 
 I have read some wonder novels by Coetzee, and so without hesitation I purchased 'Elizabeth Costello'.  What a mistake!  'Elizabeth Costello' is really not so much of a novel but rather a forum for the other to pontificate on a whole slew of life and death philosophical matters.  Such verbage might be of interest to the top 0.1% of the populace with multiple doctorates and too much time on their hands.  For everyone it's simply the sort of book that screams out "don't read me!".   Bottom line: maybe better served as fodder for a doctoral thesis 
 The first few Alex Cross novels were really quite good.  But for some reason, beginning with Violets Are Blue the quality of the stories began to deteriorate, becoming worse and worse and worse and worse.  The plot of Violets Are Blue is disjointed and full of holes, and the writing is juvenile.  Please don't waste your time or money with this book or any subsequent Alex Cross novels.  I purchased and read them all.  The first six Alex Cross novels remain in my library.  The others have been recycled 
   To be sure, there are some intriguing speculations in this book, such as the one concerning the distinction between the historic Jesus of Nazareth and the Christ, and the  --- not all that novel  --- analysis of the Jewish Tanakh and of the two Christian Testaments purely as literary texts. These speculations, if properly stretched, could fill a quaint fifty minute lecture. But to keep holding forth for the full two-hundred-some pages it takes to fill a book, of necessity takes Harold Bloom out of his depth, to where the same quite trivial points are being repeated over and over. Obsessive repetition would not be out of place in a religious text, but in a literary analysis it signals careless editing and/or a dearth of ideas.  Bloom informs the reader that he worships neither at Yahweh's nor at the Christian God's altar. Instead, we catch him worshipping at William Shakespeare's admittedly superb altar; indeed he acts as if he were the bard's latter day grand ayatollah. He keeps telling the reader and then forever reminding him, that in this capacity he has the biblical characters paired with Shakespearean characters, Jesus with the Danish prince Hamlet and Yahweh with the erratic King Lear. Hamlet and Lear appearing in different plays, do not get to exchange any dialogue, and wouldn't you know, nor do their biblical counterparts, just arias, no duets.   By the author's reckoning, the historic Jesus was the greatest "Jewish genius" before Sigmund Freud of all people. This does not deter Bloom from issuing the additional fatwa that Freud's oedipal take on the Danish prince is all hogwash. For all anyone knows, this may even be so. I, for one, find the oedipal interpretation of Hamlet more amusing than convincing.  Bloom however doesn't even amuse, nor does he bother to present any convincing arguments in his refutation of Freud. But then, fatwas will be fatwas and, in all fairness, Bloom never claims to be a "Jewish genius." 
 Rogers and Hammerstein's "Cinderella" is one of my favorite musicals ever! But does this rendition do it justice? Absolutely not!!!!! More glitz and fancier costumes do not a make a better musical by any means. Maybe if I was not enamored with Leslie Ann Warren or Julie Andrews who make far better Cinderellas I would have enjoyed this. I am not against a politically correct image like this story attempts but if it was done tastefully i would have appreciated it better. If you are a Rogers and Hammerstein fan like I am, you want to watch it anyway but its not merely as charming as the other ones. Its ALOT more exciting that the Julie Andrews version was recently found save your money and buy that one. However a younger audience or an audience that was not enamored with the other Rogers and Hammerstein Cinderellas will appreciate it far better 
 I am a white woman who has been married to a black man for 14 years, and who has two biracial children. I think it is sad and ridiculous that anyone would read a book like this, and honestly believe its premise that black men dating white women is destroying the black family. Black family structure in the U.S. is breaking down for a whole host of reasons entirely unrelated the TINY percentage of interracial marriages taking place in the U.S., such as the high percentage of black men in prison, high unemployment rates in the black community, terrible  urban public education systems that don't adequately prepare black children/teens for jobs and college, etc. If anyone wants to know what the REAL causes of black family breakdown are, read "When Work Disappears" by William Julius Wilson. To blame interracial couples for such a complex problem is foolish and only serves to distract people from working on the real issues.   I am also sick of hearing that every black man who dates/marries a white woman does so out of a desire to have the "forbidden fruit". My husband and I have a strong, loving relationship that has withstood many rough times, and that is NOT about race. Sure, we have cultural differences (different preferences in music, food, etc.), but the only time RACE comes into play in our relationship is when other people force it on us, and make it an issue (no, I am not naive, and think that racism doesn't exist). We married for the same reason same-race couples do - LOVE. I have plenty of other interracial couple friends (black women with white men, and white women with black men), and they too married for love, NOT because of the so-called "taboo" of interracial relationships.   Furthermore, I have nothing against black women. Most of my friends (including my best friend of 10 years) are black women. I didn't set out to "steal" a black man to spite black women. People need to get over their fears, ignorance, and predjudice about interracial relationships, and direct their energy towards the real issues that need to be addressed in U.S. society 
 My 8 year-old daughter hated the music and wouldn't listen to it.  I'd put it in the CD player anyway.  She disliked it so much that she took it out of the car and hid it!  I was hopeful that this would work 
    This book is absolutely disgusting! Oh it'll teach your kids how to have sex alright! It will also teach them the "fun and friendly" way to masturbate have group sex and different sexual positions all in full color pictures!! It will teach them that they can have sex, whether normal or perverted, without any fear of consequences. But perhaps the worst atrocity of this book is that it teaches girls to abort their babies. It even gives nine 'perfectly normal' reasons why a girl should abort. Of course they fail to mention all of the consequences and after effects post-abortive women go through. Not to mention killing their own child. Please! Please! Do not subject your children to this piece of garbage 
 Dumb book, too borring. Better off reading "The Rules", much more entertaining 
 This book was simply not up to Baldacci's usual quality.  The story goes all over the place, but doesn't get anywhere until the last 50 pages.  Even after 200, 300, and even 400 pages we are still chasing dead ends and no closer to figuring out where this thing is going.  I don't mind suspense, but you can stay "suspended" only so long until it becomes boredom.  The main character is the worst one Baldacci has ever created.  One minute she is crying her eyes out, and puking her guts out totally paralyzed by fear, and the next minute she is tracking down trained bad guys and saving the lives of the inept FBI agents and police.  This is repeated throughout the story.........I would think she had worn out all the emotional crap by the end of the book.  She makes one blunder after another resulting in the deaths of innocent people, but at the same time comes up with brilliant deductions that help her stay one step ahead of the mastermind killers.  By the end of the book I found myself pulling for the sadistic killer to finally finish this stupid [...] off.    This is one of those books to keep next to the bed in case you are having trouble sleeping. 
 I, like so many other's, was stupid enough to buy this guide not realising the mystery's within. I still havnt got %100 thanks to this guide and can say now that i will never buy a Bradly guide again.   Everything is all mixed up in there,(Locations of all inportant things such as Horseshoes, tags ect) there must of been no proof reading what so ever... SO I SUGGEST TO EVERYONE, DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF... ...GUIDE 
 I really love the first Nightmare on Elm street movie. the rest of the series are just absurd and borderline ridiculous. I thought this movie would be better since Wes Craven was directing/writing it. In my opinion it's everything but scary.The concept of this evil entitity trapped in stories for eons is interesting, however not very well explored in my opinion.The scenes remind us of the first Nightmare on Elm Street, a bit cool when it comes to nostalgia but they completely have no surprise effect whatever. It was nice to see some people of the original movie, like John Saxon and Nick Corrie. Yet they have such small roles which undermines their presence in the movie.Corrie doesn't even have a line. The "scary" scenes are actually hilarious at some points. This movie could have been better in my opinion.. 
 As a practicing Odinist, I find this book to be extremely persecuting. Because of this author, and many like him i might add, many people are misled to think that all Odinists are White Supremacists, which just is not true. I think authors, like this pud, should be more wary in there choice of words and make it known with even the vaguest acknowledgement that a small faction of Odinists is of an Aryan mentality. I had to say my piece in defense of all my indiscriminate Odinist sisters and brothers in the world, so farewell 
 The premise of this book is that Kessler is looking for "the next big thing" to invest in.  What area in healthcare is scalable so that it can be made smaller/faster/cheaper thus saving/making money.  Just like computers have gotten faster and cheaper - he is on a mission to find something similar in the world of medicine.    Kessler is a smart guy and also, as he points out so many times in the book, very well connected.  But reading a few articles in WebMD and a paragraph or two in the PDR does not make him a doctor, nor does it make him capable of understanding medicine to the point where he should be writing a book about how to change the medical world.  The idea that you could get rid of doctors and some day have computers do all the medicine is mind-boggling.  Even if computer programs were sophisticated enough to do the surgeries or replace the radiologists, who is going to program these machines or run these tests?   The world of medicine has gotten expensive because of more regulations, more malpractice, more formularies, more hoop jumping, more administrative work and more middlemen between the patient and the doctor.  America has the best healthcare available but few are getting it because the insurance companies are dictating what can and can't be done, when it should be done, who you can see and how often you can see them. If you want good care, seek a specialist and pay cash.  If you need to treat something like a cold that's probably going to go away anyway whether you do something or not, Kessler's idea of the ATM-like medicine dispensers in the pharmacy is fine.    I would not recommend this book for anything more than a conversation starter.   
 So far I have read all of Danielle Steel's books and have kept every single one of them in hardcover.  I look forward to reading Impossible and Miracle soon.  But I just didn't care for the character of Fiona at all.  Not my type of person so I didn't care for reading about her at any cost.  I loved the character of John; he's a doll!  Fiona was nothing but a self centered, self absorbed woman who thought only of herself and how she can constantly benefit herself.  I have no idea what John saw in her; I guess it was her beauty.  Talk about total opposites!  I don't blame his daughters for disliking her! The other women in Danielle's books were much nicer and had much better personalities.  Because of Fiona, I didn't enjoy the book at all.  I couldn't wait to finish it.  I was hoping that he would leave her altogether and find someone more to his liking.  Unfortunately he stuck by her.  
 This GMRS 2-way radio claims to have "UP TO 16 MILE RANGE".  However, on the back of the packaging there is a statement in very small print that reads, "Maximum range can only be achieved over water or open rural areas under optimum conditions."  I live in a housing development in FL that has one small hill running through it.  That small hill and the houses (all one story ranch) limits this radio's range to less than one mile!  That's no better than a non-GMRS 2-way radio!  The lack of range is reason enough to not recommend this radio. However, the real "kicker" is that in order to leagally operate these GMRS radios, you must pay a $80 fee to obtain an FCC license! Bottom line: Save your money. This radio's "long-range" capability is "incapable" unless you live in the "flatlands" or on a boat.    
 I remember buying a record by DNA when it first came out...and I was really surprised later when arto lindsay and the ambitious lovers were able to turn this mess into great music. This is very unprofessiona 
 With original publication in 1940, this book brings to life only the "basics" of the con, important to know, yet, in this modern era of so many new embellishments, woefully inadequate.More specifically:  the "legalization" of all sorts of con games is becoming a threat to every business person and consumer.  This trend is totally missed.A much better book for the hi-tech era is Les Henderson's, Crimes of Persuasion: Schemes, Scams, Frauds.  It is a virtual encyclopedia of the Modern Con.       
 sorry it just did...too dramatic not enough party tracks. i guess if you want that it's cool. but i like people under the stairs and ugly duckling better 
 Has this been any other author, I would have stopped reading after the first few chapters.  But as is sometimes the case with her earlier works, I kept reading on in hopes that the book would get better - it didn't.  After I got through enough of the book (having only about 100 page left to read), I just had to skip to the end to get the experience over with.  As another reviewer worded, this was quite one-dimensional and the characters were a bit disturbing, but not in the good sense, and the story just dragged on for far too long.  I grew annoyed having put so much time into reading this and it was quite the let down.  Tyler's later works are much better and if you want to get of those books, you'd be better off.    I don't recommend this book at all 
 I have read everyone of Ludlum's books and it is a disgrace that this book has his name attached to it. I struggled through the first hundred pages waiting for something well written and interesting. It never happened. I don't quit many books before they are finished, but I just couldn't stand this any more. 
 The information about TradeStation is easily replaced with the manuals available from the company.  The trading systems included have some interesting features, but the design and analysis is far inferior to what you'll find in, say, Conway & Behle's "Professional Stock Trading:  System Design and Automation".  And the editing of the text is very sloppy.  This would be a decent value were it a $30 paperback, but as a premium priced book it dissapoints.  There are much better ways to spend this much money on books about stock trading 
 Not very well done and boring to the extreme, overdone on the wolf character, definetly not a kids movie. Way too long and seemed to get stuck in the middle so to speak.  Definetly would not recommend it to anyone.  Most scenes could have been left out entirely,  most were just crude; it just seemed to go on and on, needlessly . Just plain bad 
 Unfortunately, the paper that was used for this book would have served a better purpose remaining a tree in the forest. This is one of those books that promises much, but delivers nothing. The central premise is that, rather than being individuals first who create relationships, our individuality arises from our shared consciousness. I began the book with great hope, asking the question I ask before I begin every book: "What will I learn that will make my life better?" With this book, I was wondering how to go about experiencing this interesting transformation. Three hundred pages later (the end of the book), he still hadn't provided any information. It was 300 pages of random philosophical meanderings covering everything (and nothing) under the sun. Why do people write books like this that have absolutely no useful information 
 This book was not what I thought it would be. I wanted a book that showed how to make jewelry, and actually this was a book that showed how to make jewelry components. I was looking for design and "how to" techniques on putting together jump rings, and store bought components and and this was more like how to make a jump ring etc . . I didn't like it. If you want to make jewelry components this is the book for you. If you want to make jewelry from store bought components and beads, I suggust you find a different book 
 All I can say is don't listen to these CD's while driving in heavy traffic.  You don't want to be trapped in a car with THE SOPRANO.  At some point someone should have said, "OK Doris, back away from the Mic and let someone else have a chance."  Maybe she's married to the producer.  And let's talk about the automated-percussion.  I don't know about you, but I don't really think "I Love to Tell the Story" needs a lot of cymbals, but that's just me.  I came to anticipate each and every cymbal crash, and I was not disappointed.  Amazon should put this in the 2 for $5.99 bin.  Makes this Lutheran girl long for the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.  
 "You saw nothing in Hiroshima. Nothing" is what he said. Hiroshima Mon Amour depicts the reality of the bombing of Hiroshima, which took place on August 6, 1945.  The story begins with two bodies against each other with multiple clips of the results of the bombing.  When I watched this movie for the first time, I realized this movie was far from a fairy tale.  Instead, this movie captured reality and could be described as the "fiction" aspect of history William Gass explains in "The Nature of Narrative".  Throughout the entire movie the main character, a woman from France explains the hardships she went through back at home.  It was disturbing for me to watch the movie as it went back in time where she was taunted for have been in love with a German soldier.  I felt it violated a person's right as to whom he/she may date.  It was also unbearable to watch the clips where it shows the end results after the bombing of Hiroshima.  The fact that this movie was made in 1959 the black and white picture made it difficult for me to read the subtitles.  Lastly, the one thing I must question about this movie is the fact that it was told in French.  I couldn't help but get frustrated that the movie started from an awkward stage of the overall story.  It seems as though it skipped the introduction and went straight into the rising of the climax.  I didn't like that they both speak of the war with no clear explanation as to what they're really talking about.  If a person who was completely oblivious about the history of Hiroshima were to watch this movie, he/she that's watching would have a hard time comprehending the overall point of the movie.  
 Why has this movie never been released in Widescreen format? I absolutely refuse to buy a movie in fullscreen format that was originally released in the theaters in widescreen. Let's face it folks, when a movie is viewed fullscreen a good part of the movie is missing. The exception to this is older movies that were actually realeased in theaters in this format. Other than that, it is a great comedy which I would love to own in it's original format 
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 I thought since this was form the AAP that it would be the best reference. Not even close. It is difficult to read because it is in 6pt type. It looks like they just shrunk down the original Hard copy and tried to size it to a paperback. As a result, the text is tiny and only fills up 2/3 of the page! The book measures 6 X 9, but the reading area is 4 1/2 X 6 1/4!!It does not look at all like what you see when you take a peek on the website. The illustrations are very few and of poor quality. The information is from 1997. There was a LOT missing, especially since there have been advances in pediatrics in the last 8 years. The information is not very helpful as far as relieving symptoms, and is geared toward older children. There are so many references out there today that are MUCH better than this book. This is the first time I have EVER returned a book. I am extrememly disappointed. Please continue to browse - there are a lot of choices out there that are more complete and better organized than this. 
 The classic easy-to-use and pantry-friendly Better Homes and Garden Cookbook is pretty much in every kitchen in America and chances are, it's already in yours too.  If so, then then there's nothing in this obnoxiously-colored cookbook for kids that you couldn't find in either the adult BH & H cookbook or a back issue of Family Circle.  With a few exceptions, (most notably the breakfast pizza and the Hula Stir Fry) it's all extremly standard fare.  The only thing that sets it apart is the crazy fonts and colors so obnoxious that I had to wait ten minutes between reading it and writing this review so I could see straight again.  I mean, are you really in need of another chicken nugget recipe?  Isn't there anything more interesting they could come up with?  And it isn't written to make the cooking any easier for kids--they might as well grab your adult copy and save their vision.  If you're looking for a kid's cookbook that's full of good projects that will appeal to your children, I recommend the Everything Kid's Cookbook which has a black on white format, crossword puzzles and word finds for the older kids, and easy to follow instructions along with five really terrific projects that the kids can whip up for play, like bubbles and play dough.  Mom and Me by Annabel Karmel is also a much, much better selection, with easy to follow illustrated directions.  This is a suped-up version of standard fare you'd be better off skipping 
 If it weren't for the cover photo and Stewart's name on the CD cover, "Still the Same...Great Rock Classics of Our Time" could pass for a Ronco collection of oldies as performed by sound-alike artists. The title alone is enough to suggest a cheap, lazy and monetary-based package. The content does nothing to alleviate this impression, either. I could say that this is the last straw, but Stewart established his artistic indifference decades ago, sometime around "Do Ya Think I'm Sexy." The truth nowadays is that Rod Stewart is to popular music what the interstate is to a road trip; bland, predictable, overly familiar and safer than the road less taken. Here is a guy who once fronted one of the best rock and roll bands of all time (Faces), and released gloriously eclectic and challenging solo albums. Sometime around 1974, though, the muse left him, or maybe the creativity of Ronnie Lane and Ronnie Wood are what left. Once his affiliation with that band became history, so did Stewart's sense of artistry. Ever since, he has been shilling second-rate material to an audience that demands virtually nothing from him. As a consequence, that is more or less exactly what he has offered in return. The less demanding his material, the more that some people seem to love it.  It's a formula that works great for the man, and I don't want to begrudge him any of his fame or fortune. McDonalds sells a lot of hamburgers, Budweiser sells a lot of beer, and Rod Stewart sells a lot of records. All of them manage to do this by extracting `flavor' from the ingredients list and avoiding anything else that could make their product distinctive.  If you think that Stewart's collections featuring songs from the great American songbook were brilliant, then of course you will enjoy an album where he carbon copies rock artists who once may have been copying him. At least Sam Cooke preceded Stewart and could provide genuine inspiration, but Bonnie frikkin' Tyler's "It's a Heartache?" It's more like a travesty. If you feel compelled to defend this collection, then please tell me what Stewart adds to John Fogerty, Bob Seger, and Elvin Bishop's material? Is there one good reason on God's green earth why you would prefer Stewart's connect-the-dots cover of "Day After Day" over Badfinger's beautiful original version? He sounds like a bad jukebox in a biker bar. I am telling you that this record sucks, but you probably think I'm being elitist, so go ahead. Next time you're buying Cheerios at K-Mart, pick up a copy. If the CD doesn't offend you, then you can get in queue to hear Stewart as he sings the phone book, too, but I for one will not be standing in that line.			D		Tom Rya 
 When this book was first issued back in 1979, the information was contemporary and useful. Unfortunatley for this book, the world of Ford performance has changed drastically in the last twenty years. I have the  original print of this book and was looking forward to this update. Boy was  I disappointed. The cover says, "Includes all Modern Ford Performance  Engines." I guess this means anything built after the flathead. The  engine building techniques are old, the technology is old, even the part  numbers are old.  No information on the vast array of the new aftermarket  aluminum heads and manifolds, fuel injection, ignition systems, etc. or  anything on the new Modular engines is offered. If you want a nostalgic  look at what it used to be like or general information on older hot rod  Ford engines, this book may be for you. If you have the first printing of  this book or are trying to build a cutting-edge modern Ford engine, forget  it 
 Raymonde Carroll's book, a must-read when it came out, is now unfortunately way outdated. To that, add a poorly done translation... I was going to use Carroll's book in my French classes, but it was so bad that I picked Polly Platt's "Savoir-Flair" instead. 
 else....a curse of havning the Kennedys in our government.  It seems that all the wild living, party girls, drinking and stupid actions lead to their troubles....NOT a curse on them.  This book is a piece of fluff!  Don't waste your time 
 I did not like this book and did not enjoy reading it.  I am serious about learning how to write better and I did not find this book helpful to me.  
 Another bad zombie book in a long line of bad zombie books.  The idea was fine, but the writing was dreadful.  Hollow characters compounded by a complete lack of style.  The author needs to take a few writing classes and work on sentence structure, grammar, and punctuation.  I really wish more decent writers would get into the zombie genre.  By the way, I would still have bought the book after reading my review since my zombie addiction is so severe.  Just thought I would throw that in.  
 The book should be renamed to "How to Clean".  The current title sounds like it would give tips on making housework quicker and easier--boy that was way off!  The book gives basic details on cleaning a house as any person might already be aware of and there were no shortcuts mentioned.  If  you're looking for timesaving techniques, it's not here 
 Now, I will preface this- and probably be napalmed correspondingly -with a disclaimer: I read a third of this book, and literally threw it down.  I devour fantasy and science fiction, both the good, the bad, and the absolutely horrendous, and it is a rare book that literally disgusts me so bad that completing it would be a waste of a precious day of my time.  When I first picked it up, it seemed to have promise, as if Irvine's editor (a person I must have the utmost respect for, since they made this hack an actual published author, and actually buffed his tired prose to being readable) showed special focus on those first few pages, in order to draw in unwitting saps.   However, the sheer lack of talent of Mr Irvine shines through soon enough.  Information dumps abound, dropped like steaming piles of excrement from an unhouse-broken dog, and he even goes so far as to be awarded the supreme rebuke of, "Bad author, bad, bad author" when he decides to insult his entire readership with a third of a page pile he leaves when describing his main character. Relying on the tired cliche of "Protaganist looks into the mirror and classifies his features down to the last straggly nose-hair," he even lacks the talent to make this interesting, instead reciting a tired litany of facial features using subpar, repetitive prose.  Are you, the reader, so dumb, so lacking in even the most vestigial traces of an imagination, that you cannot form the image of the protagonist based on a few key, note-worthy features?  Apparently, Mr Irvine's answer to that is a resounding "Yes."  I debated, then and there, with dropping the book.  But, I trudged on, sad to say, only to find yet more examples of How Not to Write.  By the point I put this book down, the prerequisite mysterious-woman-with-the-mysterious-past has appeared and is with another protagonist.  Then, she proceeds to get drunk and, with a person she has only just met, told the tale of her dark, sordid past.  Back-story should be one of the most fascinating parts of a tale, like Eriksons "Malazan Book of the Fallen" or Martin's "A Song of Fire and Ice."  The mystery, the suspense of "I wonder what happened..." can be a highlight to a novel, helping to flesh out the world.  To take that and show such an utter lack of talent and ability to create a dramatic moment as to be forced to rely on the cliche of a drunken confession is atrocious.  I have heard, from others more brave than myself, that the later books pick up and get better. However, I find myself unwilling to search through the infinite weight of Irvine's dross for whatever diamond-in-the-offal he has succeeded in creating. Beyond which: it's coal under pressure that creates a diamond.  I do not think the same process is capable of compressing his dregs into something noteworthy.  Avoid: at all costs.  .davi 
 I am with the other people who reviewed this item stating that it is kinda pointless to be releasing a boxed set for this series. I know for a fact that they have been doing this since at least book 4 and each time the next book comes out they are just making the box bigger. This is just a huge rip off for the people who buy "boxed sets" for the novelty of the box...once the next book comes out they basically have to just set it on the shelf next to the boxed set. Personally, I think that for the most part the idea of putting your books in a box like this is kinda stupid anyway...I prefer to have mine individual on the shelves. I am not opposed to the idea of releasing them in nice slipcases though...anyway I'll quit my rambling. Lets just end it at this, if you are absolutely one of those peeps who need the box set, wait until the last book comes out and buy it then. The one star here is for the boxed set, not the individual books, which are all brilliant 
 It looks cool and I ordered one. It turns out a bad choice. The product is totally ineffective. Do not buy this unless you want to end up returning it like me 
 Not worth the price.  It was a disappointment. It does not cover all the Medal of Honor recipient.  It is incomplete.  How can you forget Audi Murphy the most decorated person of any war 
  The book is beautiful, no doubt. The figures and summury tables are great. However, the book lacked clarity (in my opinion at least). Comparing it to books like Lathi's Modern Communication Systems and Dorf's Modern Control Systems, it really fails in motivating the equations and mathematical derivations. Lots of very important formulas and conclusions just seem to pop-up.   Most of the excersises were also very difficult to understand in light of the given information in the text.  I recall reading the never-ending pages in the physics of BJTs with hardly a clue to what really was going on. Most of the other students merely jumped to the modeled equations  and didn't bother at all with the underlying physics.  To be fare though I must say I didn't read any other book on general electronics (we moved on to specialized courses in intstrumentation)so the book might be a lot better then others 
 I have not even opened this because the first two CDs I ordered from Amazon sounded like they were fake 
 I was disappointed by this "behind the scenes" book. Not at all as entertaining and delightful as the author wants you to believe. Some interesting facts nestled in a whole lot of information available from other books or Disney themselves. Borrow from the library if you absolutely have to read it yoursel 
 I have been searching on line and elsewhere for a good camcorder as 1) a replacement for my JVC GR-D70U, which died, and 2) to go online with a video blog.  After much study and evaluation, I chose the Canon ZR800 based on a salesman's recommendation, frustration as to the number of choices which are available, and the presence of an external microphone jack (which was one of my "must-have" options).  After returning home, I read the review by Miamian "New Reviewer", and felt trepidation.  After charging the battery, I tried the camera.  Lo and behold, Miamian is right.  There is an obvious noise when recording, which was not present in my JVC.  Hoping against hope, I played the tape back, and, just as I feared, the tape had a pronounced hiss.  This is not just tape hiss, but a much more pronounced noise, which transfers to the TV when watching.  It rendered the camcorder totally unacceptable. I took the camcorder back, and, like Miamian, ordered the Sony DCH-HC38.  (I know, it doesn't have an external microphone jack, but after all this confusion, I give up!! Why don't they make more cameras with them??)  The plus signs of this camera are that its menu is much more intuitively laid out, and selection of the desired item does not even require looking at the instruction book.  The joystick selector is so easy to use, to select play, rewind, fast forward, stop, pause in the playback mode,  and is also is used to select various menu items in other modes.  The wide screen viewfinder (LCD) is so nice to use, and easy to see, all others (in 4:3) become passe'.  I didn't have any chance to evaluate other aspects of the camera, due to the unacceptable noise which demanded rejection of the unit.  The picture looked OK; it did not greatly impress me, however, and the automatic focus appeared to be slow and very noticeable in playback.  In essence, caveat emptor; especially if you're hard of hearing.  Others watching and listening to the tape will not be 
 	The saga of the candyman continues in this third installment of the hit series. I can remember the first time I watched the original created by Clive Barker, I luv'd it, the same can't be said for this film. Caroline is last living descendent of the candyman, and he wants to end it all by ending her. All who watch this film and the acting of Donna D' Errico will wish for the same thing. One would only think that she got the job to secure watchers of Baywatch for the film and for that reason only, or maybe it's because a little fragile thing like her can't take on candyman head on. Get a real actress like KATHY BATES in there and she'll kick his ass {MISERY is a classic}. As far as Tony Todd is concerned he does a good job in this film, but not as scary as he has been in the other films. He does a good job none the less, and serves as a co-producer. As far as the script goes it's a decent attempt at the franchise, Al Septien & director Turi Meyer do what they can. But that doesn't save the film from being less then average. Side performances from the art gallery owner, the two bad cops, and the gypsy women are great and save the film a little.  	There isn't much to the story, Caroline is his last descendent and he wants to stop his pain by taking her. People she knows gets killed so it looks like she did it, and she tries to stop him, that's it nothing more to it. Over all a more worthy sequel of its predecessors would be more enjoyable. 
 Agree with the prior message.  I was duped into thinking 10 VHS tapes were being sold.  DON'T ORDER THIS 
 I was able to finish this book, unlike Gilead but this author is soooo boring!  Will not read another by her, no matter what the reviews 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 I loved Stirling's "Islands in the Sea of Time" trilogy, and I also loved the first book in this series.  Stirling is one of the best alternative history writers in the business, in my mind head and shoulders above Turtledove and Flint in his prose and his execution, but this book is one of the first books I've ever read in which ALMOST NOTHING HAPPENS AT ALL.  It is not true to your reader to use an entire book, which runs seven dollars for a paperback, to set up the third book but which does so little to advance the plot or the characters.  This book is a major disappointment.  Also, I found myself wincing, even in the first book, at the emphasis on witchcraft with the main characters.  It comes across as simply ludicrous.  The best scenes in this book are the ones involving the escape from Britain of the tangential British characters.  This is a very poor effort and though I plan to read book three even though I hated book two, I think a person, by reading the reviews of book two on Amazon, could skip the book entirely and read book three without missing a thing 
 Despite coming up with possibly one of the greatest ideas of the 20th century, Byatt, in all her annoyingly feminist glory, has failed completely to construct anything which might in any way interest even the most inanely boring person on the face of the planet. Each and every character is lacking in charisma, humour and, in fact, any other attractive facet about their personality, offering the reader no interest or reason for empathy, thus leaving no hero, so necessary to such a story.    Then there's the sub-plot literature which was all, unfortunately, written by the woman herself. To interlink the text with poetry and letters is, admittedly a good idea, but the quality is dire. Could it be more pretentious to fill a book with sections that the author herself admits will not be read by most? And chapter 10...just too long. So unneccessary.    This is, without a doubt, the single worst book I have ever had the misfortune to read, and would recommend it to no-body other than those who consider suicide by boredom a good idea 
 Overclocking CPU (Hack 21) is not as easy as adding more memory or upgrading the hard disk.  If you have nothing to lose, you might think about overclocking the CPU.  Manufacturers may not honor the warranty on an overclocked CPU. The modifications may also void the warranty on the motherboard and other components (such as video card & hard drives). To increase performance of your PC:  I would first try to add more memory (Hack 30), and then try to replace the hard disk with a faster (& larger) one (Hack 58) 
 Typical O'Rourke drivel. Heres how it goes.  PJ gets Rolling Stone to pay to send him to Lebanon, Panama (circa Noriega) and some other places where they have lots of guns and bad manners and little of anything else, in the hopes that he will get drunk enough to wander out from the hotel bar, see some "bad stuff" and come up with something funny to say about it. His humor is pointed and well placed at times. Most of the time though he, merely, uses the humor to set up some libertarian screed. Heavy reliance on Cato institute,intern-toadies(who fact check, research and do the academic heavy lifting) at times gives O'Rourke the appearance of knowing his arse from a hole in the ground....do not be fooled. PJ is a Hunter Thompson wannabe, but who lacks HT'S gonads. SKIP IT 
 It's good to know how an editor think about the scientific writing, but practically the book is not helpful if you want to learn writing rather than editing. The author has never written scientific papers by himself. He has no idea how to orgnize the data and make a convincing story.   I have read many beautiful scientific papers in prestigeous journals. How come those authors have not written a book??  Also Day's book is too old. Now day nobody would like to draw graphs if there is software available. 
 I have read all the books n the series and have come to expect an enjoyable light read with a little mystery. I thought the menace in this book overwhelmed the 'light' plots. There are serious themes here - murder, death, kidnapping, and others. Too bad the authors didn't focus more on the light plotlines that reader's look for in these books - Maggie's romance (this came across as ridiculous considering the fact that Maggie and her daughter were being stalked by a convicted murderer) and the Jamie / Max story  (which unfortunately is treated as a throwaway storyline). I also disliked the way the authors abruptly got rid of Destiny - love her character or hate it - she has been in enough books that longtime readers care about her. 
 Aye.... no, no, no. I had great expectations from this cd. I thought that it would be as good as    "ADIEMUS", but I was wrong. It is less lively and much less melodic. I expected choir chants and powerful medieval  music, but what I got was an amorphous mixture of sounds. Do yourself a  favor, buy ADIEMUS, and not DANCES OF TIME 
 Check out Gardner.  Pretty similar, yet with a different soun 
 I truly wanted to like this book.  After years of avoidance I had just finished Moby Dick and found it not only more readable than I'd feared but downright enjoyable.  In addition I'd heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me, and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature:  "Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last."  Alas, it was all down hill from there; overall this is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to finish.  This came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack.  Author of two other published novels and a short story collection, director of a university level creative writing program, long-term teacher of writing, and holder of a Ph.D. in same, all to considerable critical acclaim, she should be correcting and grading (failing) garbage like this not producing it.  So what went wrong?  How did this novel end up so awful?  The answer is brick by brick and piece by piece.  There is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things.  LENGTH: If "brevity is the soul of wit", this novel's witlessness is easily explained.  At 666 pages (interesting number that) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been.  It would seem that, to some extent like Melville before her, Naslund confused Length with Importance, but Melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is.  IMHO this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing Naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self-parody.  Somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel, but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing... with a meat axe or a chainsaw.  THE NAME DROPPING: One of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures, but if badly handled these encounters can un-suspend disbelief and downright offend.  They are badly handled here.  An almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of Kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid-nineteenth century New England and those she doesn't utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with Naslund's peculiar imagining of Nathaniel Hawthorne.  One or two of these, developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude.  As it is, it is a Zelig or a Forrest Gump without the humor (or the self-awareness).  THE POLITICS: Even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid-nineteenth century New Englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel, so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing.  However, Naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having Una espouse the Politically Correct view on every single controversy of the day (and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day) from slavery to whaling, from feminism to free love, from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled, all without consequence or even criticism.  This latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves.  Una espouses them with all the negative consequences that Naslund receives for espousing them today, which is to say: none.  THE ANTI-CHRISTIAN BIGOTRY: There is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid-nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time, but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted.  It is even sillier to portray Christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish, the bigoted, the future apostate, or the mentally ill.  It tells us more about the author than anything else that Una is openminded towards every religious and quasi-religious idea of the time EXCEPT Christianity.  THE FARFETCHED SCENARIOS: I sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which Una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi-lesbian encounter....  After this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic.  After her crazy Christian father threatens to kill her (a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand), Una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal-minded aunt and uncle, encounters two young men who both fall in love with her, disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them, successfully avoids detection, is sunk by a whale, survives by committing cannibalism, marries the surviving young man after he goes insane, and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the Indians, leaving her free to "marry" Captain Ahab (Una never really "marries" anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes).  Things don't get more realistic in the second half, which includes Una's clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale.  Riiiight.  THE MARY SUE: However, the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a "Mary Sue" that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader.  A more realistic main character might have saved it.  Una never learns anything from her life's too-many-to-be-believed experiences because she already knows everything.  She doesn't change because she is already perfect.  She doesn't have to deal with the criticism of others because she doesn't receive any, and she doesn't have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides, Una had her reasons (and they were very good ones you can be sure).  The only thing I can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone WITHOUT anyone ever reading it.  I feel like I've just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading Moby Dick in her bedroom... with the door locked. 
 I rented this game for my 3 year old.  Who loves the movie.  He tried to play it.  He like it.  I tried to play it & got to the dancing part.  I couldn't get past it.  I tried for 5 days.  My rental time was up.  I returned it.  I haven't rented it since.  This game is way too hard to beat.  And my 3 year old got bored with it real fast.  I would NOT recommend this game to anyone.  Don't waste your money buying it.  Unless you are an expert with video games.  I'm just thankful that I rented it instead of buying it 
 I was very disappointed with this purchase.  In fact, I viewed three of them and the quality is so poor the rest will remain on the shelf unviewed. I have relied on internet sales for two years now, and this is the worst 
 The item you get is decorative at best.  Doesn't have any kind of a gong sound at all.  I suppose thats what it was met for but still...  The book it comes with is funny 
 I bought this book purely on the strength of its being written by Jeffrey Deaver.  However, less than 3 pages into this terrible novel it becomes very hard to believe that it was written by the same man who brought us The Bone Collector and the Coffin Dancer.  The fact that it was written in 1988, before Deaver was established, may explain some of its mediocrity but there is no excuse for the fact that this is simply a terrible book.  The basic plot is that Rune, a supremely annoying "punk" discovers a favourite customer of hers shot to death when she goes to his apartment to collect a video he has rented 18 times in one month.  The film is a "true" story about a Manhattan bank robbery in which a police officer steals a million dollars which he hides away and which has never been found.  In the biggest jump to a conclusion I have ever come across, Rune decides that the the depiction of what was done with the money in the film is real and that Mr Kelly found it, and makes up her mind to find it herself.  The plot of the book probably could have been fairly good, but Deaver ruins the entire story with Rune, the most unrealistic and annoying "heroine" I have ever read.  She lives in a fantasy world that a 5 year old child would be too mature for, and has no concept of the real world whatsoever.  Everything about her, from her appearance to her manner of speaking to her ridiculous inability to lie makes the reader want to punch the book as it's the nearest thing possible to punching her in the face.  Another major problem with this novel is its glaring predictability.  There are no twists and turns in it and if Deaver thought anything in it was going to shock the reader, then he must have been as naive as Rune herself.  This book is chock-full of cliches that were probably old even in 1988.  This book has nothing to offer the discerning reader and it probably better left to those who see reading as hard work and only do it to reassure themselves that they can once in a while.  Complete and utter rubbish 
 Two gripes I have with this book:  1. In the section about racing technique they explain the fundamentals of cornering. Well, there's nothing more fundamental than the Late Apex. They explain what it is, then they show an illustrative diagram that has the late apex and early apex reversed! (They show the late apex but label it an early apex, and they show the early apex but call it a late apex.)  2. They claim to give "the best racing lines for all tracks" -- which was my main reason for buying the book -- but they don't. Rather, they make lots of generalities about about various turns, like "Stay out of the dirt when possible," and "Don't let them pass you." I expected to at least see illustrations of critical turns with suggested racing lines drawn through them.  My expectations were high after my first experience with their work, which was their Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle-Earth guide. It was helpful. The GT4 guide, however, is rather repetitive and full of filler, as if trying to fill out a 300-page book with insufficient material. And redundant. And repeats itself. With lots of filler. Lots of redundant filler. Repeatedly.   However, if one is looking for lots of automotive and racing trivia and jargon, this book has lots of it -- it's just that the book is billed as "The Complete Owners Manual" but the majority of the book is just. . . stuff. And trivia. And more stuff. And filler. Repeatedly. 
 This book really irritated me. I loved Mayes's previous books and was really looking forward to reading this one. The concept, a year of traveling to different locations, seemed like it would be really interesting combined with Mayes' fresh perspectives, enthusiasm for discovery, feisty opinions and poetic descriptions. But somehow it didn't work.   I get the sense that her heart wasn't really in this book. Maybe because the trips were taken over a span of five years, and cobbled together? Or because there's so much `padding' - endless quotes from her own or other people's writing. When she liked the place, her descriptions feel artificially enthusiastic, almost as if the book was paid for by the chamber of commerce. I got tired of reading that she could live there, or could imagine taking her grandson there, or wishes she was born there, or that it's SO much better than San Francisco. Where she doesn't live anymore, and hasn't for years. There are also too many stories about refreshing local characters who think Frances Mayes is the nicest, most tasteful, most interesting person they've ever met. Especially since these people tend to be waiters, cab drivers, rug salesmen or others whose business depends on charming the tourists.   Most of the book consists of sneering at her fellow Americans, or talking about people's personal appearance. This is boring and clichï¿½d - and if you like that kind of thing, Bill Bryson does it better. There's also way too much name dropping (she's always mentioning "my friend so-and-so, the famous ____"). What happened to the ordinary, financially stretched, middle-aged college professor? She seems to be taking on the persona of a celebrity. She doesn't want to be crowded in with a group, doesn't want to associate with ordinary tourist types - now she deserves the VIP treatment. This is definitely a change from her previous books.  I think when it comes right down to it, there's too much Frances Mayes in this book. I thought I liked her, but what I really like is her writing style. It can still be magical - when she gets her ego out of the way. But when she puts herself front and center, she becomes more tedious and pretentious than interesting. Now I'm sorry I read this book, because I'm afraid it will spoil my enjoyment of the earlier ones. 
 "Maximum Overdrive" is a fun Sci-Fi movie to watch, but it's not a horror movie.  I saw this movie in the TV guide coming on Halloween weekend and it's characterized as "horror"...is that what they call it?  I'm sorry, I just don't see it.  Still, this was a pretty good idea for a book and movie, notwithstanding its obvious limitations.  That said, the movie does tend to get a little boring in spots, especially toward the end...this is because of the limitations involved with such an idea.  In other words, how much can you do with killer 18 wheel trucks once people get inside a gas station?    The story behind "Maximum Overdrive" is basically about a comet that comes near the Earth and the presence and influence of this comet makes all of the machines go crazy from Coke machines to 18 wheeler Mack trucks.  So, what you get in "Maximum Overdrive" is a Man v. Machine duel.  From a Sci-Fi and comedy standpoint, the movie is mildly entertaining, especially if there is nothing else on.  Still, this is not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination and definitely not horror.  Don't get me wrong, I would be scared of a Mack truck coming after me too, but does the movie belong in the horror movie genre or sci-fi genre?    The acting is average in this movie, but Emilio Estevez does a good job in his role as the really intelligent ner do well who washes dishes at a truck stop.  The script/storyline is quite imaginitive and despite being farfetched, the plot works and the audience can understand it to be plausible in a Sci-Fi kind of way.    All and all, a pretty good movie, but I thought the movie declined towards the end when the survivors attempt to escape the trucks.  Sci-Fi fans should check it out...horror movie fans should check my other reviews for something a little more "horrifying" than "Maximum Overdrive".  
 I've seen these scenes in so many different movies that I got bored and  turned it off. It was just a poor copy of other good movies. (Like 633 squadron) 
 I was quite disappointed by the book - rather shallow rendering of facts, practically no analysis, theoritising without any practical conclusions. Simple internet search provides more useful information.. 
 Irma in the 1960s [2 and half stars]   This compilation, an updated and expanded version of a 1983 LP compilation (tracks 1-16), features 24 songs recorded 1962-1966 on Imperial, Brandy, and Minit labels.  This is a slightly superior compilation to Razor & Tie's 1996 compilation "Sweet Soul Queen of New Orleans: The Irma Thomas Collection".   TIME IS ON MY SIDE consists of 24 songs from 1963-1966; songs are not in chronological order.  Disc packaged in black jewel case; total running time: 65:50.  Booklet includes an essay by Clive Richardson, two b&w photos, and songwriting credits (recording years provided on back cover; chart positions, albums of origin, producer credits, and musician personnel are not included).  Sound quality is decent.    The disc closes with "It's a Man's-Woman's World Parts 1 & 2", which is the same recording as "It's a Man's Woman's World (Pt. 1)", the latter appearing on the "Sweet Soul Queen of New Orleans" disc.  Both are the same length and include the last note of another song at the beginning of the track.   For her Soul recordings, and I would contend best work, get "A Woman's Viewpoint: Essential 70s Recordings" [2006].   
 I bought this item thinking it would be compatible with the Sony Ericsson Z500a (this model is listed in the description).  First off, the CD that comes with the data cable does not have my phone model on it, making it useless.  I figured this would be no problem because the software for my phone is available from Sony Ericsson's website.  After downloading the software and following the instructions to a TEE, I was still unable to link up my computer with my phone.  I even uninstalled and reinstalled the software again in case I made an error.  All told, this was a waste of money and one of my first disappointments with dealing with Amazon 
 George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino have got to be two of the worst actors of all time. It's sheer agony to watch these nerds pretend to be macho tough guys.  This whole flick is akin to getting a gift-wrapped package wrapped in the fanciest wrapping paper... Problem is, as is often the case with Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, ain't nothin' inside the package. Get it? These guys like the worst movies and have managed to become the makers of some of the worst movies ever. The word shallow comes to mind. There is nothing there, and I doubt that there ever will be.  However, having said that, I must give credit where credit is due: Juliette Lewis, the talented Juliette Lewis, is terrific as usual. Good to see Harvey Keitel do his thing, same goes for Fred Williamson, the rarely seen Michael Parks (this guy, by the way made some terrific country-type records back in the 60's--and we wish he'd do more. He's up there with Merle Haggard  in my humble opinion) and, last but not least, the beautiful Salma Hayek  is also in this, although she hardly does enough. She still had the curves back then.   In addition to the above, we could have done without all the obvious and crappy CGI effects at the end. The stuff just doesn't work; never did.  By the way, the documentary FULL -TILT BOOGIE is way better than the main feature. 
 I have a book of Ross' by the same title, but the cover is different (remake?) but most of my problems with his theology come from his advocation of the "big bang theory" which has numerous scientific problems (quantized redshifts to name one) and serious theological implications.  If the big bang were true, then there were animals before man. Animals that lived and died.  The Bible says that man's sin is the reason why we die and suffer.  If death was around before sin ("For the wages of sin is death") then what good would Jesus' death on the cross have been 
 The book was horrible it had a very poor plot and a very poor ending when I finished reading this book it was one of those books that you say jees this was a waste of time and money if I would have had something better to  do I wouldn't have finished it.I reccomend that if you like weird books  this would definitly be a keeper and if you don't , save your money 
 This is one of the many books written by professors at universities in order to get tenure. It is not written for the average reader but for other professors who already have an understanding of the subject matter. For that matter, I wonder why the author would make his book available to the general public and not make his material accessable to them. The book is dense, the author focuses more on referencing other authors rather than providing a clear, concise or original thesis to the subject. I dont not recommend this book if you are one of the billions of people out there who is not a professor at whichever universities this author was trying to impress 
 Can anyone tell me if the book words on the vine has an answer key with it? Thanks. sgra 
 The storyline is way over-the-top, the plot is very poor, the red-neck-America-knows-best attitude of the writer is funny and sometimes annoying. Still, I've red worse books. But not many. 
 Reality Bites seemed fresh when it was first released, giving voice to a generation - with the unfortunately derogative soubriquet of "X" - that was overeducated, underemployed, plagued by the flashy, trashy commercialism of MTV, and stunningly superficial in its wholehearted embrace of pop culture and rejection of serious moral or philosophical discourse it might have stumbled across in college.    It was a good start because transitioning from the idyllic and unreal world of college to the crass, cruel arena of materialism can be tough, providing limitless opportunities for challenge and personal growth - the very stuff of real movies.  Instead we have a swan dive into a Pizza Hut commercial held together by a plot so shop-worn it would have been considered exhausted in 1930.  Winona Ryder is winning as Lelaina, but one can only imagine the SATs of football players at a college where she is valedictorian.  Her "documentary" is appallingly narcissistic, reflecting the characteristic Gen X notion that - "if it's about me, it's art, and it's important."  Ethan Hawke does an excellent job as Troy, the very archetype of self-satisfied, supercilious entitlement.  We are expected to root for him, but it's hard to refrain from hoping he gets hit by a bus.  Stiller, who directed - a talented fellow almost impossible to look at - plays Michael, the "anti-Troy."  Smooth, successful, and very much plugged into the contemporary franchising of Gen X culture - if culture is the right word - he's an executive at an MTV-ish corporation.  That he improves Lelaina's preposterous "documentary," rather than destroying its alleged artistic integrity, is the film's dirty little secret.  Viewers surprised by who wins Lelaina's hand will also be stunned to learn that professional wrestling is fixed and Liberace was gay.  Indeed, when you strip away the thin veneer of pop culture references this is really a very traditional movie.  Janeane Garofalo is outstanding as always, and John Mahoney shines as the TV morning chat show host who looks sweet and avuncular on camera but is in fact, a bastard.  His performance says more about the likelihood of finding anything even remotely resembling reality in film - or on TV - than the rest of this film put together.

 I really wanted to see how the developers could represent playing as a dragon, and spyro is the only one that came to mind at the time.  I decided to get it, I put it in my console, turned it on, and was blown away...by the stupidity.  -Basic Story Is stupid.  Bad dragon plant mean gems to kill good dragon.  Spyro good dragon, defeat evil dragon.  Everybody dances because goodness prevailes.  -Gameplay An atrocious story can be overlooked if the gameplay is good (mario?) but spyro has probably the worst gameplay ever.  It combines horrible, precise jumping puzzles with abysmally stupid enemies.  The puzzles require you to tap the jump button at a certain time.  If you don't, you go back to the beginning of the puzzle.  It was maddeningly hard at some points, and I am grown.  So how hard would it be for a kid?  For the enemies, they should get the darwin award.  At many instances I was breathing flame (it has a limited reach) and the enemy walked right into it!  The enemies are dumber then a retarded 4 year old but margianally smarter than Paris Hilton.  Also, they are very weak dying in 1-2 hits.  There are also very few types of enemies (like around 2-6) but they have the same AI and equally pose no challenge, seeing as they are weak and attack you one at a time. The boss battles are so simple they make you want to shoot yourself at how moronic they are.  Also, playing as the other characters (hunter, blinx etc.) are not that fun.  In conclusion don't make the mistake I made and steer clear of this game.  Get better ones for yourself whomever you are giving a gift to.   (Oh, and don't listen to the other people who gave this crudhole good reviews, they are either A. Retarded or B. Never played a decent game. 
 I will start off by admitting I did not read this entire book. As someone who has struggled with severe depression since I was seventeen, the first few chapters made me angry, nauseated, and eventually frightened.  This book will serve to fuel prejudice and contempt towards suicidal people, by claiming it's something that can be averted with a lollipop and a pat on the head; a hysterical search for attention.  Obviously the writer did have serious emotional difficulties; but most suicides are committed by people with physical, chemical, mental illnesses, as dangerous and as un-asked for as diabetes or cancer.  If you want to know WHY, read Kay Redfield Jamison's "Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide".  If you want to know how to make it go away, I still don't have an answer, and I can't trust anyone who claims there's an easy one 
 I picked up this book when it was first published. Since there are so few books on the subject, any new book is a welcome addition.  That is, until you actually read it. I've had college textbooks that were more fun to read.  Apparently, this title sells very well.  Perhaps it's the curtain on the cover or the whimsical thought bubbles that lead people to believe the secrets of directing are within this book.  If you want a book on directing that is uninspiring, lifeless, and an all-around chore to read, this is your book.  If you're still looking for the straight-forward approach to directing you thought would be within this book, "A Sense of Direction" by William Ball will ultimately be more helpful 
 I was disappointed in this book. Given the editorial reviews and other reader reviews, I thought it might be a humorous look at sex and the lack of sex in the post-baby relationship as well as ways to rekindle the romance. What I read was much different. There was information on how the sex life changes (hence the 1 star), but I was turned off by a lot of the recommendations. For example, women who are suffering from post-baby negative body image probably wouldn't find the tip to rent a pornographic movie or let her husband read pornographic magazines helpful. Nothing like comparing that body to the idylic ones in the magazine pages...Also there were sections called "hide your smut" and instructions on how to handle when your children find your "treasure chest" of adult materials. Not exactly what I had in mind 
 I have never read an Iris Johansen book that I didn't like...until this one. The characters were never developed and were unbelievable. Sophie is supposedly a genius researcher and a doctor. MacDuff is a Scottish laird who's background we never learn about. Two gorgeous killers who we're supposed to empathize with. The list goes on.   I forced my way through the book, what a waste of time. I'll think twice before I read another one. Hopefully this was an anomoly 
 This book is pure heresy clothed in feel-good, new age sounding terminology. The author blatantly states that he doesn't believe in the basic dogmas of the Christian faith, such as the virgin birth, the physical resurrection, or what he calls the "traditional" redemption and atonement of Jesus Christ. He also does not take the bible at all literally. Granted, there is much spiritual depth to scripture; however, excessive spiritualizing of scripture can lead to this type of "enlightened" Christianity.  His concepts are not Christian, but emphasize the divine nature of mankind while downplaying the role and true divinity of Christ. This is all subtly concealed under the guise of a re-interpretation of the "true" gospel message.  Anyone with even a cursory knowledge of scripture can see the errors in the author's observations and conclusions.   The author has dabbled in mysticism - unfortunately not Christian mysticism as experienced by the myriad of saints of the Roman Catholic Church. This book should in no way serve as a reflection of catholicism for anyone seeking to discover the true Roman Catholic faith. 
 I read this book twice, and gave up on the 40 day program after a week because I was bored and was applying nothing new. Yes I understand that "state of mind" is directly related to physical performance. But I knew that before. And I know that one must "step out of his/ her comfort zone in order to grow...etc, etc. Didn't Tony Robbins teach us that 15 years ago? The book seems hastily written, and too much like Journey into Power. I don't mean to sound bitter - and correct me if I'm wrong - but there seems to be no love behind the words, and it left me feeling cheated and depressed 
 I just got back from vacation where I read a handful of fun crime dramas. This one really stood out as being horrible from the very first paragraph. The writing is weak and the story was so incredibly thin that that killers were obvious from the start.   I'm not sure who the target audience is for this book, but my best guess is old guys who only read one book a year. There was a really strange mix of detail and inference. It was almost like he needed to fill space so every now and then we would get pointless detail about flying or some other random aspect of what the character was doing. And the sex scenes were just bad.   I really couldn't recommend this book any less 
 We are a group of fourth graders from Mrs. Larson's class at Sunset Hill School in Lawrence, Kansas. Most of us thought parts of this book were boring. We thought the ending did not close out the story well. We felt there was something else going on in the story that the author didn't tell  us. The illustrations did not stand out and were difficult to understand.  If you looked at the illustrations they would not make you want to read the  book because they looked so sad. We also didn't like the story because the  characters had too much anger. We also thought the story should have a  happy ending. As it was it felt like the author had just stopped in the  middle of the story. Some people might enjoy this book but we didn't 
 I was very disappointed in this movie ~ it was a definite "sleeper" 
 The problem with this book is that it does not explain the mathematics well.  The author connects the unsolvable equation with group theory but does not provide any way for the reader to understand exactly what it is that is wrong with the equation.  Why could the equation not be solved?  There is a reason for this fact, and the mathematical theory explains it well--but not this book.  Perhaps a mathematician will write a book explaining why the 5th degree equation cannot be solved in general.  The reason is the subject of Galois theory taught in high-level mathematics courses but explainable in a popular book; but apparently not in this one 
 Very poor FM reception spoiled an otherwise fine product.  AM reception is good.  Product design is good.  I tried several different sets of earbuds and earphones, and could not get the two FM stations that I listen to most often.  Very disappointing 
 I have to start by saying that one COULD do worse than follow Mr. Moench's Natural Diet, as it appears nutritionally sound.  However, one CAN do worse by purchasing this book.   It's dreadfully put together with crude, illegible copies of graphs and charts from unknown sources.  In fact, where most of the material this book used came from is anyone's guess. Nothing is footnoted.  It does have a bibliography, of sorts, with entries like "Tropical seed companies list: photocopy," "Sucrose: article," or "Leaf protein as human food: article."  additionally, these sources are very dated;  references to practices of "the Orient" (pg.41), "the Azurbaizanis" (pg. 19), and my favorite: "the Kaffir tribes of South Africa" (pg. 11) are just a few examples.  Despite the subtitle "Traditional Diets from around the World...", only a sentence or two is devoted to the diet of the cited cultures.   Finally, the author's biography states he is an alumni of St. Cloud State University.  I, too, am a graduate of SCSU, and while our alma mater is no ivy league institution, it does have fairly high academic standards.  I don't think this book would stand up there as a master's thesis, or in an English 101 class, for that matter.  I want my twenty bucks back 
 I'm listening to this CD for the third time since I bought it this past weekend, trying to figure out why it is not what I remembered from the movie.  The music is OK, although not exactly my taste. However I kept asking myself why did I like the music from the movie so much when this doesn't do much for me. Was it merely the context of a GREAT movie? From an Amazon search, I realized that there are two different (but visually very similar...same graphics, different photo) Crash (the movie) CD's... the actual Soundtrack and the "music inspired by". Whereas I have no criticism of the music itself, the packaging is extremely deceptive, and irresponsible. I will buy the "real" soundtrack and probably never listen to this again. ($15 wasted). I would also have to comment that the "inspiration" referred to on the cover is also a serious stretch of the truth. This is a pop-hip-hoppish album whereas the actual soundtrack is a Mark Isham piece... very different. And, the cover says "music from and inspired by".. which is only true on a technicality. There is only one song on this CD that is on the soundtrack. To those who knew what they were buying and like this music, more power to you. But I would imagine that I'm not alone in mistaking this CD for the actual soundtrack, as it was the only only Crash CD in the soundtrack section of my local Borders. I would encourage record labels to differentiate the graphics on two very different CD's so that consumers get what they expected. Confusion like this doesn't serve either audience 
 For the times this movie was made, the acting is good. I would love to see this same story done in more modern times where I believe the acting would be less in the dramatic style and seem more real to life. If you've read the book, this movie cuts out so much of what I loved in the book. I wish not only that it would be done in modern times but I can see it being done in a trilogy style to capture all the interaction of characters and the essence of the story would be more complete. If you have to choose between the book and the movie, choose the book 
 I have been a member of 12-Step programs for 20 years. I have been in therapy for 32 years (originally mandated by the court in 1969). I have written a book about addiction myself. People who are mandated to go to 12-Step programs by the courts do not have to stay once their obligation is fulfilled. People who do stay get help. For me the combination of 12-Step programs, therapy and religion has brought me the recovery from addiction that I prayed for before I even knew what praying really meant. Stanton Peele's book is reactionary and uses fear tactics to sell books and inflate the author's ego. I am sad that he chooses to attack programs that have such a wonderful track record. Psychology has been helpful to me over the years, but 12-Step programs (the people, the principles, the literature, and the meetings) have saved my life 
       This movie,   the story of a shocking long-ago murder entwined with the story of a modern woman who is investigating it,  is only worth watching to see the scenes leading up to the past crime.   The modern day portion of the movie is very tedious.    Elizabeth Hurley's and Sean Penn's characters are laughable caricatures.    Anita Shreve's writings never disappoint,   read the book instead.  
 First of all, you need to understand the patterns in the gang of four book before you attempt to read this one.  They talk about them all over the place without explaining them.  That's a warning, it didn't affect my review.  The major thing I don't like about this book is the abstractness with which they talk.  They give you a high level description of a pattern and leave you with that fogginess.    I think the examples were poorly chosen.  I would have prefered to have examples that are only as complicated as they needed to be.  Unfortunately the book uses examples like, "We're going to make a voice recognition application" or "We're going to make an OS that can run applications that were built on Unix or WinNT or Linux".  I think the intent was to have some real-world-I've-been-working-for-six-years examples... it would have been smarter to put the real world examples in a separate chapter and keep the design pattern explanations simple.  Also, I hate the diagrams.  They should have just copied the diagrams in the GoF book!  Instead they chose these diagrams that give less info and IMO are downright ambiguous in some situations.  Another thing the GoF book does is have 2 separate diagrams, one that's a (simple) real world example and another that's a diagram of the actual pattern.  This book only has the diagram of the actual pattern.  I disagree with those that say this book is better than the GoF book.  I think what they like is the material covered.  Material aside, the GoF book presents the information in a much clearer way.  That's why I prefer the GoF book over this one 
 This book mocks Christianity and God. Prior to purchasing this book, think about the implications. What if Betty is wrong and Christians are right?  Ultimately it is in your best interest to find out the truth.  You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.  I strongly recommend reading books from the other side, such as Lee Strobel's books "A Case for Christ" or "A Case for Faith".  Lee Strobel is an attorney and investigator. He was once an atheist and worked for a Chicago Newspaper. His wife became a Christian and he set out to prove Christianity wrong. He spent many days investigating the Christian faith in the same manner as he would an investigative case.  At the end he ended up becoming a Christian.  He wrote about it in his first book "The Case for Christ".  C.S. Lewis and Josh McDowell also became Christians after similar attempts to "prove Christianity wrong".  These are all highly intelligent men who were once atheists.  Please don't be deceived.  The choice is yours.  And it's later than you think. 
 I didn't realize when I read that this book was a critique of postmodernism that, in style, it would be so similar to many "postmodernist" works. It seems far too complicated for me.   I am not an academician, but it feels like the author could have made his point briefly:    1) Socialists need to be practical.    2) They need to be empathetic to other people and to animals too.    3) We need a sustainable, much less violent, world.  Sanbonmatsu presents what seems like Jainism meets Marxism, although, for some reason, by way of Norman O. Brown, Herbert Marcuse, Antionio Gramcsci, Michael Foucault, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and others.   I'd suggest you try Rudolf Rocker if you are attracted to liberatarian socialism. He may not answer all the questions that Sanbonmatsu asks, but it doesn't seem for me that Sanbonmatsu does either 
 The subject matter of this book is something that is of tremendous use in an elementary classroom. However, the text is choppy, and the subject hard to follow from one idea to the next.  Even the illustrations fail to  provide a common thread woven throughout the book.  The collage style  pictures are beautiful to look at, but confusing to tie together,  especially when paired with the choppy text 
 I paid for two tie racks. I received a large box with only only tie rack and a receipt for both. I figured that they would send the second later, but it never happened...  The one rack that I did receive looked fine 
 The book was an interesting enough read to keep in my library, but I would not consider it a legitimate argument for the Aquatic Ape Theory - nor, specifically, for the aquatically influenced evolution of the human female and the proceeding ramifications. It approaches the issue in a simplistic, unscientific manner that is not at all convincing. Keeping in mind that this book is dated (having been first published in 1972) could not save it's argument either. The Descent of Woman left just me as I was before and I'll be looking further still for writings on the subject 
 This could have been an excellent documentary, but the makers of it decided to distort history rather than present it honestly. This is particularly true in the way it depicts Sparta as being some kind of Womyn's Power state which is absurd. Somewhat comically, the narrator enhances the story of Sparta by telling the story of its women which is quite trendy and also totally bogus. She tells us of laconic girls and their supposeed bi-sexuality. Hughes states that it would be a mistake to think of it as a "feminist wonderland," but that's exactly what is implied. I don't know how these other reviewers missed all the laughable politicizing such as: "Fighting wars is a soft option compared to going home to mother." Yeah right! Unless of course, husbands who shave their wives heads and leave after inseminating them count as amounting to the progressive ideal.  Pretending people of the past had the sensibilities we do is disgraceful. To many counter-culturalists, history has no value if it is not used for the purposes of advancing a political program. Unfortunately, that is precisely what we have here in this spoiled work. As for Bettany Hughes, I agree that she is quite attractive, but she is an awful narrator as she at times is downright giddy. Hers is not the type of personality that should be discussing Sparta--I'll take Victor Davis Hanson any day over her. I recommend that you skip this one and look for something which quotes actual historians. 
 The author clearly has done his research and "digging" when it comes to the facts. Then how come he is so bitter? Jennings spends too much time not only disputing almost every other book about the French and Indian  War, but also "wrestling to the ground" any thesis in opposition  to his own! He comes off sounding bitter, cranky and unattractive. His  glosses over the military aspects of the war as if these details are  beneath the serious historian--why? It was a war after all! It is not a bad  reference book but as far as read-don't bother 
 	I can recommend this book only to a person who is interested in thirty or so particular families that settled in the vicinity of what is now Lewistown, Montana, during the last two decades of the nineteenth century.  There are better choices for people interested in the history of the Metis people or Montana.  	Defining who the Metis people are is a fundamental problem for all historians.  This book attempts a definition, but fails.  The title of the book implies that the Metis can identify who belongs and who doesn't.  Such unity is beyond the capability of humans.  The word Metis is French and can be translated as "mixed blood."  In a very narrow sense, one might think of the offspring from intermarriage between the French and Indians (mostly Cree) of eastern Canada during the early days of the fur trade.  This concept breaks down rapidly as other races enter the mix.  After devoting most of this book to treating the Metis as a separate ethnic group, Foster nearly cancels it all out in her concluding chapter when she says:  "In families that might have Cree, Chippewa, or other tribal relatives plus a variety of Euro-American relatives and in-laws, a Metis identity might be the only one inclusive enough to encompass and accept all members of the family....  In the 1800s a Metis person may have had ancestors who were Chippewa, Cree, African, Iroquois, English, Scot, French, and Hawaiian, as well as a number of other Native and European ancestries.  By the early twentieth century, Metis families may have included all of these plus Lithuanian, Polish, Croatian, or any other of the numerous ethnic groups who settled in central Montana at the turn of the century."  	In general, Metis identity requires a mix of both white and Indian heritage.  There are two aspects of being a product of two ethnic groups.  First, you can be either one or both.  Second, you can be neither.  This can be an advantage, or a great disadvantage.  Sometimes the Metis could convince government officials that they were sufficiently Indian to get land allotments on the reservations; sometimes the government excluded them.  Sometimes the Indian groups to which the Metis were related accepted them as part of the tribe; and sometimes they excluded the Metis.  Indians were not able to become American citizens during the historical period considered by this book.  However, if the Metis individuals were not Indian, they could possibly become American citizens; voting and homesteading as other citizens did.  	There was another duality that influenced the lives of many Metis, Indians, and others.  During the 1800s, the Metis were buffalo hunters and frequently crossed the forty-ninth parallel that later became the line between the United States and Canada.  Thus, a family could well show that they had resided in either country and that some of their children were born on Canadian soil and some on U.S. soil.  In fact, they might not even know in what country the child was born.  This became a problem as each of the two countries decided who might enjoy the rights of citizens.  	Foster never reveals whether or not she is Metis.  If so, I doubt if she grew up in a Montana Metis community.  This book is drawn from Ph.D. material.  It reads as if an outsider is basing conclusions on research and interviews.  Most of the material is consistent with the historical facts of the time.  However, it seems out of context with the broad history of Montana and the lifestyles of Montana people in the past century and a half.  To give an example, Foster implies that the Metis and Indians were somehow uniquely disadvantaged by the extermination of the buffalo and the separation of Canada and the U.S. by the forty-ninth parallel.  However, there were many fur traders, wolfers, and others who faced the same problems.  There are many first person accounts by people who lived close to the border and encountered obstacles or prejudice when crossing for social or business reasons.  As drought or homesteading curtailed their livelihood, many Montana homesteaders and cowboys faced difficulties very similar to those that Foster sees as resulting from prejudice against the Metis.  	In fact, this book goes overboard on showing that the Metis suffered prejudice from the Euro-American community.  Indeed, the Metis and Indians suffered prejudice.  However, many of the factors Foster cites as evidence were broadly true across Montana at the time.  I grew up in southeastern Montana.  The majority of farmers and ranchers could have made a case that the townspeople were prejudiced against them, that the bankers and merchants didn't treat them fairly, that they lost homes because their lifestyle was inconsistent with the homestead requirements.  Some felt treated unequally because of differences in religion or politics.  Quite a few felt discriminated against because of deficiencies in language or education.  Without looking very deep, a person can find books about many Montana ethnic groups, each claiming prejudice against their particular group; Italian, German, Polish, Chinese, Irish, Scandinavian, sheep men, wolfers, homesteaders, newly arrived immigrants, old cowboys, schoolteachers.  The list is virtually endless.  Admittedly, the prejudice against these groups was in most cases less than that experienced by the Metis.  On the other hand, most people would feel that Montana Indians faced greater discrimination than the Metis, even those Metis that chose to identify themselves as Indian.  However, it is difficult to quantify degrees of prejudice.  	"We Know Who We Are" is difficult to read.  It is at an academic level and retains the character of a thesis.  There are copious references, a large percentage of which are unavailable to the average reader.  This review started by saying that there are better sources for the reader interested in Metis history.  That is true, but unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a good source.  	In closing, it should be noted that the issues concerning Metis are not all historical.  In each recent session of the U.S. Congress, there have been bills concerning what is often termed Montana's Landless Indians.  A significant portion of this group is what Foster identifies as Metis 
 to call something one thing and for it to function as the exact opposite, how classically 'trickster' of you John.  This book had very few rewarding elements. The steady, lame use of hip-hop slang was so hackneyed it made me wince.  Someone tell this guy that Hip-Hop is the most dominant, most pervasive and most corporate form of popular music in history. Mr. Leland evidences scant knowledge of the indie-rock scene, and I couldn't disagree more with his glib conclusions regarding the Beat generation authors. Independent cinema is barely mentioned. This guy is a marvel of philistine co-option.  My advice is to not read this book, if you are looking for hipness-as hollow as that sounds- then read Whitman, read Kerouac, read Ginsberg, read Twain or Melville, Dostoyevsky anything but this rediculous foray.  At best its kitsch and at worst it meanders off into frivolity.   
 According to John Shelby Spong, Jesus did not literally rise from the dead.  Jesus was crucified, died, and was thrown in a common grave.  Some time after Jesus' crucifixion, an event occurred that created the Christian movement.  The heart of the Christian message is that the "crucified one lives." This alleged truth arose in Peter spontaneously.  The moment that convinced the Apostles of this truth occurred in Galilee and Simon was the primary person in whom this truth first dawned.    To call that idea (hereafter the resurrection vision) that allegedly popped into the mind of Peter a "truth" is quite a surprise.  Spong tells us Peter saw "a realm of God from within which Jesus appeared to Simon. Was it real? Yes...Was it objective?  Spong does not think that Peter's vision was objective.  Spong's thesis is subject to serious epistemological challenge.  Peter did not observe any objective event upon which to conclude that Jesus (the crucified one) was alive.  There was no corresponding factual basis upon which Peter could believe that Jesus was alive.  On this view, Peter had no justified true belief.  Spong's thesis is a subjective and speculative house of cards that cannot stand.     Following Peter' resurrection vision, the need arose to reinterpret the life of Jesus Christ as a faith story.  According to Spong this was done by the method of midrash.  Although he acknowledges midrash as a method for interpreting scripture, Spong brings new meaning the conception midrash by positing it as a method by which Scripture writers affirmed events and transcendent experiences into symbolic forms with no concern for linear time or literal events.  Spong blames the western mind for insisting that the details of the Gospels were actual, historical events.  Early in its history, the Church lost touch with its midrashic origins and claimed too much through literalizing scripture. With the dawn of the enlightenment, Spong suggests that the literal reading of Scripture was proven to be fantasy.  Today, evangelical and fundamentalist elements of the Christian church, Catholic and Protestant, cling to the fading possibility of a literal truth being present in the details of their faith story.   However, we need not fear, Spong's methodology will restore the original meaning of the midrashic message.      Applying his methodology, we cannot be, in the least bit, certain of the historicity of the Old or the New Testaments.  Spong applies his midrashic method to show that whatever events the disciples experienced were set forth in the Gospels as non literal myths or legends.  Specifically, since he places the location of Peter's resurrection vision in Galilee, it follows that the entire burial tradition must all be dismissed as not factual, including the female visitors who discovered the empty tomb.  Jesus' appearances that purport to be the physical manifestations of the dead body that somehow was enabled to be revivified and to walk out of a tomb are also myths and legends.   After disposing of the resurrection narratives as legend, Spong then embarks upon what he calls his speculative reconstruction of the events surrounding the resurrection while admitting that no one "can finally do anything other than speculate!"    Spong's concept of vision is not unique.  For Spong, Jesus appeared to Simon from the realm of God. What Peter saw was not objective and yet it was real.  Both subjective and objective visions have been refuted by scholars.  The objective vision includes the   experience of some literal minimal light phenomen with a corresponding mission.  Spong speaks of a species of subjective vision also called hallucination. Gary Habermas offers an excellent treatment and refutation of the subjective and objective visions of resurrection. (see, Geivett, R. Douglas, Habermas Gary R.  In Defense of Miracles,   Downers Grove:  Illinois, InterVarsity Press, 1997, pages 262-267)    Hallucinations are private events that are not contagious to the masses and are not likely to inspire dying for one's vision.  Spong's version of the vision transfer from Peter to the Apostles is ludicrous at best:  "He tried to open their eyes.  His tortured mind poured out his words in torrents...until light dawned in James, John, and Andrew." (p. 257)  Spong wants us to believe that the Apostles faced the threat of certain death on the basis of a subjective vision.  However, the New Testament reveals that the early church faced both threats and death for testifying to a literal resurrection.                 In stark contrast, the Apostle Paul made the claim of the historical fact of Jesus' resurrection in no uncertain terms.  He presented the fact of the resurrection as the litmus test of the Christian faith.  The resurrection is the primary basis for Christian faith.  Paul stated in no uncertain terms in 1 Cor 15:14-17 that if Christ was not raised, preaching and faith in the bodily resurrection is useless making professing Christians false witnesses for making such declarations.  By positing the resurrection to be a legendary invention, he removes the basis upon which Christianity stands:  salvation from sin through faith in a literal resurrection of Jesus Christ.  Spong's postmodern approach might score high marks in a university literature class, however, rejecting the miracle of the resurrection with this midrashic method would score him low marks with theologians, historians, and philosophers who support the veracity of the New Testament.      
 It was flat after one night of sleeping.  We had to blow it up to capacity every night and would be sleeping on the ground by morning.    Also, be aware that you need an AC outlet to pump it up ... it's NOT for camping 
 This by far the worst movie that I have ever paid to see at a theatre.  That is not to say that it wouldn't make a good rental; where through multiple viewers you could knock the viewing price down to 15 cents a person, but then that would still be too much to pay for this movie.  WWE Entertainment should stick to what it does best -  wrestling events where the story line is better inside the squared circle.  Outside of a Terminator reference made to Robert Patrick, this is a total waste of 91 minutes of your life 
 I never saw this film in the theater, so I can't be completely sure that this is how it's supposed to look. But, assuming that the DVD transfer is accurate, I find all the praise for Kore-eda's "painterly" visuals completely undeserved. The film is shot entirely with natural light; so, in the daytime indoor scenes, the glare from windows and doorways blots out or silhouettes everything; and in the nightime indoor scenes, everything is murky and underexposed. It all looks horribly amateurish. The outdooor scenes come off somewhat better, but slightly grainy overall, almost as if they had been shot on a digital camera.  Cinematography (and possible bad transfer) aside, there's also the matter of Kore-eda's excessively static direction. I can appreciate the still, quiet camera work of Ozu or Jarmusch, but Kore-eda takes this style and pushes it to ridiculous lengths. His camera NEVER moves, not even for an occasional cut or panning or tracking shot. It just sits there, dull and inert, while the scenes drag on and on and then abruptly end, almost arbitrarily. I guess this technique is supposed to impart a contemplative effect to a scene, but again, it just seems amateurish.   The performance by fashion-model-turned-actress Makiko Esumi, as the grieving young widow Yumiko, reflects the director's numb, soporific visual style. Instead of being quietly torn by grief, she comes across as merely affectless. Maybe the director wanted to use a zombie-like non-actress and comatose camera work to convey the numbness of grief, but the result is far from edifying or moving or even interesting. The ultimate effect of this movie is only stupefying boredom.   
 Boring. If you see this book, kill it. Everything this author writes disappoints me. He knows his subjest but not how to apply it to his own work. Writers and grammarians will all wish they's spent their money on a better book, although is it a good sleep aid.  
 I found this product after seeing it lauded on The Today Show and it appeared to be a GREAT idea.  However, I had a lot of difficulty getting the back and strap porting of the bra into the BraBABY and they were pretty tangled when I later took the bras out.  I also have to wonder how a larger bra would work, considering I'm merely a B cup and it was a tight fit.  In theory, I think it's an excellent idea.  In truth, I think it still needs work.  Additionally, although the advertisement claims that you can put them in the dryer, one out of two of mine opened in the dryer both times I've used them - even drying on gentle cycle.  It did maintain the shape of the cup and the underwire throughout the wash spin cycle - a plus.  I hope they keep working on the strap and ease of insertion issue 
 Previously, I read the first two books of the His Dark Materials books with ease. They were easy to get into and the plots were more interesting. The third book is just a disgrace. I read the first couple of chapters and just could not say, "Oh, lets continue reading the Amber Spyglass." I practically had to "force" myself to read it, and eventually, I got tired of forcing myself to read it, so I decided to abandon it. There are three main keys that has led me to discontinuing this book. 1. The plot, the characters, the settings, etc. was just absolutely boring. There were no action-packed parts of the book in the beginning. And a major have-to-do thing for authors is to draw the readers in right from the beginning, and Mr. Pullman has not done that in this book. 2. This book is way too long. The combination of boringness(not a word, but oh well) and lengthiness is definitely not a good combination. 3. Why does PHilip Pullman have to be so against Christianity? I read his bio on wikipedia and he has all these critical comments on C.S. Lewis. It's okay for him to hate the religion, but others have the right to appreciate their own. He's also in these associations that are just so religious related. I just think he shouldn't show his hatred in his books 
 If there is anything my hours upon hours in darkened movie theatres have taught me, it is that there are two immutable laws of cinema:  First immutable law of cinema: Wolfgang Petersen likes to set his films on boats  Second immutable law of cinema: one doesn't often root for Germans  While seminal German submarine picture Das Boot introduced the world to the first law (later cemented with The Perfect Storm, the Poseidon remake, and "airship" flying boat picture Air Force One), it also takes shaky aim at the second - an especially ambitious proposition given that the film is set during WWII (where Germans are never good guys unless you are Jewish, Oskar Schindler, or engaged in a plot to kill Adolf Hitler) and stars consummate baddie Jurgen Prochnow.  Petersen sets about accomplishing this task by remaining relentlessly apolitical, adhering to popular blind-eye historical notions of a WWII where even the German military were victims of the Nazis. Yes, der fuhrer comes under fire at one point for alternately being a poor political strategist and a "braggart," but never for the high crime of being the most evil person in the world ever. Perhaps Petersen assumes this, or just maybe reminding the audience of such would undermine a rooting interest in the charming crew of the picture's unterseeboot, former idealists exposed to the realities of war and wasted youth (much like the protagonists of Gallipoli, Glory, Born on the Fourth of July, and basically every war movie made since John Wayne road off into the sunset...but with Germans). Of the approximately forty-person crew of the U-96, only a single man is an avowed Nazi, and he is mocked for comedic effect. One wonders how Hitler got elected in the first place. This isn't realism, it's revisionism.  In the film's defense, it's not seeking to be a graduate thesis on 1940s German party loyalties, so it probably shouldn't be solely judged on the merits of its historical accuracies (no matter how egregious, or troubling, its view of the past is). Das Boot, first and foremost, is an action film - but not an always engaging one. Moving along at a pace one can expect from a 210 minute running time (the original theatrical release was an hour shorter), Petersen per normal acquits himself nicely as a director of thrilling/claustrophobic set pieces but not so much when he attempts any real character development (granted they all had beards, but by the end of 3+ hours, I still had trouble telling everyone apart), clumsy mise-en-scene (before the inevitable suicide mission, the hull of the u-boat is filled with bananas - perhaps German slang differs, but I can't help but feel I'm being told something), or narrative subtlety - if you don't know whether to be overjoyed or saddened by a particular plot turn, don't worry, the score will tell you. Loudly.  Interesting footnote: Based on the memoirs of German war correspondent Lothar-Gunther Buchheim, the picture almost got made in Hollywood with famed director (and frequent Clint Eastwood collaborator) Don Siegel helming and Paul Newman starring as Capt.-Lt Henrich Lehmann Willenbrock. Even after it was decided to do the film in German with Petersen, Jurgen Prochnow was not the original choice to play the Captain. The director previously offered it to Rutger Hauer, who declined the part to instead do Blade Runner 
 American Juniors are just wannabe's of S Club 8! They take their songs, and sing them horribly! They also took some S Club 7 songs. American Juniors can't even BEGIN to compare themselves to S Club 7. These kids have some potential, but they really need to get their own music. Check out S Club 8/S Club Juniors and S Club 7 for the original songs, which are actually performed well 
 Great Expectations was a mediocre book.  I was not impressed.  I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class.  It was too long and boring.  I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real.  It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill.  Every chapter was boring.  I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book.  Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays?  This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.  In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!  If you want to read a good Dickens story, read "A Christmas Carol" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens 
 This is a serious book on psychology,  not one of those "how to" popular books. To me it was very helpful, it helps to understand oneself better. I reccomend it warmly 
 At first I didn't realize that you have to use Amazon's software to load onto the Zen.  Once I figured that out (actually my husband figured that out) the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do.  I wasn't able to edit the stars.  If I could I would give this 5 stars.  If you have tried some other sites for the Zen, they are much more difficult to use. Amazon's Unbox is great for the Zen 
 I have had the unit for about 3yrs. rain guage was repaired once. Didn't work one more year. Just had a storm with 50 mile an hour winds. I watched the wind guage, it showed 18 miles an hour. Need I say more! 
 Out of all the cr appy punk-pop bands that have come out since Green Day, Simple Plan have to be the worst of the entire bunch! The band basically invented the whole "let's write songs about our awful lives and call it emo". Another thing, can you really name any members of this band other than Pierre Bouvier? Don't worry, you don't need to. Nothing about this pile is good from the whiney lyrics to the lame guitar playing of Jeff Stinco(okay I can name one but that's it).  A lot of people describe Simple Plan's lyrics as "poetic" and "emotional". Here's some lyric examples:  "Yesterday was the worst day ever,  And tomorrow won't be better it's history repeating  On and on  Summer plans are gone forever  I traded them in for dishpan water  And everyday is never ending  I need to work I'm always spending"  "I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare  I'm just a kid I know that it's not fair  Nobody cares cause I'm alone and the world is  Having more fun than me  (Tonight)"  One of the worst parts as well is Pierre's horribly whiney voice. It sounds like this: "WAAAAAAAAAAAAAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!! MYYYYYYYYYYYYYyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy LIIIIIIIIiiiiiiiiiiifffffEEEEEE SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUuccccccccccccKKKKKKKKKKKKKKSSSSSS!!!!!!" *ears start bleeding*  So here we end yet another review of yet another very cr a p py album by a very cr a p py band. Thus say The Metal Master 92... 
 I didn't like this very droll movie.  It was unbelievable, and plot less.  There was some plot there, but it was messed with by the illogical sequences.    When I saw it, I thought of a bad version of "Scarface."  I swear, the scene where they chop up the body was trying to pay homage to the Chainsaw scene in Scarface.  It was "bloody" awful (pun intended!)  I love most Martin Lawerence movies, and see most in the theater (or DVD's these days.)  Ironically, I dislike most Will Smith movies.  Don't know why.  But together, they are gold, usually better than Martin alone.  But this entire movie was a mess.    What I did like: I love the "colorful" Miami theme that all shows and movies in Miami seem to carry.  I think there was one scene in a Jamaican shop, where bullets were blowing around, and I remember seen bright, beautiful colors flowing around.  That was quite clever.  I think the outfits were interesting, though, the Latino mobsters clothes looked so 80's, perhaps another wink to 80's scarface.  The boys didn't seem relaxed in this movie.  Seemed rushed, and trying to squeeze in as much action as possible.    All in all, a rushed, poor job!  Two thumbs down!  MC White said:  Not good 
 As one who lived through many of the scenes depicted here I grew tired of Gerald Hickey's slowness in supposedly coming late to realize that the CIA, Pentagon, Special Forces, White House and Rand wasn't going to use his informaiton for peace. All of us who were there knew this was the case, why didn't he? He was betrayed so many times early on in this book that it seems obvious that his research was never going to be used for peace, so it was instead used for war. 
 The cover art is good, but the music is horrible! This is a REALLY bad recording 
 I found this book dissapointing for the following reasons:  The author's only experience in retail was in giftware so he hardly mentioned examples from other industries.  There is little mention of sales techniques (vital to success in today's competitive environment) nor little advise on how to wow your customers with extraordinary service. The book offered little advise on which types of people you should employ - and how they should be trained to maximise your customer's shopping experience and your company's profitability.  If you are looking for a book to inspire you - rather look at Retail Success 
 Others have already said it better, but good God this book was awful. Predictable plot, stilted conversation, forced attempts to show knowledge of pop culture. What's with the random Demi Moore bashing? I bought it for 50 cents at a garage sale and overpaid. There's 6 hours of my life I'll never get back 
 Lisey's Story is the newest in a series of boring books by Stephen King. Very sad considering Mr. King used to be one of my favorite authors. I hate to say this, but it seems since Mr. King got hit by that van, his writing has gone downhill. Liseys's Story got alot of good reviews and I thought maybe the old, page turning Stephen King was back. Not so. I was lucky to get through about 50 pages of this book and called it quits. I was being put to sleep. 
 Matter of life and death is much better.  Brave new world is lame progressive rock NOT heavy metal.  They don't even do a good job at making progressive rock either.  Check out Therion, Iced Earth, or Dream Theater instead. 
 It's no accident that this novel ranks 1.5 millionth on Amazon in sales. It offers the reader nothing but relentless cruelty, hatred, depression, loveless relationships, one-dimensional characters, and repetitious writing. And in the middle of this book is an anti-French rant that asserts the French are inherently hypocritical because that is part of their culture and makes them civil, whereas Russian culture is more honest because it is directly crude, boorish, and spontaneous in its hypocrisy and stupidities. The matriach of this family is a greedy obsessed woman who gives nothing to her husband or children except reprimands for what she suspects them of doing, which is undermining her and stealing from her. She also expresses little regret at their deaths which she in no small measure has caused. Her husband is a bitter sickly man who never gets out of bed, and we learn precious little more about him. Her children are mere products of this loveless relationship except one, who is a greedy, conniving, religious hypocrite who manipulates his beliefs and words to take possession of everyone else's properties, including his mother's. He earns the name "bloodsucker," which is uttered into his purposely deaf ears again and again. In short, there is nothing redeeming in this novel, nothing that recommends it. The whole mixture can also be boiled under a flame and be reduced from over 300 pages to a third of that without missing a thing. If Chekov had written about this family, he would have produced a short story that might have had a point, but as this stands, I would stay very very far away from this work, unless you are a masochist who enjoys getting depressed 
 Yeah, unlike his first book, which was good, this book seems to be just a weekend's worth of text rambling from a guy trying to steal my money and succeeding. I love Bruce Campbell, but this blatant profiteering makes my skin crawl. I'd rather him do a pop-up book! Next time, Mr. Campbell, hire a ghost writer 
 I spend quite a lot of time at the Google Analytics (GA) website, not only to learn about the tool itself, but also to learn about Web Analytics in general.   I gave such a low grade to this book based on my relative user experience, not on the book quality itself. I think the book should have a real added value over the online GA help center (not to mention the Google Conversion University, which is a wonderful source for Web Analysts) in order to be a useful spending of money. Why should I buy a less comprehensive guide, when I have the full guide for free with an amazing search tool built-in? When I use GA I am in front of the computer anyway, one more tab in my browser does not bother me...  The book has the intention to: introduce the concept of analytics; introduce GA basic features, reports, and competitive strengths; show how to integrate GA with AdWords; show how to utilize dashboards to their fullest; understand how to use analytics for e-commerce, marketing and content optimization. While the book does cover the subjects above, it does so in a very shallow way (specially the e-commerce topic). For the beginner it might be enough, but why shouldn't one get used to a complete and updated version of the guide from the beginning?  I believe that vendor related information is much more accurate and up-to-date when it comes from vendors. The information in this book will not be relevant in no time... Better to buy a book like Web Site Measurement Hacks, from Eric Peterson.   
 Roger Ebert, a review I greatly respect and normally agree with, raved about this flick.  Roger, I love you, but you missed the boat on this one.  I'm not going to review the plot because it's been done by several reviewers already.  Suffice it to say, David Lynch didn't get enough of symbolism interpretation in freshman English ("Okay, class, who wants to discuss the meaning of the impaled pig's head on page 72 in Lord of the Flies?  David, how about you?") and now want to inflict it on you, the unwitting movie watching public.  Thanks, Mr. Lynch, but I'll pass.  I didn't enjoy figuring out the obscure symbolism in page after page of Crime and Punishment and I didn't enjoy it in scene after scene of Mulholland Drive.     To add insult to injury, Lynch prides himself on putting scenes in his movie that make absolutely no sense, rationalizing it by saying life often doesn't make sense.  This habit of his is less noticible in this film than, say, Twin Peaks, mostly because the whole film is for the most part senseless.  Yeah, it's true that a lot of things are absurd in my own life, but more along the lines of "...I would've won Powerball this week except I spent my lottery money on a scented candle at the RenFaire, what the heck was I thinking..." or "...I wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life watching this dumb movie, what the heck was I thinking..." but I've yet to be visited by scrawny cowboy or a wheelchaired dwarf.  I must live a sheltered life or something.  Lynch also forbids chapter cuts in his DVD, believing his movie must be watched in its entirety, or not at all (I'd advise the second.)  To be fair, in this case I don't think he's motivated entirely by a exaggerated sense of importance, but rather by the knowledge that every male, if given the chance, would overshoot most of the movie and focus on the hot chick on chick action.  C'mon all you 5 star givers, admit it!  You find the movie pretentious and silly, but the topless scenes more than make up for all the drippy pseudo-art!    To reiterate, if I wanted to see a boring and pointless dream sequence I'll rewatch Dallas - if I wanted to see a nice rack I'll take my top off and look in the mirror.  Who needs Mulholland Drive 
 I bought this alarm clock today (April 7, 2007) at Bed, Bath and Beyond for $10.  I wish I had seen the reviews first.  I bought it because of the product name, small size and variety of options.  Unfortunately, I realized it wasn't a great buy when I brought it home...and spent a few hours trying to keep the battery in a certain position so the clock would stay on.  The connections appear to be very sensitive and the battery doesn't stay in place.    The clock light is pointless.  It's supposed to help you see the time in the dark, but unless you have the clock at a certain angle everything will appear blurry.  Actually, the screen is blurry in most positions  even with the light off.    As for the alarm, it's pretty quiet.  If you're a sound sleeper or live in a noisy environment, this is not the clock for you.  You'll only hear the alarm if you sleep with it under your ear.   A final note on this product: The clock has been on for almost an hour without any problems...but only with the battery cover slightly open.  If I close the cover all the way, the clock shuts off.  If you want an alarm clock that will last awhile, I suggest buying something else.  You get less than you pay for with this model. 
 This is simply one of the worst books on horror I've ever read.  Before you purchase this book, know what you are getting: the first half of the book focuses on the horror films of the twenties and thirties, and is embroiled (as would be expected) with anecdotes, stories and information about people like James Whale, Tod Browning and Bela Lugosi. This is all highly interesting, but unfortunately the author makes some very far-reaching conclusions about the cultural place of horror films in the 1930s, and especially about Frankenstein and Dracula, the two subjects to which he devotes the most time. In the second half, the book starts collapsing under the weight of its own grand conclusions and impossible correlations. Gradually, almost unnoticeably, facts and figures are entirely replaced with dodgy social and cultural analysis.   Mr. Skal completely fails to mention Jesus Franco, Ruggero Deodato, Lucio Fulci and other famous Italian horror directors. Hammer Horror has less than a page devoted to it. Roger Corman is mentioned in passing in a rambling two-page essay about "Masque of the Red Death". Even Dario Argento, who should be known to all but the least knowledgeable cinephiles, is not mentioned at all in this book. Instead, Skal spends 80 pages discussing AIDS, vampirism and Anne Rice. The author reaches conclusions that are drawn from a set of banal connections: for instance, in the chapter "Bad Blood", Michael Jackson is made out to be a modern-day Lon Chaney. The connection? That both practiced physical transformation (Jackson is a pop star with plastic surgery, Lon Chaney was a make-up pioneer film-star. The connection is superficial at best). Horror icons are constantly made out to be "christ figures".  This book is full of holes when it comes to the subject it's supposed to be a "comprehensive" study of: Italian/Spanish horror, Indian horror and Asian horror are not mentioned at all, and neither is the VHS revolution in the 80s. To add to insult, the cultural analysis is weak and contrived, delivered in hyper-eloquent, grandiose prose and takes up about half of the book. Go with Steven J. Schneiders "The Horror Film and Psychoanalysis: Freud's Worst Nightmares" instead, which covers much of the same subjects in an infinitely better package 
 This book assumes that you know about makeup and is basically a self promoting book about the celebrities the author knows. The first 40 or so pages do discuss makeup tips, but it's overshadowed by the remaining 100+ pages of stories of his famous clientele. Not what I was looking for in a beauty book 
 Ok, check it out, there's two Jack Blacks. One is the guy from Tenacious D, you see him all the time. He's funny and childish and insane. Then there's the other Jack Black. He's the evil creature who pervades films like Shallow Hal and King Kong, whose only humorous lines are the ones that are funny by accident. Well, as long as you aren't fat and don't feel patronized by Gweneth presuming to know what it's like not to be desired all her life (ha), then by all means suspend all disbelief, logic, and brain power and watch this dumb movie. Gweneth's fat suit is actually pretty convincing, although most of the movie she's played by an actual fat chick...who by the way should have just been left in, without the whole "ha ha the dude thinks she's skinny" nonsense. Obviously, a film about a dude trying to cope with dating a big girl would have a lot more resonance if: a) He weren't brainwashed b) His fat girlfriend wasn't replaced by a twiggy blond chick  c) The movie didn't throw ridiculous concepts your way (like a guy could have sex with a 300 lb woman without realizing it) d) Tony Robbins was in no way involved whatsoever  I knew I was slumming it when I saw this movie.  But I'm not sure what the message of this film is.  Jack Black's character is decent, considerate, great with kids and perfect in every way.  Oh, except he's really shallow for no dicernable reason, other than his dad's dying words were for him to go out and chase tail.  The weird part is that Hal's not a bad person.  The movie beats you over the head showing you he's the nicest guy on on the face of the Earth, so you can't really laugh at him looking like an idiot.  Rosemary is so fat she has superpowers.  Her butt actually creates typhoons (I wonder if that has military applications?).  Suddenly, Hal mistakes ugly pimply girls for supermodels and evil skanks for old shrews.  Tony Robbins brainwashed him, the fiend! When Hal finally realizes this he decides to (ooh big spoiler) love Rosemary anyway, and learns a VALUBLE LESSON.  Along the way there are a ton of cliches like people thinking he's dating Rosemary just because her dad happens to be his boss, and a sexy neighbor in his building who starts to get the hots for him when she sees how non-judgemental he is dating a fat girl ('cause that would make any woman melt).  Of course there's requisite best friend, played by Jason Alexander, who is repulsed by fat people and plots to get Hal to dump her.  Then again, the friend is a complete troll, so I don't know why Hal would want him around.  And to insult us further, they force some burned kids on us at the hospital to strike a SERIOUS note about how true beauty is on the inside. Too...many...public...service...messages! PICK...ONE..!!   But brain-dead writing aside, Paltrow really sells her performance when they actually show her in the fat suit (despite Gweneth's postering when this film was first released). Regardless of its clumsy benevolence, I have to rate this as a romantic comedy. And for that, I give it a rating of totally unremarkable. Nice gesture, Farelly brothers. Not to be bothered with 
 I'm sorry but children that try to rap are just horrible. They are just a gimmick like the old school r and b artists that would come out called teeny boppers. I guess this lil one wants to be a "hip hop teeny bopper". Well guess what? You don't get teeny bopper reviews, you get grown up one's. Please stop rapping and go to college (or work as a mechanic) like a normal kid should 
 This is the second worst book I have ever read! The first, being the authors revisionist barf about the featherweight irish! He writes with the dexterity of a blind bull elephant in a China shop. The chapters have no order, and are incoherent, and he does not sight his sources. An Eskimo knows more about the Jewish people than this crude clown. Read Isaac Asimov and Abba Eban if you want to learn the truth. 
 I could not stand this book. It used verbs like it was going out of style. It tries to make you believe that you're about to embark upon an amazing adventure of learning where discoveries will lead to ultimate fulfillment and success :) . It's 75% fluff to make you believe that all life problems will be solved if only you could learn how to learn. It was like Anthony Robbins wrote it. Motivational B.S.. Some of it was good, if you siffed long enough you could get a couple gold flakes out of this one, that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of a deserving 1. But it was so anoying in how it was written. It was so bad I had a hard time paying attention. Awful motivational and persuasive [stuff]. Do waste you money buying this. .. 
 If you are looking for a book that will teach you a lot about real estate and home inspections then this is not the book for you. The chapter information and text content of this book was very basic and did not teach me anything I didn't already learn from other books that were much better. Inspecting homes is something I have done for many years and I would not recommend this book to any customers or contractors. If you know absolutely nothing about real estate then you might learn a few things but not too much 
 Diamond Dogs was Bowie's first misstep since becoming famous, but his aura was so powerful that most people hadn't noticed. As far as the media was concerned, the photo of Bowie as a post-apocalyptic half man/half dog mutant provided more than enough fodder for their copy. The album's hit single "Rebel Rebel" helped to disguise the paucity of continuity on this album, but the fact remains that Diamond Dogs catches Bowie at a fairly uncertain moment in his career. Fed up with Ziggy Stardust, but unable to entirely throw that persona off, Bowie dabbles in various modifications of his image with this album. Unfortunately, none are anywhere near as convincing as his previous incarnations. The main reason this happens is simply because the material is lacking. Bowie was certainly an artist who was capable of pushing his image before his material, but he was always imaginative as a songwriter, too, so the material always seemed to come from some rarefied place.  Diamond Dogs is too schizophrenic, so the album suffers. Since Bowie expends a great deal of energy trying to develop a theme that never gels, two straight-ahead rock and roll numbers ("Diamond Dogs" and "Rebel Rebel") have the burden of carrying the entire album. They aren't enough. The "Sweet Thing/ Candidate" medley is the only other musical offering on side one; It takes him minutes, but takes us nowhere. The same goes for side two's "Big Brother" segment. "Rock and Roll with Me" is as close as Bowie has ever come to writing generic material, and "We Are the Dead" is lifeless, which leaves "1984" to carry the entire second half of the album. Even this is greatly disappointing, though, especially since it was drastically edited from the ten-minute centerpiece that it had become in recent live (and televised) performances. Why spend so much time and energy introducing your audience to something if you aren't going to utilize it on your album? It is questions like these that remain unanswered, and it is reasons like this that make Diamond Dogs seem so inconsistent, schizophrenic, and confused.     B	Tom Rya 
  This author has surly become disallusioned with his religion and is trying to bend it to his liking 
 The book was long and boring. To many and way to much descriptive details. I regret ever purchasing the book. Had to really fight with my self to finish the book. I'm glad it's over 
 This is a low carb book. "Better of with Atkins Book" 
 An extremely frustrating book to read due to the author stretching what should be one or two chapters into a full book by repeating the same points over and over and over.  After suffering through to the end, not one new or interesting idea that you would not have not already envountered by reading the business/investing section of a decent newspaper or The Economist.  Honestly, one of the worst books, financial or otherwise, I ever read in my life 
 A diary is supposed to allow me to record my personal information.  By adding the irrelevant photos and so-called motivational quotes, they have reduced the space for my personal information even further.  I used the first edition for four years.  At least I was generally able to squeeze in the essentials of my workouts.  However, the new edition has less space available for each day, and still only room for two workouts.  The space for each workout is much less than adequate, and forget ever trying to squeeze in a record of more than two on any day.  Do you ever workout more than twice a day?  Then, skip this product! 
 I was initially very excited to see this book was available.  The Komsomolets was the advanced technology "Mike" class submarine.  Designed with a titanium hull and advanced hull design, the submarine was a worry for the US Navy in the closing days of the Soviet Union.  However in 1989, a fire broke out on board while in the Norwegian sea, and this drove the submarine to the surface.  The fire spread and the submarine floundered and eventually sank, with considerable loss of life.  The present book's author, D. A. Romanov, was one of the designers of the submarine.  As such, he is ideally placed to discuss the technical issues and aspects that lead to this tragedy.  Unfortunately, a better title for this book might be "Lost in Translation".  It is immediately clear that the translator has no knowledge of submarines, and the translation appears to be almost a literal word for word version, with little regard for idiomatic phrasing. The result is an extremely awkward, and in many cases unintelligible book.  Two examples: "The supply of oxygen in these compartments was provided by the periodic opening of the corresponding valves in the oxygenated collector of the electro-laser in the electromechanical air regenerating system located in the second compartment."  A little further on the same page: "In accordance with the RBZh-PL-82 (appendix 15), the watchstander of the compartment must control the content of the oxygen in the atmosphere of the compartment no less than six times a day by use of a portable apparatus, independent from the condition of the automatic means of control." These border on some of the best technobabble since Star Trek: The Next Generation.   The official investigation by the Soviet Navy of the Komsomolets accident basically exonerated the crew and the leadership, instead blaming the accident on numerous "design pecularities" and "technical imperfections" of the submarine.  Romanov's thesis is that crew training and readiness were woefully inadequate, and the failure to routinely monitor oxygen systems led to a fire that started in compartment seven (the aftermost compartment at the stern).  The failure to control the fire by promptly discharging Freon -based extinguishing materials into compartment seven led to the fire spreading forward, and smoke spreading through the ventilation system. Confusion reigns in the few minutes after the fire develops, and precious time is lost in attempting to clarify the situation aft. Romanov systematically goes through the accident timeline and testimony and points out step by step how the crew and officers lost several chances to control and contain the fire and save the submarine. He defends the design of the submarine and condemns the poor casualty training and especially the lack of officer leadership in the disaster. Even when the decision was made to surface the submarine and discharge life rafts from special canisters built into the hull, the lack of training and preparedness conspires to kill additional men in the icy waters.  The deployment canister is designed to rapidly discharge the rafts into the water by having the bottom of the canister drop away and release the rafts. This operation is totally misunderstood, and instead the crew tries to lift the 200 lb rafts out of the top of the canisters.  Romanov also devotes a section near the end (Assault of the Pundits) to answering specific criticisms leveled at the submarine design.  I suspect that there may be a decent and intriguing story struggling to get out of this book; unfortunately, it didn't make it!    I was extremely disappointed in this book overall.  As noted above, significant sections of it are excruciatingly difficult to read and understand.  The language is extremely stilted, reminiscent of Cold War Tass press releases. There are a number of rather complicated block diagrams of key ship's systems throughout the book; these are labeled in Russian and there is no accompanying explanatory text.  The diagram titles are minimally helpful (e.g. sources of smoke and gas in compartments two and seven).  As such, they just fill space and do not aid the reader at all in understanding the technical arguments. The book does have some photos, although many were taken underwater after the sinking and are extreme close-ups.  Without some sort of context, it is next to impossible to say why any particular photo is shown and what the reader should take from the picture.  Unless you are an extremely hard-core Russian submarine fan, I cannot in good conscience recommend this book to you.     
 I'd buy this CD in a second if it included all of the songs from the movie. 
 The book covers a lot of material but, the book's index is far from complete.    Although the book proports to describe both DB2 and other databases, facts such as the important difference between Numeric and Decimal types in DB2 are omitted. 
 Ahhhh, what a great movie.  I cry at the end every time.  I remember when I was young and prayed for the safe return of the astronauts of Apollo 13.  However, I am SEVERELY dissappointed with the widescreen DVD.  Those who created it did not use the original film, but chopped top and bottom from the fullscreen VHS version.  There are many instances when this is evident, but the most glaring is the scene in the back yard of the Lovell house after the walk on the moon when Jim says, "I want to go back there".  When the scene opens, he is cut off at mid-thigh and you never see below his knees. On the fullscreen VHS you can see his shoes.  When I buy the widescreen, I want the WHOLE movie, not less than the fullscreen VHS tape.  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.  Buy the VHS 
 Waiting is a single-concept book novella confronting the difficulties of love and individual happiness in a restrictive society that is stretched to a few hundred pages. Ha Jin's personal accomplishments notwithstanding, this is one of the most overrated books I have read. National Book Award? Hmmm.   Waiting is the story of a doctor and loyal officer of the revolution, Lin, trapped in a loveless marriage. When Lin becomes passively entangled in an extramarital affair with a nurse at his hospital--Manna Wu--herself the victim of waiting for a man, he is repeatedly denied the divorce that his girlfriend demands. Everyone in Waiting waits...and waits...and waits.  The book gets its point across, and more or less works as an allegory on the Chinese communist state. It lacks any deeply interesting characterization, as Manna, and even Lin, are both all too childlike (as the author intends). The book also lacks lyricism and elegance, and unforgivable trangression for sucha  decorated piece of literature. Ha Jin's story educates, but doesn't elevate us 
 This was everything I looked for in an mp3 player, but only for about first 6 months.  About half a year from getting it the headphone input went, making the audio staticy and constantly going mono.  Had to send it in for repairs.  After another 5-6 months of light use (mostly in the car, so it's not like it was bumped around in bags and pockets) the problem reoccurred.  Had to send it for repairs again.  A couple of months later, after the 1 year warranty expired, I noticed that the battery life started to decrease.  In a few weeks it got to a point of lasting for only about an hour after being fully charged.  I nevertheless continued using the unit, being extra careful with that damn headphone jack and making sure that I charge it every night.  So a couple of weeks ago (about 15 months after purchase) it stopped working completely.  When turned on it gives "HDD Error" message .  Resetting does not work.  The computer no longer "sees" it when it's plugged in. I emailed tech support and got and they said that it looks like the hard drive needs to be replaced and the possible cost for that is $195.  Needless to say that I won't be investing two hundred bucks into the clearly faulty unit.  I really liked it before the problems started and was eventually planning to upgrade to 60GB model, but I doubt I'll trust this manufacturer again 
 It's very boring, pictures of old shoes , i think they picked the worst shoes from late 90's 
 ~I bought the MVSV3-1m cable and put it between my Pioneer V555 DVD player and SONY WEGA tv KV-27FS12, I was unable to see with my naked eyes any improvement regading the visual quality, color, sharpness. Same as the result as I used the composite cable came with the box. I really don't know why. I have to say, my TV is a good one and the picture quality is already satisfactory even I don't use DVD player. Unfortunately my DVD player does not have component jack to let me try the next level video~~ experience. I don't want to say this expensive cable is a poor one, I was just unable to verify its alledged ultra high performance. we just don't have a benchmark to evaluate it. 
 This would have been a good skit, or maybe a short story, but not an entire novel.  The book is tired like the town Wigfield 
 ...that Robinson's latest books have become as pedestrian as this one.  I found the plot uninspiring at best, and completely devoid of surprises.  All in all, one could skip this entry and not miss a thing.  As always, Robinson is a good writer, and he's brought Banks to an interesting -- albeit depressing -- psychological place, but one can't help but feel that he and the series are simply treading water at this point.  If only the entire book were as brilliant and incisive as the very last line.  I'll keep my fingers crossed for the next one 
 If you are a busy person, you work a lot with programmers and you need a general understanding of programming, this is not the book for you.   If you have time on your hands, and you want to learn VB, this could be the book for you. After I bought this book I realised I was fooled by the title.  It should be called 'Programming in Visual Basic for beginners'.   The point of this book is to teach you to program in VB6, not to teach you the basics of programming using VB as an example language.  While I can understand that the verbose classroom approach may appeal to some, I found it patronising and time wasting. I eventually bought 'Sams Teach Yourself Beginning Programming in 24 Hours' by Greg Perry which gives a concise summary of programming basics, an overview of the most common languages, and exercises to drive home the lessons. Exactly what I was after.   
 Sure there's some excellent artwork in this picture book. But instead of being an artistic guide to the ships of the Star Trek universe, 'Ships Of The Line' ends up being more like a photo album (albeit artist-rendered) of the central ship of each of the Star Trek television series. This is not anything close to a comprehensive spotter's book for the various Federation and alien space craft like the book's dust jacket suggests, which is EXACTLY the sort of book a Trekkie geek like me was expecting. Instead, this book lays out like a scrap book of the various iterations of U.S.S. Enterprises as it appeared on the various series and in film, the Defiant from DS9 and of course Voyager. Too few of the art panels focus on other ships in the Star Fleet inventory, or from any of the alien races that makes the Star Trek shows as rich and embellished as they were.  Too small to be a real coffee table book, and too lacking in the sort of minutiae information a Trek trivia fan craves to be useful as a real Star Trek reference guide, 'Ships Of The Line' needs to head back to the literary version of space dry dock for a content refit 
 The teaming of Brian Hegeland with Heath Ledger, Mark Addy, and Shannon Sossamon produced one fantastic movie... unfortunately that movie was "A Knight's Tale" not "The Order."  The movie is an unimaginative take on a promising premise:  A young Catholic priest (Heath Ledger) investigating the death of his mentor discovers the existence of the "Sin Eater." This immortal individual performs an arcane ritual which can secure salvation for those outside the grace of the Roman Catholic Church. The current "Sin Eater" is weary of this burden and wants to recruit himself a replacement in Father Alex (Heath Ledger).  Besides the slow pace and lack of focus, the movie's greatest flaw is the complete absence of any chemistry between the two stars. A foundation of the plot rests on Alex's (Heath Ledger) conflict between his vow of celibacy and his desire for Mara (Shannyn Sossamon). The relationship seems forced and discredits the rest of the film.   
 This book will teach you how to sound pedantic and insincere in Japanese.  It is basically a list of buzz words that stupid people throw around in the states to sound smart.  It teaches absolutely no grammar, so you will spit out words like "radioactive waste" in broken, incorrect Japanese 
 Wright presents no new information about Al-Qaeda, leaves out plenty of information about Al-Qaeda and neglects the USA side of "the road to 9/11."  Understanding Qutb's radicalization of Islam is important to understanding why Ayman al-Zawahiri and Usama exist and also why they failed at creating theocracies and were lame ducks until the USA found a use for them as an enemy.  What cannot be neglected is the myths spread about the United States by the Neoconservatives and followers of Leo Strauss.  The United States is not a unique and beautiful snowflake.  The liberal idea of individual freedom was decried by Strauss as destructive of the society of the USA and he told his followers to keep the public in line with grand myths about US exceptionalism.  After the the Soviet Union was kicked out of Afghanistan, both Qutb and Strauss' followers believed they were the cause of it.  Since the Cold War the US has been working off of the "friend and enemy" model of policy formulated by Carl Schmitt and 9/11 presented the US with what Schmitt called a "state of exemption."  If you think jihad was the cause of 9/11, ask yourself why Richard Clarke found Bush and his advisors saying find a way to tie this to Iraq hours after 9/11.  See the BBC documentary, "The Power of Nightmares" or "From Secularism to Jihad: Sayyid Qutb and the Foundations of Radical Islamism" by Adnan A. Musallam or the Political Ideas of Leo Strauss by Shadia Drury for a better analysis of Qutb and Strauss than Wright has in his book.  If you prefer to stick with fiction about "the road to 9/11," check out Patrick S. Johnston's novel "Mission Accomplished. 
 I wish ther was a -10. Dum story. Same old evil wolfs are bad. Y not somthing new for a change 
 We've had a number of Gazillion bubble machines.  The first - this one, with an upright rotating set of bubble wands - worked relatively well, but stopped working after maybe a dozen uses.  (Granted, one of those uses was for a few hours).  When the level of liquid is low, the machine stops making bubbles since it has to pick up enough liquid to cover the wand.    We replaced it the next year with the Typhoon machine - this was awesome, produced a huge quantity of bubbles and worked more reliably since the bubble liquid is sucked up and put on the wands, no matter how low the supply of liquid.  It has a large reservoir at the bottom so you don't need to fill it very often - it takes a lot of liquid though.    Our issue now is getting the liquid.  Gazillion liquid does produce the best bubbles - they last well, etc. etc. etc.  HOWEVER, very few stores stock the liquid, and except for when I first bought the first machine, no-one stocks large size bottles.  Even the online vendors like toys.com who are supposed to have them, never have them in stock (I've been on their notify list for a long time!)  I've ended up buying from someone in Canada on eBay - otherwise, buying the smaller bottles at ToysRUs, Target, etc. is just too expensive.    Both of these machines don't really work if you try other bubble liquids - other liquids (especially the cheaper kinds in very large size bottles) are much thinner and the liquid drips right off the wands before it has a chance to pass by the blower part to make any bubbles.   We're planning to start making our own bubble liquid and hopefully that will cover us.  Otherwise, the machines are useless now.  
 Since I loved Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain (way back in high school) I happily picked up Congo at the airport. What an enormous disappointment - the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half. Nonsensical details are never explained (what's with the gray gorillas and the paddles? The gorillas were trained by the Zing-ites, back in the day, to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it? This is never made clear), the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up, and the characters are ridiculously one-dimensional. This is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you're SOL - the plot is not going to come together, and you're not going to be satisfied. That, plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology, left me entirely cold - this book hit the airport trash can the minute I debarked 
 And I thought I WAS a die-hard Conrad fan!  He's one of those writers by whom I must read a book every two or three years -- but this one I did not like at all.  Despite the usual brilliant prose, much of it as good as  anything Conrad has done, "Tether" is a let-down -- astoundingly  depressing!  Most Conrad work posits a world that is inimical and uncaring,  yet holds out hope that courage and integrity will serve to help us endure  it all; "Tether" holds out no such hope.  It concerns a captain  who continues to pilot his ship even though he is legally blind, doing so  in order to provide for his family.  Nothing turns out okay, and no one  ends up happy.  I don't ask for a lot of hope from the books I read -- but  at least a little 
 Don't Buy it. Be warned. It's stupid. You will regret it is the worst possible thing that has come to musicals and hopefully will be the last 
 First, it took forever to get this book shipped and then when I did receive it - what a disappointment.  Most of the photos are poor, lots of "noise" in most enlargments - which is very surprising for "Life".  Second, there is very little written information.  
 This is Arnolds fakiest film.  I mean, a demigod?  I can't believe this at all...fakiest film.  Yes Arnold is in peak condition in this film, but his other films are simply a little easier to swallow...come on Arnold, no one talks back to Zeus 
 It's a very nicely drawn & explained book but if you have any other style home other than Victorian, there are limited styles that would match. Also, you have to order patterns separately 
 UPDATED REVIEW  Mine died 35 days after I bought it. The retail store thankfully made good on it. Second one performs slightly better. Overheats QUICKLY witha  1 gig card, and that may be why first one failed - heat. I can't praise this item as others have done. It's unreliable 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 Richard Brautigan's Trout Fishing in America could have been a real classic for the ages.  That is, it could have been a classic if it wasn't about trout fishing and if it wasn't written by Richard Brautigan.  Brautigan seems directionless as usual here, leaping haphazardly from one place in time to another.  Just when he comes up with an interesting line or word, he seems to forget about it and leave you hanging while he goes off to some other world.  His writing is the equivalent of sitting in a chair under a tree drinking MD 20/20, suddenly falling onto your back, and then staring up at the leaves and wishing that it all meant something quite profound.  And that is where the problem lies--Brautigan wants the grander themes and ideas of the world to be expressed in his books, but he never does the legwork to get you there.  You feel teased after reading his poems, like a girl who says she'd like to date you, then leaves you to go swimming at the YWCA, and you never hear from her again.  Do you see where I'm going here?  You can't make lemonade out of a sourpuss.  Brautigan never gave it his best shot, and unfortunately, he left the world without having said very much to it 
 I have the VCR copy of this and I purchased the DVD, hoping to have another way to watch it. However the quality of the DVD is horrible. It's like someone pirated it from the VCR copy. I could've done a better job with lesser equipment. 
 This book, set in the Midwest in the early 70's, is unbelievable and ultimately silly.  I was a young woman during that time; I can tell all you younger readers out there that there is no authenticity to this story.  It might have worked if set in the 19th century on the Plains, or perhaps the English moors.  No, probably not because angst is not a reason to write a book, no matter how skilled the author at writing prose.   I had the sense while reading this book that Ansay started with the premise that the world is bad, and most people are cruel, insensitive and victimized.  Then she tried to invent reasons why this is true.  The results are cardboard characters that are cutouts of cruel, victimized people with no human being attached.   The premise that a painful past makes for a wretched person has been done wonderfully well in countless other books.  Try Elizabeth Bowen's "Death of the Heart" for a masterful treatment of this subject. If you're looking for dysfunctional families, try Joanna Trollope.  They are honest, they are believable.   Ansay has not yet developed the heart, vision or wisdom to see people as whole beings.  If she ever does she will be a knockout of a writer because her prose style is wonderful.  Until she does, her books will be one long, depressing, unbelievable whine 
 I bought this book last year and read the first few chapters before getting bored. In other words, I had no desire to continue reading it. Much of what he says aren't his ideas, he shamelessly borrows from the great thinkers, so it's probably better just to buy THEIR books instead of one from an author who simply quotes others. He apparently writes book after book regurgitating material he's done before or from others to get rich.   Dyer DEFINITELY has an intention, and it's to get rich by selling his mediocre books. 
 A Nightmare! Don't buy from Electronics Expo! The 1st Sharp 52' LCD TV was late, had a smashed HDMI & 4 dead pixels.  The replacement TV had even more dead pixels & Electronics Expo, Sharp, Amazon & Visa all gave me a horrible time & no respect.  So I am stuck with 2 damaged TVs now & still fighting for a refund.  My advice to all - Get a SONY from a local store for perfection & no worries 
 My 4 year old loves this set of books!  They were challenging yet easy enough to experience success.  The sentence patterns and picture clues are perfect for young pre-K/K readers. 
 I've read easily a dozen poker books - normal stuff like, Jones, Sklansky, Harrington, Gordon, and I thought this book would talk about Matt'a learning experience, what levels he started at and where and what he learned.  This book started out like a read for a complete beginner with talk of how to play Hold 'Em.  It continued with a self-inflated view of his trournament history - include hand by hand in certain tournaments.  It includes stuff like "then with the blinds at 500-1000, I picked up ATo and raised on the button to take the blinds."  Jesus - who cares?  The amazing part is that this book was written BEFORE he won playing in the 2004 WPT Championship.  He was nothing but an amateur with a couple cashes.  He had no business writing a book.  And sinec this book was written in 2003, some stuff has a bit out of date.  I wish I had not bought the book at all 
 I think every organizing book out there has some good points, and this one certainly does, but,unless you are completely clueless and/or completely unorganized to such an extent that you don't know to give away something you aren't using, don't bother with this book!  Her clients seem to be completely clueless.  One guy didn't know to put his socks and underwear in a dresser, and she helped him with that.  One couple had 3 extra bedrooms but built on to their house because they thought of the bedrooms as bedrooms, and not offices.  One couple kept their children's play gym in their bedroom, taking up most of the space,even though their children had outgrown it!  She had to tell them to get rid of it!!!  Another lady didn't know what to do because her kitchen counters were full of things she used, but her cabinets were full of things she didn't use.  She had to be told to take the things she didn't use out of her cabinets and give them away, so she could put the things she used in them!!  I could go on and on, the book is full of stories like this.  I just thought most of this book was common sense.  Try "Organized from the Inside Out" if you are looking for a good orgaizning book 
 This book was not at all what I expected and I was very upset that I wasted my tme and money on it. It is not up to date with today's times at all. When I bought this book I s loking for an informational guide on the  joys of sex- instead I got a one sided opnion from a man who seems not to  be up to date with todays society. I dislike the way he referred to  homosexualty,transexuals,and experimental people as if they were wrong,and  they were not normal-very insulting and discrimminitory to those  individuals,and to me personally. So if you are looking for an outdated  medocre publication then this book would be just right for you 
 Maggie Smith is a wonderful actress and the Italian scenery is photographed to a luminous perfection, but the storyline of My House in Umbria is an exasperating mess.  As the grande dame romance novelist with a dark past and a relentless imagination, our heroine makes a sloppy but sometimes piercingly insightful drunk:  a complex and comprehensible character, a woman to be wary of.  This marvelous mystery lady is even surrounded by a fine ensemble cast.  But all these interesting actors are cast adrift in an unfinished plot hinting at complications it hasn't any idea what to do with.  You're set on edge for some elusive explanation that they never get to.  Just when you were convinced it didn't matter any more they toss you an extra clue or two, and then finally they expect you to be charmed by an off-camera change of heart in the cold American uncle who has never given the slightest indication of being thawed out by the warmth of either Italy or the lady of the house, such an unbelievable turn of events that you expect her to awaken from a dream so you can find out what really happened.  Again and again I had to ask myself, Are these really the facts of the story?  Or are we just muddling about in her imagination?  And of the whole movie:  Are we really expected to take this immense display of sentimentality at face value?  Or is there an undercurrent here that would make sense of it all if they would just get to the point?  Unfortunately these questions were never reasonably answered 
 This album shows sadly that Nancy has lost her pipes, albeit ever so slowly. She misses as many as she hits. The arrangements are good and the surrounding cast is excellent with Bob Mintzer, James Moody , Tom Scott and many others and the artwork is superb! She looks great in the photos, and maybe that's good enough reason to buy it. But the singing is poor and her choice of numbers isn't so great either. I suspect that if she would keep it light and moving along at a faster swing-type tempo, as say Sinatra did at the end, she would sound better. Still a very classy lady though.  
 Robins' whole presentation is distressing, and in a word, untenable.  No  one has yet written the definitive text on phase noise, although most  aspects have been documented in the professional literature over the years.   As a veteran with over 40 years of experience in the subject, I found  Robins' mathematical development ineffective, the style exhausting, and the  conclusions generally obscure.  He overworks drawing general inferences  from specific or oversimplified examples.  Many important topics concerning  phase noise theory and practice are either missing or shallow in substance.   My suggestion is, if you want to understand phase noise, first consult a  good text on modulation theory (there are many of them), and then search  the Web for articles on phase noise (and allied subjects).  There you will  find a wealth of information on characteristics and measurement techniques,  and it's free 
 [http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/faq/Genesis.asp] [www.answersingenesis.org] has numerous refutations of 'progressive creationism' and specifically of Ross' assertation of the meaning of the Hebrew word for day (yom). They clearly demonstrate the grammatical errors of his claim.  Also see the book "Refuting Compromise" by Jonathan Sarfati, Ph.D 
 How many times can you wear out the same story line. Kahlan lost, Kahlan found, Kahlan lost again, Kahlan found again. Or Richard lost, Richard found, ohp...Richard lost again, Richard found again. Goodkind has run out of ideas. He should put the Sword of Truth series down and move on to something fresh. 
 For me this movie is a painfull thing to watch. I wish that I could give this 0 stars. The infamous fake "O" scene kind of recked true intamacy for me. It may be true that women do this but it is one of the worst kind of lie imaginable.   One of the truths for us guys is that when we are cuddiling with a woman we fanasise that we are with the first girl we fell in love with.   Just FYI.   
 While this is an excellent and well written story, the Blackstone Audio version is horribly read. It is painful to listen to. The reader is very "nasal" and the attempts at accents and characterizations are just simply horrific. Find another version, or read the book if you can. I can't, and had to endure this version of the audiobook. I listen to a LOT of audiobooks and this experience was a nightmare 
 This is a very strange release. In short, Russell doesn' sound at all like Russell -- his voice is far too deep and strained. I just saw then in person in Vegas and this sounds nothing like that. (... 
 Are you kidding me?! It's a great performance and all, but ONE freaking hit or remotely recognizable song ("Hanginaround) out of 15?! They don't even perform "Mr. Jones." Wasn't the idea to have this show in New Amsterdam spawned from the opening line of that song? Would be better off as an internet only release, rather than a Nation-wide one 
 Kriss Stephens knows one thing for sure: ghosts (whatever they are or however you choose to define them) exist, and she really knows how to find them. And take their pictures. She refers to herself as a "paranormal investigator and a professional photographer", and FEAR is the story about some of the hundreds of ghost-hunts she's done over the years.  There is, in Stephen's world, no such thing as a world without ghosts, and there's no point trying to prove their existence, because, well, they exist. She's very sure about that. What's worth investigating, though, is how and why a certain location becomes haunted. And yes, I agree, those are definitely questions worth asking. But just make sure not to do it they way Kriss Stephens does it.  Because I don't think I've ever seen a so-called paranormal book of such low quality. There's no reason doubting that Stephens believes in what she does; she's both honest and motivated, but honestly, if she's really a "paranormal investigator" and especially a "professional photographer", then my parents' dog could be that too.  The book is absolutely packed with black and white pictures, and they're all just as boring, pointless, uninteresting, and stupid. In each new chapter, Stephens alone or together with a group of "colleagues" goes to a haunted location, and wherever she goes she has some sort of ghost-related "paranormal" experience. As soon as she arrives at a new site, be that a house with a violent history, a battlefield from the American civil war, a cemetery and so on, she starts taking picture with her digital camera, and she always ends up with photographic proofs of the presence of ghosts.  Well, then, what are those proofs of hers? Orbs, orbs, and more orbs. In other words, perfectly natural phenomena that has nothing whatsoever to do with the world of the paranormal. And in case it's not orbs then it's fuzzy details or smoke or something else very much mundane that in Stephens' eyes turn into ghosts.  And that's how the story goes throughout all of the book's 234 pages. More or less every single page has at least one picture, and most of the pictures don't even show anything interesting at all. The book is not one bit investigative, there's no critical thinking to be found, and I doubt that I've ever read a book where the author has been as gullible as Kriss Stephens.    Yet, I still had a good time reading it, because gullibility can be extremely entertaining. Still, I cannot help but to feel sorry for Stephens, who apparently lives in her own little fantasy world where ghosts almost seem to outnumber real life humans 
 When Mike & The Mechanics ushered in the `Madchester' scene with The Living Years it was only a matter of time before these jokers attempted to jump on the bandwagon. If you want to be adored you should write some decent songs lads! Verdict: don't waste your money. 
 If this wasn't such an inexpensive item I would return it, but the hassle is too great 
 This book is way overated.  Its way-out, wacky treament of electronics could definitely not be that of any well thought-of engineer.  It's frankly just a bunch of goofy unsystematic mumbo-jumbo by some over-educated self-proclaimed "physicists."   So imagine my surprise when I read a translation of this in Russian.  I think the whole world must have been duped.  Do yourself a favor.  Go read the Smith book (see my other reviews) and avoid this one like the plague 
 Same exercises, even the same pictures, and of course, the same cocky attitude. I dunno, maybe a video would be better, but when I see "JP" sitting on a chair flexing his biceps, I don't get all that inspired. The book starts out just like "Pushing Yourself to Power" and has pages and pages of stories about Charles Atlas, Herschel Walker, et al, and how all they did was push ups, chin ups, squats, and sit ups and they became Greek gods. Then it moves on to  nutrition (oh yeah, that's an exact science), then to page after page of cocky attitude and re-hashed pictures of "JP" and Wendy flexing and posing. I was very dissapointed in this book 
 After reading this compulsively readable book (compulsively readable in the same way that eating a pint of ice cream is compulsive, reprimanding oneself afterward for submitting to the lowly instinct), I felt tremendous pity for Mark Kram.  I don't think he was so much concerned with portraying the "fateful blood feud between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier" as making an art out of agony, resentments and utter dirt. I would have been more satisfied if Kram had ended each chapter with the following lines: "All is darkness."  "All is darkness".   With respect to the reviewer who wrote that "anyone who hates this is into propaganda", I don't think so.  This seems like propaganda to me though.  Kram uses his limited (and embarrassingly pretentious) command of art to paint a  picture that simply does not exist: a noble, warrior-like Joe Frazier up against the terrible, name-calling, vicious, egomaniacal and power drunk Muhammad Ali.  Reality check.  Frazier was a guy who dumped his lifelong trainer, Eddie Futch (the guy who helped him get near the top), because of money.  Fairly recently he was arrested for beating up his wife while drunk.  (I guess Mark would blame that on some flashback to Manila).  He wasn't the timid, beautiful soul Mark would have you believe in his downcast dementia.  This is only another hallucination Kram sees fit to create in this piece of selective delusion.  Joe Frazier never quite forgave Muhammad Ali for being a better boxer and more of a public figure than he was.  I suppose that's understandable: but, for a guy who was so tough, Frazier sure was real sensitive when it came to the PR Ali pulled with him, just like he pulled with every other fighter he stepped in the ring with.  The difference is that Chuvalo, Foreman, Liston, Wepner, Patterson, etc--they didn't let it bother them.  Larry Holmes later pointed out that Frazier let too much of it get to him when it was only theatre.  Not nice theatre, no; but boxing isn't nice. (I don't recall Lennox Lewis crying about Mike Tyson wanting to, in his own words, "eat his kids".) ]  Kram does a cute and completely ineffectual job of minimizing every single accomplishment (and they were grand) Ali pulled off in the ring.  The Rumble in the Jungle only requires two pages; Frazier flipping out in a hotel room and the minute psychological motives behind that, however, requires half the book.  Hmmm.    Actually, you can tell Kram hates both of them.  Frazier less, because he uses him as scrap metal to throw at Ali.  In his painful state of cynicism and hatred for self and others, Kram spares neither fighter; he doesn't even spare Archie Moore or Sugar Ray, painting nightmare visions of them as permanently brain damaged, staring into outer space.  Sonny Liston's death from a drug overdose is a source of voyeuristic pleasure for Mark, making sure we know that no one wept for him.  He writes, more or less, like they deserve what they got.      As if all this weren't enough, Kram even uses deliberate distortion.  He claims that the "phantom punch", which again and again has been proven to have connected with Liston's head, never happened.  "Only those interested in maintaining Ali's legend will ever invest in the phantom punch".  For a boxing journalist, Kram sure has missed a lot.  In the end, both disintegrate.  Frazier and Ali are irreedemable messes to Kram, products of the "disgusting sport" he's made his living off of.  And guess what, Joe's still obsessed with Ali and how he beat him up twice!  In Kram's mind, this pettiness is worthy of a depiction by Van Gogh.   I am sorry, but there is something wrong with Mark Kram.  This should be next to William Styron's "Darkness Visible" as a testimony of what mental illness can do to a man.  I wouldn't recommend it, though, as book about the Greatest of All Time or his worthiest opponent.         
 This item stinks. That is the only thing that comes to mind when I played this cd.(UGH 
 Beyond the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle and the secrets of the Pyramids, the other great mystery of the universe is why exactly I keep reading New Frontier novels. I recently realized though that I enjoy the stories and the idea of the characters, but I just don't like the execution of either. So I guess I found what it was that kept me coming back, but Stone and Anvil was standard New Frontier: pretty average. There's good. And there's bad.  The good: seeing Mackenzie Calhoun's days at Starfleet Academy was quite interesting. I especially loved how he handled the dreaded Kobayashi Maru test and his reasoning behind it. His growth from outsider to someone slightly more civilized was fun to read about, even if it was really skimmed over. Frankly, despite its relevance coming in later, this should have been a whole book on its own. Might have even been able to spin off a couple of Harry Potter-esque novels about Calhoun at the Academy. You even had a Hermoine character in Shelby and a Ronald character in Wexler. Why even Dean Jellico was sort of a Professor Snape-like character. Lordy, are Calhoun and Jellico going to be attached at the hip their whole lives?  The book at first looks to be like one of those mediocre Voyager episodes where the A-plot and the B-plot seemed to have absolutely nothing to do with each other. Thankfully, the two do eventually come together thanks to the rather bland cliché of the mad scientist and his pet, though the whole thing ends in probably the stupidest twist I've seen in a Trek book. Seriously, I don't use the word "stupid" much when writing about something, but that's fits the bill for that ending. It was quite groan inducing. Luckily, the very end managed to salvage it a bit with a surprise bittersweet ending.  The present day story about investigating the murder of Gleau was interesting, but could honestly have been more so if we had more of a sense of the Selelvians. They make a brief appearance at the end, but despite all the talk of their abilities, I never really felt like it was any kind of serious threat. Again, there's the fascinating idea of a memberworld working in their own interest possibly to even to subvert the Federation eventually, but again it felt glazed over.  The bad: I think I'm actually growing to hate Elizabeth Shelby. Am I the only one who feels like she's almost regularly being portrayed in a negative light anymore? Both her and Robin Lefler have been taken from their admittedly brief appearances on the show as strong and intelligent women and reduced to shrill, whiny children. Perhaps that's too harsh when it comes to Shelby, but definitely not in the case of Lefler, who for the last many books including Stone and Anvil has been almost defined solely by her constant over-reaction to pretty much anything having to do with her mother. It stopped being interesting a long time ago.   For Shelby, it's become more the constant portrayal as the one trying to think rationally when Peter David likes to make so much of New Frontier about instincts this and instincts that. I really can't put more of a finger on it than that right now, but it's just this feeling I get myself. Everyone else stays the same, with some characters like Si Cwan not even appearing in the book this time around. Calhoun has always been David's strength since he's the center of the whole series and it's really no different here, though I almost get the sense that the writer is "really" fond of his main character.   With the news that the next several New Frontier books will all be hardcovers (why exactly I don't know), I find that that doesn't really bother me. New Frontier has become the harlequin romance trash of Trek and as I keep saying, that doesn't exactly make them bad. But it sure doesn't make them all that great either 
 This book was disappointing.  For starters, if you're cooking healthy recipes you should not be using instant rice, or canned cream-of-whatever soup. And just because you're cooking for children doesn't mean you have to add sugar to vegetables!   There are a few good recipes but borrow from your library first.  I think the early Mollie Katzen cookbooks (Enchanted Broccoli Forest, Moosewood Cookbook) have much healthier recipes 
 Like a previous reviewer, this is my first-ever review on amazon because I felt this series was absolutely butchered by the editing and use of images.    Not only do the images flash across the screen so quickly that you cannot absorb them and they give you a headache, but it is done in a repetitive and even misleading manner.  In a series about all the american presidents you'd expect to see a few shots of the white house.  However, the same shot of the white house is used over and over and over, and when you get tired of that, they shoot it from a different angle and show that over and over and over.  It's very distracting to watch.  It's almost like they couldn't think of anything for an image half the time, so they went to that tired old shot of the white house, over and over again.  I think if they put some time into it they could have found hundreds of paintings, photographs, newspaper articles, statues, locations and objects to shoot video of.  Heck, even more shots of the inside of the white house would have mixed it up some.    Worse than that is the inherent misleading nature of presenting modern video (with cars!) of the white house, capitol or Washington, D.C. while you are talking about events 200 years ago.  The entire city of Washington looked very different than it does today and 80% of the presented video is not accurate to the time period it is talking about.  They constantly zoom in on the capitol dome when the dome was not finished until 1863, and constantly show the wrong facade of the white house for the period.  At one point they talk about John Adams creating the U.S. Navy while they show a jet landing on an aircraft carrier and a submarine surface (but no shots of any ships of the period).    Sometimes the image being shown is even completely misleading.  For example, when talking about ford's theater they show a wide shot of a small church in the countryside and then zoom in to the real ford's theater sign that says "ford's theater."  When talking about the senate they show the interior of the library of congress.  When talking about a print shop in philadelphia they show a random building in williamsburg.  When talking about Congress Hall in Philly they show a shot of Independence Hall.  When talking about the early years of diplomacy with Great Britain and France they repeatedly juxtapose Big Ben, the Washington Monument and the Eiffel Tower as imagery when NONE of those had been built yet.    These things go on and on until it gets more and more painful to watch.   The script and information presented is actually not bad, though I thought they missed a lot of great opportunities to color the characters with more interesting anecdotes and stories.  Bottom line is, turn your tv off and play it through your stereo.  The information is great but the video renders it unwatchable and even misleading.  If you can't do that, read a book on the subject 
 This is definately not the 60's compilation CD to get. Who was in charge of choosing the songs on this boring album anyway? I bought it for Van Morrisson, and was not familiar with any of the other songs but one. They weren't good 
 Garbage. The references to myself in the book are incorrect and any simple minded freshman student could have done more thorough research. With that said I  suspect the same amount of effort went into getting "it  right" throughout the remainder of her book 
 I should have bought my girls ipods.  Yes, these mini-muddles are cute in that they fit into little girl purses and pockets, but that's where the novelty ends.  First, it is NOT abundantly obvious to children how to work the controls to get where they want to be.  These are kids for crimy sakes!  They needs to have controls that are clear and easy.  My youngest has no idea how to get to a particular song because the buttons never do what she THINKS they should do (That's a big hint to Hasbro...don't design a product from an adults point of view.  Design it for a child from their point of view.  A button having multiple functions is very confusing for kids).  So I end up having to constantly mash those itty-bitty buttons until I can figure out where the song is for her.  Second, the process of getting music from point A to point B (point B being the mini-black-hole) is NOT a quick and easy process.  Copy here, burn there, transfer to this spot, drag/drop to who knows where.  Oy vey.  And THEN you discover the music isn't in the correct format so you have to start all over again.  As for the 128 worth of space...128 is a piddly amount of space but it is clearly advertised on the packaging that this is the amount you're going to get.  No surprises there.  Now if I could only get the darn music into the player without giving up and chuckin' it to the dog to play with.  An ipod might be expensive, but Apple certainly doesn't cause this consumer the grief and frustration that Hasbro has 
 The 365 Cats Page-A-Day Calendar for 2004 was a favorite of my family: large format excellent photographs in a sturdy holder. Everything about the 2005 version says cheap and minimal production cost: small low quality photos in a flimsy holder with text instead of cativating photos. Who wants to read a lot of useless text on a cat calendar? Where are the charming photos?  Larry - Los Alamos, N 
 I really tried to like this cd. I thought he did a decent job on Idol. The uptempo songs are decent, but the ballads are just sleep inducing. I think I'll stick with Michael Buble' when I want to listed to a great young crooner

 I've read all of Flynn's books. In fact, I just picked up Act of Treason. As I'm reading it, I'm reminded of how disgusted I was with his last book, Consent to Kill, only giving him the benefit of the doubt on this one.  Without giving away the ending, Consent to Kill is but an amateur attempt to keep a tired saga alive for the sake of a bestselling serial--that being the Mitch Rapp saga. To any real fiction writer, what Flynn resorts to in the book, in terms of Mitch's personal relationship, is quite sad; it's simply designed to keep Mitch "hungry" and "emotionally tattered" so as to allow Flynn to continue cashing in on the only story he's capable of writing.  The book started out to be intriguing, although I did ask myself how Flynn intended to keep Mitch going with the seeming direction our star spy was headed via the last novel. But, the story read like a tenth grader wrote it, a tired cliche designed for the sole sake of keeping Mitch Rapp and his million-dollar franchise chugging along.  By far the worst story Flynn has written to date. Skip this one 
 I bought this CD and was dissapointed that the song I heard on the radio which had an uptempo steppers beat was not on the album. Instead I got a cd full of elevator music that quite frankly is sub-par at best. If you like  that sort of thing then this is for you 
 I bought this book so I'd have something interesting to read during my son's tonsillectomy last fall.  I was hoping to enjoy the torrid love scenes in it!  I got half-way through the book, and it bothered me so much (my own issues getting in the way?), I put the book away.  I felt Anna was emotionally neglecting her daughter, Molly, while involved in her lustful dysfunctional relationship with Leo.  I didn't like any of the main characters, including Molly---all too unrealistic.  But I picked up the book yesterday and finished it.  The book was too flat!  Though I don't think she was a BAD mom, she certainly exercised poor judgment (and for what?  Like Leo was a good catch?)!  I wasted my time (I don't read books very often) on this story.  Yet I did read the whole book, hoping it would get better, so I'm giving it 2 stars.  I didn't think I'd get any more of Sue Miller's books, but other reviewers said she has better novels 
 You'd be crazy to pay this price for a $3.50 toy. Don't support the greed of this vendor! Let him sit on these a while and you'll be amazed how quick the price will drop 
 I just bought this book and I have to be honest that it really disappointed me. All the material inside is already known and has been explained from some other book like "Hyperspace" by Michio Kaku. The book just repeats some fact about kaluza-klein, flatlanders, mobius strip, supergravity or relativity theory of Einstein. It does not even consider explaining in detail the latest advancement in theoretical physics that explore the possibility of higher dimension or theory of everything as its title would suggest.   If you are looking for some introduction to popular science of space-time, matter and the universe in general, MAYBE this book will be suitable for you (even though I would advice you to get it from another book such as "Hyperspace" or "Parallel Worlds" by Michio Kaku). But if you are looking for some "advance" information in these area or the latest advancement in theoretical physics concerning the development of the Superstring, M-Theory, Brane Worlds and so on, this book is definitely NOT for you. 
 I have read every one of Stephen King's books.  This was the only one that I have not read.  I have struggled to get to page 105 and I have no clue as to what is going one.  The style of Peter Straub stinks.  Don't waste your money, you will put this book back on the shelf an never have a clue as to what the story is about.  Stephen King has finally written a real clunker.  This may be the worst book that I have ever tried to read 
 Mullen's debut novel, about how the 1918 Spanish influenza epidemic affected the fictional town of Commonwealth, Washington, located at some unknown distance northeast of Seattle, is a perfect example of how NOT to write about a plague. Although the premise is intriguing and based on fact (the author notes that residents of some uninfected towns did block roads and post armed guards), neither the writing nor the plot is compelling enough to keep the reader's interest. Sixteen-year-old Philip, adopted son of the town's founder, mill owner, and leader Charles Worthy, and his feminist wife Rebecca (not supportive of the quarantine because it goes against their original goal in establishing the town - to show the world how it can be improved) is allowed to stand guard with twenty-five-year-old mill worker Graham, who he looks up to like an older brother. Shots are fired during an encounter with a tired, starving, unarmed-soldier who is hungrier than he is cautious, at which point the plot begins to really unravel.  Believing that potentially letting people die by unnecessarily exposing them to a virulent flu versus protecting them from it would "improve" the world - is not smart reasoning. Letting a teenager continue to guard the town after the firing of the initial shots ends badly - is not smart parenting. Kissing a person who might be infected - is not smart thinking. Not filling out the necessary paperwork required to legally become classified as an "essential worker" is not smart citizenship. Not developing your characters enough to compel the reader to care one way or another if any particular person dies and providing so little imagery that readers know only that the town contains tall trees - is not smart writing. Luckily for readers, however, another author, Geraldine Brooks, IS a smart writer. Her novel of the 1666 Bubonic plague, Year of Wonders, contains more character development and imagery in its first few chapters than Mullen's does in its entire length, not to mention the fact that it is also interesting and believable. Equally smart writing of a different genre can be found in John M. Barry's non-fiction book about the 1918 flu, entitled The Great Influenza. Choosy readers will choose Year of Wonders and The Great Influenza over The Last Town on Earth.  
 Whitman is brilliant, but as a writer he suffers from some serious defects.  Chief among them is his obsession with proving academics wrong.  Rather than write much on how he thinks through and makes real-world investments, he spends most of his ink distinguishing value investing from Efficient Market Theory and Graham-and-Doddism.  It gets old, and dull.  And he constantly qualifies his statements with "probably", "would seem", and so on, and undermines himself.  The writing also utterly lacks any sense of humor.  Finally, I was disappointed that Whitman--who is an astute and detail-oriented investor--did not include more case examples, with financials, to show his reasoning and method at work.    His first outing, The Aggressive Conservative Investor, is better in many ways, but is still turgidly written.     Given Whitman's talents, track record and reputation for smarts, this is a real let-down.  
 I got this for Christmas last year.  I hardly use the thing and when I have I have been very careful in placing the ipod on and off of it. I can no longer play an ipod on it as there is no sound or too much static - apparently a short of some sort.  I was shocked as it had been used maybe 10 times by my wife and I.  Read all of the reviews I am not the only one who now has an overpriced doorstop.  Save your money and buy something else.  Take your time and read through the "cotton candy" 4-5* reviews which bump this up to an artificially high rating of 3* and you will see one consistent pattern, the connection to the ipod is very poor, the alarm doesn't function, and they feel it is overpriced 
 All the information in there I can find it in a cats magazine. VERY basic information and quite obvious 
 The author of this book, Warren Wagar, is apparently a professor of "Future Studies." I certainly hope he has long been fired from that post. "A Short History of the Future" was  written in 1989, but the writer is so ignorant of politics, and so WRONG, to be blunt, it reads as if it was written in the 1940's. Orwell's 1984 is more on the mark than this.   He shows barely any creativity in his "predictions" and clearly was barely even aware of much of the contemporary political developments of his time. The fact that he assumes the Soviet Union will continue plodding along well into the 21st Century is incredibly naive. The fact that he assumes the nation's socialist economy system would survive equally long is similarly bizarre. Did he read the newspapers? Did he pay ANY attention to that Gorbachev fellow and the path he was bringing Russia down?   And honestly, did anyone really expect that Germany would remain divided into two states until time immortal?  Or that Latin America and Africa would remain dictatorships forever? Or that black rule in South Africa would not occur until 2014?  If this book had been written 30 or 40 ago, it would be excusable. This book is just sloppy. He doesn't even do a good job describing how his corporations take over the world. Everything is just described in these overly flowery sweeping generalizations. Like "and then the capital lords seized control of the governments and made the state wither like an autumn rose." That sort of thing.   The author is clearly an "ivory tower" academic who believes history can be predicted sorely through dry Marxist theory and analyzing dubious vague "trends." The fact that this book became horribly dated something like three years after it was published is quite a strong indictment of a man whose entire job was devoted to predicting the future.   
 it seems that as long as reguritate the dominate social narrative of an oppressed/underpresented group the work is considered a "masterpiece" and "touching". Well this left me cold. How many times does this novel need to be written? there are many ways to create unforgettable characters and working the hell out of tired stereotypes is not one of them.  Also, read something by Julius Lester if you want to see this kind of thing done well 
 This title is billed as the Sixth Edition, and reflects the coming and going of co-authors.  It is too bad that the editor had so little influence. Sections of this book that stick to their cartographic knitting are excellent.  Historical information is very intersting.  Basic explanations, such as the evolution of ellipsoids is very well done. Some  of the writing is so bad it could have been extracted from a sophmore term  paper, sprinkled with such inept phrases as "such as",  "similarly", "however" and "in fact". The  most glaring deficiency is in the area of computer technology.  Either this  material has not been updated since some earlier edition, or the author(s)  are very uncomfortable with the subject matter.   As examples: "Most  common procedures used by cartographers have been translated into software  programs written in special computer languages such as FORTRAN and C."  "Today's well-rounded cartographer is routinely involved with these  'canned' (prewritten) mapping programs..." "The professionsal  cartographer should, therefor, have a working knowledge of at least one  computer language."   We are regaled with three pages of detailed  obselescent material on computer structure, but only 23 lines of overview  on current instrument technology.   There is a whole chapter on fonts and  lettering, but no algorithm for conversion from Lat-Long to UTM. The  central meridians for the UTM zones are not provided, nor is the DoD  lettering scheme. One of the responsibilities of a text book is to arrange  the subject matter in a structure where it can be easily referenced.  This  book reads like a series of articles of varying quality published under one  cover, with overlap resolution left as an exercise for the reader 
 this book is a staple among the clever clogs chattering classes, even though he mis-spells the word "shown" at least a hundred times. The prose is terrible and I had no idea what he was talking about.  Verdict: Ivory tower rubbish 
 Anyone who is doing any kind of serious research into Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code should be aware of some important information that isn't revealed in 'Jesus, Mary, and Da Vinci'.  Mr. Brown's book, which he claims, in the preface, is based on 'fact' is actually perpetuating a known and established FRAUD with respect to its claims regarding the 'Priory of Sion' and the 'Dossier Secret' documents in the French National Libary.  It has been established beyond reasonable doubt that the 'Priory of Sion' and the 'Dossier Secret' documents are in fact the fraudulent creation of a circle of anti-semitic French nationalists who revolve around the figure of Pierre Plantard.  Mr. Plantard was a primary source for the authors of 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail' which Dan Brown attributes as one of his primary sources for the 'Da Vinci Code'.  This information has been brought to light in the excellent video 'Breaking the Da Vinci Code' as well as by CBS's 60 minutes, which filmed their own investigation into Mr. Brown's claims on a show that recently aired on April 30th.    Basically, Mr. Brown propagates the same fraudulent information that he inherits from his uncritical use of 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail'.  Not very good form for someone who claims his fictional novel is based on 'fact'.  There are numerous other errors, misrepresentation, and outright fabrications in Mr. Brown's book that aren't adequately addressed in 'Jesus, Mary, and Da Vinci'.  Those who are truly interested in some solid, scholarly research on Mr. Brown's book would be well served by viewing the excellent video 'Breaking Da Vinci's Code' also available on Amazon.com.  There's nothing wrong with reading and understanding the 'Da Vinci Code' as a work of fiction, which it is, but don't confuse this book as a serious representation of history and theology, which it most certainly is not 
 Since I ordered this for a young budding artist, I was willing to wait awhile until it shipped.  What a disappointment - this book is not at all what I expected - I imagine I should have been warned by the price.  There is almost no instruction about drawing horses - the pictures are pretty but they will not help in actually learning to draw horses.  One star is almost overly generous for a "learning" book 
 Omaha doesn't grade their meat - consequently you don't know if you are purchasing Prime, Choice, Select or worse and from what we have sampled I doubt that it is any better then Select and maybe not that as we've had some skunked steaks 
 Don't believe the last review.  I had mine about a month before I tossed it out the window somewhere near Charlotte, NC.  Nothing but problems, barely recieved or transmitted and was extremely weak when it did.  I actually had truckers ask me to stop transmitting because all they could hear was squealing when I keyed.  Tossed it, kept my K40 antenna, bought a Uniden Pro538W and have loved it!  Much better radio!  Don't buy anything Cobra makes 
 After reading about Ambrose Bierce and his fierce wit this book was a real  let down. Too many stories, all of a similar vein. I should have gotten the  Devil's Dictionary!! 
 Another money making scheme dreamed up by the marketing department.  This is not how D&D is supposed to be played 
 In the footsteps of "The Protocol of the Elders of Zion" and " don't bother with the man behind the curtain " I won't waste anymore time with this conspiracy rubbish as the nutcases have come out and decided that right is wrong and wrong is right..up is down and water is dry. I just love the post 9/11 neo-historians out there who buy this hookem because they are too lazy to read but a small piece of the Pan-Arab -Petro-induced fusion into the media and anti-American so called professors who take up space in our colleges and universities because the are self appointed "experts"

 featuring cookie-cutter travel log footage of Scandanavian scenery to the very last scene with 30 exhausted extras shouting "God Save the King" at three better than average actors standing ill at ease on a wooden platform, it was all pretty disasterous.   I knew that it was a no go at the first syllable of the "narration."  Instead of showing us the murders of Amleth's father and brother, we were told about it.   Instead of showing us the horror and mystery of Amleth's father's ghost appearing to him and telling him of his uncle's treachery, we were told about it.    The poor actors were given almost nothing to play.  I imagine that they were pining for Shakespeare's genius for writing superbly playable scenes and dialog. He would never have left his actors so stranded.  The story and the actors deserved far better.  What a total waste of celuloid.  
 First of all, this book mentions "the heart" and strays from the truth of scripture terribly. God's word says the "heart is deceitful above all things and who can know it?" There is nothing good in our hearts, apart from Christ, and whatever "good" there might be in there comes from Him. Scripture tells us that in the last days the church will go into apostasy. This time has come like no other time before. There is a move to to throw out scripture and move past it, ignoring what God has already told us. What we need to know is in scripture--especially those things we need to know about Him and what He requires of us. This move in the church today to "feel" God and go "to a deeper level" is a reawakening of mysticism which does not belong in the body of Christ. The truth and objectives of scripture are not mystical, for a reason. Jesus Christ was and is not a mystic. This movement is called "contemplative spirituality" and it is subtle and dangerous. Sadly, even Eldredge has taken this route. How many more good authors and great men of God are going to forsake the completeness of God's word to turn inward to "self" and think they will find something new? Solomon said, "there is nothing new under the sun." The devil wants us to think we can reinvent and invent "new" outside of God's marvelous confines. We need to stick to scripture and stop reading books like these written by men who want to offer us something more than the Lord commanded us. We are treading on shaky ground, but all we need is His glorious word and to do what He said: "Keep my commandments. 
 By the time you see the ending, you'll already be wishing that you hadn't watched this movie 
 This is a book by JA Jance?  This book took a potentially good storyline (plot) and made it seem stupid because it was so simplistic in its writing style, which is UNLIKE JA Jance.  This book seemed to be to be written for a young-adult reader audience.   I had to force myself to read it all the way through because I must admit, I was curious as to the conclusion, but I did not derive any pleasure from reading this book.  A waste of time 
 I did not find this book helpful.  I feel that the fashion tips are ridiculous for plus size women. Checks, bright colors and huge caftan type clothing are certainly not flattering. I am a plus size and I would never wear any of the selections found in this book. They are loud, loose and make the model look like she even heavier than she is. I found Sandra Betzina's books, especially Power Sewing, to be much more detailed and helpful. The sewing techniques in this book are certainly not couture in my opinion. The techniques are quick, but the results are a home-made look and the fit is poor. The waistline techniques are amatuer at best. My skills are on the intermediate level and I did not gain any helpful information from this book. Having found better selections in the Sandra Betzina line of patterns and books, I gave this book away, because there is nothing I found in it that I consider worth my time. 
 The set up for this novel is interesting, if a bit easy to anticipate in the first half. The father: stoic and crushed by his love for a flighty, mentally ill woman. The mother: beautiful, ravaged by her own mental sickness, seemingly self-obsessed and consumed by superficial things. The brother: distant and angry. The daughter: spunky with a desire to rise above it all, hungry for the love of her brother and father. I was never--not once--surprised by any of these characters until the father found an interest in the occult in the middle of the book, and by then, I just didn't buy his his sudden turn. Lots of things happened, but by the middle of the book, I kept thinking, when is something going to happen that moves me?    Part of the reason that so many events with the potential to elicit great empathy from the reader fail to do so is that the book feels like so much backstory, so much summary. We rarely get to be fully present in the past moment with the characters, and because of this, the characters feel very distant and stiff.  But ultimately, this book frustrated me because of the awkward, contorted prose. Look--I'm fine with fragments and run on sentences, but when there is no rhyme or reason as to why so many are being used, they lose their impact and importance. The sentence structures in this book are beyond affected, and they really take away from what could have been an interesting story. I quit reading 2/3 of the way in, I will admit. However, if I feel nothing by then, there is a problem 
 After reading some of the scathing reviews below, I can only AGREE 100%.  I caught this on HBO, late at night when I had nothing better to do.  This piece of crap is so preposterous, I've seen better plots on episodes of The A Team.  The fact that all the actors act so "serious" in this movie is chuckle-inspirting, shame on all of them. 
 This book is almost like watching an episode of "The Real World." You follow a semi-interesting person around for a few weeks, watch them experience some amazing highs, some disasterous lows and lots and lots and lots of average ordinary daily humdrum. There is the a fiery girlfriend whom our subject waffles about. There are the odd and sometimes obnoxious friends who try to sound deep and sometimes succeed. There is lots of pot and alcohol to keep life on an even keel, if that is how you have to get by. And there is no real resoultion. Seriously, is the whole Judaic thing supposed to hold this story together? Is there some obscure Kabbalistic point to this mess? It sounds like there is supposed to be. There are hints of it here and there throughout the story. But it doesn't really hold up. At first I thought the book was just quirky, and I like quirky so I kind of got into it. And then there were really great flashes of brilliance in the events and the prose and I was like, "Sure, this is a slice of life story about, well, life, belief and the little things that keep us sane and keep us moving," and I got into that too. But then the story just kind of ends with no real resolution to ANY of the major plot points that are left hanging in the wind along with the reader. Seriously, and I will say this again because I hate when authors foist this on an unsuspecting audience, all of the big events leading up to the end that cry out for explanation and resolution and reprecussion are simply dropped. Is this a Zen ending? Actually the book ends where it tells you it is going to end about halfway through, with Alex doing the Kaddish for his dead Chinese father (who never converted to Judaism). The only problem is that Alex tells you over and over again that this ceremony means nothing to him. He doesn't believe in any of it. And through the prose of the final pages, not only does it not continue to mean anything to him, even in the act, but it doesn't even mean much to the audience who are listening to him go through the motions, including three Rabbis. No revelation. No change. Not even a bit of comfort for the road. Just a very flat ending for, as it turns out, a very flat book. The only thing I can figure is that this is some sort of morality play about how little religious belief truly affects our daily lives and who we are as people. In retrospect, it seems like reading this wasn't an uplifting nor a depressing experience. It was simply no experience at all. Hey, maybe that makes it Zen after all 
 So, a bunch of mafia gangsters come over and shoot each other up, then they go out west and shoot each other up there, including one particular scene in which a bunch of people all get shot up together as part of a sort of montage. Woo hoo. How brilliant. I'll never forget this movie. NOT. 
 This "translation" of the K'iche' Mayan sacred book was not made from the original K'iche' Mayan text but rather it is a weak translation from an early Spanish version based on an even weaker French version. There are many many mistakes. Reader beware 
 I do NOT recommend that you buy this book. Dr. Taylor is very good at promoting herself and appearing on television, but I do not believe that she is better than any other dermatologist at treating the skin of people of color. She is more style than substance, I suggest that you SAVE YOUR MONEY and check this book out of the library if you have the time to read it but don't spend any money on this 
 It might be a nice little book if any of it were actually based in reality.  Yes, the author is right that if Hutton had challenged the dominant mode of thought to create a new science and been the first person to challenge the biblical time-scale and the story of the flood, that he should be mentioned in the same breath as Galileo, Newton, Darwin, and the other greats  ...BUT HE DIDN'T!  All of this had been already covered to varying degrees by many different scientists for only about oh, the last 100 years by the time Hutton showed up on the scene.  He is in no way a founder of geology, he is only an important and early contributor.  So regardless of whether the book is well written or not, the entire foundation for what it has to say is completely false, and thus completely worthless 
 Just like every Rubik's cube I've ever had, this one is a piece of junk.  The folks at Rubik's have always made a substandard product.  I had one of the knock-off brand cubes as a kid and it seemed to be much sturdier.  Common problems with Rubiks' products...1) stickers fall off, and 2) the whole thing becomes loose and sub-cubes start to fall off the main cube.  It's junk 
 Save your valuable time and steer clear of this train wreck!  Worse yet, you could be making the biggest mistake of your life if you make an important decision based on Retirement Places Rated. Sorry, but I get upset after having my time and money wasted, and just need to vent. I've spent a career in corporate relocation, and find myself stunned at most of the recommendations.  The book's choices usually fall into the following categories; unaffordable, uninteresting, uninhabitable, unsafe, unpleasant, unhealthy, or uncomfortable. On top of the flawed and biased reviews that might have been researched from chamber of commerce web sites, the book's layout requres endless page flipping to get the full profile of each city. And yes, I said biased.  As a West Coaster, where are the cities west of the Rockies?  There are very few included, representing a strong East Coast leaning, maybe because the author sticks to what he can drive to. Please, Mr. Savageau, invest in a Jet Blue ticket and take a trip out here.  Spend some time out here, in person, and maybe you'll avoid mistakes like your #1 choice - Florence, Oregon. I asked an associate from the Northwest about this town as the nation's top retirement spot, and she laughed, "Retire there?  I don't even like to drive through Florence!  Has this guy ever been there?" Good question!  
 As someone who likes to dabble in game development, I was completely unimpressed with this book.  I was hoping to learn some of the details about some of the complex and difficult issues of game programming:  keeping games in synch, making the best use of bandwidth, UDP vs TCP, etc.   But this 800 page book only devoted about 2 pages to these topics.  Instead, the author chose to spend more time explaning the differences between C and C++.    That points to the major flaw in this book:  The author doesn't seem to pick a clear focus to write to.  He jumps back and forth, discussing threads and mutexes, then charging into a diatribe about hungarian notation, or how C++ object-orientation works.  He spends the last half of the book showing a rough overview of a multiplayer game he wrote, but only spends a couple pages of that talking about the network elements of the game.    If this book had been titled "Game development for software developers who already know how to write and design software but don't know the specifics of DirectX or windows programming, and who want to learn the absolute basics of networking with DirectPlay", I would give it a better review.  Really, it's more of a DirectX tutorial than anything.    My advice?  If you fit into that narrow group of people described by the title, then it's worth picking up.  Even then, you'd probably be wondering why the author wasted so much time telling you things you already know.    If you don't fall into that group of people, I'd find another book.   
 I generally enjoy reading biographies, but this one was an exception! A very boring read! I did not think that Lincoln was being portrayed as overly religous as another reviewer did, but I seriously doubt that lincoln had evangelical inclinations. I was dissapointed in the lack of overall perspective of Lincoln's life. I feel that there was too much concentration on Lincoln the politician (his political development) and not enough about his family and social life. I wanted to know Lincoln better on a personal level and I did not feel that this book provided much insight. I may have been expecting too much, but I prefer a biographry that maintains my interest rather than puting me to sleep, as this one frequently did 
 I was just given this book for Christmas, and the first page I randomly flipped to was How to Use a Seatbelt.  The second page I flipped to was How to Remove a Bumper Sticker.  Not exactly the repair advice I was looking for 
 This book was interesting at first.  It shatters what most of us think the typical millionaire looks and acts like, but that only takes a chapter.  After that, it just keeps repeating itself over and over.  "Who do you think bought the $1000 watch and who bought the lower priced watch?"  Yeah, yeah, I get it; the millionaire has a lower priced watch than the overspending, no real wealth guy.    Then some of the examples are so over simplified or exaggerated that you know they are made up to make a point.  I want real examples.  I don't care if you give them goofy code names to protect identity, but don't come up with such bad comparisons to prove a point if it isn't real.    Then there is the advice on being frugal.  I am pretty frugal, but some of what they said would put me in the crazy house if I had to live like that.  Sure, I could cut out every unnecessary expense from my budget, but then I wouldn't be very happy.  Who cares if I have a million when I'm 60ish if I had to live miserably up until then.  What is that worth?  I know not to go out and buy a brand new luxury car, but driving around my 20 year old Jeep is no fun either!  This book is good for the first chapter and if you are just completely clueless or a compulsive over spender.  People with common sense need not buy this book, just check it out at the library like I did 
 Any book that has a delivery date of 1 to 2 months is way too long a delivery schedule for the average consumer. I wish I could rate the content, but I am going to cancel the order because I found out later the estimated delivery would be that long. Too bad for both sides - the buyer and the seller 
 I have read many children's books in my time and I have to say that not even a child would be able to follow along with this.  What's with all the dashes, arrows, and other symbols?  This only added to the confusion of what the author was trying to say.  My nephew, who reads three grade levels ahead of his grade tossed the book away in frustration.  I am surprised that dogs all over do not protest this piece of literary garbage.  This was definitely a book that one could put down.  What a nightmare 
 I was looking forward to reading this book after hearing so much about it from my colleagues.  While it was an interesting approach to the subject matter (especially in what i assume is suppose to be an academic book), both Behar and the book get tedious.   Although I appreciate Behar's efforts to relate her life to Esperanza's, somehow the book ends us being about "me, me, me."  She just goes on and on about how horrible Esperanza's life is, and how her life is very similar to it.  It comes off as a bit of a stretch, especially since Behar is benefitting by writing about the struggles of this woman's life.  The book is self-centered in a very subtle way.  But, by the end of the book, I just didn't care anymore about what happened to Esperanze, Behar or the book. There are both a lot of critics and advocates of this book.  I wasn't able to for an opinion strong enough to join any of those two camps 
 I think what this movie did is not simply reverse the color scheme but generally speaking the attitude. I think it condemns for the sake of condemning and moves the problem from where it really is.  America is not perfect but it is as perfect as they come to give each individual the possibility to succed regardless of the skin color, this movie, in my opinion is anti white, which is as stupid as being anti black 
 No matter whether the reviewers here have liked ot disliked this book, they all agree that it's one you should pick up only if you are a Heinlein aficionado.  I can't disagree with that assessment.  Heinlein's political beliefs have always been very clear in his writing.  His characters often describe what is wrong with the world and how it should be.  However, in those stories it is a part of the narrative.  In this book, however, it is the main focus.  The story itself is thin, just a vehicle for long lectures on political and economic matters. I've read nearly everything Heinlein has written, so I'm used to his lectures, but when they last for dozens of pages, even I get bored and start flipping pages to see how much more I have to sit through.  The economy of his new world is novel enough to keep me reading through its explanation, but I do not believe the average reader would enjoy it.  If you are looking for science fiction, or any kind of fictional novel, this book will not satisfy you.  If you are interested enough in Heinlein's political and economic ideas to want to read over a hundred pages of them, then this is the book for you 
 The general feeling I had left after reading through this graphic novel was, That was it? Costing anywhere between 17 and 25 bucks this title hardly pays for itself. The book overall has a couple of different stories split up, all set in the Halo Universe. A good way to describe this book is, it's like the Animatrix, short stories based in a specific fictional landscape that are at best, cool and at worst mediocre. The art in every one of these short stories in this book were all top notch but, the shortness of the short stories just left me with again, the feeling of: That's it? My suggestion to Halo fans out there? Wait till this comes out in trade paperback form when it'll be about 10 bucks, then it might be worth buying. 
 This book and the sequels were clearly written by Lee. And it shows. The character development is too long and completely unnecessary in many instances. The villains are transparent. I was dissapointed that Clarke decided to sell out on his his brilliant RWR. It could have been so much more than this transgalactic soap opera. Do something else with your time, this book and the ones following this are not worth of your time 
 All the other reviews describe what the book is about, so I will just speak my mind instead...  Over the course of the story, the "master spy" grows overly fond of his apprentice... romantically. They are both male. In the past, this master, was also the lover of another main character (a burly, male, sword-master type). Now, I hold nothing against that kind of sexual orientation, and it didn't reach graphic proportions by the time I tossed the book (page 308). But it was kind of like saying that Batman has a secret crush on Robin, and he once had an affair with Superman- It was more than I could comfortably read.  Had the book kept my interest despite this... with an intriguing plot for example, or maybe some stimulating dialogue- I might have managed to overlook all that. But unfortunately, in my opinion, Flewelling didn't pull it off. Had the apprentice and the master both been WOMEN and things progressed the way they did... well then, rest assured that I- your typical, male, fantasy novel-reader, would have stuck it out for the long haul! ;)  It would probably not be politically correct for me to hope for some kind of warning about such relationships (in the back-cover summary, perhaps?), but it certainly would have saved me plenty of time and a little bit of money.   For a similar story done right, without any of the misgivings I have detailed above- I strongly recommend ASSASSIN'S APPRENTICE, by Robin Hobb 
 Very disappointing when it comes to the projects; I found the designs crude and not at all anything I'd want to put on display. The author obviously loves his subject and offers some very good tips on working with bamboo, but the overall style is very dated looking on most. 
 This book is simply awful. I gave up after a hard slog through ninety percent of this dreck. The author simply can't write. It sounds callous, but after enduring this book I feel less sympathy towards the yound Marines fighting and dying in Iraq. No wonder they call them grunts. I made a resolution long ago to never read books by the enlisted and this book reinforced that. That Mark Bowden of Black Hawk Down fame endorsed this book is unfathomable to me. Read 'A Rumor of War' by Philip Caputo if you want a superbly-written account of war. On the other hand, if you want to waste time and money, read Jarhead 
 This has not aged well. The scripts are silly, the acting is of the "chewing up the scenery" variety. Gale Storm no longer seems cute; she comes across as annoyingly perky. Spend your money on something else 
 Not asking to recreate music however after Sueno Liquido nothing innovated has come out of the band.  4 of 13 songs are good  Mariposa Sabana's Angel De Amor Mi Religion  
 The only reason why I think this "movie" continues to actually exist is the fact that the luscious & amazingly gorgeous Elizabeth Hurley does topless nudity in the film.  Other than that asset, this film is absolutely abysmal.  Atrocious acting, hackneyed script, ham fisted direction and terrible lighting.  It's not even good in a so-bad-it's-good type of way.  Avoid at all costs and just download the Elizabeth Hurley nudity off of the internet 
 The index in the version I have is completely inaccurate.  What's more, to obtain errata you're required to enter a code on the publisher's website.  This code is not stamped on the book but is on the packaging which I unfortunately threw away before I noticed the index was completely inaccurate.    Save yourself the headache and get a different version 
 Sorry but I don't like this, always the same distorded guitar, always the same riff, feel like it was the same song from the beginning 'til the end, poorly done  
 ordered the stainless flavorizer bars for a Genisis-1000 which is supposed to be 13 bars, what i received were 5 porcelain bars for a completely different model 
 This book served as a general overview of the billing from home business, but does not give details on getting started.  Not a good book to rely on if your looking to start your own business. 
 With all that happens in this book,and much of it is somewhat far-fetched, the only thing that I did not buy were the choices made in the end. They were inconsistent with the character development throughout the book. I felt cheated 
 I bought this book because it was advertised as Bob Harpers book.  Needless to say, it's not.  It isn't Jillian Michaels book either.    The book is fun and there are lots of pictures of Bob, but no real weight loss advice that amounts to a program of any kind.  I like the book because I am a fan of the show and it does have some motivational anecdotes, but I wouldn't recommend it as a weight loss plan.  
 We enjoyed the first couple of lessons, and I was really excited about these cds. Unfortunately, the sound became almost completely incomprehensible after the first few lessons, sounding almost like a robotic or synthesized voice. I see other reviews that complain about this, too, so purchase this at your own risk. It's hard to imagine that a company would ship so many defective cds, especially cds where sound quality and comprehension are the most important aspects 
 Contents are low and false. Example, the book tells Vacheron Constantin is founded by Francois Constantin 1755, when it was  Jean-Marc Vacheron. Charles Constatin entered the firm 1819(!). Lousy pics of uninteresting watches. It's now in the dustbin, where it belongs. Beware! 
 I ordered this dress and when I received it, I thought that it was very pretty.  When I put the dress on, it was completely see through.  You could see my bandaid on my thigh.  I would not suggest this dress for anyone based soley on the material. It's a shame because they dress is very flattering and also comfortable. It would also be impossible to wear anything under this dress (including pasties) because it seemed to show everything 
 I am an AVID reader, pretty intelligent and read at least 1-2 books a week (more when on vacation).  I have read books about all kinds of people in all cultures...and this book turned into a quest...a quest to FINISH it!!!  I never stop reading a book once I start it, but I was about ready to shoot myself in order to end my distress.  If you want to read a REALLY, REALLY good book about desperation in the Indian culture, you simply MUST, MUST, MUST read "A Fine Balance"...one of the best books I have ever read.  It's always on my suggested reading list when people ask me for the name of a good book...along with "Life of Pi."  I simply don't understand all the wonderful remarks about this book.  It went on and on and on and on with the same thing happening to this man over and over...with only a change in his location.  It would pick up every now and again, and I would think "now it's going to start to get interesting" but I was only entertained for a page or two before Mr. Biswas returned to his same ol' depressing self, repeating the same mistakes over and over and over and over and over and over...well you get the point.  Boring, boring book.  I would have given it 0 stars but that wasn't an option 
 It's good for its purpose but not resistant. The lock that close the ball broke in the first use when I tried to open. The other one worked fine. It's a cheap plast material, could be better and more resistant. But for now it's ok since there is no other solutions for my bras. Besides, this product is for medium and small bras. Who has large sizes will have difficult to fit the bra in the produc 
 If you want the same old, bang bang rob the bank, movie then go ahead and by this low brow movie.  Take it from me it sucks 
 This book is just horrible... anti-marriage and anti-man.  If you're bitter and you want your daughter to grow up the same way, then this is the book for you.  Otherwise, opt for more wholesome entertainment 
 "The Artist's Complete Guide to Drawing the Head" by William L. Maughan,  Watson-Guptill Pub, $24.95   160 pages    The title  is a  a boast. It is not  "complete" in any sense.  First,  it is too brief. Second,  every portrait model shown here holds a totally passive expression.  Not one shows the least bit of emotion;  neither fear, anger, joy,  leering, laughing, scowling or anticipation. They simply stare vacuously straight ahead or to the side with an empty, torpid expression.  A really "complete" guide to any kind of drawing will show some animation or feeling  or variety of a range of feelings.       I am alerted by usage in the title of a major "Warning Word"  or phrase.  This time it is the words  "COMPLETE  GUIDE."  When you find "Warning Words" like COMPLETE,  ULTIMATE,  ESSENTIAL  etc   on the cover of a book,  the book will generally be substandard as  a general rule.  None of the really good drawing books ever use words like that.  Books using the word COMPLETE,  never seem to live up to that claim, and in fact,  they usually skip over basics, and move right on to intermediate material.        The bestializized   Half-human/half-hog, and Half-human/half-elephant, or Half-human/half-vampire  portraits are entirely beyond the scope  of the topic, pertaining to fantasy art and not human anatomy.  It certainly is not appropriate for small children. Moreover,  it falls entirely outside of the category of the human head, which is what the book suggests.           The art work is flat, absent of mental focus,  and uninspiring, lacking in dynamism and vitality. The models are listless and possess no expression of emotion in their face, and  they reflect a HUMANITY WITHOUT FEELINGS! I find that offensive.      I would  point out that from my personal perspective,  I am highly suspicious of artists who draw human beings without FEELINGS.  Healthy people show expressions,  and artists who fail to acknowledge the FEELINGS of their subjects,  probably have an imbalanced view of the external world, and I just cannot trust them.   [There are people in the world utterly blind to the reality that their own FEELINGS register on their face,  so that as their feelings register on their face,  they are unaware that you are "reading" them. Isn't that peculiar? ] The models here have a One-Dimensional quality.  Not only can the artist not sense the FEELINGS of the models,  the artist is showing evidence that FEELINGS are not  integrated as part of  a personal artistic vision. Some might refer to this as art, but...            The list price of $24.95 indicates the public will be thoroughly robbed.      If you enjoy alternatively,  lifeless portraiture and fantasy portraiture,  at a rip-off price,   this book is for you; but for myself,  I am not interested in any instruction by someone purporting to be some kind of  "teacher" who cannot even represent a full range of human emotions and expressions and feelings and is unaware of the degree of their inadequacy. 
 As a new user of this or ANY such program, I find that this book does not cover the basics.  It was used in courses that I took to learn desktop publishing because of job requirements.  It's pretty much monkey see, monkey do if you have no experience with this program.  You don't learn the reasons why you're following the steps or how to decide which procedures apply when you're working on your own vice working with the lessons provided.  I'm looking for a book that gives you a foundation for thinking things through, and this is definitely not it 
 I guess I am the scrooge of the reviewers of The Politics of Diplomacy by James A. Baker III.    Given the positive things I have read about Secretary James Baker, I expected this book to be interesting, insightful and educational.  I found the book to be as interesting as reading a phone book, with sentences aggrandizing Secretary Baker thrown in along the way.  I can't believe that in his 12 years of high-level public service for Presidents Reagan and Bush, that Mr. James Baker was consistently the most crafty, astute, worldly and knowledgeable of the leaders of the world, which is the impression I was left with after reading this book.  I did find one interesting tidbit in the book, however, which was that from the time George H. W. Bush was President Reagan's Vice President, Vice President Bush wanted to overthrow President Noriega of Panama.  After he was elected President in 1988, President Bush had the opportunity to overthrow President Noriega, which he appeared to do by mishandling negotiations with President Noriega and provoking President Noriega into a belligerent state.  This example of toppling a sovereign state for personal, rather than national interest, reasons was copied by President George H. W. Bush's son, the current President Bush, who seemed to follow the same playbook with Iraq with different results, sadly.  I haven't yet given up on Secretary James Baker; I plan to read his new book, Work Hard, Study...and Keep Out of Politics! Adventures and Lessons from an Unexpected Public Life.  I hope the book contains some insights about Mr. Baker's decision-making as well as insights about other personalities he met along the way.  If the book is 480 pages of self-aggrandizement, I may have to reach for the Alka-Seltzer to keep my dinner from spilling out onto the floor. 
 Zed (Sean Connery) hitches a ride inside of a giant, flying, stone head. Once aboard, he shoots it's occupant dead and flies off to "The Vortex", a place where the "Eternals" live. This is a land full of men and women who have no sense of what real living is all about. They just loll around, musing and pontificating about nothing. Zed spices things up for these immortal buffoons by being different and, oh yeah, by having a male organ that works! I kid you not! The rest is mainly Zed finding out that what he thought would be heaven is actually pretty dull. Unfortunately, so is this movie! John Boorman (Deliverance, Excalibur) wrote, produced, and directed this elephant tranquilizer. Although, it does get an extra star for that hilarious flying head.. 
 The Comendium contains introducing desciptions of Hunter's antagonists. It's not bad but definitely too little for an own book, even a compendium. It should rather be a chapter in a bigger publication. If you have knowledge about Vampire, Werewolf or Mage you don't need it 
 If you have listened to the original cd you will find this one to be  terrible. It can never be as good as the original.  Also Snoop Dogg screwes  up in Gangsta Gangst 
 Al Gore is making a good road to tell us the facts on Global Warming , but he is missing the fact that in 3-4 years we will have the New Ice Age coming and Billion of people on Earth will die and he is missing 40-60 % of the cause of the Global Warming. The book is good and bad. We can stop this Global Warming in one month. But we cant' do it untill we will expose the real cause of it. Think about: in one month we can stop it. Each month ( in the next 2 years )we will postpone the truth is just bad. The movie is good and bad. Is bad in 90% and good in 10%. He put enormous work in it , so many government agencies he is using for this ( mostly) But he is missing the main point. He will need to change that in the next movie and this is the main point. As a government employee he will never be able to tell the truth. is going to be all the time wixh wash.... We will need to get this work from this stage and do it under an independent ( no government involvement) study. Adria 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 George Sluizer's original Dutch-French version of The Vanishing (aka The Man Who Wanted to Know) offers one of European cinema's most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths, feeling his way one step at a time towards murder. If you've seen that version, you probably still can't get the final revelation out of your head, but the film had plenty more to offer than that, playing with chronology, subverting the usual cliches of its 'Lady Vanishes' plot (the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive) and throwing in some excellent characterization. I can only assume that for this 1993 US remake Sluizer was so determined that no-one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself, but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work. His career never recovered.  Chief culprit is an astonishing performance by Jeff Bridges that has been overthought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level. A friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that Bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing, and this film is the proof of the pudding. Every movement is overly mechanical in its precision, making him look like a rusty clockwork toy, while his voice is a bizarre mixture of Tootsie, Latka Gravas from Taxi and a Dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from Dok-tah E-ville. No banality of evil here, just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying "Please. Let. Me. Kill. You. Thank you. For your. Consideration.'   But the blame really needs to be shared out here. None of the performances are good: often, they don't even look good - Keifer Sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station, Nancy Travis flounders badly and Sandra Bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession. Not that they're given any help by either director or writer Todd Graff. The script is particularly weak. The chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on Bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film. Worse is the rush the film is in, draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next. Rather than the high/low mood shifts in the couple's relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location, we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he's probably better off without her. As for the new and improved happy ending - standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame `let's end on a joke like a TV cop show' moment - best not go there... which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie. Even a shockingly bland and uninspired Jerry Goldsmith score can't do anything for this one.

 I borrowed this from my sister-in-law to read. It is the first Barr book I have read.  I did not like it because of several reasons.  First of all, THE VULGAR LANGUAGE was too much.   One can write a fantastic thriller without words that are in the gutter.   Second, it was so mundane for a mystery.  The writer could have made this a very interesting book with the setting being in Yellowstone National Park.   Someone needs to give me a book of Barr's to prove that she can write an interesting book using words that are common to our daily language instead of trash talk. (By that I mean words one would use in professions of integrity.)  
 This is not the kind of book that feels good to pan.  The author candidly shares her experience of the losses that go along with prolonged unwanted singleness in the family-focused world of evangelical Christianity and offers heartfelt encouragement to the many women who are finding themselves in the same situation today.  However, like the overwhelming majority of Christian self-help books on this topic, she hauls out that patronizing, over-used and utterly unbiblical cliché THE GIFT OF SINGLENESS, devoting an entire chapter to its defense titled "Esteeming the Gift".  Published two years ago, its timing is most unfortunate as a backlash "rethinking the gift of singleness" has just started to build with a spate of new book writers, such as Debbie Maken, and bloggers appearing on the crest of the wave.  It may seem like a matter of petty semantics and theology, but is it really a problem to call singleness a gift?  Yes, if you're suggesting that the Bible calls it a gift, which it does not (see my review of Al Hsu's "Singles at the Crossroads").  Yes, if you are suggesting that if someone is single that it's "God's will" which McCulley does when she says "Ultimately, we are single because that's God's will for us right now. That's it."   Who is she to tell us what God's will or plan is for anyone, now or at any time?   This is what one critic calls "outcome based theology", the idea that whatever happens is "God's will", including those things that are caused by sin.  It's a springboard to logical leaps contained in the teachings on God's sovereignty particular to late 20th century evangelical leaders including one of her sources, John Piper (author of the infamous post-September 11th article titled "Why I Do Not Say, 'God Did Not Cause the Calamity, but He Can Use It for Good'").  In defending the sovereignty of God (something we should all do), those who lean heavily on these teachings become too quick to frame events in terms of God's personal plan for an individual's life.  Aside from leading to the patently presumptuous, insensitive declarations and judgments common to Christian culture, it can overlook, and even justify, the larger sin-based causes of a problem such as protracted singleness.  Indeed, the church currently has a widespread epidemic of protracted singleness on its hands, particularly among women, and it is caused by sin: most notably, the shortage of marriageable Christian men, due to men leaving or avoiding the church. McCulley seems oblivious to the pervasiveness of this problem: "It's not because there are more women than men in our singles group." Hello? Singles group??  How about the whole western world, which has been suffering a dearth of Christian men, as evidenced by CampuslifeCollegeGuide.com male/female ratios, and Barna's calculation of a shortage that's in the MILLIONS.  Only recently has Christianity Today identified the gender imbalance as being the issue that "rises to the top" for Christian singles.  For years, these women have been living with their failure to find a mate and with no one willing to confirm the true reason for their predicament, going back and forth between self-blaming and blaming God (by-products of outcome-based theology), leading to the invention of "the singles contentment sermon".       Although McCulley mercifully refutes the common misconception that contentment with being single is a prerequisite for God to reward us with the goody of marriage, she erroneously claims that either singleness or marriage is given by God to each of us as our "own grace gift" or "gracious endowment", based on her misreading of 1 Corinthians 7:7.  "It's not because we are too old, too fat, too skinny, too tall, too short, too quiet, too loud, too smart, too simple, too demanding, or too anything else. It's not wholly because of past failures or sin tendencies." Actually, some of these things can decrease someone's chances of marriage.  Making this assumption undermines dealing with the realities of mate-finding that past generations of believers handled with much greater shrewdness and agency.  This pragmatic attitude is also reflected in the Bible, where marriage is almost always talked about in terms of human volition: a man "finds a wife" in Proverbs 18:22, or "takes a wife" in 1 Corinthians 9:5.  Prior to the reformation, marriage was an agreement, a vow with God, not a gift or a calling.   McCulley's misinterpretations of 1 Cor 7:7 occur because she overlooks the Greek word "idios" preceding "charisma" (grace gift), a common mistake among Christian singleness writers who use Bibles that translate the word as "own". Idios is more correctly translated as "particular" or "peculiar".  It's the root of the English word "idiosyncratic", and the French word "idiot", which means "peculiar one".  In speaking of this "idios charisma" or "idiosyncratic grace gift", Paul was referring to something much more unique than the either/or status of married or single. He accentuated his point about uniqueness by using a Greek expression still common today: "hos men houto de hos houto", most closely translated in the NASB as "one in this manner, and another in that." It's a figure of speech! "This" and "that" are non-specific: "this" does not mean marriage and "that" does not mean "singleness". As much as he recognized the advantages of singleness at that time of "present distress" v.26, we have no reason to believe that he saw it as a gift or calling.  (Nor is McCulley's reference to verse 17, also regarded as non-specific by most Bible scholars, a strong argument for it.)   Whatever was his peculiar gift that allowed him to proceed on such a perilous mission alone, Paul probably didn't quite understand himself.     The Living Bible of the 70's was arguably the first to mistranslate 1Cor7:7 to mean that "God gives to some the gift of singleness and to others the gift of marriage", and later, "The Message".  With these late 20th century biblical revisions, rogue doctrines on singleness have proliferated throughout the Christian world. The never-married, later disgraced Bill Gothard taught millions who attended his Basic Youth Conflicts seminars that singleness as a gift and a calling, using the terms interchangeably, with the underlying assumption of divine assignment or "rhema". Into the 80's and 90's there may have been some softening attempts that stressed "gift" over "calling", but the two remain inextricably linked. Obviously, this is damage control because there has been damage done. Ellen Varughese in "The Freedom to Marry" wrote at length about Christian singles immobilized in their intent to pursue marriage without any clear "word from the Lord", having been taught to view their default singleness as "God's plan" for their lives, rather than as something that could be caused by individual or generational sin.  From its biblically specious roots to the careerism of Christian singles writers who keep passing it on, "the gift of singleness" does not have an honorable history. It has become a thorn in the side of a generation of surplus Christian women that dismisses their collective grief and allows leaders to hide behind sermons about sovereignty and contentment instead of addressing the sinful causes of this epidemic, such as the flight of men from our churches (as well as teachings that have sown seeds of doubt, ambivalence, and complacency towards pursuing marriage).   We do not need to call singleness a gift to effectively encourage spiritual essentials such as gratitude and contentment, or to honor those who have devoted themselves to celibate service (and wouldn't need the flattery of calling it a gift, if indeed their service is sincere).  Even if you take the strictest view on sovereignty, there are plenty of things that God has given that are not considered gifts. When was the last time you heard the Ten Commandments referred to as a gift?   Let's all send "the gift of singleness" to the Christian lexicon trashbin, and work together to persuade church leaders to do the same.  We can begin by appealing to the editors of The Message and other modern translations to restore translations of 1Corinthians 7:7 so that they once again conform more closely with the original Greek. If we care about the future of the church, we will need to restore the ordinariness and universality of marriage enjoyed by previous generations of Christians by putting the emphasis back on God's revealed will about marriage, which puts the onus on human volition and agency.  And we will once again give singles exactly what they have been lacking: a wholehearted blessing to pursue marriage.  
 With only the most banal of polemical perspectives and no aesthetic undepinning, this journalistic description of the recent fluctuations of the art market and its suppliers falls sadly short of the potential interest and excitement of the subject. It's readable. That's it 
 This is a terrible book. True, it's hard to go wrong with the likes of Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Wittgenstein, and the other great figures represented in this volume. But the editors manage it just the same.   One problem is the length of the selections. There is no way a reader can come to grips with, say, Marx's critique of capitalism or Russell's theory of sense-data after reading a two-page snippet wrenched from its context. Some of the selections are even shorter than this; at least one is only 80 words long. Often the reader is given a philosopher's position on a particular issue, but without getting the arguments for the position! The subtext seems to be that reasons don't matter -- which, it seems safe to say, is distinctly unphilosophical.   Another problem is the banality of many of the chapter headings. As the title indicates, the book is structured around twenty philosophical questions; each chapter gives the answers of various philosophers to a different question. Chapter 10 is called, "How Should I Feel About Abortion?" This one seems easy to answer -- presumably, everyone feels pretty badly about abortion, regardless of their position on the issue. The more important question, obviously, is how we should *think* about abortion. Chapter 4 is called, "Which Should I Believe: Darwin or Genesis?" This question assumes that there is no way to harmonize Darwin's claims with those found in Genesis. It also assumes that, if they can't be harmonized, there are only two possible positions on this issue. Anyone with a passing acquiantance with the literature on creation and evolution knows just how naive these assumptions are.   Finally, the book's selections reflect a palpable bias toward the extreme left of the political spectrum. For instance, in the chapter on creation and evolution, Duane Gish, an ignoramus, is pitted against Philip Kitcher, a leading philosopher of science. The fight might be fairer had the editors chosen J.P. Moreland, Alvin Plantinga, William Lane Craig, William Dembski, or any of a number of other leading critics of naturalistic evolution, rather than a minor figure from the fundamentalist lecture circuit. Another question asks, "Does Religion Give My Life Meaning?" Apparently the answer is NO, since, with the exception of a couple watery selections on Buddhism, all of the other selections in this chapter come from opponents of traditional religion. There is also an emphasis placed on irrationalist views of science, linguistic determinism, and other liberal themes. The editors are entitled to their opinions, of course, but anyone interested in an objective and fair-minded introduction to philosophy should look elsewhere 
 This was my first Goodkind book.  Since "Debt of Bones" was a special price $2.99 novella, I figured it would be a good way to see if I wanted to invest in any more TG books.  I was not overly impressed.  While I admit that Fantasy is not my favorite type of fiction, I was still not taken in by the story or the writing in DoB.  I felt it was somewhat flat.  If this is a typical Goodkind story, then I might be able to read a stand alone book, but there is no way I would even attempt to read a series 
 Jane Goodale (Ashley Judd) is the talent booker for 'Diane Richards Live', a New York talk show that has just been picked up for syndication. Ray Brown (Greg Kinnear) has just been hired from a Washington station as the new Producer. Eddie Alden (Hugh Jackman) is the writer/director of the show. Jane falls in love with Ray. Ray asks her to move in with him. Ray gets cold feet. Jane develops a theory about cows (don't ask). Jane becomes Eddie's roommate. Jane's attraction to womanizer Eddie grows as she also reconsiders Ray.   "Someone Like You" is your basic girl-meets-boy-boy-becomes-jerk-can't-decide-whether-attractive-womanizer-is-the-right-guy story. We have all seen this story hundreds, if not thousands of times. If "Someone Like You" were just that, it would be a pleasant diversion starring attractive actors.   Unfortunately, Jane comes up with a theory about cows and their mating rituals. She finds that they are very similar to that of humans. Huh! Jane is the very young talent booker on a syndicated talk show. How did she become such an expert in biology? She buys a lot of books at Barnes and Noble and then lays on top of them. You think I'm kidding.   Because the ludicrous 'theories' that Jane Goodale (get it?) comes up with are referred to repeatedly, they completely undermine any chance that we might have to get to know or believe the characters were real. The theories keep bringing us out of the story.   Judd and Jackman are both very attractive and manage to generate some chemistry. Unfortunately, this is one of those stories in which we never see them kiss until the very end. I'm not really revealing anything here. You can tell this will happen from the very beginning.   "Someone Like You" is supposed to be a romantic comedy, yet I only laughed a couple of times throughout. Not very successful. It is also a classic example of a 'chick flick'. However, calling "Someone..." a chick flick is as insulting as calling "Exit Wounds" a guy film. Neither film is any good and prescribing them to a particular group only insults that group. More accurately, "Someone Like You" is just a bad film. Be careful you don't step in it. 
 I thought this book was a repeat of his previous book, The Fat Fallacy.  I was so looking forward to some new ideas and there was nothing.  I lost 42 pounds and have kept it off for 3 years now by following The Fat Fallacy.  I was very disappointed in this new book 
 I found this book to be very boring. I bought it because I had seen it referanced in a lot of magazine articles. It may be good for looking up useful information on heart disease, but not really a preventative book. The diet recommended in this book is unrealistic to me and seems like a diet that would be recommended to a person who was diagnosed with heart disease and had to change their lifestyle 
  I've never actually walked out a theatre in the middle of a movie.  I've never actually had every person I was with walk out of a theatre in the middle of a movie.  I've never witnesses a mass amount of people walk out of a theatre in the middle of a movie.  That was all before Miami Vice.  There is no excuse for this movie.  Not only does the plot line not go anywhere for the majority of the movie, the acting isn't even good.  And that's surprising, given the cast.  But, honestly, how long can you watch Jamie Fox simulating sex?  And how long can you watch a boat speed off into the distance?  Both of those scenes took up about all of the movie.  100%, pure garbage.  0/1 
 I connected all the cables as instructed, but it doesn't work, the light is not on. So I return it to Amazon 
 Would give it 0 stars if that were an option! It does not record in multiple recorders. A waste of time and money 
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 Something that someone who claims to be COUNTRY should NOT do. Even though these girls are already pop, remixing it to make it even more pop was a HUGE mistake! Then again, they have to do something to sell more cd's! LOL!! 
 the first few chapters have built the anticipation for a good strategy to learn , HOWEVER, there were no formulas, nothing to learn. book talks about theories about market timing with no proof. i wouldent take it seriously as i though 
 This a fascinating book that argues quite convincingly the existence of a "dual soul" theory to explain the different claims about the afterlife.  It attempts to unite both those who believe (or through an NDE actually experienced) a Heaven/Hell afterlife with those who believe in reincarnation.  Novak argues that the human mind fragments at death, with the objective conscious mind going on to reincarnate, while the subjective unconscious mind with its memories, conscience and self-judgment experiences a Heaven or Hell scenario.  He offers compelling evidence from traditional religious texts and modern NDE accounts, wile putting them in the context of current scholarship on the right-left brain dichotomy.  I was with him for the entire intellectual journey, until the last few chapters, where he takes this fascinating theory and makes a leap too far based on his own personal religious convictions.  Novak argues that the only way for the human soul to achieve true peace and fulfillment is for the two halves of consciousness to be reunited after death.  That sounds perfectly reasonable.  And then Novak leaves behind his analytical hat and becomes an evangelist -- literally.  The final pages of the book become a rather tortured effort to convince the reader that this reunification of the soul can only happen through accepting Jesus Christ, whose death and resurrection reunited the binary souls for us.  All you have to do is believe in Jesus, and the spiritual work of reuniting your own inner dualities is no longer necessary.  As a Muslim and a Sufi mystic, I had to smile.  As Novak acknowledges, all of the world's spiritual traditions contain the idea that there are several layers of souls and dualities within the human condition, and that the goal of spiritual life is to reunite them.  I have learned this from Sufi teachings about the Ruh (spirit) and Nafs (ego) and and have found similiar ideas in Taoism, Jewish Kabbalah, Buddhism and other mystical paths.  The methods each of these traditions have developed rely on individual spiritual work and progress on the path.  Unfortunately for Novak, these tried and true methods that have helped human beings transcend duality are too "uncertain."  So he decides, based on nothing except his own personal conviction, that believing in Christ is a shortcut to healing the mind rift at death, removing the need to do the spiritual work that these "Old Path" traditions require.  For those of us who value human free will and the joy of the personal journey to God, the idea that we should just believe and let "Jesus do the big lifting" is not only erroneous, but it is dangerously self-deceptive.  This delusion of vicarious atonement removes individual responsibility for the spiritual journey, which is the central purpose of life.  Novak does such a wonderful job of explaining the ancient mystical truth that the human soul is bifurcated and must be reunited, it is a tragedy that he then tells his readers to skip the hard work of spiritual discipline because he believes someone else already did the work for everyone.  I feel as if Novak brought his readers to the verge of truth, only to hoodwink them at the last minute.  They see the destination, and then are told they don't need to walk to get there.  This delusion of vicarious atonement leads to a loss of personal moral responsibility and causes people to take the spiritual life for granted.  It is a cruel joke, and I am saddened that a man of such great intellect and passion can't see that his rejection of the very ancient wisdom he uses to buttress his theory dooms his efforts to help humanity at the end.  Novak helps people see that they need to overcome their inner duality and achieve unity, and then tells them they don't need to bother to actually do it, because its already been done for them by someone else.  If he is wrong, and my heart tells me he is deeply wrong, he has misled his readers and cursed them to spiritual stagnation.  His conclusion covers up what he has himself discovered about the purpose of the human condition -- to take one step at a time toward the Infinite, which is One and beyond duality.  Thank you Mr. Novak for showing how the Binary Soul Doctrine is an ancient belief in the human condition.  The Sufis, the Taoists and all other mystics new this already.  Now if you'll excuse us, those of us "Old Path" followers who believe in individual responsibility and choice will put our knowledge into action through spiritual practice, while the delusional wait for someone else to do the work for them 
 The Quiller Memorandum takes place back during the cold war. It represented a time and place in history that was true at that time. It accurately depicts an era that is now gone, that some of us lived through.  The movie, by today's standards, is a little disjointed and incomplete.It jumps to a conclusion but lacks story development how it got there. Some scenes must have been edited on the cutting room floor back in the 60's or 70's in order to get a G or GP rating. As a result of those incomplete or cut scenes, part of the movie makes no sense.  The movie would have been better served if it were produced closer to the author's original book.  The most memorable part of the movie is the haunting score, including Matt Monroe's "Wednesday's Child".  I was disappointed in viewing this movie again some 20 or 30 years later. Perhaps Wolfe was right when he said that we can never go home again. Quiller must have gotten lost on his way home!  
 This movie is nothing but a exploitation film out of Japan. Similar to many 80s American films that really should be forgotten, like "I Spit on Your Grave."  There is nothing vengeful about this story, nothing shocking, and not much worth watching.  I mean, you do have a beautiful, full-bosomed lead female who seems to act well, and you have the rapist evil-doers, who seem to act well enough as well.  The movie has scenes of violence against women, and of women and men both being very weak against it. The plot is stupified, and its annoying to see these people, which includes pretty much everyone, act retarded.  Plot: girl is raped five years ago, moves to tokyo, rapists return and want to do it again . . oh no! what could possibly happen?? well in true exploitation film nature, lots of breast, blood, and beer. Seriously.  Is it art? No. Hell no. Rent the Kill Bill series if you want true revenge well served to the point of ecstasy. Is the acting and directing good? sure, no problems. Will you remember this movie a few months after seeing it? highly doubtful. 
 The songs in this book are mostly in 1st position-so if you are looking for great blues lick-this is probably the wrong place to look.  However this isn't a bad compilation of popular songs aranged for the harmonic 
 My wife got this book when homeschooling and my daughter picked out the motor experiment. We followed the directions but could not get the motor to work. After looking at the design I realized the armature winding was incorrect. The winding must go around the cork in parallel with the axis, not around the axis. Needless to say a child trying to build this would be extremely frustrated. I have a feeling the author did not build all the experiments. The lack of explanation of how the motor works is also a drawback 
 This book presents a horrible introduction to graduate level fluid mechanics.  Some faculties like to teach from this book because of a few well-written sections near the end of an otherwise disastrous attempt on the subject.  Kundu or Currie present a much more comprehensive approach to introducing the wonderful subject of fluids and the different solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations 
 This novel comes off like a high schooler wanting to write about the movie and music industries.  In between the entertainment biz cliches, the author can only think to put various assination hits.  some of the characters are interesting but not believable, and they  certainly can't make up for the braindead plot.  Read some of his other novels and skip this one 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 I think this proves the old saying that.... those that can...do; and those that can't.... teach -or in this case, "write" 
 The reason the novels of Child and Preston are so good is that they give the reader a glimmer of the possibility that the supernatural events that they are reading about might just be possible.  Not with this writer.  Totally unbelievable 
 This book has many wonderful reviews. I ordered the book and was looking forward to reading it. So I read it, then read it again. I didnt find much that is helpful to new writers. Certainly no "Ah,Hah!" moments.  Gardner reminds me of something a professor once told me: "If you were lost in the Amazon jungle would you want an Indian to help you OR someone who knows a lot about Indians?" Gardner knows a lot about writers! This book showcases his knowledge of writers and literature. Very interesting book.  But what exactly it does to help new writers is a mystery. New writers are not Tolstoy or Dickens or Balzac. New writers need to know how to hobble a book together that will fly...later they can soar 
 First: The part that the ratcheting clip clips to has to be attached to the case with 4 screws.  Second:  No Fixed belt clip.  Third: Only the case is black, all other parts are clear plastic.  Bought 10 of them for 36 cents each, spent 35 dollars on shipping.  Guess i got what i paid for.  Now i have to go thru the process of trying to get a full refund 
 I'm sure this book was great in the 90s, but this is the 21st century, when you can buy the fourth edition.  There has been a ton of advancement between 1994 and 2002 
 1994 William J. Bennett wrote "The De-Valuing of America: The fight for Our Culture and Our Children", 1995 followed " The Children's Book of Virtues", 1996 "The Book of Virtues: A Treasury of Great Moral Stories" as well as "What Works: William J. Bennett's Research about Teaching and Learning", 1997 "The Children's Book of Heroes", 1998 "Our Country's Founders: A Book of Advice for Young People "as well as "Choosing The Right College: The Whole Truth About America's 100 Top Schools ", 1999 "The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals" as well as "Patriot Sage: George Washington and the American Political Tradition", 2001 "The Broken Hearth: Reversing The Moral Collapse of The American Family", "Virtues of Family Life: Stories from the Book of Virtues "as well as thirdly "The Children's Book of Faith ", 2004 "Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House", 2005 "The War Against Excellence: The Rising Tide of Mediocrity in America's Middle Schools" -- and so on: a true cloudburst of conservative forefingers lifted up fully, all publications, together just as stoutly as this Old Testament, Bible Part 1. Of course the one, who lectures dearest children and her moms at "what has to be believed in", does not like that pacifist, relativistic thinking climate, which is too characteristic of the intellectual elite at universities. He rejoices, that the academic world represents a minority. He is right with that. The majority can be conducted by third-class educationalists like William Bennett. Besides Christian false piety a clear sympathy with military solutions is part of this type of writing. Of course Iraq must be covered with war and if necessary, Iran also. The soldiers have to be admired as heroes. One does not have to think about this, why some countries on this globe like to criticize the USA. This undermines only the fight morals of the soldiers. The unutterable, one-dimensional arguing of this William Bennett indeed does not get beyond the standard of an armed forces parish priest. No book for universities or politics interested adults, but one for boys who would like to become once a soldier. One should read this book with the flag in one's hand .  
 Horrible movie, only worth watching if you are a Jayne Mansfield or Phyllis Diller fan. Movie looks like it was cheaply filmed and only uses about 4 scenes in entire movie. However, if you like cartoons, than you might like this movie. The singer Laurie Berger is the funniest when she sings and dances her solo. Save your money for a fast food burger. 
 this magazine is almost as bad as consumer reports. their comparison tests never adhere to their thesis about what the tests is measureing, for example a comparison test is said to be about quick acceleration and on point handling and then the car with the lack lust performance in handling and acceleration would be #1 in ranking. often, the car reviews are always mentioning information about a car that isn't relevant, or doesn't make sense, or the review isn't consistent with the posted viehicle stats. the magazine also seems to be biased. some vehicles are criticized with more irrelevant information than others to say its awful. after further reading of many issues, you would think they are playing favortism towards certain brands or recieving kick backs from manufacturers, for example, you will always see the domestic brand being referred to as basically "trash" and a japanese brand or a BMW is always the way to go, when once again the posted stats and sometimes photos say different.this is more noticeable when you can predict the out come of their reviews. ultimately, its a bad guide towards getting any  information on automobiles period. its the pat robertson of auto magazines. if it were possible, i woudln't even give this magazine 1 star. 
 The series started off so well, it's sad to see it end so badly. This book is just a collection of random events, there really isn't a plot. None of the questions raised throughout the series are answered.  The first book was great, I wish I had stopped there. 
 First of all they didn't sent me the pictured panties, but boyshorts in a weird blueish psychedelic print. Butt-ugly. Second, they are from a flimsy mesh fabric that looks really cheap and declasse. Returned right away. Very disappointing 
 I wanted to take a quick look over the internet but the people who programed this site will not let you scan the book for one second. It is sad that you would have to by the book just to look for one sorry thing. And I am ashamed at the situation.And at the creaters of this site for not giving anyone the chance to look before they buy 
 The book was filled with filler information from about everyone who has ever written about having a the "right" mindset.  But I will give Matt credit though, I might not of liked this book by him, but he does know his stuff on interent marketing 
 This review covers only the Gateway Movie Classics edition, softcover, 1999.  What a thrill to revisit this gripping story that I enjoyed in childhood so much. Good writing, excellent story-telling, if you're not too squeamish to tolerate late 19th century colonialist literature.  But skip this edition. Mainly because of the numerous typos scattered inanely through the book...periods dropped into the middle of sentences, rogue exclamation points, and words inaccurately transcribed as though an original text had been OCR scanned without any professional quality checking. Inexusable in a professional publication. And, frankly, I don't think the movie is all that great, so the cover photo of a film version Quatermain doesn't do much for me.  Get another edition 
 This book is a breezy read, but it is very broadly (and superficially) put together, and will offer nothing new at all for anyone familiar with the underlying material. And the broad reference in the title to 1942 suggests a much broader overview than what the book actually deals with. Most of the book is focused on the U.S. war in the Pacific in 1942, and anyone seeking a broad study of world-wide developments during that fateful year will be sorely disappointed. The book is glibly opinionated (fair enough) but has the feel of something dictated into a recorder after a hasty review of secondary sources and then transcribed, rather than something thoughtfully written. As one other reviewer has noted, there are far too many grammatical errors and words used incorrectly, which suggests not only inattention by the writer, but very little attention paid by his editor. As a work of "popular history", this work seems most suited as a kind of introductory primer for junior high school students 
 The most sensational claim Evans makes is that Aristotle Onassis indirectly paid for RFK's murder.His 'proof' is shockingly inadequate.  Central to Evans's thesis are entries in Sirhan's notebooks which purportedly connected Aristotle Onassis to the assassin. Evans alleges Sirhan's notebooks make reference to Alexander Onassis's girlfriend Fiona, whom his father detested, and Stavros Niarchos, his shipping rival, whom he also hated.   However, Evans's juxtaposition of names to prove Sirhan wrote about killing Onassis's enemies is misleading. Sirhan had placed the name FIONA in a list of racehorse names - Fiona, Jet-Spec, Kings Abbey and Prince Khaled. The Arabic script consists of one sentence "He should be killed" (not "They should be killed" as Evans alleges) and does not refer to either Niarkos or Fiona.   The diary entry "Niarkos" remains unexplained, as do many other entries in Sirhan's notebooks, but there is no indication it refers to anyone on a Sirhan 'Death List'. The words in Sirhan's notebooks were the result of simple stream-of-consciousness ramblings he learned from Rosicrucian literature as ways to improve his life. The notebooks are filled with names of people Sirhan knew - Bert Altfillisch, Peggy Osterkamp and Gwen Gum for example, and people he didn't know like Garner Ted Armstrong. The entries which refer to $100,000 were simply Sirhan's obsessions about wealth and appear a number of times in the notebooks.   Also central to Evans's thesis was the implication that Sirhan had spent a three month period before the assassination being trained by terrorists or undergoing hypnotic indoctrination. Evans was wrong in stating Sirhan's movements were unaccounted for, or "a blanket of white fog" as he put it. Sirhan's movements in the months prior to the assassination leave no unaccountable period when the assassin could have spent a considerable amount of time being "hypnotically indoctrinated." In the year preceding the assassination Sirhan was seen frequently in the Hi-Life bar in Pasadena by waitress Marilyn Hunt.He was also seen in Shap's Bar during this period. In July 1967 Sirhan filed a disability complaint for workmen's compensation. Between July and September 1967 Sirhan's mother and brother Munir said Sirhan went often to the Pasadena library.Library records confirm he borrowed books during the so-called 'white fog' period. Sirhan's mother said her son `..stayed at home for over a year (sic) with no job'(October 1966 to September 1967). Sirhan, by his mother's account, often drove her to work during the time he was unemployed. On 9th September 1967 Sirhan began work at John Weidner's health food store.Weidner reported no long periods of absence up to the time Sirhan left his employ in March 1968. So how did Sirhan `emerge(ed) from this `white fog' in March 1968, (and) joined the (Rosicrucians)' as Evans states? (Author's note: Sirhan actually joined the Rosicrucians in June 1966.) And, as I point out in my review of Evans' book in Crime Magazine, (http://crimemagazine.com/05/robertkennedy,0508-5.htm ), Sirhan's movements in the three month period before the assassination leave no time unaccounted for.  Dominick Dunne is wrong - this book will not change history 
 This was a cute product, but only lasted a day.  Perhaps my preschool boys' punches were just too much for this bag.  A patch was included, but it seems that air is leaking from the seams.  Oh well. 
 There are some good points and bad points to James Shelton's "Bear Attacks".  There is some excellent information presented on attacks themselves and on what to do if you find yourself in that situation.  There are a few problems I have with this book.  First, Shelton is just as biased as the so called "preservationist" groups he demeans.  It is clear he was raised in the thought that everything in the world belongs to mankind and that we should be able to take something if it benefits us.  His attitude towards bears, while showing respect, paints them as some sort of lesser being that we need to control.  Second, some of his ideas on why attacks are happening seem to be skewed by this.  While I do not agree that all attacks are all people's fault, Shelton makes it seem like we should blame bears for the way they live and naturally are.  He insists that attacks are not people's fault but then presents information about how the bear was food conditioned by people, even if they are not the ones who were attacked.  If you are looking for a definitive book on bear attacks, look for one by an actual biologist who does not have a hidden agenda 
 EDIT: I guess this deserves two stars rather than one; after all you can't get this stuff anywhere else.  I was feeling a bit shirty when I gave it one star.  Now, on with the review! - - -  First of all let it be known that the so-called "notebooks" of the title are a fiction. The title implies that during the making of his greatest films Sir Alfred sat down, licked the end of his pencil, and committed to paper all his magic in black and white for the indy filmmakers of posterity to read and emulate.   Well, sadly, there are no long lost secret "notebooks". The creative genius of Hitchcock, much like the plans in The 39 Steps, resided in that little man's head.   What we have instead is distressingly prosaic, and not very educational at all. We get memos, telegrams, more memos, lengthy side by side script draft comparisons, transcripts of conversations, still more memos, and a few storyboards that can be found elsewhere.   And if, upon hearing the name Hitchcock, you think of titles like Psycho, Vertigo, Rear Window, Rebecca, Notorious, and North by Northwest, then prepare to be disappointed. They aren't discussed. Instead we're referred to the author's other books for the first two films and the Criterion laserdisks for the rest. (Laserdisks! Do they even make those anymore? Thanks for nothing, guys.)   We do get a gobsmackingly large amount of stuff about Marnie, though.   But wait, there's more:   We get a thrilling exchange of telegrams discussing whether or not Suspicion is a boring title for a film. (Hitch says yes, his producer says no, then Hitch says yes again, and his producer repeats no. How's that for a look into the mind of a genius?)   We get lengthy memos from people like Hume Cronyn talking about how scene 423 of a second draft of a script that we never have seen nor never will see needs to be revised in some unspecified way.   We learn that the character development in The Birds was a little below par. There's a series of four or five lengthy letters, all saying the same thing, and capped off with this brilliant editorial comment from our learned author: "Of course, the consistent complaint here is the weakness in the character development, something that was never worked out." Thanks, Professor.   We get fuzzy reproductions of the blueprints for the bookshop in Vertigo, should you want to build one of your own.   We get twenty pages of reproduced letters in Hitchcock's illegible handwriting discussing whether or not 3-D is a good idea. At least that's all I could make out.   We get the first draft treatment of Shadow of a Doubt in Thornton Wilder's handwriting. Alas, it too is illegible.   We get pages and pages and pages and pages of material about Marnie. It seems that half the damn book is about Marnie.   We get not one, not two, but three letters from some guy named Otis Guernsey telling Hitch he's welcome to use his germ of an idea for North By Northwest.   We get not just the film-related parts of letters, but the whole blessed thing: paragraph after paragraph of "How's Alma?" and "Drop by the next time you're in town" and letterheads for the Herald Tribune, all taking up valuable space.   We read a memo asking that the dialogue for The Birds needs to be punched up "on pages 6-10, 27-29, 37, 40, 48, 49, 50, 53, 54, 65, 74, 132, 188, and 194."  And so on. Basically, the book seems to have been assembled by dipping at random into Hitchcock's old file cabinets, running every other scrap of paper through a scanner, then presenting the whole pile sans comment. There's a definite rummage sale vibe about the whole thing - the very occasional gem amid lots and lots and LOTS of hooey.   I guess what I'm trying to say is, this one's for the completist.  Anyone who would like to get an insight into the creative thought processes of Hitchcock would be best served by the Truffaut interview book.   As for the rest of you, well, I hope you liked Marnie 
 There is a little secret that people should be aware of before watching this film. The rationale for the war was not that the US wished to bring civilisation to the Iraqi nation and to end the atrocities this film deals in. It was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction that it would use against the West if these were not dismantled. The war was waged even though the weapons inspectors could find no weapons. After the war, the victors found no weapons of mass destruction. And so the case for a war in which, according to the Lancet, 100,000 people lost their lives, was manufactured.    Here's another secret. If someone lies to you once, they will do it again. I suggest that people should view this stuff, if they must, with extreme scepticism. No one would claim that these atrocities never happened. Of course they did. If you go to chop-chop square in Saudi Arabia on any Friday, you'll see this form of justice dispensed, as it has been for the past 1000 years. Question the accuracy of these claims, and the motivation behind the claims and ask yourself whether, yet again, we are being manipulated. One thing is certain, if you believe that what you see in this film justifies the war against Iraq, consistency demands that we attack Saudi Arabia immediately. 
 This movie, often identified as a must-view DVD for expectant parents, certainly has its share of laughs. While the movie sometimes verges on a slapstick feel, the situations encountered by Hugh Grant and Tom Arnold provide enough humor to make the movie a workable comedy.  Why, then, a two-star rating? The answer lies with the film's perpetuation of common misconceptions about cats, pregnancy, and babies. In this movie, the father-to-be has a pet cat. Unfortunately, the expectant mother is the victim of out-of-date information suggesting that cats spread parasites and threaten babies. While it is certainly true that pregnant women should avoid cleaning the litterbox and that no infant should be left unattended with any pet, there is no credible evidence to suggest that cats and babies cannot live under the same roof.   The film does seem to redeem itself briefly when a jilted Hugh Grant is shown holding the cat during a party. The brief promise of redemption vanishes quickly when the cat is literally tossed aside by another character. After that point, the cat and its fate are never mentioned again, allowing the viewer to draw the least favorable conclusion.  Ironically, a book shown during the movie, "What to Expect When You're Expecting," reinforces the conclusion that cats and pregnancy are not mutually exclusive. It appears, however, that the makers of this film never actually read the book or absorbed its wisdom.  Of course, some viewers will be tempted to say that this is only a movie and that this reviewer should "lighten up," but movies have a surprising way of legimitizing behavior. While it is highly unlikely that someone would decide to abandon a cat based solely on this movie, it is possible that "Nine Months" could sway someone who is already contemplating abandonment and looking for affirmation that such behavior is acceptable. That possibility is enough to undermine a movie that would otherwise be an inoffensive and enjoyable comedy 
 The author and publisher of this travesty need to spend a little more time in the real world, perhaps in the helping professions and less time in literati land where obviously they thought this tripe was a good idea.  To those who believe this is an accurate commentary on American society, I say to look a little more closely; altruism abounds in our society, it just isn't as sexy or glamorous as the narcissism and the greed and so isn't as easly seen.    Further a comment on the audio version of this book: the reader needs to stop trying to imitate regional accents.  Speaking as someone who actually lives in Maine, very few of us actually talk with an accent and to hear it imitated (badly) in media is insulting 
 Line by line the writing is superb. Ford has an eye for making insignificant detail seem important. But here may be the problem with ID. The constant shift to describing everything in the narrator's line of vision confuses my sense of what's relevant. Every other page is a distraction from something I wasn't sure about to begin with 
 First, I want to say that this is another book that tells you how to eat healthy.  Many of us who are overweight know how to eat healthy - we just don't do it.  We are addicted to our ice cream, sodas, sugar, etc.  Forget buying this book if you & your family like beef, pork, lamb, veal, etc.  On this "way of eating" you are allowed chicken, turkey & fish.  (Most of the people in my family are not fish eaters, including me, and especially talapia, which is the fish that is recommended in the recipe section of the book.  Talapia tastes like dirt to me.)  Therefore, if I were to follow the instructions, I'd be serving only chicken & turkey.  Dr. Katz's research seems sound, and I agree that the food industry has succeeded in "addicting" us to sugar and over-processed foods.  I intend to try some of the recipes (they look pretty good) and I also intend to cut the junk food out of my diet.  I've already cut out white bread.  Dr. Katz says that our appetites are lulled by flavor consistency.  So his theory is that if you eat the same flavor during the day, your brain will turn off the hunger and you will be satiated.  So, the first day you incorporate raisins & currants into your meals, the next day, apples, the next, pineapple, and so on.  I really would have tried it, but my family likes other things besides chicken & turkey!! 
 AN AIR FORCE PILOT [ICE-T] FAKES HIS OWN DEATH ONLY TO RESURFACE AS THE PARTNER OF A DEADLY LATIN AMERICAN ARMS DEALER [ANDREW DIVOFF]. WHEN A STEALTH GETS STOLEN AND IT'S USED TO TARGET THE MILITARY, IT'S UP TO ONE MAN [COSTAS MANDYLOR] TO STOP HIM BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. ONE THING THAT CAN'T BE DENIED IS THAT THIS MOVIE IS BORING. THE ACTION IS NOT WORTH WATCHING, THE SCRIPT IS DUMB, AND THE STORY JUST GETS TIRING AFTER A WHILE. ERNIE HUDSON'S ACTING TALENTS ARE ONCE AGAIN WASTED IN ANOTHER LOW-RENT DIRECT-TO-VIDEO FILM. IF YOU LIKE ICE-T AND WANNA SEE ONE OF HIS MORE RECENT FILMS, SAVE YOUR MONEY AND RENT OR BUY ''OUT KOLD''. 
 To start, I admit that I did enjoy reading this book overall. However, this text is just as biased as the object of its accusations, the (rest of the) media... While I don't doubt that the author has a firm grounding in the subject matter, I do wish he'd left out a few pot-shots at subjects that are irrelevant to the subject at hand, such as: - a disavowal of the current AIDS epidemic in the U.S. (p.9) - stating as fact ("a truism" in his words) that news reporters are all liberals (p.10), a topic which is hotly debated at present and not found to be "a truism"... - a strangely out-of-place jab at President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinski (p.144) - stating that West Coast police departments tend to have "higher moral standards" than others (p.128) - delineating why "fag murders" (his words) are different from other types of murder (p.39)  Also, the author's excoriation of the news media is not followed up by any substantion discussion of their errors; nearly all of his anecdotes deal with written fictional works and movies. While he does sufficiently recount a laundry list of errors in books and movies, he rarely returns the issue of the news/"press" media after the first chapter. Finally, he uses too few citations for sourced material, and of those he does attribute, most are from articles published in the Southwest U.S., or listed as "personal communication with the author" from an unnamed person. As another reviewer recommended, I'd visit the publisher's (Loompanics Unlimited) website, but not only because they offer other interesting books, but also because it will give you a very clear picture of the audience this and other of their books are aimed at. Or, in their own words as found on their site, "we are the lunatic fringe of the libertarian movement." Not necessarily a bad thing, but worth keeping in mind while reading this book, which I would still recommended for an interesting and informative read. But, have your salt-shaker nearby, because you'll need a few grains during the reading... 
 Sorry to give you the bad news about this DVD set, but...  I love the Kids in The Hall, but found the Complete Season One  dissapointing. I remember some wonderful and very humorus skits in Season One that were not included in this set...such as the crushing the head man with his friend Misha who interupts the play he is putting on. The actors in his play are his fingers. As he goes to crush her head, she sticks her thumb in front of one eye and says "there's no body home", so it appears that her thumb is covering his head... But this skit isn't in here. Why?  As a lover of the head crusher, the only head crushing episodes in Season One are when he crushes business men's heads and runs into a little boy in a suit and asks him "What do you want to be when you grow up?" the little boy responds "A business man!" -- he consquently gets his head crushed. Funny, but not the best or most memorable of the head crusher.   I also was disspointed in Buddy Cole in this DVD set. There were some wonderful Buddy Cole segments in the first season that are not in this set (how about the one when he is in jail and his tin cup is shaped like a champagne glass?), The same for the chicken lady (blind date, attending wedding to the bearded lady, or phone sex line) and cabbage head (I loved it when he invited himself along to join a bunch of women who were trying to have dinner, as he sits in a lawn chair with a sex book and asks questions). I also loved the skit where a woman (played by one of the Kids in drag) sits at an outdoor cafe, is annoyed by a terrible waiter and suffers further aggravation from the "dirty man standing behind the fence" who is trying to bum cigarettes for "his kids" from her. Or, how about the guy that stubbed his toe and doesn't want to go to the doctor because he found the colors of his infected toe "interesting!"  Not one of these hillarious skits or episodes are included in the Season One DVD Collection...Why?  God only knows who compiled the collection of sometimes boring comedy skits in the Season One DVD collection, but I can tell you one thing. There is no way this is a complete collection of the entire Season One episodes. It is incomplete, to say the least. I just gave you many examples of my favorites that are missing. It would have been great to see them again and have them to enjoy for posterity. It was that kind of humor that endeared us all to The Kids In The Hall so much.   The skits included in this collection are probably not the most popular or funny episodes. I would not recommend it. Take it from me...save yourself twenty or thirty bucks.   I have not seen the other DVD collections from the other Kids In The Hall Seasons on DVD as yet. One can only hope that they will be more entertaining than Season One was (or should I say, wasn't)...  P.S. I would not have even rated this DVD set one star, but it was the lowest rating you can give an item. 
 I read this book on the advice of a friend who said it was an american literary masterpiece.  To my surprise I found the book boring and devoid of any value.  Miller spews out a self-absorbed diatribe intermingled with profane and tedious nonsense.    After a while I thought - why am I wasting precious time on this book?   There are other far better literary works.   
 I have to go against the grain here and give a Thumbs Down to this series.  The things that come out about the characters is simply not very interesting.  The things that they say aren't interesting.  Their lives aren't made interesting for us.  It's a good concept on the surface.  Just follow someone's life.  Check in with them every seven years to see what's changed.  But the bottom line for me is if I enjoy watching the program, and I don't.  Maybe it's the dryness of the interviewing.  Maybe a different person, a more creative person, would have breathed more life into the series.  It would be hard for me to imagine anyone doing a dryer or more boring job of it.  So while almost all of the other reviewers applaud what we see here, I have to say it was not done well.  A concept so potentially interesting, following various people throughout their lives, has not been developed as well as it could have been, and I can't recommend this series, except for the concept itself.  Good concept, inadequate execution.  A much better interviewer could have done something with this format.  If you are pleased with these results, your standards are too low, you'd applaud instant oatmeal 
 I'm not reviewing the show itself, but rather the colorization. (If you've seen the show, you know whether you like it; if you haven't seen it, you can read the many other reviews.) The show is lighthearted fun and not to be taken seriously, but if I'm bothered by the colorization, it must be really bad. Unless you like Jeannie with orange hair and people who look like they've drunk a bottle of ink, skip this version and get the BW set.  Then you won't be constantly distracted by weird and wrong colors 
 I wish I could give this movie zero stars. It's really amazing how someone can inject raw gore, violence, and sick humour into a movie, and try to pass it off as slick comedy, drama, and deep philosophy. This movie is a great example of how a director can actually make a deliberate and hard working effort to produce a despicable movie. The sheer perversity in this movie that is dressed up as comedy and paraded as some kind of dark humour is beyond criticism. Do yourself a favour and please don't ever watch this movie if it comes on air. It's not even worth watching for morbid fascination. I terribly resent the fact that I gave up an hour and a half of my life watching it out of sheer curiosity. But then, I may actually be glad that I did. At least it taught me how an exercise in atrocious film making can be 
 This wasn't what I was looking for, I was disappointed why??? The book was very bland, uninformative and it really just very useful to m 
 BAsed on some good and some bad reviews, I bought the book to see for myself.  Let's just say I gave the book away for free, because it's not worth the bookshelf space.  If you really know anything about voip security, you'll know this book is a waste.  It's not technically wrong, but it's easy to be not wrong when you don't say much.  You can learn more from NIST and vendor docs than from this book.  My respect for CISSPs dropped after reading their positive reviews of this book 
 The work of a 12 year-old without talent. Phrases are tediously cobbled with clumsy, inappropriate similies. Story line is absurd. If this were Koontz's first novel, no publisher would touch it 
 The mystery of the broadcast from no-man's-land is solved by page 174.  That leaves about 110 more pages of melodramatic romance and a a somewhat shallow description of how the people end their lives as the inevitable radiation poisoning takes hold.  I would have liked more treatment of submarine operations--one of the cruises only takes about two pages.  If you're looking for a maritime mystery story this isn't it.  The romantical treatment of the young family might be a culture difference--Shute repeatedly refers to the infant as "it."  There are some continuity problems, as Shute was evidently unfamiliar with radio terminology despite years developing "secret weapons for the British in World War II:" in two facing pages, the frequency of the mysterious transmission is either 4.92 megacycles or 4.92 kilocycles.  Similarly, the descriptions of some of the dead (falling out of a latrine, sitting at a year-long cocktail party) are also puzzling given the nearby blasts.  More curiously are the dead people in the American town whom the deserted sailor found poisoned in their beds but that in that area death would have been very immediate and not as convenient as the slow, anticipated deaths in Melbourne.  I rather disliked the bland story of the scientist-turned-race-car-driver that was seemingly bolted into the book about halfway though.  I suppose the author wanted to stuff more pages or perhaps an early reading of his manuscript left out some crucial third-party character.  Still, I haven't read a book in three days' time in many years.  It's a compelling page-turner, but after page 174 I had a hard time dragging myself through the rest of it 
 I read Cast Two Shadows by Ann Rinaldi in my history class. I had much trouble getting through this book because of the unique writing style and Carolines vague descriptions of things. If I could read this book again, I would not because I did not enjoy it much at all 
 I was very unhappy with this product. First the shipping took way too long. Second, the tube is much smaller than sold at Macy's and the cost is more. And the contents were gross, very goopy. Not smooth. Like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months. I'll fight the mall to buy this next time 
 Never having read Macomber before, I picked up Susannah with interest, hoping to discover the secret of her popularity. While the premise of this book is a promising one, it never reached it's potential. Susannah as a character is oh so nice, and for a woman in her 50's, remarkably impetuous and self-absorbed. Her husband Joe is incredibly mild mannered and forebearing, and daughter Chrissy, evidently meant to be charmingly naive and innocent, comes across as petulant and spoiled. As so often happens with writers who turn out book after book, Macomber annoyingly depends too much on favorite phrases (e.g., he "wound his arm around her waist"). Less than halfway through this story, its central "mystery" became transparently predictable, and in the final 30 pages, all the pieces fell conveniently into their happy ending places. On the positive side, Macomber did a terrific job portraying the insidiousness of Alzheimer's. Perhaps her earlier novels are more skillfully written 
 Reading this book felt like being stuck next to a new parent on a long plane trip.  Either you're bored because you don't have kids, or you're bored because it is never your turn to talk about YOUR kid, or you are so kid-oriented and passive that you simply LOVE to hear all about the mundane ordinary pleasures that someone else gets from THEIR kid.  If you are in the latter category, or you are perhaps a single mom in recovery and born again in Christ, you will enjoy this book.  Otherwise, skip it and go spend some time with your real-life friends who have kids.  They need the company, and the baby stories are all pretty much the same.  Lamott's diary style offers 'reality' but little art 
 -Everyone expressing a erudite opinion about Clausewitz or "ON WAR" has completely missed the point here.  -The question is NOT whether Clausewitz or "On War" is an essential read for everyone interested in military hsitory or military affairs. THAT is a moot piont to the Nth Degree.  -The REAL question IS - WHY would you pay $595.oo for a book that has the same identical information as another book for $30.oo ?!?!?!?   -That is the ONLY question regarding THIS particular version of "ON WAR".  -Its the ECONOMICS, stupid ! 
 This album, released in 1987, may not be the one you want...  The song Classical Gas, by Mason Williams, has been recorded dozens of times. Mason Williams has recorded at least three different versions himself, so it's not too surprising that many people end up buying something different than they expected. Here is a list of some of the more notable versions:  Title: Classical Gas Performer: Mason Williams Album: The Mason Williams Phonograph Record Year: 1968 Comment: This is the original hit you have heard on the radio many times.  Title: Classical Gas Performer: Mason Williams Album: Handmade Year: 1970 Comment: This superb acoustic version is my favorite. It also appears on the 1999 "The Story of Us" soundtrack. Many MP3 files circulating the Internet incorrectly credit this version to Eric Clapton.  Title: Classical Gas Performer: Chet Atkins Album: Street Dreams Year: 1986 Comment: Features acoustic and electric guitar, violin, and flute - an interesting listen.  Title: Classical Gas Performer: Mason Williams and Mannheim Steamroller Album: Classical Gas Year: 1987 Comment: This is the album shown above and is good if you like Mannheim Steamroller, but it does not contain the original Classical Gas recording that most people want.  Title: Classical Gas Performer: Vanessa-Mae Album: The Violin Player Year: 1995 Comment: Very nice cover with violin as the lead instrument.  Title: Classical Gas Performer: California Guitar Trio Album: Pathways Year: 1998 Comment: Impressive.  Title: Classical Gas Performer: Zoe McCulloch Album: Gypsy Noodle Year: 2004 Comment: Electric guitar version by a brilliant young player. This album features several compositions by Mason Williams. 
 This item is supposedly titled "UFOs: The First Encounters." It is, however, an episode about reincarnation. It is incorrectly labeled. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
 Inspired by his uncle, Eddie, who worked at an amusement park, Albom writes a well-coordinated tale of people who connect here and in the afterlife, which is described by him as a very materialistic ambience. The concept is old: a better life beyond and a reason for the people with whom you cross paths. There are concepts to be learned from the five people. The story is delightful and cavalier.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope and South State Street Journal 
 After reading Jane Austen, George Eliot, Charlotte, Emily, and Anne Bronte, this book only tries, but never makes it to the 19th century period writing style. I disliked the fact that the author had to place us in this period, yet goes into the 21st century again and again with little nuances. What does a computer have to do with the people in 1867?  I do not understand how people could find a review helpful when the reviewer has given a book 5 stars. If you like the 19th century period, and is bothered by the way some contemporary novelist write, it is probably best to read the British authors of that time and forego John Fowles. I think Fowles tried to imitate George Eliot's Middlemarch by inserting certain quotes and passages from other books and Eliot's writing style, but Fowles has failed. This book comes out uninteresting and barely readable. It is amazing that a movie actually came out of this, and it is another wonder that people have actually liked this book enough to give it 5 stars.  I do have to add that if you are a woman, this book will definitely be offensive to you. The women are portrayed as manic depressive, innately hysterical, or terribly stupid and materialistic. Also, unless you are into 2 different versions of an ending, you would not like this book. Fowles may have thought that a reader would rather make up his/her mind on an ending, but I read a book because I want the author to give me a story. I do not want to have to make up my mind on how it should end. Otherwise, I might as well write my own book 
 This book was on somebody's Amazon.com LISTMANIA for Sea Turtles, so I hunted it down.  It is only vaguely about sea turtles, in that it is set on an island in Georgia where sea turtles nest.  There is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book, and then he disappears, so it's obvious that he was involved in the crime.   There are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable.  I wish this book had at least been fun to read but it was tedious and I ended up skimming the whole thing, looking for any sign of sea turtle interaction.  Skip this book and send your $6.99 to a sea turtle hospital instead. 
 I have enjoyed many of Anne Tyler's books, particularly, "Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant," "Breathing Lessons" and "Back When We Were Grownups".  "Saint Maybe" was a huge disappointment.  The plot and characters were mediocre at best, and a bizarre religion, The Church of the Second Chance, played a major part in the story. By the end of the book, it had completely taken over.  The Church of the Second Chance fell somewhere between a strict religion and a cult.  Yes, Ian Bedloe was close to a saint for looking after three children for the best part of his life, but why the book was named, "Saint Maybe" is still a mystery to me.  One of the children in Ian's care made reference to Ian as perhaps being "Saint Maybe," but who the heck is Saint Maybe??  The closest I could come up with is "MAYBE you will finish the book... and MAYBE you won't! 
 Everything is fine, everything is OK. The simplest answer is the most likely.  Conspiracies are made up by left-wing wackos with nothing to do.  Did Iran-Contra ("Ask about the cocaine!"), Tuskegee, MK-ULTRA, Latin American germ warfare, Bay of Pigs, Allende overthrow, CIA LSD research of the 50s, '66 NY subway experiment, and the Arbenz coup in Guatemala all happen?  No they didn't.  Oliver North acted alone and was deranged and crazy.  E. Howard Hunt was a deranged loner who tried to kill Castro.  Uncle Sam was a crazy deranged lunatic that give African Americans syphilis in 1932.  He acted alone.  God bless America.  I love our leader.  The more than fifty people that died after the Kennedy assassination all committed suicide.  They were distressed by Oswald's murder of Kennedy and could not go on living.  Shame on you Mr. Oswald.  I love you Mr. Posner.  You're a lot better than that Oswald guy.  Mr. Posner: would you please write a book debunking the claims of The Chuch of the Sub-Genius?  JR Bob Dobbs is a nut and must be stopped.  God bless you and your people 
 Both the book and the film is full of exaggeration, revenge and hatred towards Turkey and Turks. Only 30-40% of the story may be true which I am pretty sure would also be the same in many countries 36 years ago. All the rest is full of lies. But portraying one of the worlds most interesting and beautiful city like it was is a real shame and pitty. I am a Greek living in Athens who visits Istanbul and beaches at the south of Turkey with my family at least twice a year and know what I am talking about. I don't know anyone who was in jail but dealt with police a few times and everyone was always nice and very helpful especiallyy to foreigners. 
 This book has been recommended many times and also referenced in many things I have read before.  But truthfully, I purchased it 6 months ago and I just cannot get into it. It's hard to put it into words but it just drags for me and I have not been able to read it.  If and when I ever do, I'll be sure to get back to you 
 I'm a long time fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries, and have read all the others. Unfortunately, "Hard Truth" does not live up to the quality of Ms. Barr's earlier works. It feels very contrived. It also appears to take advantage of stereotypes against religious groups. This book just does not meet the expectations I've come to expect from the series. 
 These are thin solid and dark patties that cook up tasteless, juiceless and unburgerlike in texture.  Completely unlike their advertising and unlike the regular beef patties sold at the supermarket.  I will never buy Omaha Steak products again.  Omaha Steaks' customer representatives are very nice however.  I wrote to them telling them about my experience and they said I could dump the scary meat and they would credit my card.  Thank you very much. 
 This book is a complete joke, the title is a complete misrepresentation of the book's contents.  I've read journal articles that have more information on embedded control than this 200+ page book.    Everything in this book can be gotten from more complete references on control systems, such as Dorf and Bishop's "Modern Control Systems" for starters.  Even Phillips and Nagle's "Digital Control System Analysis and Design" has more information on embedded control when it isn't even the primary focus of their book.     Instead of explaining how to program control systems in C/C++ the author provides a brief overview of control techniques and MatLab code.    The author never actually discusses embedded control which is the title of the book.  The point of the book, and even the title, is supposedly to explain how to control embedded systems with C/C++, yet the author never discusses anything remotely close to this, the closest he ever gets are programs that convert MatLab files to C.  This is completely useless if the author doesn't explain how to use a converted MatLab file on an embedded microcontroller.  The author doesn't even have examples on choosing processors for embedded systems.    Save $70 and put it towards a real controls book.   
  Had for not even a month and when used it broke. Would not recommend 
 I think the music is ok but boring. The musicianship IS decent, but the production sounds very humble and home done on a computer with cheap software. It's interesting to hear the covers one time. I value my listening time and guard it jealously. Who would waste an hour on this when you can be listening to the great Spanish Guitar Masters?  For guitar music that truly captures the heart I'd rather listen to the greats of Flamenco like Paco de Lucia or Manolo San Lucar's Tauromagia for example. This cd pales so horribly IN COMPARISON to the music of the Spanish Masters.  But of course if Rolling Stone says it's good than it must be 
 ... unless you really  want to. And you better have good reasons in that case. I can't imagine what they could be though. If you want to ponder, circa 1988,  the problems facing  U.S. cities, or terrorism, or conspiracy,  you'll not find anything much here. This is Franzen's first book,  written 13 years before the materpice The Corrections (which is why  you're considering this one, right?), and the kid had not yet assembled his talents nor adequately honed his intelligence. Rather than itemize its marginal successes against it's tedious failures, I'm gonna streamline for you: the only reason to give this a workout is to see how much the author, as a storyteller, truthteller, character-meister, has developed since. And that endevour is one of research.  Read The Corrections again instead. Seriously 
      Paul Johnson generally gets short shrift and quick dismissal as that most dreaded of ink-stained commentators - the "popular historian." Suffering from two fatal defects - he suffers from having his books actually purchased and read in significant quantity, and unencumbered by footnotes or academic cant - Johnson is, three dozen books or so later, nonplussed, and certainly undeterred. Instead, Johnson soldiers on in his crusade of churning out crisp, readable and even trenchant history. Generally he hits the mark more often than he misses. A HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY, unfortunately, is largely one of the occasional misses, a misfired product of his youth written (1976) in what must be considered one of the most demoralized and cynical decades in Christianity's history. The resulting book is one very much of its day.   How cynical is A HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY? Johnson, in his preface, has the avowed goal of a history of Christianity with "the requisite degree of historical detachment." At no point does Johnson spell out what this degree is or if it is even measurable. Nonetheless, he certainly believed it to be attainable. Johnson, an avowed Catholic, achieves it by a searching and relentless hermeneutic of suspicion towards nearly all comers, but most especially his own church. "Nearly all" - but there are exceptions, for Johnson's narrative leaves no doubt who its heroes are and who resides in the rogue's gallery. And it is in both classifications that the reader gathers a clear sense of Johnson's brand of Christianity - and an uneven (at best) historical detachment. That brand is, inescapably, Erasmian.  In this regard it is worth noting that while Erasmus does not make his appearance until the opening of Chapter 5 ("The Third Force," devoted to the Renaissance and the Reformation), he provides not only only the glue for the entire chapter but the entire work. Johnson's sympathies are not only evident in the disproportionate treatment given to the Dutch humanist - over a dozen continuous pages, to contrast with, say, the two given to Calvin, the few sentences given to Athanasius, Anselm, Aquinas or Zwingli, and the lack of any mention at all of Kierkegaard, Unamuno, or Bunyan - but in the effusive manner in which Erasmian themes come to dominate analyses of crucial episodes throughout Christian history. An Erasmian theology "reduced to the bare minimum" finds little to praise in "the constant and depressing inflation in the vocabulary of invective" (p. 51) of the Church Fathers; the "parasitical" unproductivity of monasticism; the scholasticism, high, midddle or low of the High Middle Ages; the "confident dogmatism" of Calvin and Luther and their successors; but plenty for Pelagius in his doomed battle with Augustine - apparently the chief of Johnson's villains - and John Locke's religious minimalism. Locke and Erasmus, Johnson says, get to "the heart of the problem. What matters is not so much what a man believes as what he does. Christianity is about morals, not dogma" (p.338). From this premise most of Johnson work flows, and only in passing does Johnson hint at the possible vulnerabilities of this approach - Christianity at risk, he faintly concedes, to easily lose its Christian character completely "and topple over into mere deism" (p. 340). Passe Leo Strauss (or at least his popular caricature), Johnson's ideal Christianity is one that makes for well-behaved and productive citizens. "It helps to cage the beast," Johnson avers (p. 517). Which is to say, very Lockean of him.  Such a narrative requires a certain selectivity in treatment, but Johnson's story leaves surprisingly large swaths of Christianity untouched or barely grazed. The virtually nonexistent attention given to Christian history in the developing world is bad enough if tolerable given its marginality to the core of the faith's identity during much of its development. Less escusable is the scanty treatment given to the critical role of the Eastern Churches, which more or less disappear from view even well before the Great Schism. Likewise striking are the large gaps in Protestant history, especially of evangelical movements in the U.S. Johnson's is less a History of Christianity than A History of West European Christianity.   Nevertheless, there are glimmers of the old Johnson fire which no doubt form much of the attraction the book has had over the last three decades. Crackling, even astute observations pepper the work. Not the least of which is the concluding paragraph, which for all its Erasmian language is inescapably skeptical of the alternative: "Certainly, mankind without Christianity conjures up a dismal prospect. The record of mankind *with* Christianity is daunting enough...In the last generation, with public Christianity in headlong retreat, we have caught our first, distant view of a de-Christianized world, and it is not encouraging." While it is likely that A HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY would be a different work if Johnson wrote it today, three decades of de-Christianization in Western Europe have lent an undeniable force to Johnson's observation 
 Gerrold and Niven are both excellent SF writers.  I usually enjoy their books, and both have built up large and high-quality bodies of work.  That's why the badness of "Flying Sorcerers" is so baffling.  It's like they banged this out in a weekend on a bet.  Much is made of the alleged humor of this novel.  Fannish jokes and puns belong at Worldcon, not in a book put out for sale to the general public.  Their humor value fails to rise over the level of Granpa's thighslappers.  For example, two young alien boys who build a flying machine are called "Wilville" and "Orbur."  Ho, ho.  My sides!  And the gags go downhill from there.  So why 2 stars instead of one?  Despite all of its flaws, this is still an amiable book.  "Ringworld Throne" aside, both Niven and Gerrold have enough talent to make this book at least somewhat interesting, and to keep the thin plot moving.  If you're interested in these authors, and you should be, pick out almost anything from their extensive catalogs before you purchase this 
 Check out my review of Wicked (which I also translated) to find out what I thought about it. Well, this is even worse: either Maguire totally lacks the narrative skills to capture the reader's attention, or he doesn't believe it his duty to do so. This deadly bore of a sequel has even less action than the first book, and reads like its author takes it for granted that the public will worship him no matter what. An increasingly uninteresting sequence of petty events, here and there interrupted - just like in Wicked - by the usual aimless and self-complacent blabber, all set in a fictional universe that Maguire doesn't seem to feel the need to develop in any depth. Not to mention his pathetic puns (Liir/leer, "which nation"/"witch nation", "leaf and limb, laugh and lamb, loaf and loam", the title of the book itself) and his unbelievable pretentiousness: someone should definitely tell him that writing "he riposted" instead of "he replied", "succor" instead of "help", "dale" instead of "valley", or "lave" instead of "wash", doesn't make you a great novelist. As a side note, I know of people who read Wicked in Italian and loved it: best for them. I made it clear to the publisher that I'd rather stop working for them altogether than translate the dreaded third novel, or anything else by Maguire 
 Funny how people always vote a review to be "not helpful" when the reviewer expresses an opinion the voter doesn't like...  If you are a mickey d's binger who gets pissed off when people expose the fact that their food is utter garbage (or, if you are a Mc-Exec), you'll automatically hate my review or any others like mine.  But if you're here to really see what someone who hasn't been mc-brainwashed, hopefully this review will help you.   This book tells an accurate tale of the solely profit-focused means by which mcdonald's has grown into the fast food empire it is today.  Sure, it's a capitalistic wet dream.  But what this book doesn't cover is how Mickey-D's exloits workers, vales corporate profits over franchise success, and feeds people McGarbage that can't even be called food, all without being honest about its products or practices.  I'm sure devoted McEaters and McCapitalists will trounce my 1-star rating & review, but that really just proves my point.  Read this book.  But if you care to know the WHOLE story, be sure to also read something presenting another view - such as Fast Food Nation 
 I should start by saying I am a big Clive Cussler fan and have read all his books.  The only ones I have not enjoyed are the two Oregon Files ones.  There are so many characters I could not remember who was who without having to keep looking at the cast list at the front.  I reached the point of not caring anyway and just kept reading to get to the end.  The whole thing reads like a Mission Impossible TV episode but nowhere near as good or exciting.  The scenes in the UK were very sloppy; there are no such things as pound notes and the beefeaters actually guard the Tower of London not Buckingham Palace.  I can only hope that it is Craig Dirgo that is the problem and that when the next Oregon Files book comes out written by Jack DuBrul (who I am a great fan of in his own right) that things will improve 
 Rosemary Wells' book entitled Felix Feels Better is one of our family's new favorites.  I went to the book store seeking out more of her books.  I thumbed through this one and thought it looked really cute so I bought it.  It wasn't until I got home that I read the phrase, "Nora!" said her sister, "Why are you so dumb?" repeated several times in the book.  Name calling of any kind is not practiced in our house and I was disappointed to find this in the book.  This is also not a book that my son's teacher would read in class for the same reason.  I will be returning it to the book store.  Very disappointing 
 Let's consider 'Why Not Me' a trial run for Al Franken's better written follow-up 'Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them.'  All of Franken's work bears the hallmarks of his sketch comedy background - it's an ensemble of pieces, some of which work, some of which don't.  In 'Lies,' roughly 80% or more of the pieces hit the mark (I wasn't a fan of the cartoons).  In 'Why Not Me,' it's about 50%.  Like the Bob Woodward parody ('The Void'), for example: funny for about the first five pages (you laugh when you see Franken's nailed Woodward's melodramatic scene-setting and habit of assembling conversations as if he were in the room).  But it drags on and on.  How many readers got though the whole piece?  Not many I bet.  Like others, I agree that the campaign diary worked the best, followed closely by the faux Newsweek piece - the classic campaign shot of Franken chopping wood with Golden Retriever at his side is a howler.  Talk about spot-on.  I think the best part of the entire book is the 'one issue' campaign (elimination of ATM Fees) and how Candidate Franken steers all discussion back to that point.  Watching both Bush and Kerry try to route every question back to stump speech set pieces makes you realize that there's sometimes a fine line between parody and reality.   
 This boys' adventure, republished by Tor in a hardbound edition, was published in 1948 and was one of Robert Heinlein's first books. Set several hundred years into the future, the solar system has been colonized on one of Jupiter's moons and on Venus, where beneath the clouds the air is breathable and intelligent life was discovered. Keeping the peace is the Solar Patrol, whose atomic bombs circle the earth while its members continue exploring the planets, moons and asteroids.  "Space Cadet" follows the journey of Matthew Brooks of Des Moines, Iowa, and his friends Tex, Oscar and Pierre (from Texas, Venus and Jupiter's moon), through their education at the Space Academy, finishing up with an adventure when their ship runs into trouble during a mission to Venus. Heinlein spends the first hundred pages moving them through this world — the patrol bears significant resemblance to the U.S. Navy — then puts them onboard a ship for about the next 50 pages before bringing in a story.   There are a couple sections that shows themes Heinlein will explore in future novels. There's the wide gulf between the civilian and military worlds, that Matt discovers when he tries to explain how the atomic bombs circling the earth — ready to be dropped down the gravity well on any city that gets uppity — are maintained. This leads to some bizarre lines such as "Now, Catherine, you can't imagine Matt bombing Des Moines, now can you? And that is what it amounts to. Tell her, Matt."  So far adult readers, "Space Cadet" brings with it the charm of "Golden Age" science-fiction: the finned rockets, the elite space organization and a few aliens thrown into the mix. Heinlein nails portable phones, but computers are room-sized and rockets land on their tail. In his perfectly run Solar Patrol, he includes officers from all races (even a black officer is mentioned, but not seen), and yet the patrol is firmly phallocentric.  As for children, "Space Cadet" is pretty bland stuff. To children brought up on Harry Potter, video games and anime, "Space Cadet" is more likely to induce eye-rolling than a sense of wonder 
 This band is one of the reasons rock is dying. well i take that back. rock is dying and these simple [...] are pulling on the chord of the life support system. this sound is nothing new and at times sounds melodic and painful. this cd makes me want to punch myself in the head for wasting my time listening to it. 
 We bought this camera two years ago.  We have loved using it, until last week.  The camera showed an "E18" error in the middle of a special event.  We researched the error online and found that almost anything can cause this error, from turning the camera off while it has a low battery to having something in front of the lens while turning it on.  We're not sure how ours developed the E18 (never dropped or damaged.) Our camera has been rendered useless and Canon's only response it to have us mail it in for $100 repair 
 I love Judith Mcnaught's work.  Her historicals are stellar one-of-kind novels that pull at your heart strings.  In my opinion all of her historicals are winners.  SOME of her contemporary works are fabulous as well - Perfect and Paradise to name a few.  There are other contemporary flops though (Remember When, Triumphant Heart, etc).  Every Breath You Take was such a disappointment.  The plot, character development, and writing was not up to par. I found it very hard to believe that a couple could fall in love in 2 days, be separated for two years and then fall back in love instantly upon meeting again.  It was really forced.  Someone mentioned it was "amatuerish" and I have to agree.  I think anyone could have written this novel.  I understand that the book was rushed, and to tell you the truth it reads like a novel that was written in a mad dash.  I love Judith but this book was just terrible 
 Fugazi is so bad it hurts, I've never liked them because they can't sing and their music is just plain boring. These guys are so old its funny, whoever takes this band seriously is an idiot. 
 i hated these shakers. i got them as a gift and 1. they are too big and take up too much space and 2. the rubber stoppers were not a tight fit so the salt and pepper was always leaking out the bottom and 3. the holes in the top are too big and too much comes out at once. finally one broke and i was thrilled to toss them out. the other, smaller fiesta ware ones -- the round ones -- are much much better 
 This book is basically a magazine article that has been expanded to fill out an entire book (this has been noted by others) Anything of interest is said in the first chapter, followed by a lot of fluff - "sometimes the crowd is wise" "sometimes the crowd is not wise".  After the first chapter, I seriously couldn't read for more than 10 minutes without getting bored 
 Peter Fonda and Kurt Russell surfing a wave down a Los Angeles reservoir is not cool, does not make this movie worth a look, good God, that scene stinks. P-U. Campy. This movie is a mess. A horribly made sequel. So bad it actually tarnishes the reputation of the original 
 Zane Hodges attacks the Word of God and those who hold to the true message of salvation with heated rhetoric and laughable "logic."  It is sad that so many are accepting his watered-down gospel and the  easy-believism that is completely insufficient for salvation.  In every  case in which the Bible indicates the necessity of obedience as the fruit  of true salvation, Mr. Hodges inevitably begs the question at stake.  He  always confuses the results of salvation with the requirements for  salvation and uses a completely malformed argument to "prove" his  point.  This book promotes a dangerous heresy and will surely lead its  believers astray 
 the case did fit the player very well and did excellent in protecting it, but... 1. you have to remove the player to charge because the charger isnt that small, leaving scratch marks on the zen 2. it is kinda bulky, cant fit in any pockets 3. must remove the zen if you want to use the microphone feature  i just bought the silicone case with screen protectors, works just as good, doesnt leave scratch marks, much much smalle 
 I read the book, New Faces, hoping for an intelligent look into the  way people view themselves as being multiracial. "Dr." Loretta Winters appears to be one of the worst, most absent minded speakers on the subject. Her writting is horrible and I believe that she lied about having a Ph.D and about being Biracial. Her own psychological state of mind is clearly unstable and unhealthy and I think she needs to seek some counseling for playing this sick game on humanity. This is one of the worst looks at being multiracial. I found the book to be unclear and came off like a drunkards rambles. I pity the soul that ever come across this and her repetive, condescending overtones. I am multiracial and offended at how she writes that we are all the same. 
 This book is basically Marxist view of art, and what art is intended to accomplish.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing!  It does help you to examine your assumptions and beliefs a bit, and that's one of the things an education is supposed to do.  The book repeatedly hammers the idea that art serves the purposes of the ruling class.  This is beat upon to the point of tediousness.  There is also a chapter that can be summarized as "art serves the purposes of powerful men by trivializing women and encouraging them to think of themselves as an object d'art for the viewing pleasure of others.  Oddly enough, the book didn't really return to this them in the final essay when it talked about the visual image in advertising.  That's an arena where visual imagery is used to play on the insecurities of everyone, but especially women, to convince them that they are flawed and need __(fill in the name of a product)____ to be happy and respected and glamorous. Speaking of which, one of the more interesting points in the book (even though I believe it is flat wrong) is the discussion of the rise of "glamor" as a desirable trait.  I found the book interesting, and it irritated me, but only in a good way--By making me think about my views.  But it really is written from the perspectives of a trendy liberal from the early 1970s.  Instead of closing with a powerful message summarizing some important aspect of art that we have been taught, the authors even use the final paragraph of the last essay to point out that capitalism exploits the masses and coerces them to ignore their own best interest(that's literally what it says!).  Probably worth reading, but not a high priority.  The Penguin edition is compact and affordable, but the B&W images are so small that much of the value of the work is lost--You can't see details of the art being reproduced 
 i wish going to usa to be with my brother hosa 
 I've read all but "A Christmas Carol" in this edition. I've found several typos. Moreover, the binding is becoming unglued. I estimate by the time I finish "A Christmas Carol" the binding will be totally exposed. I value permanent books (otherwise I would buy paperbacks). I suggest anyone who enjoys Dickens buy a better edition 
 I bought this dvd for my 6 month old daughter Sophie, after having purchased some of the Baby Einstein Dvd's including Baby Mozart.  I wanted my daughter to know God and his Word early on even if only in a small way at first.  She loves the Baby Mozart so naturally I thought they would be similar.  She watches the God made me for about ten minutes and then becomes bored and dissatisfied.  That really disappointed me because she will watch a baby einstein movie the whole way through which is about 30 minutes.  I also watched this movie myself and while the narrator would say "On the 1st day God made the heaven and the earth" then it would show a bunch of random images and pictures that had nothing at all to do with the fact that on the 1st day God made the heavens and the earth.  All in all I was not impressed at all and will not buy another baby faith dvd.  I am planning to test out the baby miracle and some other brands to see how they go over.  As for this one, I will sell it on ebay.  Hope this helpe 
 I got this potty for my baby shower.  I registered for it because it was Safety first and most of their products are excellent.  I set it out to introduce it to my son( he was just beginning to show interest not ready to actually start yet).  We never actually used it since the top of the seat and I mean the entire top kept falling off even with nobody sitting on it.  Even if you just moved the potty it would fall apart. Instead we bought a plain potty seat by Graco and it is excellent! 
 On the advertisement, these sandals were shown in green.  If they were available in green, I would be interested.  Please advise.  Thank 
 This is by far the worst hoover cleaner I have ever owned and I have had many over a long time span. After ten minutes or so the broom motor heats up and you have to wait at least twenty minutes for it to cool down so you can start using it again. I have never had this happen with any other Hoover electric broom, so I called Hoover and they said that this model is only meant to be used 20 MINUTES PER WEEK and only for quick pickups. No where does their literature say this on the box or in the manual inside the box. This product is a completely useless item if you want to use it on a daily basis. I purchased it for bare floors, not carpet, yet it has a rolling brush for carpet use. The box says is provides "effective carpet and bare flooring cleaning, " but they don't tell you it can only be used for 20 minutes a week as I was told by their customer service rep. Poor product from a company I always trusted 
 I have a hard time understanding what it is that I dislike about the novel. I dislike it almost as much as the movie. I have been a loyal follower of Smiley and some more after that. Once the Cold War was over, JlC had to look for a new realm. I tried to follow him, but gave up with the Kaukasian troubles, forgot the name of the book. Maybe it is this: JlC's trade mark, his USP, is the evilness of the other side. With the KGB & Co., that worked perfectly. His readers were willing to stay with him and believe him. Now he is transferring the KGB style to all sorts of other badies. I think it does not work any more. It is not that I trust the pharmaceutical companies enough to not be like here insinuated. I do not. What I do not like, I guess, is the artificial mood of intellectual suffering from the evilness of all kind of conspiracies. Tess in this story seems to be the normal do-gooder who falls foul with the baddies. That is more ok in the book than in the movie. (There, for my eyes, Rachel Weisz does herself discredit.) What is absolutely not ok is the surrender of command by the narrator mid way. JlC gives up on trying to keep a believable storyline and declines into darkest conspiracy allegations 
 I just rented this movie this weekend because so many people had been telling me that it was great.  But I felt kind of let down after watching it.  It starts of well by giving the characters a brief introduction, but we really don't get to know any of them that well, except maybe Kurt Russell, so who really cares who dies?  There's no real build up to the huge wave hitting the ship; everything is fine, then the captain tells everyone to be quiet and listen, Richard Dreyfuss looks outside, and the wave hits; it's not all that intense. Then the rest of the movie is the main characters trying to find a way to get outside the ship.  But it gets kind of repetetive and boring, because they just go from one room to another.  It's like they get into one room, someone says "Here, this is the only way out."  Someone else says that maybe there's another way, but the other person says there isn't, then the water's coming, so they have to get out of that room quickly.  When they make their way into the next room, it's the same thing over and over again. When they finally get off of the ship, they get into a raft and the entire ship goes down right after they get off.  Then a guy shoots a flare, helicopters come, and the movie's over. So basically, this movie gets boring and repetetive and you just keep asking yourself when it will be over.  This is one movie I know I won't be buying 
 I am appalled that the publishers continue to pimp these books to lovers of Lillian Jackson Braun.  When you read these past few books, you are gradually disappointed more and more--and this one is the worst of the bunch.  I found the style annoying.  The book skims through the story.  It is sorely lacking in the rich details and characterizations that made the first 20 books so enjoyable.  When I finished this book--so short that it took me less than an hour and a half--I threw it across the room and into the trash.  What a waste of time and money.  There is no ending, the plot has promise--but is never explored in any quality or depth.  I think Quill should have eloped with Violet and ditched Platonic Prozac Polly and her evenings of sheer boredom. He needs a passionate affair--how long has he been in this sad relationship? The most interesting characters were ignored or forgotten.  I am done with this series.  I will just reread the first 20 and mourn what might have been.. 
 The Diamond in the Bronx is a verryy ticky book. It leads you to believe that it's all about the Yankee's and the stadium; the history behind it. When really it's ALLL about politics. The first couple chapters are interesting because they have history on how Dodger Walter O'Malley had his desire to build the Yankee stadium. The book then goes into detail on how the stadium affects the politics of New York. Making it complicated for race and wealth to be apart of the stadium, since the stadium was located in the Bronx; one of the boroughs that have more ethnic people rather than caucasians. It was also a question that if the stadium was taking money from "more important things" like transportation, and city neecessities. If you're more of a baseball, stadium fan, this book in not for you, however, if you are a politics fan, GET THIS BOOK!!! 
 There are no new concepts put forth in this book, and worse, it's filled with painful stabs at humor, practically worthless information (most of which seemingly to get the reader from one picture to the next).  I just don't think many people realize that Meadows has rewritten existing ideas as little "revelations" he has had himself, and so, I advise any prospective shoppers to move on, look toward online journals or monthly magazines in this field (like Speculative Reviews of Narrative, etc).  There's nothing to see here 
 I am a great fan of R.A. Salvatore, but this book is a disappointment. It starts off very well, only to die out in the middle. Salvatore does a great job of building up events to epic proportions, only to have an anticlimactic ending. For the rest of the book we plod along looking into Enteri's past. It could have been interesting, but it was too slow and drawn out. Maybe it was just out of place in this book. And don't even get me started about the strange handling of the love interest! Oh well, I guess you can't knock them all out of the park 
 My son got this for his 4th birthday.  Moon Sand is a terrible toy--ugly and messy.  He seemed to enjoy playing with it (but no more than Play Doe), but the clean up is horrible.  The sand stuck to the treads of his shoes and was tracked throughout the house.  
 I never received my order thanks alot, os I finally give up and canceled my order. I will never order from you again... Laura Doughert 
 I really didn't enjoy this piece. I had to read it for school. I complained alot every night I had to read it. It is really very confusing and I think that the overall book was pretty horible. It was probably on the list of the top ten books that I DIDN'T like. Others may have different feelings but I really didn't like it at all. 
 Or write.  Or, for that matter, think critically on the key issues of the day---wealth creation, unemployment, the war against folks who want to commandeer 747s and crash them into skyscrapers.   It is a Serious time, an age of great peril for our country, for our democracy, and for liberty in the world. It is a time for Serious men, with Serious ideas.  Sadly, Moore is not one of them.   Now: Michael Moore presents himself as the Angry Wild Man of the Left: brave, ferocious, caustic, intellectually independent, bound and beholden to no one---asking the questions that need to be asked, dammit, and the Devil take the hindmost!   What this self-anointed Crusader of the Common Man has produced is another story entirely: a kind of Populist Leftism for Dummies, written in crayon and featuring giganto-font type with SUPER-SIZED margins (evidently for the remedial reader, who would be content with pictures)---which ain't the only thing Super-Sized about this penny-dreadful.   And dreadful it is.   Moore's unfunny screen amounts to this: Bush is evil, capitalism is evil, the System is evil, it's all a bunch of nasty white men in suits who plot to send low-income young Americans to death and dismemberment in the sands of Iraq while Bush and Bin Laden hob-nob it over caviar back at the ranch in Crawford.   And that's about it: which is saying a lot, really all you can fit in a "book" half eaten up by blank space and margins.   The truth is, everyone knows a Michael Moore: he's the cabdriver from Hell, who picks you up at Newark and launches into a 20-minute harangue---with you, the helpless captive audience, sealed off behind dirty plexi-glass, trapped like a crazed weasel in a steel coffin hurtling along the New Jersey Turnpike at 90 miles an hour---a frothy, spittle-spewing sermon about how filthy New York is, how corrupt the politicians are, how things would be different if somebody took the "Man" down.   He's the slobby sales guy who gets in two hours late every day, and leaves well before 4:00---and who holds court at the water cooler, letting you know how many deals he would be locking down if only Management---you know, dude, the "Man"---would get its sh*t together.   He's like a shabbier, slightly psychotic, downscale version of Uncle Buck, who pops in for the holiday unexpected and clogs up the toilet.   So if "Dude" is meant as humor, it falls flat: the writing is stale, shrill, and strident, the sort of thing the mean local drunk spits out after a wild Night Train bender. Nah, this isn't humor: it's pure political invective, meant to elicit a "Preach it, Brother!" from its target audience.  But it's a little tough for Joe Six-Pack---Moore's intended reader, evidently---struggling to pay off his cable bills, fretting about the wife having to work graveyards, wondering how he's going to afford medical care---to yell "Preach it, Brother Moore!" from the sidelines, even as Brother Moore is preaching it from the back of a stretch limousine. Or a super-duper-stretch, in Moore's case.  And frankly, that's not even the saddest part of this walking affront to decency: I am certain that beneath all the calculated bluster and outrage, Moore doesn't believe a word he writes.   Moore spouts rebellion, civil unrest, rage against the Machine: he talks a good game.   But let's face it: the only street-theater he sits up late at night planning are midnight raids against the local, hapless In-and-Out Burger. Like PT Barnum, Moore is relentless, tireless self-promoter: he's hungry---he needs to feed!---and like the fat dorky kid in the back row in that political science class, he'll say anything to get attention.  The worst of it is really this: Ideas---however incoherent---have Consequences. Moore's greatest crime with "Dude, Where's my Country?" isn't his banality, nor even his delight at reducing the most complex social problems to lowest common denominator insults---nor even his lack of seriousness.   It's that Moore is deeply disingenuous. Take his contention, written with utmost condescension, that his readers will never be rich. No chance. No way, not in America!   That's not just wrong: it's deeply dangerous. If anything, Moore himself is proof of the American dream: a scruffy, uneducated, possibly unhinged refrigerator of a man, who went out into the jungles of corporate america with some cheap movie equipment and made some snarkily funny documentaries. Who plugged into the Zeitgeist of the age, who made one barbaric yawp after another, and got attention.   And made millions.   Now: the real conclusion from "Dude" should be---if Michael Moore can do it, my God---so can I!  Instead, we get whiney finger-pointing: it's the Man's fault you're living hard, eating catfood, and begging for spare change. It's not *you*, not your responsibility: the System did it, Dude.   Sartre once summed up his philosophy of existentialism by saying that Man should live so as not to contribute to the suffering. Moore takes the opposite tack: he's like Samara, the creepy-crawly little dead girl from the well in Ring: he never sleeps, he never stops, he'll never stop eating, and as a result---at least, without a damned good editor---he'll never stop spewing.   So is it too much to hope for that Moore, who can be a prodigiously talented, incandescently cynical filmmaker, when he wants to be---is it too much to ask that he will one day put his abilities to good use, really lay down a wicked little polemic that sets out a true battle plan for change?   Fat chance.  JS 
 This book is a compilation of stuff that is readily available on the net. There is not any new, groundbreaking or special advice contained within.I feel that anyone with internet access could have written this book within just a few days 
 This was the movie that gave us The Brat Pack, a staple of a certain 80s cultural set.  The term Brat Pack was derived from an article writen by a journalist out one night with most of the men starring in St. Elmo's Fire on a boozy night of partying.  Since then the gals in the movie as well as a few others who weren't in the movie (Anthony Michael Hall, for example) suffered a bit of a ripple effect.  Here we will see all of them at their prime and at their peak of heart throb success on every teenage girl's bedroom wall.  Out of all the dramedies of the John Hughes movies, this was the one I liked the least.  Maybe it was the fact that all the characters were so vain and self centered.  Maybe it was the fact that it was all so idealized seeing all of them trying to adjust to their lives after graduating college.  It was trying to be the next generation "Graduate" movie, and I didn't relate when my time came.  Maybe it had to do with the fact that I have been let down by many people and didn't have that network of friends in similar situations, and the isolation I felt during that first year adjusting to the outside world having left the nest of academia.  I guess I was just a little more bitter.  Plus, as my life was surrounded by work and little else, I didn't have all the dramas going on they did.  That was kind of sad, the one scene where Rob Lowe goes back to his old frat house and they tell him they need someone like him to couch their team.  It proves you really can't go home again and there are some clinging to the past.  Not to mention embarrassing with that one gal who has managed to hold onto her virginity for so long and in one of the attempts to releive her of it Rob Lowe finds those enormous granny panties.    This caputed more of a time in fashion and music than it did a mindset.  It's not a bad story, but the vain and self centered antics of the main characters left me cold.    
 This book disappointed me.  I hoped a good overview but this only just repeated the RFCs without value added.  Anyway it is useful for an  introduction if your expectations are low 
      What a drag it was to read this shoddy & superficial book.  I kept waiting for it to get better, but alas, I was cheated. Shame on me. At least I didn't spend any money on it as it was a public library book. For a deep & thoughtful analysis of George's music, read "While My Guitar Gently Weeps:The Music Of George Harrison" by Simon Leng. Mr. Leng is a scholar who appreciates good music and artists of integrity, unlike so many hacks posing as journalists & authors these days 
 I loved this bra when I first got it a year ago.  It gave me great support, it looked great and I was the happiest with a bra that I have ever been.  My girls are in the F range so it has been difficult to find the right size.  A year later, the girls are headed south and the bra has no support left in it.  I am really disappointed in the quality after paying almost $70 for one bra.  They are on a great product if it could stand the longevity of time.  One year just doesn't work for me.  
 I love history and political science but couldn't quite make my way through this one.  Make sure you have the option of returning this one if you buy it 
 The book tells you that friendships at work are good.  That's it.  The author doesn't address when those friendships over take the workplace and what to do when the workpplace is the only friendships people have.  The author also doesn't address the issue of diversity.  It is large type and double spaced - it is a waste of your money.  If you are a fan of the information from the Gallop Organization, you are going to be very disappointed 
 I happen to think that "Funcrusherplus" may be the best hip-hop album ever. For those of you who are fans of Company Flow, the "Little Johnny From..." album, will be a huge disappointment. For those of you wanting to MC, pick it up and get some good beats. Don't waste you time other wise. Without the tight lyrics from El-P and Bigg Jus the album is nothing more then a reminder that Co. Flow has a strong original sound. Don't waste your money, get something you'll actually listen to 
 ...but I have to agree with the other reviewers who said that the recipes fall short. Many of them sound absolutely delicious, but I have found many errors and in recipes where there are no obvious errors, I often have to make adjustments to the seasonings or ingredients (for example, I made the Lemon Tahini Sauce tonight to go with the baked Falafel Balls...the falafel balls recipes is missing a step, and the lemon tahini sauce calls for way, way too much tahini and the end product is not what the recipe describes. I could fix both mistakes, but I shouldn't have to).  I wish they would do some heavy revising to this cookbook, because it has so much promise.  
 I did not enjoy reading the book, A Gathering of Days. The entire book uses odd phrasology that detracts from the overall effect of the story. The word choices throughout the book make it very difficult to read and understand. The story is fine in and of itself but I was unable to enjoy the story because of the heavy word usage and poor sentence structures 
 On the most fundamental level, i.e.,a sexual/semi-erotic level, L'Ennui most definitely has its moments. As a total film, however, it stutters more than a few times. Technically, the subtitles occasionally flash too fast or are offered with no contrast so they become almost unreadable. The camerawork is quite good, however, with a definite European style. The story itself is also intriguing, but once the point is made,it has nowhere to go. The problems begin with the actors and plot. Not that the actors were bad; they were actually very good. But you understand from minute one that Martin isn't wrapped too tightly (his treatment of a fan, for example, early on), so his bizarre behavior once he meets Cecelia isn't surprising in the least. More simply, the guy evinces no sympathy in the least from the viewer; none. He's a complete ass. He comes off as needy, selfish and egomaniacial, one of those boors who are so deeply personally insecure they become outwardly obnoxious and nasty to hide it from everyone. You really don't care what ultimately happens to him, and also understand that if he did get what he wanted in the film, he would immediately reject it once he did, just to be hurtful. Cecilia, the more you get to know her, is just as bad in another way. She doesn't come off as stupid (as someone else said)or obtuse, but as almost totally uncaring and unfeeling, not to mention far more immature than her few years. She simply does whatever she wants whenever she can without a lot of regard of how it can hurt or affect people. She understands how they can feel things, but unless it touches her directly and negatively, doesn't really care. Look at how she regarded her father. All in all, it's hard to feel sympathy for her as well. She's not opaque but almost completely transparent. And to say the film's point was hammered home way too long or that the ending was ridiculously abrupt is putting it mildly. 
 I purchased this book while taking an Intro to Java class thinking it was a Java programming book; it is not. While I will probably find it useful if ever I decide to start building web pages using Java applets for fun, it is definitely not for anyone looking to learn or understand Java PROGRAMMING. From this purchase, I have definitely learned the hard way to read all of the REVIEWS prior to purchasing any books.   Also, using the "Search Inside" tool (when available) to view the table of contents and the copyright date are a MUST for purchasing any future books!! I have used this function for several books and have been able to make better, more informed choices based on that information. If you have not used the "Search Inside" tool, I highly recommend doing so on your next purchase 
 The title grabbed me because I have been noticing for, oh about 14 years now, the decline of the truth in this country.  Unfortunately, this book is written precisely by the kind of person who has lost touch with reality and what truth is (definition of irony I believe).  The reason it is #1 on the bestseller list is because there is a ready audience out there, of similarly detached people, who want anything (and I mean anything - a website with a good conspiracy story and a glass of warm milk before bed everynight is their ideal) that backs up their point of view.    It is precisely why the truth is so out of fashion.  New media streams like the internet, blogs, etc. offer up "news" without accountability.  They allow this segment of society to avoid confronting the truth and instead construct their own alternative realities.  It makes people like Frank Rich, rich, with very little effort.  Why bother checking facts, his core readership doesn't care whether it is true or not, just tell them Bush is evil 
 I have read all buy 1, and felt this was the weakest.  It was still good, but lacked in a lot of ways.... 
 This BP Monitor was accurate for about the first 2 weeks of use. BP from monitor checked closely with manual BP. After the first 2 weeks, got very inaccurate results dispite replacing the batteries. I can not rely on this monitor for my patient's B/P results 
 This book was a gift and that is the only reason i am not returning it.  The story is bizarre, which in and of itself is not bad but this is...bad.  Luckily my daughter found it as painful as i did to read.  Zero appeal on any level.  If you want great bizarre try "Heedly pecked me in the eye"! 
 What a load of turnspeak.  G. Orwell (deceased 
 Francis Ford Coppola should not be listed as an author of this book.  I bought it because I thought Copppla was one of the authors.  He is quoted in the book but he did not write it.  I think this is misleading to  readers 
 White-washed with a heavy coat of feminist wistfull thinking, "Missing Mary" is a New Age fictional concoction at best and outright heresy at worst.  Spretnak blatantley lies when she states that Mary's presense in Catholic theology has been "played down" from the pulpit by decree of Vatican II.  Never has the church made any official statement that Marian statues were to be removed from churches and that prayer to Mary and the Rosary be given a kind of Protestant-like boot out the door.  One need only look at the papacy of John Paul II and his devotion to the Blessed Mother to see that Spretnak's assumptions are completely false.  Pope John Paul even put "M" in his coat of arms to represent Mary and he credits her with saving his life after the assassination attempt on his life.  While Spretnak was "missing Mary" in her particular church there were plenty of other churches where Marian devotions continued unabated.  Too bad she never found one, but it does not justify her shoddy research and false accusations.  Spretnak quotes theologically fuzzy Catholics like Matthew Fox and Andrew Greeley and she constantly slams Cardinal Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI) in the typical liberal dissendent-catholic manner.    But it's when Spretnak starts to ascribe pagan "Goddess" qualities to Mary that she goes out on a limb and saws it off.  Never in the church's history has Mary been portrayed as a goddess, a near-goddess or "the Goddess."  She is Theotokis, the "light bearer" meaning that she carried the light (Jesus Christ) in her womb.  Mary is the Mother of the Church, given to the Church by Christ as he was being crucified ("Son, behold your Mother").  She is the Ark of the New Covenant and she leads her children to Christ as any good mother does, but she is not a Goddess to be worshipped and the church has never taught that she should be worshipped, only venerated because she is the first Christian and a perfect Christian.  Mary was never GONE from the Church. She doesn't have to make a COMEBACK. Mary was never minimalized or whatever cockamaymie words Spretnak uses.   
 Ripping off King, but with more sex, shallower characters, and a Hollywood ending. Leave it on the shelf 
       This book encourages purity and respect in a relationship and that's great.  It discourages casual dating and takes getting to know each other seriously.  Good.  It also encourages not rushing into marriage and benefits of waiting (but, uh, disregard that Mrs. Ludy was only 18 when the couple married).      But beyond that, there's a lot of problems.  This book is the view of ONE COUPLE.  If you're looking for a perfect formula for a relationship, there isn't one.  Different people will have different "love stories," and the book is mostly personal example from the Ludys--very subjective stuff!      Serious warning for those who don't like gooey romance:  this book will give you sugar shock with its cotton-candy fluff speech.  If you want to read about being a "princess of purity" as you "give God the pen of your life" (um, God is in control of the universe, He already HAS the "pen") this cutesy, fluffy book will be a treat for you.  If you're a little less into that sort of thing, as I am, you'll be raising a brow.      The Ludys' personal, subjective account is not an "ultimate approach" that can apply to anyone.  Even in godly relationships there will still be problems and hurts.  The ultimate approach to your personal life is going to be unique.  Study God's Word and walk with Him.  
 I cancelled my subscription to this magazine 6 months ago with a letter to the editor stating that I loved to see nude woman, but subscribed to learn from the masters about photography.  I cannot tell you how disappointed I was when I resubscribed after not taking the magazine for years... it used to be a wonderful magazine chock full of insightful articles, lighting techniques, studio setup diagrams, lots of great stuff... I subscribed to a 2 year deal through an online subscriber and asked them to quit sending it after only 6 months and to keep the money.    Not worth the paper it is printed on- period.  Apeture I hear is pretty good, and I also hear Popular Photography has gotten much better and now only 95% about advertising and product reviews and at least 5% helpful tips and tricks.. 
 I purchased this book hoping to get some deeper understanding of risk (e.g., approaches for measuring risk, how to quantify risk.)  This book was way too high level to achieve that goal.  It is a quick read with lots of case examples that would be helpful if you're giving someone a high level overview of Risk Management.  However, if you want to understand these topics at a slightly detailed level or deeper, you should probably look at the more text book style books on risk management 
 I have placed the order on Oct 9th for $114.95, now on Nov 10th Amazon is asking me to approve my revised order again for $125.95. I made a mistake when I should have ordered directly from folica I could have used it for a month now! The 1 star rating has nothing to do with the product quality, since I have not used it.  
 I ordered 2 of these flimsy tables.  They were not only expensive to ship, but one arrived damaged.  The one that was not damaged in transit would not even open fully, meaning that people's drinks would slide off the table.  These are the most flimsy tables I have ever encountered. If it weren't for the replacement tables I found at costco, the party I planned would have been a disaster.  
 Ju Dou is a great movie, I'd only previously seen it on VHS borrowed from the public library and was so looking forward to this release, but sadly I concure, this DVD is as bad as the other reviewers have previously stated.  Worse than the old VHS recording I saw 7 years ago.  So bad, that it's gotten someone like me, one who never writes reviews, to comment on it.  This DVD should not be sold in the United States, or anywhere.  Unfortunately, I picked this DVD up on a whim before reading any reviews.  I'd suggest you just cherish your memories of this wonderful film until a better transfer is made available.  It was good to be reminded of the story, but very sad to see how carelessly Razor Digital Entertainment handled this transfer.  It really baffles me how terrible this transfer is.  A few moments here and there the picture actually looks acceptable, but then the rest of the time it's blurry, washed out, monochromatic yellows and browns, lines and dust marks everywhere, and occasional digital glitches.  This dvd has probably any bad transfer cliche you can imagine; more than I've seen anyway.  Yimou Zhang is a great director, Li Gong a wonderful actress, and it was from two beautiful films(seen only on VHS :( ) that I discovered this, Red Sorgum and Ju Dou.  But heed the reviews, this DVD lo-fi remix of Ju Dou by Razor Digital Entertainment is a nightmare 
 Not much in the way of humor on this one ("Easter Eggs" and "Orange Drink"-which was stolen from Bobcat Goldthwait, of all people-being the lone exceptions).  If you like George Carlin's "angry" period, where he rails against everything without being funny, you'll like this.  If you're looking for laughs, spend your money elsewhere 
 Of all the bad things I have read on Eastern Europe, this book is the worst.  I already wrote a long criticism in reviewing another of Roskin's books, so I will not repeat it here, although he deserves all the criticism he can get.  If "chitatel"'s students liked Roskin's book, it only goes to show how harmful the book is: uninitiated students, without other access to information on the region, read Roskin as if he were telling the truth 
 It's summer, and Parker County, Texas, is gearing up for the annual Peach Festival.  That includes retired teacher Phyllis and her friend and boarder Carolyn.  Both women always enter the cooking contest.  Carolyn usually wins, and Phyllis is determined to beat her this year.  While the two women are out picking peaches, the farm's owner dies.  His death could be ruled an accident, but it might also be murder.  Phyllis's son, an officer with the sheriff's department, investigates.  Unfortunately, he can't find any conclusive evidence one way or the other.  The day of the peach festival brings another death.  Head judge Donnie Boatwright keels over just after trying Phyllis's spicy peach cobbler.  This is a clear case of murder, however.  The man was poisoned.  When Phyllis is quickly cleared of suspicion, the police turn their attention to Carolyn.  Phyllis knows her friend couldn't have done it.  But can she prove it?  The book showed promise at the beginning.  The first death took place in the first chapter.  But then it quickly went downhill.  Once Donnie dies, the book focuses all the attention there.  Still, very little seems to happen.  The characters, Carolyn especially, aren't really that likeable.  And the writing style is fairly poor, with dangling modifiers and awkward sentences throughout the book.  Even the three recipes in the back of the book could have used a bit more detail.  The book sounded promising, so I'm very sorry I can't recommend it.  I won't be visiting Phyllis again 
 I should start by saying I am a big Clive Cussler fan and have read all his books.  The only ones I have not enjoyed are the two Oregon Files ones.  There are so many characters I could not remember who was who without having to keep looking at the cast list at the front.  I reached the point of not caring anyway and just kept reading to get to the end.  The whole thing reads like a Mission Impossible TV episode but nowhere near as good or exciting.  The scenes in the UK were very sloppy; there are no such things as pound notes and the beefeaters actually guard the Tower of London not Buckingham Palace.  I can only hope that it is Craig Dirgo that is the problem and that when the next Oregon Files book comes out written by Jack DuBrul (who I am a great fan of in his own right) that things will improve 
 I do not understand why this book is still in print, or at the very least is not published with a huge disclaimer on the front cover.  The author himself has admitted in more recent books (_Blinded by the Right_ and others) that he was *lying* when he wrote this book, and that he deliberately spun every piece of information about Anita Hill to discredit her. 
 This series may be good for a laugh. Some of the writing is engaging.   But the premise is absurd.   WHY, in this day and age, should anyone accept the world-view of the Bible? A book that tells us to buy and sell slaves, stone our wives to death if they accept some other tribe's beliefs, and subordinate our minds to an absolute despot up in the clouds of Mt. Sinai?   In a sense, Bible believers have been "left behind" since the 1700s Enlightenment. Tom Paine's "The Age of Reason" showed the God of the Bible to be a cruel, vindictive monster. And what did Thomas Jefferson call the book of Revelations? "The ravings of a madman."   Read this series, if you like. Enjoy parts of it. But make no mistake: to take any of this seriously, you have to regress to a prehistoric world-view, before men learned to think, to ask questions; before logic or science -- a time when dazed, superstitious primitives believed stars could fall to the earth, if they didn't grovel humbly enough to their supposed god.   Do the absurdities and contradictions bother no one? When the "sheep" are raptured up to heaven, their clothes are left behind. So heaven is a nudist colony?   The basic contradiction, of course, lies in using worldly action (some of it exciting) to proselytize for the unworldly, the supernatural.   But why should we care whether any of the "good" guys gets killed? And why should THEY mind -- won't they go straight up to heaven? That's what they WANT, isn't it? Why even lift a finger against the "bad" guys -- didn't Christ say, "Resist not evil"?   Worried about who will win? "God" is infinitely powerful. So Jesus (who is 1/3 of God -- or something like that) is sure to win when Armageddon rolls around, in book 12 of the series. And the "sheep" -- the believers -- will happily worship him, looking just like the pictures of dim-witted, bovine people you see in the tracts Jehovah's Witnesses leave at your door.   The going price for a used copy of "Tribulation Force" is one cent. Does that tell you something?   Actually, the story-telling is worth more. The basic premise is worth less. Perhaps it averages out 
 While there was some useful information,this book appeared to be an effort to prove Ms. Vencent's prejudices, rather than the voyge of discovery that it could have been. The author seemed to be searching for the very worst in men, and of course, she found it.  The fact that she would join a men's bowling league, when she couldn't bowl was simply amazing.  I don't think a man (or most women) would ever consider doing such a thing. In addition to the lack of substance, I feel the book was written in a very unengaging and simplistic style. Overall, it was one of the few books I have bought over the years that I don't believe was worth the money.  If you must buy this book, find a used one, or better yet, get it from the library.  If I ever see another book written by Ms. Vincent, I will pass 
 I made myself wait two days before writing this review hoping that I would be able to view this book in a better light but it is just not going to happen.  I had originally read the only other review for Murder at Shots Hall before purchasing it and expected that it would be just the perfect cozy mystery which I love so much.  I find that I am going in the polar opposite direction from the other reviewer.  This book was originally published as Green December Fills the Graveyard but the title has been changed by Rue Morgue Vintage Press to better define the book within the mystery genre.  (For anyone interested in the second Sarsfield mystery it was published as A Dinner for None in Britain and as A Party for Lawty in the U.S.  Rue Morgue has retitled that selection as Murder at Beechlands.  Just a little information so you will not accidently buy the same book multiple times.)  I did not like this book.  I am very irritated with myself because I even finished it but I wanted to see if I had spotted the murderer.  I'm also sorry to say that I had but not the reasoning behind that character being guilty.  I thought I would scream if I read one more time that Flik was lovely, just lovely, so lovely, really lovely, a lovely woman.  Why was she lovely?  Surely the author saw something in her imagination which made Flik lovely.  Her hair, her eyes, her skin, her figure, her hands, her feet???  What, what, what???  We are just told ad nauseam how lovely she is.  And that every man "fell" for her.  Once again, why?  This story all takes place over a very short time, a matter of days, and every single night the fog came down so that no movement could be seen, so thick that it actually dripped off people.  This village was six miles from the sea and yet the salt in the fog stung skin and eyes.  Really?  Now that's a long way for salt spray to travel.  But of course I'm forgetting.  Every night these poor people had to endure gale force winds (just to make it more interesting).  This book is so full of stupidity that I could spend all day trying to relate it all.  Several examples:  (1)  The SCOTLAND YARD INSPECTOR told the constable left on the premesis to take his boots off and walk around outside in his socks at about 2:00 am (in the mud, rain and howling wind) so that he would not wake Flik up, she needed her rest!  (2)The doctor (who had lived within a three mile radius of Flik for many years but had never met her until the first murder) actually almost balked against going to check up on a newborn infant whose parents thought he was dying because he wanted to go check up on Flik.  (3)A broom comes flying out of the air and manages to hit a police constable smack on the head while he is wallowing in the mud (again during all that howling wind and rain) in the middle of the night, in the middle of a muddy road but nobody can figure out where the broom came from and don't even really believe that it happened.  I'm telling you, my list could just go on and on.  When push came to shove, Flik was hiding two "dreadful" secrets which she could never allow to be revealed and so was willing to go to prison for murders she had not committed.  When the secrets were revealed they were pure piffle!  Nobody cared.  It's for sure that I didn't.  Detective Sergeant Arnoldson was a truly abhorrent character.  So much so that it made no sense for the powers-that-be to allow him to stay on the police force.  He had propositioned Flik several years previously for "special favors" after he rescued her from her burning bedroom after a bomb struck Shots Hall during an air raid.  (He spotted a military man's mess kit beneath her bed.)  She had turned him down and he was resentful and liked to gossip about her and insinuate that she was not a "nice" lady.  I got sick and tired of hearing about his red, sweaty face and his wet lips.  He also broke the law in his treatment of Flik during the murder investigation and yet his superiors put up with him.  Once again, my perennial question is WHY?    Well, now I've vented my spleen and I feel somewhat better.  If you still want to buy this book after reading my rants, go right ahead.  I bought the book based on one 5 star rating.  Now you have an entirely different assessment.  Happy decision making 
 Native Son is a book that I was required to read for school. I had high hopes for the book , but they were dashed as I read on. The writing style is extremely sub-par. Wright struggles to get his point across succinctly. The book is characterized by muddled and repetitive narrative. I kept trying to like the character of Bigger throughout the novel, but I was unable to do so. His apparent lack of remorse for his actions is apalling. The argument that his fear and society is the cause of his murders can only apply to his murder of Mary Dalton. His willingness to profit from the murder and sense of pride about it afterword is sick. I see no literary value in this book. We read it because in public schools today we are forced to read literature about how America is racist towards blacks every year. Schools try to jam the theme of racism against blacks down our throats every year in an effort to "emotionally move us" and make us feel guilty for something that occurred long before we were born. I assure you that this book would not have achieved the title "classic" if the author was white. In America we ignore the plight of other ethnic groups and focus solely on the cause of the African American. I get the point we studied it enough already. 
 Drosnin is a hack.  Read Satinover's "Cracking the Bible Code" if you're interested in it 
 The audio is delivered in a monotone that almost puts you to sleep. Not a good thing while drivin 
 I am both shocked and surprised at how completely faulty this book is.  I have the previous version of this book; Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Analysis Services Step by Step, and I don't remember it being this bad.  Don't get me wrong, I know Reed Jacobson as I had met him at the SQL Server 2005 launch event, and I don't necessarily blame him for the poor standing.  I do however blame Microsoft as there is no way they could have performed any sort of Technical Editorial on this book.  If you do decide to buy it, watch out for the Writeback partitions exercise in Chapter 10.  It blew up my Virtual Server.  Twice 
 I was looking for help teaching this subject to middle schoolers in a Christian school.  I find the discussion questions far to broad to prompt actual discussion in the older end of this spectrum and too deep for children in the younger part.  From Chapter 12 "Do you think Moses will be happy in heaven becasue he made this decision? Why? (yes, Moses will be happy because he did what God wanted him to do.  He will be able to enjoy the Lord forever in heaven."  Yikes, I can hear the crickets already. Not enough practical like balancing a checkbook, how credit cards work etc. and way too many softball discussion questions 
 240 pages of scratchy toilet paper. Shaughnessy is allowed to perpetuate a myth based not in fact, but his own feeble brain. Avoid this book at all costs 
 It can only be a good thing that this book provides positive support for women who suddenly find themselves in a marriage that is not what they thought. After all, spousal compatability is the most important aspect of a lasting marriage. It does seem remarkable to me, though, that in 30 years of "mostly happy" marriage, the author never realised her husband was gay. Surely the marriage's general long-term happiness should have the author questioning her own status, vis-a-vis the whole gay issue? Different personality types and their relative compatibility are usually issues that are sorted out in the pre-marriage courting stage, or at least in the early stages of marriage. For it to take 30 "mostly happy" years for the author to realise her objections to her husband's gaiety indicates the likelihood that she had actually changed over time. It's natural for some people to become more melancholic and morose as they get older, but it seems a bit unreasonable to be taking it out on your spouse 
 This book is exactly the same book - verbatim - as Myles Munroe's The Purpose and Power of God's Glory.  I wouldn't have bought this book if I had known it was the exact copy I already owned (with a different cover and title).  I've lost a little respect for Mr. Munroe for misleading his faithful readers like this 
 you may be tempted to buy these because of the 'sony' name...but be warned, DO NOT buy sony cd-r's off of amazon....I bought this same 50 pack, and had to throw half, yes half as in 25 of the discs, out because they had read errors and God knows what else.  I find this strange though, because I've  bought (and still do) these same sony cd-r's from best buy, and at target, and at staples...and they've always worked fine.  I thought I would give it a go buying the online and I'm sorry I did.  If you want the sony cd's, just go to your local target and pick em up there...at least I can tell, based off my experience, they'll work.  Can't say the same for the ones coming from amazon 
 I don't read many comic books, but I enjoy Batman and I enjoy talented artists.  The artwork in this comic book is awesome ... great drawings, great use of color.  The storyline, however, is amateurish.  Admittedly, you must approach all fictional writing with a degree of "suspension of disbelief", however this pushes the bounds of what is tollerable.  Spoiler: c'mon ... a 10 year old boy wants his parents to die so he can be an orphan?  And then plots his revenge against Bruce Wayne for 25+ years after his Bruce's dad was able to save the mother?  DESPITE now himself being a world famous physician?  The plot brings every villan into suspicion ... seems like a weak attempt to get all of Batman's most famous enemies on the cover to sell more comics.  The writer gave us no sense of the torment of the antagonist, no real motive.  Were his parents abusive?  Why the displaced agression towards Bruce?  The writer wasted valuable storyline on dead ends rather than building real suspense and drama.  I am going to continue to read Batman graphic novels in hopes that there is something better than this out there.  I wished the writing lived up to the art work 
 Instead of this pick up a Plextor convertor box.  It takes the output of the camcorder (composite/RCA or S-Video) and compresses that to mpeg-2 (DVD) or mpeg-4 (or DivX) and includes software which easily burns that to DVD or CD (mpeg-1 or mini DVD).  Look for Plextor's M402U box.  Unless you really want to deal with 3.125 MB of data per second (25 Mbps), or about 180 MB per minute, or about 11 GB per hour through the firewire link, get the M402U.  Your options will be greatly expanded, and you won't tell the difference by looking 
 Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Jonathan Mostow, 2003)  Okay, raise your hands: how many people didn't see this movie crashing and burning when a director other than James Cameron-- despite his dismal track record since 1996-- was attached to it? (And let's face it, Terminator 2 wasn't exactly gangbusters, either.) Still, the fact that twelve years elapsed between the second and third movies lent a minor air of credibility to it. Incorrectly, of course, but there you go.  As the title tells you, this is the story of how the machines took over the world. In other words, the very title of the film is a spoiler, since the machines take over the world, yes, in the very last scene of the film (after Arnie once again does his level best to save the world). This is pre-apocalypse John Connor (Carnivale's Nick Stahl), who begins the film as a bum, more or less. We are almost immediately introduced to Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), the woman who will, obviously, be his saving grace. This isn't a spoiler; the movie's about as hard to figure out as a four-piece jigsaw puzzle with three pieces already put into place. And, of course, there's Arnie, the good guy, and Kristanna Loken, the bad guy-- uh, girl. Gotta wonder how Arnie keeps getting crushed, melted, and elected Governor of California, but they can keep sending him back to mess with the Connor family, don't you?  In any case, things blow up, people run from terminators, people get killed by terminators, you know the drill. But, unlike the brilliant first film, and even the mediocre second, T3 manages to studiously avoid anything approaching characterization. We are given no reason to care about these characters, no suspense to make us wonder whether they'll rise to the occasion, not even a decent script for the actors to work with. This was as paint-by-numbers as it gets. Save your money, even if you can watch it free.  
 Beautiful prose is not enought to save this book. I enjoyed the first third and was moved by the loss of Beverly Penn, but by the end of the tome I frankly didn't care who lived or died when the Apocalypse arrived. It was a surprise to find out that only middle class urban journalists and their friends will actually go to heaven while the poor burn in their hovels. Having said that, Helprin is capable of writing a great novel;  A Soldier of The Great War remains one of my favourites 
 I heard about this book growing up but didn't read it until just recently (a middle-aged adult) and I have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written, i.e., it was SO SHOCKING AND DISGUSTING! Such filth! I mean, that's why I heard about the book when I was growing up. But as so many others have already pointed out, it is tame by today's standards. I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the "female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part..." Now, you see, what struck me about Sir Clifford's situation, and Lady Chatterley's, for that matter, is if they really loved each other, his paralysis from the waist down wouldn't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done, yes? In fact, quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time! (Ahem, women readers will know what I mean.) But Clifford treated Connie poorly. With or without the lack of sex issue, I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway. Which to me, just goes to show that a man wrote the book...a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick. 
 Mr. Rasiel has written a book on consulting for 3rd graders.  It is full of fluff and cliches.  At the beginning of each chapter, he outlines its contents in 2 paragraphs, and spends the rest of the chapter illustrating his "points" with weak, unengaging, and not even remotely entertaining anecdotes.    His solution for a member of the client team who would leaf through the presentation booklet at the beginning of a meeting and then tune out?  Staple the pages of the book together!  Gee thanks, Mr. Rasiel... priceless advice.  Here are some other gems that I found especially helpful: + "No one ever said life was fair." + "Sometimes a little politeness goes a long way." + "When all else fails, have a doorman.  Then, at least, you'll come home to clean laundry."  The only valuable information I gleaned from this book is that if Ethan Rasiel is anything like the rest of the McKinsey-ites, I would last no longer than 2 years at the Firm myself.  I found myself gritting my teeth at the nauseating tone and pointless content of this book.  Save your time and read something (anything) else 
 Very amateurishly written, downright "corny" plot that thinly tries to disguise a conservative, backwards political agenda.  Don't waste your time on this one 
 This time, teen agent Cody Banks (Frankie Muniz) is on the trail of a former spy instructor who has gone rogue with the intention of using a mind control microchip to create world-wide chaos.  The first film had its moments but was generally a pretty mediocre affair.  This sequel is painfully uninspired and over-the-top without being very funny.  The beginning sequence that introduces Camp Woody, the school for young spies, is amusing, and Anthony Anderson is funny.  Nothing else quite works. 
 Much like her other book, "Wild Swans", this is another piece of Imperialist-apology and anti-Communism that would make Joe McCarthy proud.  It reads like cheap fiction, and in the end, has little historical value.   Read "Red Star Over China", "Fanshen", and "From Ike to Mao" instead. 
 I generally enjoy reading biographies, but this one was an exception! A very boring read! I did not think that Lincoln was being portrayed as overly religous as another reviewer did, but I seriously doubt that lincoln had evangelical inclinations. I was dissapointed in the lack of overall perspective of Lincoln's life. I feel that there was too much concentration on Lincoln the politician (his political development) and not enough about his family and social life. I wanted to know Lincoln better on a personal level and I did not feel that this book provided much insight. I may have been expecting too much, but I prefer a biographry that maintains my interest rather than puting me to sleep, as this one frequently did 
 Infinitely unsatisfying, and of little to no value to those who are seeking legitimate answers to furniture repair questions.  The saccharine-sweet "Recipe" section in the book suffices only to induce dyspepsia in the judicious.   Only a shameless furniture repair dilettante would see any merit in this tome, and the "Recipe" layout is the perfect emetic to those unfortunate enough to waste their money on this book.  To those who are sincerely interested in the subject, I heartily recommend the Creative Homeowner's series title "Furniture Repair and Refinishing" by Brian D. Hingley 
 Plain and simple, there is no such thing as the group, Earth, Wind & Fire without Maurice White.  Anything else is simply not genuine EWF, and true fans of their music know this 
 Calling "The Truelove', whose story is primarily that of Clarissa Oakes, a woman who has been sexually abused from early girlhood until she boards Aubrey's ship [and, one might argue, until she leaves] a light hearted romp is misleading.  Hardly the first time this series has dealt with the impact of a woman on 'the wooden world' that Aubrey, Maturin and the ever changing cast of supporting characters inhabit, this time it shows everyone behaving in odd and surprising ways. Jack is thick headed and oblivious. Stephen, normally so clear-eyed, sends Clarissa, who admits not only to disliking children but to throwing an infant down a well, to stay with his wife and their newborn. Pullings throws off his sense of duty and is befuddled as well as bewitched.  Since Clarissa [like all O'Brian's 'strong' females] is really a man in a skirt [for a woman in uniform we have the aptly named Killick, in all his shrewish glory] she is far too flat, vague and undeveloped to carry such large portions of the plot with any measure of success.  This is definitely the worst book of the series and, sadly, in some ways not a good book at all. Not just because the plot is so out of place in this series, or even because characters you have grown to know start behaving in ways that are inexplicable, but because they have almost disappeared from the story to be replaced by someone you can't actually care about because she seems so fake 
 Maybe I was just expecting something like Jaws but I didn't think this movie that great. I watched it twice now only because I kept falling asleep the first time. The script is very weak and thus so is the story, the  acting is flat. Most of the shark sequences are in my opinion taken from  existing documentaries (I have seen photographs of at least one scene), you  can tell that they are cut into the movie and the parts that where done for  the movie are very poorly done. Don't waste your money, if you want to  watch it, rent it, don't buy it 
 I had a problem with Brietta a day after I bought her. I was combing her hair, and suddenly her head broke! The part of her head that has hair seperated from her forehead, and there is no way to fix her. So she is stuck with a crack in her skull. I'm very upset about this.  Other than that, I adore my Brietta doll. She has long strawberry blond hair that curls at the end in a messy way, so I cut the hair shorter to get rid of the messy curls.  Her face has a gorgeous expression, which looks so friendly to me. Her gown is light pink with a real overskirt and long sleeves, and she has pink shoes that ACTUALLY STAY ON!  I'm just sad that she broke, but I still love her nonetheless 
 When this movie began, I was sure I was in for something penetrating and deep.  As it went on, I felt that the movie was merely clever.  Within a few minutes of that, I was just plain bored.    The premise -- Hitler, his colleagues, and a few random Nazis in a surreal, underground world akin to hell -- has potential.  But the movie becomes tedious for lack of any plot, or of any pretense of one.  The whole movie is given over to listening to Hitler make speeches about heroism, propaganda, and other abstract concepts.  For the sake of variety, his speechifying is occasionally interrupted by comments from Goebbels, Goering, Eva Braun, and others.    Having Hitler talk with Sigmund Freud was evidently intended to be the cleverest stroke of all.  Freud, however, is portrayed as a bland, ordinary, TV-stereotype of a psychologist; the only way we know he's supposed to be Freud is the beard and the pince-nez.    
 I had to read this book in english class this year and it was absolutely horrid. The jokes weren't funny and the story was just stupid. Also, if you actually like the book, don't buy this edition because it falls apart. The book is about the battle of the sexes and it's stupid, pointless and boring. On top of it, you'll be really confused at times because of the old english. It's not a fun read more like a frustrating read. This is definitely one of my least favorite books of all time. 
 I dropped out of this one by about page 200.  I have read and thoroughly enjoyed Neverwhere and Stardust so I was eager to read this book.  Unlike the earlier works, American Gods failed to engage me. I love to lose myself in a good book, to feel like I'm part of the story; but when your main character is unaffected and apathetic to all that's going on around him,as Shadow is, it tends to make the reader feel the same way.  I'm sure if I hung in there it would have picked up a bit, but I don't like having to work so hard to turn pages. Life is just too short and there are a lot of good books out there 
 I was really looking forward to this book. I'm not sure when I have been so disappointed in a story after all of the hype.  I was raised in mid-west and expected a serious story about trials of a disfunctional family. What a total waste of time. Turd fantasy is not my idea of great literature. Worst book I have read since "Running with Scissors".  I don't need to waste my time on this psychotic drivel parading as great art 
  I usually trust Amazon reviewers on movie reviews, but this time ....NO WAY!   This silly, totally predictable film left us playing with the cat for our evening entertainment, hoping the movie would liven up.  Sadly, it didn't. To those who rave about the film...you must be in another dimension or something.  Thumbs DOWN. 
 After reading this book, I wished to hang myself with a thousand ribbons. It is a fictional work of junk and a waste of my time. Phillis constantly complains about everything going on in her life, even though most of it never happened. It was boring, useless, untrue, poinless, petty, junk, and all around horrible. It made me miserable and I chose to burn it when I was done. If I wasn't forced to read it, I would've never wasted my money reading this junk. I searched for the audiobook to numb the pain but to no avail, I was stuck reading the whole thing. I pity anyone else who must read this garbage. I suggest you take the money you were going to spend on this and burn it, it will save you time, effort, and will be much more rewarding. Sorry to all who read this book 
 This is a very angrily written book.  It is hard to take it too seriously even when there are some segments of truth.  Author has an axe to grind 
 you'll catch VD from listening to this fag. Esoteric ripped him and you're better off listening to 7l and esoteric becuase they make better music and have got boston locked down. 
 If you're a fan of Wagner's Ring Cycle of operas, you'll be disappointed by this (which Prof. Hatto freely admits in the introduction.)  The real Nibelungenlied, for the most part, lacks the "balls" of Wagner.  However, the amazingly bloody fight scene at the end is memorable and masterfully composed. Hatto's prose translation is readable but sort of flat.  It has a fairy-tale lilt to it at times, which more often than not comes across sounding juvenile. The story consists of two distinct sections with decidedly different flavors, indicating that the poet composed it out of two pre-existing stories that didn't exactly fit together.  The first part deals with the wooing of Brunhilde and the death of Sigfried.  A wealth of detail from other versions of this story is unfortunately left out, and Sigfried's earlier career is completely skipped over.  We're simply told in a few lines that he slew a dragon and conquered the Nibelungs, gaining posession of their vast treasure along with a magic cloak and impenetrable skin.  Brunhilde is consumed with jealousy when Sigfried marries Kriemhild, but because of the poet's ham-fisted tampering with his sources, the "real" reason of her jealousy has to be substituted with something lame and irrational. The second half of the Nibelungenlied tells of Kriemheld's grisly revenge for the murder of Sigfried.  This part is well written, but oddly the characters metamorphose so that the villain of the first half (Sigfried's muderer) is the hero in the second half (a stalwart victim of a woman's treachery.) The story is bogged down throughout with chivalric courtly nonsense, undoubtedly thrown in for the gratification of the poet's royal patron.  After reading some Icelandic sagas, the characters' behaviour in the Nibelungenlied seems painfully artificial. I'm also puzzled as to why this work bears the title "Nibelungenlied" since it really isn't about the Nibelungs at all.  It doesn't tell the story of Sigfried's conquest of Nibelungland and the winning of the legendary treasure.  The Nibelungs show up briefly in the story as an army which Sigfried has at his disposal, and nothing more.  In the second half, the Burgundians are inexplicably referred to as "Nibelungs" but this just doesn't make sense after referring in the first half to the Nibelungs as a seperate people in a seperate land (a seemingly otherworldly land.  There's a dim sense that the Nibelungs might be "fairy folk," perhaps like the Tuatha De Danann in Celtic myth.)  The title is a cheat, and I think it's misleading.  But it is the traditional title of this epic. The afterword provides in-depth critical analysis and profuse apologies for the epic's many flaws.  Reading this helps greatly towards better understanding of the poem, and also puts you on the track of parallel sources of the Nibelung legend, some of which Prof. Hatto briefly summarizes.  I need to find the Norse "Thidrekssaga" which fills in many exciting details of Sigfried's early career and the truth about his relationship with Brunhilde. I've also heard that the Volsung Saga is a much better telling of the story.  Though I haven't yet read it, based on what I know of sagas I'm willing to bet it will be a much more satisfying experience. All in all, I can't recommend the Nibelungenlied to anyone unless they have a real serious thirst for Medeival literature 
 I find it difficult to believe that any serious writer would feel comfortable using this overly simplistic approach to character development.  A character created from a mish-mash of bullet point-ed traits would be very flat...existing merely as a stereotype.  And I can't decide whether to be overjoyed or dismayed that librarians are not included (omitted perhaps to leave room for the 'careers' of "kept woman", "corporate wife", or "shadow mom").  Perhaps some "types" of people are already so stereotyped that Dr. Edelstein felt no need for inclusion.  Oh yes, and did I mention that use of eyedrops and incense is a sure sign that the character is a marijuana user?  Please 
 From the start, Jet look like a band with potential. Their lead singer has an outstanding voice and the band sounds tight together. They try too hard, but that's not what makes this album below average. The problem is they're "influences" are too pervasive in this album. The Bassline to "Are You Gonna Be My Girl" is a straight rip off of Iggy Pop, and "Look What You Done" has just about the same melody and lyrics as the Beatles' "Sexy Sadie." I didn't give the album one star because Jet have the tools to become a great rock and roll band. But the cliche's in this record are just too much. Next time, Jet, put substance over style 
 This is garbage, any way you sniff it. I was a big fan of his earlier CDs but if you're looking for laughs here there are only about three of them. This CD reminds me of Adam Sandler's movie career in regards to how his movies are getting continually worse. This, however, ups the ante; there are no redeeming qualities about this CD at all. I can't be emphatic enough to potential buyers: don't. It's very, very bad. It's the culmination of his tired humour, which seems to get worse as the years go by, combined with clearly very little effort put in here. I'd be surprised if he spent more than a lazy week completing it from start to end 
 The book is violently anti-Semitic. More importantly for an informed reader, it is so inaccurate that it is useless for anybody but historians exploring the investigation of Romanov murders. Wilton's hatred of Jews clouded his mind to the extent that he was unable to establish even the most basic facts concerning the case, although he had ample opportunity to interview a significant number of key witnesses and had access to evidence now lost. Wilton was fired from London's "Times" for being unreliable, in 1919 the British High Commission wanted him recalled and Foreign Office often branded him a liar and an embarrassment 
 Found this presentation very poor. After reading many of his books prior to seeing him deliver this speech, I was a greatly disappointed. It was a mumbled fumbled repetitive delivery with the most important facts obfusicated with a line like -I think you all know what im referring to here. I suggest read his books they are much better structured and more to the point. I give this dvd one star and repeat- read his books! dont be lazy and expect to get much out of this, I ask myself how can he be an MIT professor with such poor teaching skills, an off (ice) prof ? 
 Although the product description seemed promising, this product had an electrical problem from the start. As soon as I set it up and turned it on, I noticed a loud cracking sound coming from the unit, about every 10 seconds or so. I looked inside the unit and a visible blue spark could be seen.  It appeared that either the product had a problem with a fuse or a bad connection inside the unit. Luckily, I was home when this happened- what if the spark had caused a fire? I returned the product immediately and have since bought another air purifier.  This one is not worth the money and is a huge safety hazard! 
 This book should have been a collection of short stories.  It needs some heavy editing.  There are moments of real science fiction and story telling, but it is burdened by preaching.  
 Installed it to my Nissan Xterra. First it was working fine, but after a few months the channel switching knob stopped working (twists free, but the channel number remains 1), making the whole thing kompletely useless 
 Talk about a waste of time!  I was wondering if it was just me so I asked several friends who dutifully read this prize winner and they said they could barely get through it.  It is boring, tells you instead of shows you, hyperactively jumps around the timeline like a flea and provides no payoff at all.  I also found the protrayal of the grandmother's flirtation with Islam to be shallow, un-informed, unbelievable and ultimately dismissive. Don't waste your time on this or your money. Luckily I had picked it up at a book sale for $0.25, about what it was worth 
 The game plan in Mark Burnett's hit reality TV show The Apprentice is to ruthlessly eliminate 15 of its 16 contenders, in its bid to identify the best man or woman for the top job in one of billionaire Donald Trump's corporations. In the event, it sheds light on the ways and means Trump, estimated by Forbes to be worth US$1.74bil (RM6.6bil), and the likes of him may have undertaken on the warpath to building their own business empires.   The contenders are divided into two teams: Protege and Versacorp, where they are expected to compete against the rival team and against members of their own team for leadership posts while maintaining teamwork throughout 15 frenetic episodes.   They are thus put through a series of tests to gauge their team leadership skills, competitive spirit, business acumen, passion, gumption and more. These tests have included an advertising campaign for a card that allocates private jet service by the hour, an AIDS benefit auction, art exhibition, running a lemonade stand and selling bottled drinking water.    Although Trump appears only at the end of each episode to eliminate one person from the losing team - and briefly at the start - he really is the star of the show which is an induction into his world. Choosing his apprentice by shrewdly assessing their strengths and weaknesses, with the help of assistants George and Carolyn, Trump cuts a clear picture of the type of person that will fit in his world.    According to Parinello, a Wall Street Journal bestselling author, and Gottfried, a regular columnist for The Apprentice on www.the-trades.com, the ideal candidate will be familiar with all or most of these 10 Trump-approved methods:   Think Big. Show the Competition No Mercy. Defend Yourself Aggressively. Remember, Consensus Is Overrated. Identify All Possible Resources, and Use Them Strategically. Cut Your Losses. Get Face-to-Face With Key Decision-Makers. Step Up - Take Intelligent Chances, and Then Take Responsibility. Advance the Most Profitable Deal. Negotiate Tough.    Employers look for people who dare go after a riskier but more potentially rewarding path, who will pull through more often than not. These are what Trump calls Big Thinkers. The apprentice will have to be this and much, much more.   The apprentice will have to be able to Show the Competition No Mercy. He does this by identifying and neutralising competition - both outside and inside. He recognises there will be team-mates who are not above stealing his ideas or credit for his work, or sabotaging his ambitions.   If things take a turn for the worse and they sometimes do, the apprentice will Defend Himself Aggressively. It doesn't matter whether he is right or wrong, what matters is that he steps up and defends himself aggressively. How he tackles false charges and inaccuracies will be perceived as a measure of his fighting spirit.   The problem with group-think is that the watered down solution that is agreeable to everyone is rarely often the best solution, that Consensus is Overrated - so, when in a leadership position, his team cannot come to a compromise, he takes what he thinks is the best idea and runs with it.   Being able to Identify All Possible Resources and Use Them Intelligently, especially non-cash resources like getting things one needs without paying full price for them, ingenious methods of attracting potential customers, getting people to work for free, goes a long way to aiding continual business survival. The apprentice recognises this and uses the resources to his advantage.   And if things somehow don't work according to plan, the apprentice will Cut His Losses, and move on. In a leadership position, these include reshuffling a team, changing a design, approach or product line and firing someone. Continuing with something or someone that is not working is a waste of resources, time and energy.   To win over a position or a business, the apprentice will Get Face-to-Face with Key Decision Makers as often as possible, and make his case with passion and style. Non verbal communication counts and face time will give him the chance to feel out his contact's distinct way of interacting with the world. More importantly, he will get to bond with that person.   Failure comes with the territory but the apprentice knows how to Step Up - Take Intelligent Chances, and Then Take Responsibility. He recognises the right risks as the ones that present the possibility of a high payoff, have manageable downsides, take advantage of his demonstrated strengths and resources and neutralises his competition.   In any business situation, the apprentice knows that he only has a certain number of hours to work on it, so it makes sense to Advance the Most Profitable Deal. Business propositions that can't be expected to realistically deliver a minimum level of profit are a dime a dozen - he recognises those.    The apprentice will Negotiate Tough but flexibly, remembering every negotiating partner is different, thus no two negotiations will be alike. So, he researches beforehand, adapts his strategy to the person he is talking to, pushes when he can and walks away when he should.    The TV series is dramatic and addictive for its soap-opera-like quality, the way knives are constantly being hurled into the backs of rivals, metaphorically of course.    The authors of this book appear to have cleverly gleaned the lessons from the series - presumably towards good profit. So that after the show ends, you can still hold in your hands the book, 10 Secrets I Learned from The Apprentice, to be referred to again and again in quieter moments.     
 This book is another attempt to capitalize on a name brand (Porter; Harvard) as opposed to providing a substantive, insightful take on what is happening in Japan and what needs to be done in order to correct certain problems in the Japanese economy. It also gives the false impression that Japan is somehow a pre-mature version of the US. Porter is not a Japan expert and I would be very careful, as an American/foreigner, to not to take books on Japan by foreigners who have never lived their or speak the language too seriously. The book is not about Japan, it is a generalized theoretical black box solution to a much more complex problem in which one needs to understand a lot more than just management theory. Japanese management is much more complex and, unlike in the US where a monkey can be trained to fire people, Japanese managers have many more issues to deal with. People tend to forget the fact that Japanese managers have done a much better job (though moving more slowly) at reducing the negative impact of restructuring. Its more difficult to keep a company going and competitive when its against the law to fire people than if you could fire people on the spot-- US management "expertise" is incredibly over-rated the recent market correction shows the incredible amount of resources that are wasted by corporate America on such things as management consulting. Those foreigners who have written on Japan's economy and financial markets who have the language down (speaking; reading) and have been in-country for an extended period of time as expats can provide a very interesting and highly useful perspective for those looking from the outside in a way most Japanese cannot (and will not). Being a "senior advisor" to a few large Japanese companies does not qualify someone to write on this topic 
 Long ago, humans tended to think of people as categorized into four basic temperaments: the Artisan, the Guardian, the Idealist, and the Rational.  This theory has become lost in the shuffle of modern philosophies, which essentially state that if you push someone hard enough in the right direction, he or she will ultimately go there.  Redirecting us to this claim of temperaments serves as the driving force of Please Understand Me II, and to that effect, Keirsey succeeds.  Some discredit his work on the grounds that it compartmentalizes people and thus confines their identities; in truth, I think it does the opposite.  The first time you read through this book and allow it to describe who you really are, you may experience deep satisfaction, if not all-out extasy.  You realize that you are who you are, no more and no less, and that is that.  It's truly a liberating experience to find out that so many of the personal attributes that many people have criticized you for, you owe nobody an apology for.  Whether or not people understand you, you may indeed be yourself and not act according to some other identity.  But then you take a second look at the book, and you start to discover a sobering truth: You realize that while Keirsey calls Guardians and Idealists on the floor for their weaknesses, he lets Rationals and especially Artisans off the hook.  This bias results in a substantial number of strawmen arguments.  For example, his claims that "ESFP's haven't a mean bone in their body," and that Guardians always believe that car drivers should use their turn signals even when no other cars are around, are simply false.  The chapter on romance, while quite critical of Idealists, makes an all-out defense of Rationals' mistakes.  Although Please Understand Me II goes into great detail about how Rationals drive for efficiency and Artisans drive for effectiveness, he makes no mention as to what the corresponding goals of Idealists and Guardians are.  This personal slant of his is not right, it isn't fair, and it should have been caught.  Other personality works such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and Tieger-Tieger's Do What You Are, while not as enlightening as Please Understand Me II, were obviously subject to some kind of peer review that this book is in dire need of.  Granted it may sound harsh to judge a book for one simple mistake, but believe me, this bias is more than a simple mistake; it truly sticks out like a sore thumb.  Yes, it is that bad.  Don't get me wrong, I really wanted to give this book 5 stars.  But I'm doing a disservice to you if I tell you that this book is a work of art, because although this may be true, the portrait has a very ugly stain on it.  I'll give this book a second star for its potential, but sadly, that's about as far as Please Understand Me II goes 
 I am very sad, This work is not art, I think this is [ The Worst Damn Thing ] An ugly and poor sound, She seems to be the lion which was totally tamed, The drying up of talent? I think that I want you to come back to a brilliant artist 
 This book is an affront to Dummies.  It is also below the standard set by the For Dummies series (Estate Planning for Dummies is excellent).  A Dummy would be better advised to get a used copy of a world history textbook, for less money, and just read the table of contents.  It's difficult to imagine who Haugen's target reader is, since even Dummies have choices 
 By 1945, the german army was bled white, gutted, undersupplied, out-numbered and lacking experienced officers and men.  The western front was manned by a desperate mixture of few veterans, old men, young boys and whatever the germans could get together.  The odds were NEVER even after 1943.  The Western front was a side show compared to the titanic battles that took place in the east.  The russians bore the brunt of the best units the german army could throw together 
 It just didn't do it for me.  Like so many other people, I loved Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  It was such a rich, unexpected book and came alive in the reading.  But, I fear John Berendt had only one in him - one great story.  He found a crime and a city and another series of characters, but he just didn't find the magic.   Good writing?  Yes.  Interesting characters?  Somewhat.  Compelling plot?  No.   Maybe it's just that he tried too hard to make Venice new to his readers.  Maybe he tried too hard to replicate the formula and twists of Midnight, even though reality didn't afford him similarities to work with.  Maybe he just tried too hard. 
 This movie is a Shakespeare play. The dialog is impossible to understand for MUCH of this movie. Anyone who says that they understand everything these actors are saying must be lying. No one speaks this way now and it is very hard to follow. I wish I had known that it was Shakespeare before I bought it, but for some reason I didn't. The movie is also like a play but in a movie format. This might not be to everyone's liking. Just be cautious of all these rave reviews. People here claiming this review as not helpful are the ones pretending like they understand every word of a Shakespeare play. I would just like to continuously pause the dvd and ask them what the actors just said and let them fumble over themselves trying to explain 
 Quite an example of uneven sound quality that is totally unforgiveable in this current day and age.  I was very excited to finally find this "LP" on CD and couldn't wait to play it...however, when the CD arrived I could not believe how poor the sound quality was...drop-outs, surface noise, distortion--simply unplayable. I have heard direct transfers from LP to CD that sound waaaaaay beter than this garbage.  My happy ending is that a few years later I was lucky enough to discover the Ides of March CD on the Rhino Handmade label.  It was like Magic!--What a difference professional sound quality makes 
 Aidoo gives new meaning to the term "female whiner". Her brief "novel"(about 132 pages) is a trying exercise in whining about being a woman, and being an African. She may have cause to whine, but please spare us the long poems that break up the text. If I wanted to read poetry, I'd buy a poetry book. I hate it when authors insert poems in midstream. It breaks up the text, and detracts from the action. Anyway, Sissie is a Ghanaian who visits Germany, makes cute with a German woman, and reflects on how bad colonization and Africans can be. Not recommended except for insommiacs 
 If you have read Richard Lamb's book, Mussolini as Diplomat, then there's no point of buying this book as it essentialy covers the same ground, and comes to the same conclusions. What's more, even if the former is a dry, boring read, it's still a bargain at $5 for  a hardcover 
 My copy of this book is barely readable.  Numerous parts of the text are missing. The printing is just missing here and there on the pages. Beware this edition. It is unfortunate since the content appears excellent 
 I normally wouldn't spend the time to write a review.  This time, I am compelled to warn others not to waste their time.  Beyond Infinity begins as a great idea, and ends with an author so full of his supposed vision, that mere language fails him.  In other words, his images don't come together and the plot explodes.  Trying to find any redeeming value in the last half of his book is extremely difficult.  He creates a world of such strangeness that all "science" is abandoned.  It becomes very much like reading someone doing some serious mind-altering chemicals (e.g. racoon-lke creatures whose intellect spans galaxies - which are all alive and aware - and whose mission to is share their uber-world-view of the pre-eminence of evolution and the failure of the human dream, etc. etc. etc.).  I would quote the book here, but I would probably get slapped with violating some copyright rule.  Please, find another book to spend your time with.  I read a book a week, and I had to struggle to convince myself to not just put it down about once a day and go on to my next book. 
 I bought this for two reasons: because I wanted to learn about LBOs, and because I had heard that the journalism was good, and was hoping for something like 'The Right Stuff'.  The cover of my copy blurbed 'unflawed' writing, and 'all the suspense of a first-rate thriller'.  The last is true only if your expectations of a first-rate thriller reach no higher than Michael Crichton.  The writing is a plodding 'you are there' journalism-school pastiche of the New Yorker: Gulfstreams are sleak, CEOs are silver maned, side-kicks are bantams, lawyers look like they model for GQ, etc. Investment bankers bark, curse, are struck by inspiration, work off grudges and wave their lingams around at the sort of comic book level Stan Lee would scorn.  I finally realised, after slogging through the first 200 pages or so, that 'Barbarians at the Gate' is, in large part, essentially porn for aspirational middle managers.  There is no-one in this book whom I would want to know, unless I were a sociologist.  But I don't even trust the sociology, because the psychology is so superficial.  I did learn something about the process of LBOs, and for that a star is in order.  I didn't particularly enjoy learning it. 
 The outgoing message that I tried to record sounded terrible, so I have to use the default outgoing message. To delete a message you hit the on/off button -- not very intuitive as sometimes it just shuts the machine off if your timing is not right. I've had it for over a year, it works fine, but I'm looking to replace it for something of better quality that's easier to use 
 I have yet to read a true Grisham thriller, but I plan to in the near future.  Having said that, I have no idea how this compares, but I didn't really care for it.  It's cute and has a sort of slapstick humor that I couldn't get into.  I felt like I was reading a teen or children's book, and I don't like feeling so patronized when I read unless I knowingly pick up a picture book ready for the simplicity of a good message--even then, I don't usually feel patronized or "written down to".  It's simple writing and a simple plot.  It's lighthearted and thus a light read.  I imagine many people would enjoy it; I just couldn't get into it.  :o 
 I usually like what Mr. Peretti writes, but this one was dissapointing. It felt a little disjointed, like it needed more character development. When the characters of Randy and Leslie first appear in the novel, it's as though the authors just left two chapters out of the book. Who are they and how did they get where they are? And Who exactly is this "Tin Man" and where did he come from? There should've been alot more interaction between him and the heros in the book or at least a little more background on him or anyone else. This book could've been much longer and should have been.   Frank Peretti's other books like "The Oath" or "The Visitation" are much better. I haven't read any of Ted Dekker's books yet (I did buy "Showdown") so I won't blame him for this book. It's almost as if one or both of these guys had an idea for a movie based on a book, but had no book to base it off of. With the movie about to start filming, I fear this might be close to the truth. This may be one of those cases where the movie is better than the book. Overall, I have to say stay away from this book. 
 This book is a terrible book in my opinion and anyone who thinks that it is good needs to question their intelligence.  It is not based enough on facts and is full of personal perceptions, opinions, and myths of the author himself.  Not recommended to anyone who is a music maker or true consumer.  Quality music is expensive to create and very time consuming.  That is a fact that Mr. Kusek fails to point out.  
 After reading this iconic work, I felt as if I had been ripped off with only myself to blame.  I should have known better.  The book is SOOOOOOO 70's!  I'll give it two stars simply because it's really so out-of-date it's almost campy.    Okay, early oil paintings depicted the upper classes with their "stuff" and the "stuff" of the upper classes.  So?  It's pretty elemental to figure out that those painters had to make a living and they painted for those who were able to pay them.    Duh.  Okay, women were depicted in oil paintings as possessions and, in turn, viewed themselves in the light of the value the possessor placed on them.  Deep and enlightening, huh?  It gets worse.  We get a healthy dose of the "capitalism is bad" philosophy and the hammering that advertising is meant to keep the masses enslaved to capitalism.  Nineteen seventies style collectivism is so boring.  Of course, Berger offers no alternative other than some passing reference to his vague definition of democracy.      Maybe it's just so out-dated, it's no longer relevant.  Maybe it played better to the 1970's.  Maybe we've heard this claptrap for so many years, it's no longer novel or meaningful.  And, maybe, it's because we've matured enough to realize criticism without any offering of alternatives is simply disingenuous and superficial 
 I've been a fan of the Who since I recieved my copy of Tommy on vinyl in 1970 for Christmas. I resisted buying this DVD set for a long time because of the price and knowing that if it was a current release that Townshend would be playing an accoustic guitar while someone backstage would be playing what he should be (he started doing this due to hearing loss years ago). The Who hasnt been the same since. Watching the Tommy performance will make you seasick its so out of sync. It just goes to show that some publishers and performers will let anything out the door to make another buck. I had just moved to Las Vegas when Entwhistle died there of a cocaine overdose, it was somehow prophetic in a way, I didnt have tickets for their show that week but I thought with his death it wouldnt have happened anyway. Surprisingly it did, (its all about $$$$$). If you've never seen this band in its heyday go get a copy of their Live at the Isle of Wight festival show or Woodstock for a second choice and see what this band was really like. And shame on the people who let this recording hit the shelves, I hope they choke on the money. 
 This massive back-breaker of a casebook is seriously in need of major editing.  The cases were frequently repetitive and exhaustive about minute details.  The editor would make a point, the following case would repeat it twice, and then the editor would again repeat it following the case.  Another thing that made the book so unpleasant to read was its open-ended, inquisitive writing style.  Sometimes the notes following a case would be nothing but paragraphs of questions.  So what is the significance of the case?  So what does it all mean?  Would it have mattered if fact X was fact Y instead?  Questions to make you think are great, but they also slow your reading down.  Yes, the material is interesting, but I don't have time to rub my chin and ponder the ins, outs, what-ifs, and maybes of every case, especially when I have 50 more pages of the same due that night.  If you have a sharp Con Law professor who assigns very specific parts of the book and is able to cut through all the repetition, then the book would likely be a strong supplement to your classroom experience.  Unfortunately, my professor was HORRIBLE, and lazily assigned huge reams of reading, with almost no follow-up discussion 
 I couldn't tell you who this book was about, but it certainly wasn't Elizabeth I.  Portrayed by Gregory as a dependent almost stupid neurotic, this estimation of her character flies in the face of all accepted scholarship.  And the writing isn't so hot, either.  If I had to read one more time that Elizabeth was picking her cuticles, I would have gone mad.  The Other Boleyn Girl is a much better effort 
 Ditto to other complaints - won't separate easily- either by unscrewing or prizing.  Cheap, flimsy, leaks water also because no gasket.  I'm looking for something else and hoping reviewers will give honest good advice . . . this almost identical to product by Munchki 
 Functionally, this product holds plenty of media in an easily accessible manner.  It is not attractive to look at however.  My walnut finish was closer to a cheap mahogany, there are multiple areas where the finish migrated along the seams and left areas with nearly no finish, the varnish is very high gloss, and the knobs are low-grade, mismatched junk.  I believe the build is solid, but only time will tell.  Final word....pay the extra money for a hand-crafted cabinet where you can pick the finish and you can talk to the craftsman personally.  This just isn't worth $300 
   "Evan Cornog's masterful new look at the American presidency explores the ways our presidents craft persuasive personal narratives and how their storytelling can capture the public imagination and build the support necessary to govern," exclaims the flyleaf. In reality, this is an object lesson in how the disingenuous journalist can craft their stories to appear as scholarly research when, in fact, they are just old fashioned partisan campaigning.    Cornog's book should serve as a warning to anyone who believes the media are "objective": Cornog is an associate dean for plannig and policy at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism and publisher of the Columbian Journalism Review.    My copy of "Power and the Story" is now loaded with slips of paper, each bookmarking a lie or distortion in Cornog's campaign tract. Cornog claims that the old Soviet Union was an American stereotype rooted in habitual ignorance or modern prejudice. Just what does Cornog find admirable about the old Soviet Union? Its gulag system? Its forced exile of minorities? Like others who apparently felt that acceptance of the Soviet Union was the right thing, Cornog casts Ronald Reagan's declaration of the Soviet Union as a message "inadequate to the complexities of the world." Why do people like Cornog come out and specifically say what was good and admirable about the Soviet Union?    In Cornog's view, Lyndon Johnson embodied the Texas Populist Tradition while George W. Bush is rooted in the Conferdate past. The single tenuous reference to support this theory is to yet another overtly partisan screed. This reminds me of Stalin citing Lenin as a persuasive authority.    Time after time, Cornog bases his assertions on the assertions of other partisan and sometimes thoroughly discredited sources such as Joseph Wilson whose partisan claims were debunked by investigative committees on both sides of the Atlantic. But such minor details cannot deter a rabid partisan like Cornog from his appointed rounds. He is a part of the journalistic community, where truth is apparently the first casualty.    In the final analysis, Cornog offers sophmoric history of how - big surprise - Presidential campaigns weave legends around their candidate and how history distorts them. He pays no attention to how determined such posthumous efforts can be, as in the case of John F. Kennedy. All of his contemporary sketches are clearly skewed: Democrats are all saintly, Republicans evil.    In all, this is just another anti-Bush rant. What makes it disturbing is that the author is someone who apparently is an "educator" of future journalists. With Cornog's work as an example, we can whistle goodbye to whatever shreds of honesty and objectivity remain in journalism.  Jerr 
 This movie is like 2 and a half hours long!!! WHY?!?!? It can't decide if it wanted to be a movie about a young black professional male blowing the whistle on an "Enron like" organization and himself caught in the middle of it, or just being about a brother who was down on his luck and due to frozen assets,etc FORCED into being  the "Sperminator" to a whole bunch of "biological-clockticking" lesbians.  I kinda liked the second story better. But at the same time this movie is a bit too unrealistic. I am trying to understand why they think that every other lesbian couple or individual WANTS to have a child...let alone the "old fashioned way" (by way of the male species that is) They need to get those statistics right before putting it out there like that. Then to top it these lesbians are acting more like they are Bi-sexual and enjoying themselves in the process, no complaints or anything..it's like they WANTED to be "turned out" by this guy. And worse...they pay $10,000 for this when all they had to do was get someone from around the way, buy him  2 chicken wings and a blue soda and boom! They would have saved all the drama and trouble..and money.  There are a few celebrity appearances such as: John Turturro,Q-Tip,Brian Dennehey,Spike Lee's sister, Lonetta McKey,Jim BRown,Woody Harrelson,but they don't do  much for the script other than to make this movie seem like it's not just another "hood" movie about a guy skeezin' on woman. It's like this was unncessarily long to accomodate the "Enron-like" scandal plot and the "baby making machine" plot..they should have made it one plot and save the time and money. 
 Finney's sequel to Time and Again is a sad attempt at recapturing the success of his first novel. Maybe I was hoping for too much since the first novel was so enjoyable, but as one reviewer said, this historical novel falls flat. The ending to Time and Again was so perfect for the story Finney had created and his attempt to alter the ending was ill-advised. The possibilities with time travel are endless and you could essentially have an infinite number of sequels, but you can only strike gold once, which Finney should have realized. Read the first one and don't bother with this 
 I have read 3 books of Ann in last 3-4 months and no doubt loved it, but not sure If I am reading same info in different books with different titles from her.    I guess I am not buying this title and anymore of her unless it has way different contents...  
 The original "Fine Without You" is about 3 million times better than the techno garbage that it was remixed into.  Please, if you've got no experience with Alk3, don't judge them based on the song that they for some reason let slip onto this soundtrack.  My god.  It's as if someone said, "hey, let's drop this stereotypically boring techno beat behind this song, and speed up the voice track a bit, that'll make it OMG AWESOME"... well, they were wrong.  Seek out the Alkaline Trio/One Man Army Split EP if you want to hear the good version of this song, better yet, seek out any Alkaline Trio cd, and you'll find great music.  As a matter of fact, bypass this soundtrack altogether, it sucks 
 Actually, I couldn't even get all the way through.  It should be called "The Thoroughly Shallow Married Girl."  It's not even clever enough to by kitsch.  You could fit all the valuable or entertaining info in this book on one side of an index card 
 Title Should Be:  Just Another Six Sigma Book  I guess I'm the dumb one, because I was expecting a book that simplified and clarified the Six Sigma process.  After all, isn't that the purpose of the "for Dummies" series?  Well, this book does neither.  On page 2 of the book, near the top of the page, it says, "Six Sigma For Dummies is ... a comprehensive, actionable description of the methods and tools of Six Sigma."  A few lines later, however, it says that "...the field of Six Sigma is much too large to fit in only 400 pages."  This indecision on the authors' goals permeates the whole book.   The book has three authors, and as you read this book you suspect that they didn't collaborate at all on their approach to this topic.  For example, the statistics portion of the book is 165 pages long, with line after line after line after line of statistical info.  Then you get to the "tool" section of the book, where you will supposedly learn how to actually apply the statistics.  Even though at the beginning of this section it says, "You can't do Six Sigma without tools," the whole section of practitioner tools is less than 40 pages long.  Only a brief overview is given of each tool, without enough detail for anyone to actually do Six Sigma work!  Sure, statistics are important for Six Sigma, but for a person just being introduced to Six Sigma, the coverage is excessive and not done all that well.  If someone wants to learn statistics at this level, they would be far better off getting Basic Statistics, by Kiemele, Schmidt, and Berdine.  If someone wants a general reference book for Quality, including Six Sigma, get the massive (over 800 pages) The Six Sigma Handbook, by Thomas Pyzdek.  If someone wants a book that gives a practical and workable approach to Six Sigma in general, consider Statistics for Six Sigma Made Easy, by Brussee.    It isn't that anything presented in Six Sigma For Dummies is actually wrong.  It's just, as an earlier reviewer observed, that the book does not have a target audience.  And the book certainly doesn't fulfill the implied promise of a "dummies" book to simplify and clarify the subject.  Dedicated Black Bel 
 I'm at page 116 right now.  The writing is lovely, the specifics dense, and the sense of place rich.  If the author tries to create suspense one more time by having the father say, "I just can't go on with this story!" I'm going to throw the book at the wall.  Also, so many embarrassing little holes.  If I were a librarian I would say, "So Dracula's checked out.  Go to a bookstore.  Every bookstore in the country has a copy."  And if I were the cat, I would know I was a goner the second I appeared as indeed he does within a paragraph(you need to plant the gun in an early scene if you're going to fire it).  Lastly, it seems like Dracula would be so much more efficient if he just killed the main characters rather than killing everyone around them.  Unless "Dracula" is related to our heroine--that would be good.  Will read a bit more. . . 
 Not only was the plot unbelievable throughout the entire book, but the ending was terrible. If the authors wish to write about computers, they should do some research first and learn how computers work.   The dual-author thing is strange also. One of the authors is definitely worse than the other. They should part ways 
 I was trying to duplicate HI-8 tapes and the ADS Tech Video Express USBAV-191-EF is not a viable solution.  It drops frames and there are nothing that can be done to improve its recording.  The installation is buggy.  I ended up buying a Sony VRD-MC1 and am extremely happy with it 
 Well...unfortunatly this book is well below par. The Writer is one of many unobjective historians who has jumped on the 'anti christian pro islamic bandwagon'. Totally unobjective, apologetic historian with no orginal thought. 
 It is nice to see a book actually written on the topic of paranoia, as it is a subject sorely lacking in the literature. Unfortunately that is the only thing positive about this book. Martin Kantor writes chapter after chapter of assertions about what a paranoid person does and thinks. His assertions are so broad as to include everyone who has a differing opinion then that of the current status quo, believes that right and wrong are absolutes and not mere abstractions (Christians who actually believe and follow the Bible for example), or thinks they are being singled out for mistreatment (This would have to include many black and Hispanic people). Almost none of his conclusions and descriptions have any citations to actual research so that the book is more of an assortment of opinions than an actual scholarly text.    Some of his claims are just outright insulting such as distinguishing between PTSD and paranoia by whether a client was more interested in revenge then in receiving monetary compensation (Page 45 and 46). I guess if after 9-11 you wanted to sue bin laden then you had PTSD but if you wanted to hunt down and shoot terrorists then you were paranoid. I have known many people who have PTSD from rape and in all cases they would much rather have killed or severely beat up the rapist then collect any amount of money.          In summery using Martin Kantor's own methods I would have to conclude that Kantor is himself paranoid about people being paranoid and having sadomasochistic tendencies. 
 I don't know why this book is a classic.  Foreigners come to Babar's home and kill his mother.  He goes to the land of the foreigners to learn to be just like them because the are so swell and all.  He then takes their ways back home with him.  marries his cousin and gets everyone to wear clothes like the foreigners.  This is a nightmare, not a children's book 
 I think that TO THE LIMIT definatly had some bad acting and the story sucked but Anna Looked good 
 well lets be real here there are two really catchy songs and they stand out.Don't Let Me be the one & of course one of the baddest and rarest Bass Jams from the 80's I Can't Wait.cuz the Synths took over at will and  sadly the music hasn't recovered 
 I never wanted children. Because of the insane hype surrounding this book, I thought I was "safe" when I turned 40. I got a little sloppy with the birth control. Now I'm eleven weeks pregnant with my first child.   Thanks heaps, Hewlett. 
 This is another product placement by Gary Null Inc. repackaged with a new title and cover. Gary Null is a God and knows everything about everything. Gary knows what you should eat and how you should think. Ignore the fact that he owns a private multi-million dollar media, supplement and gadget company that sells nearly all what he advises to consume. No conflict there at all? Gary is a brilliant marketer and here are his tactics:  1)Create documenteries, radio shows, movies, lectures, books that strike fear into your audience so that they are in a constant buying mode. Make them fear to breath the air, to  drink the water and make them fear their enviornment in total. Claim that you are the authority and others are cranks aimed at harming you and your audience. Evoke fear, conspiracy theories at every turn, and taint the competition (mainstream medicine) as immoral, money grubbing and intentionally harm promoting.   2)Provide a catalog of products to calm the fear evoked. Have them buy costly air filtration and water systems, expensive magnetic products, costly vitamins and supplements, and provide media so that you can reinforce the fear and buying behaviour. Advocate a costly and restrictive diet that few could follow for long so that they will fall back on your food replacement and food concentrates as well as vitamins. Above all promise you base that if they follow your advice and buy the products  they will look young and live forever. Promise the suckers that they will avoid sickness and will be the chosen ones.   3) Claim you make little or no money and that the profits go into making public service movies even though you charge to view them, and even though the profit markup on vits and supplements run in the hundreds percent range. Claim that you have advanced degrees and are a scienctific authourity even though you went to nontraditional schools and could not get a degree from a legit University. Should anyone challenge you claim that they are part of a conspiracy to silence you even though that if false- it increases the your profile among followers.   
 ...this movie is at the top of my list...unfortunately, it's the 'worst movie of all-time' list...that's right, ladies and gentlemen, friends and supporters of this film...this movie is trash (and not just for cuba's horribly annoying acting)...it's also one of the reasons so many relationships end up miserable...come on...do you really think renee would have ended up with this guy if his career went in the other direction...it was pure desperation rather than inspiration that made him succumb to showing up with his hat in his hands...and if all you base a relationship on, is the end justifying the means, well, i wish you luck with your next soul mate.. 
 Is there substance?  Yes, not a lot, but there is a brief overview of history here.    Is there fluff?  Oh hell yes and way too much of it.  There are just way too many asides and way too much focus on kings rather than conditions.  For example, he explains that Caesar may have had a homosexual escapade in Spain.  NOT PERTINENT and a little offensive to boot.  Remove such things and you have about 50 pages of worthy reading and I have to question some of his findings in those 50.    He goes to great lengths to brush over Spanish atrocities in the New World and at Home, claiming they are basically English racism towards the Spanish designed as a PR campaign against.  I have no doubt that such existed as the two countries have long had problems, but that doesn't mean the Spanish Conquistadors weren't brutal (and downright evil at times).  And the Inquisition should never have detractors.  The most telling moment of the book happens, after detailing this "racism", he then goes on another aside to tell how the Irish sold out the Spanish for a bottle of whisky. Holy crap is that the pot calling the kettle black and how any editor would let that slip through, calls into question the entire book.  So I learned a little from it, but it's not worth your effort.  Seek other books.  
 Purists will argue that once an author has died then his output has finished. Others will argue that there's no compelling reason not play in someone else's imaginary universe if there are good new stories to be told. Certainly there's a thriving market for new Sherlock Holmes stories. I myself don't mind a continuation novel or pastiche if it's well written and captures the flavour of the original.  This book fails on both counts for me. Ultimately this is just a mystery with robots in it. Without Asimov's name to spruik it I doubt most of us would bother picking it up. Tiedemann is not a bad author but this is dry, technical stuff for the most part. His characters aren't badly drawn and there's some mildly interesting discussion of new aspects of the Three Laws but there's long, dense passages of technobabble that simply beg to be skimmed.  Some will like the dense, convoluted conspiracy, I found it tedious.   Bottom line is I'm not inspired to read the other two books in the series, which about sums up my indifference to this one 
 As far as crime dramas go, this is firmly mediocre.  The story is okay and requires suspension of disbelief only sporadically, but the author's writing style is sometimes a distraction.  Why do the African-American suspects always ask for Slice soda to drink?  And they repeatedly make a point of asking for Slice.  (Do they even make it anymore?  I thought it was replaced by Sierra Mist).   And another distracting detail is the author's way of giving so many people nicknames.  You don't need to tell me that a guy's name is Ed "Smiley" Jones if you never mention "Smiley" again or there's not something significant from a story perspective about that nickname.  That said, I liked the use of DC as the backdrop and if I was going on a plane ride, I would probably pick up another book by Pelecanos (but I wouldn't let anyone see what I was reading and then I'd leave it in the seatback when I deplaned) 
 Some things are best left as they were. The first edition was simple to read, and did not seem to be trying to be the most complete guide to cruising ever written. Unfortunately I loaned my copy to a friend and it never came back so I ordered a new copy and got this one. I think the author has tried to write about too many subjects and include too many different ideas- it comes off  like a compendium of conflicting ideas. Also this book more than the previous edition shows the author has a pretty big budget. Not the best guide for those of us with more limited funds 
 I was disappointed with this DVD. Other reviewers made it out to be an amazing performance, but I have a feeling they're just sending underseved praise to their favorite band. The performance is mediocre, at best. As a matter of fact, it's clear that the band is holding back, A LOT. Perhaps the guys knew they were being filmed for a live DVD, and took extra care not to mess up any of the songs, but the performance suffers as a result. There's far less intensity in this performance than in other live performances, or even in the CD recordings. Dan doesn't even bother attempting some of the more difficult licks in a lot of the songs. The lighting is also another sore spot on this performance. There's a crazy red tinge to everything that makes it difficult to see the band and almost hurts your eyes after a while.  That said, this DVD does have a lot of nice extras if you're a big fan of the band. There's interviews, music videos, photos, and the sound quality is excellent, but the performance itself is severely lacking in intensity and quality. If you're crazy into the Black Keys you'll probably want to pick this up, but if you're just the average fan, pass this one by 
 A very very dangerous book reminicient of the McCarythite past of this country where decent people whose views clashed with the right-wing bullies; were lynched and intimidated in public discourse.  There should be a huge outcry against books such as these whose merits are dubious and whose sole motivation is political smear and revenge.  Typical of a neoconservative icon like the pro-Israeli Horowitz whose fellow neocon warmongerers scared the American people into the invasion of Iraq and now dangerously Iran...  American better wake up and smell the fifth column of neocons amongst us. One of their trademark traits is their consistent reliant on fear and shameful exploitation of world terrorism to further their agenda for Israel, a country they'd die before they criticize.   It is precisely in that motivation that honest academians are being crucified in his hatefest Horowitz calls a book.   As is always the case, its best to question and do some digging about the source that smears before you latch onto his fears.    It then goes into length about history of the Democratic Party and how it has nothing, nada good to offer. A fact which is interesting considering the author's own lovefest with the Party when he was a 60's hippie.   If Horowitz seems content in bashing his own roots so be it because that in a nutshell is what this book is about, exposing what Mr. Horowitz's considers his own shameful past.  Highly recommended for the easily brainwashed amongst us 
 Another "Me Too" book. Nothing new in this book that you can find in a hundred other better books 
 I've just finished this book and found it rather annoying. Though I have enjoyed the Pitt series along the way, it seems that Anne Perry plays fast and loose with historical facts and, in this story, contrives an entirely unlikely key to resolve the plot.  Although no date for the story is given it appears to be set about 1880. The fact that Pitt and other characters have telephones at home, when the telephone was first invented in 1876 and not in general use until much later, is one problem. Another is a reference to someone's having seen another character's photograph in the newspaper, when photos were not used in newspapers until considerably later.  The chief bad guy in this story, police inspector Wetron, supposedly knows that one of his underlings is trying to catch him in illegal acts. So Perry has him leave a clue in his office that will lead the underling to his home, where apparently Wetron is planning on catching him. But the clue he leaves in his office is the real thing - a link to his criminal activity. How dumb can that be? And then he allows the underling to spirit him off on a wild goose chase in the middle of the night while his house is searched. The ridiculousness of this ruined the story for me. 
 He doesn't deserve that Nobel.... It was a political decision 
 I have had this printer for almost four years now, and while it has saved my bacon on the road a number of times, it has also really let me down at some crucial moments. First, like a lot of older Canon printers, it is noisy and slow. It takes forever to get started on a page. But also like a lot of canons, when it is working right the output is beautiful. But you cannot count on finding ink cartridges for this printer on the road. It also has a weird and unpleasant ink cartridge system which includes two very different little trays, and three different kinds of tank. But what made me finally leave the thing in a hotel room was its tendency to get halfway through a print job and jam or inexplicably give an error signal. I have spent hours trying to get a clean copy of a single transparency. Very frustrating. 
 My preschool classes have all loved MUD PUDDLE.  The repetition with in the story is great.  We love to have an excuse to shout, "Hey, Mud Puddle." We've even made up actions to go with the bathing and dressing portions of the story.  I love this author and this is by far my favorite of his stories 
 You've got to love Walter Hill -- he starts out by very haughtily decrying Special Edition DVDs but saying that his masterpiece The Warriors is an exception... for basically the same reasons as George Lucas and every other director has given for their mucked-up Special Eds. Nice try, Walt.  Worse, he has butchered his own film into a comic-strip digital monstrosity, replete with cheesy digital graphics and a terrible intro. that evinces nothing much more than a glossing of Steven Pressman. This is really inexcusable when it comes to a film like The Warriors, where its reputation lies primarily in its late-70s atmosphere 
 I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.  Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.  Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time 
 This product is difficult to sqeeze out of the bottle, need to use a lot of product to condition hair and just not happy with results. Hair seems stringy and has fly aways after use 
 I almost bought this book but then read the 9/11 report and was reminded that Mr. North broke the law, was indicted, and then was pardoned because of a technicality;and now for some reason, there are those trying to make a hero out of him....he's taken  advantage of his ill begotten fame and has made himself a millionaire...Fox news loves him....I then decided not to contribute to his coffers... 
 I did research for a dvd player combo  that can convert my vhs tapes to dvd and also provide an upconversion for my dvd collection to my new Panasonic lcd tv. The tv is great! I thought it would be neat to buy the same brand for the same reason but I was wrong. The vcr seems to work fine it's the dvd player that's the problem! It would load to the dvd menu screen and freeze and stay there. You can't navigate because it just would freeze and leave you frustrated. I've resetted the machine a billion times tried everything even copied a cd-r firmware from Panasonic to the machine and nothing. It would work sometimes and then when you want to relax and watch a dvd it just won't comply. I called Panasonic and they had no idea this was happening...they said they would send me a packaging slip so that I ship the machine to them. It's been over 2 weeks and nothing has been shipped to me.   Panasonic let me down!  
 Boring academic jargon at its worst. I have PhD so should be used to this sort of thing, but found it useless. Save your money for a readable book 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 Shortly after I began using my head phones, I noticed the wiring at the hinges was starting to crack the wire coating.  Within 8 months of not-very-heavy use, the left earpiece wouldn't work any more.  Guess I can't send them back, since I didn't keep the box!  Also, the battery pack is in an annoying place - every time I turn my head, it catches on something 
 When I bought this DVD, I was all jazzed up that I would be watching more great SNL moments (after the first edition was released) of one of my favorite participants: Will Ferrell. After watching it, I not only wanted to rip the disk from the player, but I wanted to go boot the DVD out the door. I had been expecting his BEST of and all I recieved was extensions of the first volume. On the first volume, they had cute little snippets of skits that obviously didn't deserve to waste space with a joke that dragged on. I can only describe the decision of whomever picks the segments on these "Best of" DVDs as having inside jokes with their friends that derived from certain skits. I agree with a previous review in that buying Elf or Anchorman would be a better choice. This DVD surely stunk.  
 This book was as useless as the German version of Strarwars that I received on Amazo 
 Much of what appears in this book is largely based on second or third-hand, suspect information. Don't waste your money on this poorly-written, self-absorbed, speculative (at best) tabloid in hard cover. Rather, spend your money on works like "Shout", I Me Mine, or the Hunter Davies treatise on the Beatles 
 It is nice to see that so many writers still believe in a Newtonian universe.  Deterministic, with a Prime Mover.  No bothersome questions about the origins of the universe, no need to explore the vastness of space, and a deep distrust of the possibilities contained in each new generation.  But it's ok.  Darwin loves you, man.   
 I was very disappointed with this book.  Overpriced and overwritten -- it could have been condensed to a 20 page monograph.  This is not coming from any "elitist" martial arts perspective, just a practical value-for-money perspective.  The only valuable section is the description of single-stick fighting.  You are just as well to search on google for single stick fighting, or look at the EJMAS articles for free 
 Interesting experimental fiction.  In Big Trouble, Barry employs the technique of shifting protagonists so well that in the end the reader isn't sure who the story is about.  Characters are abandoned with abandon and neglected through carelessness, leaving a laser sharp focus on what the novel is really about--which is not the psychodelic frog.  It's something less original.  The genre is also well disguised.  Is it a comedy or a thriller?  If a novel is funny, can we take the thriller part seriously enough?  In some cases, yes.  When, for example, the comedy is built on clever dialogue by characters truly capable of mayhem.  In this case, no.  It's a little jarring when a comic cop is traveling around, chained to an entertainment center, while a teenage girl is in the clutches of a sex-oriented crazy.  In all fairness, the novel does feature a ticking clock, which is handy to have in a thriller.  It's more effective if there is something believable about the story.  I expected a novel with an overdose of silliness, but I was spared that, which was a plus.  No characters with absurdly meaningful names.  The nuts and bolts aspect of writing was competently performed.  While there was little depth to any characters, that's probably less of a requirement for characters  we want to laugh at.  The characters could have used some personality, but that's a common flaw.  The novel should have been funny in places, for a list of situations would show some potential.  But I had no difficulty keeping a straight face throughout.  Others would disagree.  The politically incorrect portrayal of Miami was entertaining, if not actually funny.  The overall effect of reading Big Trouble is to bring about a yearning for the days when an editor would say, "Sir, I know your name is a household word, and I know we could make money on whatever you write, but I have to turn down too many good novels to give a green light to...to something like this."  If there ever were such days.  
 After taking the test, I'm surprised that more people haven't taken the time to point out this book's flaws. I used the MSPress books to study exclusively for the 290 and 291 exams, and did fine on both. After reading this book, I thought this exam would be a piece of cake. After taking some practice tests, I realized that much more material would be required.  The book nurses you through subnetting and basic DNS, just like the 291 book does - possibly even at a slower pace. The topics which are really heavily covered on the exams are introduced, but barely explored. How did the author fit so little substance into so many pages?  It's especially disappointing after the 291 book, which is right on target with the exam. This books acts as if you've never heard of TCP/IP or DNS. Maybe this is Microsoft's philosophy that you can take any one individual test and become an MCP. But honestly, who takes the 293 alone? It makes no sense to waste half the book explaining things that people preparing for this test should already know.  So the short summary is, if you're picking and choosing which MSPress titles to use in your MCSE study, this is the one to skip.  By the way, I'm always wary of reviews by bitter test-takers who have just failed and are PO'd. So for the record, I passed.  Good luck 
 I think that this CD by far is one of if not the best. One other thing, if there is anybody out there that is a big Doc Watson fan, years ago he had a guitar course out, does anybody know how I could get one or even if it  still exist? Thank You for taking the time to read this 
  Now, don't ch'all get me wrong, I enjoys me an offbeat comedy as much as the next person.  Heck, I myself am as "offbeat" as it gets this side O' the cuckoo's nest.  And yeah, I chuckled two, maybe three times during the course of this one and a half hour movie.  But that ain't a good laughs to minutes ratio, boys `n' girls.  Problem is, I prefer my offbeat comedies to be funny...I'm funny that way.  I s'pose I can see why some O' the people of Airheadzona might think this is a great comedy...after all, Airheadzona's collective I.Q. rating is commensurate with its average temperature during the dog days of Summer.  But what excuse does the rest O'Yous have?  Not to worry; I'm a-gonna buy each and every one O'Yous a REAL, fully-developed Sense O'Humor for Christmas this year. (Provided The Comedy Store has `em on sale. I doesn't like to pay me full price!) 
 A daily task or 365 ways to save money works if you can stay focused that long. Yet, this is life and one person saying they can do it doesn't alway work for other peoples money.  Specifics other than an author saying me,  me, me all the time is how I have learned to invest 
 If you are fourteen and read your first bestseller, you might finish it... But if you have read more than 10 books in your life..this is soooo boring 
 The editors' presentation of this book as a dismantling of blowhards at the hands of academics is misleading in the sense that it suggests the contributors represent the field of anthropology in general and not a particular clique within it. The book unfolds predictably as indicated by the dedication: "To Franz Boas and Margaret Mead." - How much you'll appreciate it will likely coincide with how much you appreciate the legacies of these two individuals in anthropology. This is not a book that encompasses the whole of anthropology's conflicts with popular journalism. The anthropologists stick to offering arguments that attempt to appear uplifting while their pundit opponents are always the cruel, imperialistic, genetic determinists who are too negative about human nature. This is not to say that the pundits criticized don't deserve it, or that the contributors' articles are not at least somewhat coherent, but the book follows a political thrust as opposed to a scientific one.   
 I have used Shure, Sony, Ultimate Ears, etc. over the years and these are properly one of the worst fitting ear buds I have ever used.  No matter how I tried, I just can't get them to fit right, let alone use them for when I work out.  I am a big Sennheiser fan but this was a big disappointment 
 This book focuses on a couple driving home from a party. His drunken wife asleep, the man apparently, though NEVER explained, stumbles into a ghostly situation and area. It haunts him and the story was spooky and original - almost like a old legend you've heard with terrifying creatures - when it wasn't being dragged along, or missing pieces. Again, Mr.Golden chooses a weak male as the character; he pieces things together slowly to save his possessed wife and the little girl that haunts him...When the ending comes, you'll be asking yourself "why didn't he do this, or "why did that happen that way"? because it just doesn't make sense! There are too, too many loose ends left untied that will leave you wondering, and even more things that just aren't addressed. Again, great story, but not worth reading with so much missing. Like clues that are never explained. Why is this house unfindable, and yet located in every country? Why was the main point of the story- the little girl - no longer important near the end? I'm so annoyed. I'm going to have to re-sell this 
 This book is lacking for sensible sturcture. Seems to put a reader into a maze and leaves them wondering where there at. There are enough topics but their too full of proofs to really understand what the book is trying to explain. This book would even be diffucult for a graduate student that's using it for review. The author seems to be proving his mathematical talent instead of trying to explain the topics in a manor that's understandable to the average reader 
 With a pacing that only Tsai Ming-liang could love and deliberate scenery shots that you are forced to enjoy "House of Sand" steps into the genre best described as the Foreign Doldrums. Moving as fast as thick molasses never wins any points in my book and considering that that seems to be the main goal of this film we didn't get along too well. The entirety of the movie takes place in the Brazilian desert, a place that we movie fans rarely get to see. However, as you may have guessed, not a lot happens out there. There isn't even a weeping camel out there to keep us company. We watch as a crazy old guy moves his family out into the middle of nowhere (no explanation given) and then dies, stranding everybody else there for three generations. I know, how can I criticize a plot for not having any developments (other than the startling revelation that somewhere out yonder sells salt!) when in reality nothing would ever happen to these characters. And to that I would say that this was not the best yarn to commit to film.  Pretty much everything goes as would be expected. People walk around bored, some of them die off, there are some minor romances, and everything looks beautiful. About ten years in a group of soldiers shows up and Aurea, the crazy man's wife, desperate for anything that moves, strikes up a love affair with one of them. He promises to take her out of the desert, but unforeseen problems prevent that from happening. Throughout more soldiers will arrive, and the females will always view them as tickets out of town, there to be seduced and exploited. Do I believe that these fellow travelers are the only way these women could escape their destiny? Maybe, maybe not. In the end the point is made that living in the Brazilian desert is just about the same as living on the moon, to which I would have to think that moving your family into the middle of the desert and then croaking might to be too smart.  Another minor complaint I would like to air is the usage of the same actors to play different roles. It would be fine, in a "Three Times" kind of way, had they bothered to label the passage of time. Instead I was left playing catch up thinking that somehow the grandma had risen from the grave. There is a fairly graphic sex scene somewhere in the middle that might shock you out of your slumber, but really the only use it has is spicing up this overtly bland stew. You have to be in a certain kind of mood to watch a movie like this, and even then it is nearly impossible for the director to pull off. "Rain" and "Elephant" leap to mind as masterpieces of this technique. These characters really may have been marooned out in no man's land, but unfortunately for the filmmakers the exit of the theater is just a few short steps away. I wasn't lucky enough to have seen this in theaters, but I would have been mighty interested to see how many people took a walk. Awe-inspiring cinematography does not make a movie. . .and here is my proof. **1/4  
 GREEN NAZI ZOMBIES COMING FROM THE BOTTOM OF A SWIMMING POOL TO FEED ON THE LIVING? AUGHH!!! BAD ACTING, BAD DIRECTION, TERRIBLE GORE, TOO LONG FLASHBACK HORRABLE DUBING AND THE PORN MUSIC IN THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE TELLS YOU WERE THEY WANTED TO GO WITH THIS PICTURE. DAMN THIS MOVIE SUCKS..... 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 I expected a book on how to read body language.  This book does NOT do that.  He really focuses on how my body should look.  That is about it.  Not a whole lot of great information.  The exercises they suggest are not good.  When you are done with the book, you realize that body language is important that our understanding of it should be better.  But AGAIN that is it 
 This one's easy.  The lies start showing up even in the book description.  "The Zionists established a sovereign Jewish state in 1948. Had they been content with that, peace might have followed the 1967 war, when Israel could have backed the creation of a Palestinian state in the occupied territories."  Actually the Zionists were willing to accept the tiny country that was initially Israel, but the surrounding Arab nations attackeed immediately.  After the 1967 war, Israel offered virtually all the so-called West Bank, but without East Jerusalem, back to Jordan.  They offered Gaza back to Egypt.  They did not offer the Golan Heights back to Syria, because they no longer wanted to be sitting ducks for Syria's artillery.  Israel's offer of the West Bank and Gaza back to Jordan and Egypt was offered at a price: recognition, peace and negotiation.  At the 1967 Arab summit in Kartoum, the Arabs responded to Israel's offer with No, No and No.  Israel had every right at this point to annex the territories won in a defensive war, but under pressure from the U.S. and elsewhere, Israel did not.  After the war, in 1967, there was no talk of a Palestinian state in the territories.  For 19 years Jordan occupied the West Bank, and there was no Arab or Palestinian clamor for a Palestinian state.  For 19 years Egypt occupied Gaza, and there was similar silence.  There was no reason for Israel to talk about yet another Arab state when even the Arabs hadn't talked about it.  The whole idea of a Palestinian state was a concept invented by the surrounding Arab nations to make war against Israel by a new method: public relations.  If they could make the world believe that Israel was an occupier of lands not theirs, they hoped world opinion could defeat Israel where Arab armies could not.  Nevertheless, in 1973 the Arab nations tried yet again, but were trounced, and the war by public relations started to ramp up.  In my opinion, Neuman's solution, "The only solution is for Israel to withdraw, unilaterally, to its 1948 borders.", shows real impoverishment of thought.  For almost 60 years the Middle East's Arab and Muslim nations have been trying, unsuccessfully, to destroy a nation that was recognized by the United Nations and which was purchased totally and legitimately from recognized landowners, but it is Israel which must surrender?  At the time of Israel's creation, Arabs who were residents and who had not decided to flee (at the request of the attacking Arab nations) were to be given full political rights, unlike, for example, Jordan (Transjordan at the time), in which Jews were not allowed to live.  In fact, although there is racism on the part of individuals in Israel, Israel itself is not a racist state.  It is the surrounding Muslim and Arab nations who are the racists.  In my opinion, Neumann's book, even if you consider only its Book Description, is trash in the spirit of the anti-Semitc Czarist forgery, Protocols of the Elders of Zion 
 The authors do a fine job explaining the concepts behind object relational mapping in general and Hibernate in particular.  Too bad the book is absolutely crippled by its index.  For instance, there is no entry for "discriminator" (or anything close to that), so to go back to that section where I positively recall reading about this term, I have to browse the whole book.  Ridiculous.  Furthermore, the following statement by the authors themselves throws this entire technology into question: "Retrieving persistent objects from the database is one of the most interesting (and complex) parts of working with Hibernate."  If this is so complex, than the Java community has been sold a bill of goods, and its no wonder the exodus to Ruby is gaining momentum 
 I should have read the previous review before ordering, because this product did not work at all.  The on/off button did not work/click.  The light produced a very faint light, less than a cell phone emits.  Don't buy this product; there are better flashlights out there 
 I purchased this book for an overview of Acrobat 6.0. While there is some good info, too much is not explained fully. There are constant cross references "see chapter 8", no page reference and the bulk of the book is for the pro version. The author spends a lot of time using fancy nomenclature (not technical terms) instead of offering better tips. I would love to see a Special Edition Using Acrobat from Que Publishing. That series is excellent for learning software. I will look for a better book. 
 I was not satisfied with the quality of the digital pictures on this Ziga Digital Frame. I returned it 
 Curtis White's diatribe against the usual suspects is mostly unreadable waffle, but it's worth browsing through the few lucid sections where he stops trying to decide whether Derrida made the world a better place and takes specific works of popular culture to task. His merciless demolition of Saving Private Ryan is hilarious, his dismissal of American Beauty less so. Mildly diverting is his hagiography of David Lynch and Blue Velvet.   Discussing Radiohead's Kid A, he flays Nick Hornby for his (widely shared) opinion that Radiohead's follow-up to OK Computer was, musically speaking, rubbish. I can't agree with Hornby on Kid A's musical merits (Everything In Its Right Place, In Limbo and Morning Bell are wonderful tunes to my ears) but that's just my mileage varying. I take more serious issue with White, who thinks that all we have any business caring about when judging Kid A are its iconoclasm, its motivating philosophy, and the form (not the content) of its music. For White, the merits of the music _as music_ don't come into it. What a philistine argument. If the tunes on Kid A were no good, all the rest would be completely moot.  The rest of the book pads out these morsels with the kind of self-important bilious rambling that lacks the discipline to make any sort of memorable point. Blecch. 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 I don't like this CD at all what happeed to the classy Monica???   Too Ghetto.... Such a waste of such a beautiful voice!!   
 I have never actually thrown a book across the room in frustration - and I love books, so this is drastic!  Spoilers ahead - please don't read on if you haven't read the book.  I managed to (somehow) get through the first book, 'Wideacre', which I disliked - whilst I adore the rest of Gregory's novels, so this was hard for me - and grit my teeth and tried to read this book, the sequel as I'd bought it and it looked more promising.  It was 'marginally better' as one reader put it, than the first, but a very depressing and frustrating book indeed.  I was getting very angry and frustrated after the second half of the book - as many other readers have highlighted, Julia's consistent inability to stand up to Richard made it impossible for me to like her anymore.  I quite honestly wanted to slap her to wake her up from that dreamy state she was in!  Because I wanted so much for Julia to be with James - who I liked a great deal.  I was so depressed after everything went wrong and she didn't marry him... ah, because I was expecting the usually very clever Ms Gregory to surprise me and have a twist at the end and say, aha!  She does get her true love in the end and she and Ralph get rid of Richard and although it's not happily ever after she learns to grow a backbone and be the very first female heir to Wideacre.  The rape scene with Julia and Richard was very violent and far too detailed and I think it may be difficult to stomach for anyone who has ever been in an abusive situation like that, in fact, for anyone at all.  I don't want to get into the tricky area of abortion too much, but I really did feel strongly that Julia should have gone to Ralph for help when she concieved the child with Richard.  This was a child of incest and rape - and she knew in her heart there should be no heir for Wideacre - they were all simply too inbred and it needed to end somewhere for nothing was going right.  Clean slate, so to speak.  Yet she gives the child away - then in her final letter asks James to find the child?!  What?!  And I was expecting perhaps a deformed child, after all this inbreeding (I mean this child is the product of parents who are brother and sister AND grandparents who are brother and sister!!!) but she was perfect and beautiful.  I was hoping the gypsies would keep her and she'd never be found again.. but alas, the Lacey madness will live on...  The perfect end to this book would have been a nice twist.  Gregory could have made her very good point about inheritance rights and the lack of power women of Beatrice and Julia's era had by Richard being killed by Ralph, then Julia inheriting the land - baby Sarah is adopted out to the gypsies and never seen again and Julia either lives as a widow and runs the land or (this would have been lovely - I bet all the girls have sighed over James a little, didn't you?  he was a little like the handsome romantic leads in Austen's books) James forgave her - for they had both made mistakes and Julia's was not intentional nor her fault (I was practically screaming at her that it wasn't her fault - and she gets it in the end, when it's too late!) and they marry and have 'normal' children - or perhaps none, they just learn from their mistakes and respect each other, and make a fresh start for Wideacre.  There were so many allies that Julia had - she was a sweet girl and I liked her - I wish that I could have shaken her though, I got so mad.  So many people in the village offered their help - this trap she was caught in with Richard could have been avoided - ahhh... SO frustrating.  I will not be reading the third book in the series.  I shall go back to reading Gregory's more historic novels (A Constant Princess is one I haven't read yet and it sounds excellent).  I wouldn't recommend this one 
 Take advice from somebody who is able to easily win over others easily.  The advice and beliefs shown in this book are just wrong.  If you want to do really well.  Do what others that are doing well are doing.  Adopt the beliefs, mannerisms, attitude,  techniques, ideas  of who you wish to be like  and you'll get the same results.  in other words.  Don't copy John Gray.  
 The people rating this high must be paid to do so.  It's just riddled with historical inaccuracy ... Fuller's book on this topic is SO much better that I'm still kicking myself for buying this.    Just because I made the mistake doesn't mean you have to. 
 After reading the 1st two books in Robin Hobb's Farseer Trilogy and enjoying them immensely, I was more than just a little disappointed in the 3rd volume.   Hobb appears to have burnt out.  He devotes pages and pages to boring pointless journeys, opens a promising theme - Old Blood - and never develops it and his evil king character develops a split personality, alternatly swinging from evil genius to drug addeled dilettante.  I finished the book but it  was so poorly done I had a real hard time not just chucking it part way thru.      
 Sleep better?  How could you sleep better when your pillow has a WARNING- FLAMABLE label?  Scary.  The pillows are soft but does not have great neck support.  I'm usually a side or stomach sleeper.  The pillows are better for hugging 
 Ms Estes book is pernicious nonsense. She is a shining example of new age muddleheadedness. Such pretentious intellectual blather so easily leads to unadulterated self indulgence. That her "work"  is a hit makes me  shudder. Jack Rosenbaum, aka Werner Erhard, pulled off a similar financial  coup with EST. ESTes, with an e, is right in the soupscam with EST and the  bucks that follow. At least Shirley Maclaine did it with a smile 
 Overcoming the Fear of Success is hands down, the worst, most destructive book I have ever read.  When I read it at age 16, what it did was convince me that my own unconscious or subconscious mind was "out to get me" and derail me of every attempt I made at success.  So instead of helping me, the book ended up hurting me a great deal. I cannot tell how many times I think about this book in my life (I'm now 40) and the terror it brought me.  The author basically said you could overcome the fear of success only through much work or at least modify your fear. So basically, in some instances, you could never really overcome it.  This is a psychiatrist with a major, delusional mental illness who is trying to help the readers overcome their mental "illness", but instead, what she accomplishes is a FEAR OF THE FEAR OF SUCCESS in her readers and a terror of living within your own skin.  The book is very poorly written (I have read it three times) and I HIGHLY reccommend you do NOT buy this book.  It is awful and full of "hearsay" and incorrect information. Thank you, Martha Friedman, for causing me to spend many years and alot of money on unneeded therapists and continual worry. You have been a discredit to your profession and have caused needless pain and suffering in people instead of help 
 We bought the bumbo seat for our five month old baby. By her fifth month she fell on her face with it still attached to her bottom. She was hurt pretty bad. No way this seat can keep the baby in place with its own weight.  Please beware of how unsafe this product is. Not at all what is advertised.  
 Great! Karen Zelan writes a sensitive book about working with autistic children. Here's my rage and despair about this book. Zelan worked for years with Bruno Bettelheim. She co-authored books with him. And she witnessed his terrible abuse against mentally ill children at the Orthogenic School where she once worked. Many of the autistic children she knew lived at this school. Why did Zelan not report any of this abuse? Because of her silence and the silence of many others, young children, teens and young adults were constantly beaten and shamed in Bettelheim's "House of Horrors" for over 30 years. And children were beaten with fists and belts, smacked repeatedly in the face and told horrible things. It was all common knowledge if you worked there. So Karen Zelan cannot say she knew nothing of such things.  Read books like Richard Pollak's, "The Creation of Dr. B." or Stephen Eliot's, "Not the Thing I Was" or Jacqui Sanders' chapter on discipline in "A Greenhouse of the Mind", if you just can't believe it. Why should Zelan be allowed to benefit from writing this book about love and acceptance of autistic childen when she 1)did nothing to stop the abuse against autistic as well as mentally ill and traumatized children while she witnessed it and 2) has done nothing to make amends for her silence by now speaking out about the abuse and the legacy of silence.  How can she even live with such hypocrisy in her soul. Because of her silence and the silence of others, I was beaten and shamed for being confused and terrified. And I resent the hypocrisy of her being the sensitive autism guru when she seems to have had no problem watching disturbed children get beaten 
 If I could give this book zero stars, I would do so. There's barely a plot: the protagonist, Janie, marries three men and kills the last one because he gets rabies. The end. Janie is the ultimate antiheroin. She comes off as this oppressed little wife who takes forever to speak out against her husbands. It would have been better if Alice Walker had not "found" Zora Hurston and brought this awful book back into the public. 
 After reading this book, I would like to make three points about it:  1.) First of all, DON'T MAKE THIS YOUR FIRST DEAN KOONTZ BOOK.  This is the second book of the so-called Christopher Snow trilogy.  Read the first book in the trilogy first -- FEAR NOTHING.  The first book introduces pretty much all the key characters that you find in this book.  2.) Second, please be aware that Koontz has yet to write the third book in the Christopher Snow trilogy.  This is a real shame, because SEIZE THE NIGHT ends on a cliffhanger of sorts.  Koontz has claimed that he will write the third book someday, under the title RIDE THE STORM.  But since it's been over eight years since Koontz has written a Snow novel, I wouldn't expect this book anytime soon.    3.) Third, I must admit I didn't really care for this book at all, and I say that as a Koontz fan.  Lots of padding -- the action doesn't really start until page 250.  Koontz wastes a LOT of space repeating things he originally wrote in FEAR NOTHING.   I found myself skipping through this book quite a bit to get to the good parts.  The plot here is also too over the top -- plot elements include time travel, killer monkeys, alternate realities, serial killers conducting government experiments -- and that's just the tip of the iceberg!  Even the characters in the book don't seem to take any of it seriously.  All the dialogue in this book is whimsical and unrealistic.  I was therefore never able to suspend disbelief for this book.  It was just too silly for my tastes.  Koontz is a great writer, but his best novels are the ones that have a more believable, fast-paced plot.  Instead of this book, I would therefore recommend WATCHERS, INTENSITY, ODD THOMAS or VELOCITY.  
 This movie stunk. I hate this movie. I should throw my copy out the window. I should pee on it. The way you shake it i cant beleive it you make my pee pee go badoing doing dump 
 It claims to be "the saddest story I have ever heard". Well, it is certainly not the saddest story I have ever read. Usually, sad things happen to good, thinking people. It is beyond my understanding how this tepid book can have so good a reputation. No doubt, adultery and the passions that surround it can be a great subject to write a novel, but the problem here is that characters are at the same time plain and unsympathetic. The trick, in my opinion, is that they pass for profound people, when in fact they are void, useless and jobless persons. The florid language in which the book is written gives the impression of psychological depth, but the truth is these characters have not much to search for within their personalities. Edward Dowell, the narrator, is the typical cuckold, unaware that his hypocritical wife is sleeping with another man -his friend, to make it worse- under his nose. Fool. Florence Dowell is a typical hypocrite (funny, they all seemed to me to be the "typical" something, which may tell you how profound I found them), an emotional blackmailer. Her husband gives his life to her, devotes himself to take care of her illness, and she goes and sleeps with a friend. And she's not even sexy or wicked or nymphomaniac. She's just an unfaithful common woman. Pig. Leonora Ashburnham is at the same time proud, detestable, arrogant and fool. She devotes her life to mend the fences broken by her irresponsible, philandering husband, who spends all his money on other women and gambling. Leonora is always there for him. Dumb. And John, well, John Ashburnham... Lucky guy. Rich, seductive, idle, always generous to easy women, always losing money and depending on his wife to talk to creditors. Always with nothing to do but seduce other women, including friends' wives. Pathetic loser.  The funny thing is, everybody knows what's going on but no one does anything about it, and later they all complain and are perplexed. Boring and despicable lives make, in this case, for a bad novel, representative of the worst traits of XX century literature. The ending is exhilarating by way of trying to be tragic and moving 
 This is not scholarship, this is bad science fiction. If it was possible to give a book less than one star, I would--preferably minus five. All of Gardner's books are ridiculous, but this one goes even further than most. If anyone thinks this is scholarship, I suggest they actually read the footnotes and follow up. They will find there's nothing scholarly about it. I am all for alternative history, if it IS history. I'm also for identifying fiction as fiction 
 The Scientific Method applied to this book:  1) Form a hypothesis:  Great managers do something differently than mediocre managers. 2) Conduct an experiment:  Interview 80,000 managers. 3) Analyze data: ???this step is missing??? 4) Draw conclusions: Write this Book.  With the exception of the "12 questions", the authors make no attempt to back any their conclusions with the results of their study.  They make several insightful statements, such as "many managers say they would like to define the right outcomes."  However, they do not even attempt to tell the reader how the study led them to this statement.  Did 90% of the managers interviewed state this?  Did 60% of the great managers state this while only 10% of the mediocre managers did?  Does "many managers" mean 100 managers?  100 managers seems like "many managers" at first, but considering 80,000 were interviewed I 100 managers is a negligible amount.  The entire book consists of several rational statements that are not supported by their study.    It seems to me that after conducting a huge study to find out what great managers do differently, the authors found almost no common trends.  However, since they put a lot of money and effort into conducting the study, they needed something to show for it and wrote this book.  If Buckingham and Coffman didn't claim this book was a result of "the largest study of its kind," I would say it offers some decent advice;  however, since it does make this claim, I wish they would have back up their conclusions so the readers would be able to determine how valid they are.   
 This dictionary is just another long-winded, pretentious, unreadable, high-brow attempt to legitimize anthropology. The authors of each definition are more concerned with impressing their peers than giving the average person clear insight to cultural anthropology. If you are struggling through a cultural anthropology class, and are looking for a dictionary with clear definitions, forget this book 
 I had high hopes for this book but my expectations were not met.  The authors are clearly eager to bear the Freakonomics mantle (they say as much in several places), but unfortunately they do not exhibit anything resembling the flair of Levitt and Dubner.  Their cute comparison of quarterbacks and mutual funds just sounds like a cheap imitation of the comparison between teachers and sumo wrestlers (which, honestly, wasn't all that clever anyway).  Much of the other writing also seems to imitate the conversational style of Bill James, but without as much wit.  Overall the writing comes off as alternately condescending and self-congratulatory, and sometimes both.  Style aside, the book contains a number of substantive weaknesses.  For example, the chapter on the effects of labor shortages on fan attendance shows clear signs of bias.  The authors favorably cite plenty of evidence that supports their hypothesis; and when confronted with evidence to the contrary, they suddenly decide to pick it apart and explain it away.  Sorry guys, it doesn't work that way.  This clear example of "disconfirmation bias" causes the chapter to lose all credibility.  It wouldn't hold up in a peer-reviwed journal.  Further, although the authors claim to be "taking measure of the many myths in modern sport" (the subtitle of the book), they actually devote a lot of effort to knocking down strawmen.  Is there anyone alive who really thinks that "the best players in basketball score the most" or that "quarterbacks should be credited with wins and losses"?  No one with more than a passing knowledge of sports actually believe these things, but the authors act awfully smug after debunking these nonexistent "myths."  Yes, we're all aware that offense is at most half of football, and that the passing attack is only about half of that.  Luckily no one attributes wins to quarterbacks, except maybe to point out that a team can win with a mediocre QB (e.g., pointing out Trent Dilfer's career winning percentage) -- which is a different issue altogether.  The book also spends a lot of time trying to analyze basketball using methods that are much better suited to baseball.  Don't get me wrong, I admire their effort to subject basketball to some analytical rigor.  But baseball is largely an amalgam of statistics and can be studied as such.  Basketball simply cannot.  There are too many events in basketball that clearly affect the game but are not quantified (a pick, a shot that is altered but not blocked, a team deciding not to drive against a particular player, a player drawing a double team and getting a teammate open, the second-to-last pass of a possession).  One might conclude, based on the demonstrated strong correlation between wins and the conventional statistics employed in this book, that these events are all relatively unimportant.  But this argument ultimately fails because the purpose of the analysis is to measure the contributions of individual players.  A team might score two points but the model does not adequately break down individual contributions beyond who scores the points and, if applicable, who gets the assist.  Similarly, most of what happens on defense isn't recorded, and the model only takes into account steals and blocked shots.  The authors sweep these weaknesses under the rug and proceed to devote dozens of pages to comparing players based on their new, supposedly superior, measures of individual performance.  This is an enormous flaw.  Further, I was also struck how a team of economists could write about the value of basketball players without paying attention to the supply curve.  They do adjust some of their stats for league-average at the position, but not on a category-by-category basis.  In the final chapter, where they purport to show that scorers are paid too much, they fail to examine the issue of scarcity.  My wild guess is that the data would support their conclusion, but I was struck by the absence of real analysis here.  Of course, no book on sports statistics and/or economics is complete without the obligatory nod to the genius of Billy Beane and the claim that salary disparities do not lead to competitive imbalance.  This version of the story is no more convincing than any of the others.  They happily point to the 2003 Marlins as an example of a low-payroll team winning against the odds, but somehow ignore the fact that a number of those players (Derrek Lee, A.J. Burnett, Josh Beckett, Ivan Rodriguez, Alex Gonzalez, Mike Lowell) are now earning big salaries in big markets while the Marlins are under .500.  Sure, a team can win with young players who haven't yet become eligible for free agency or arbitration, but is that any way to build a franchise for long-term success?  Where is the analysis of that rather obvious question?  And where is the point, made quite clear in Moneyball, that no inefficient market can last forever?  What happens when the next Billy Beane is hired to run the Yankees?  I will grant that the book is thought-provoking.  But ultimately there are many other books on sports statistics and economics that are much more readable and well-argued than this 
 I passed on the hard copy of Unstuck more than once. When I saw the updated and revised paperback edition, I thought I should grab it. Having recently spent quality time with Ideaspotting, Zag and re-rereading The Brand Gap, it seemed to fit well with them both in spirit and purpose. Also, since Keith Yamashita's firm is mentioned in both The Brand Gap and Zag, I figured there must be something to it.   The idea for the book apparently came out of an MBA course at Yale which in turn led the authors to the realization that very few books "function as in-the-moment tools that let you take instant action." They point out that they ended up creating a set of flash cards which were a hit. Oddly, the book does not come with the flash cards.   Pity.   On the plus side: * Unstuck tells us that there are seven primary causes, the "serious seven" for getting stuck. One of them probably corresponds to what you and your team are going through.   * Unstuck makes it easy to navigate to the specific type of "stuck" you have. No need to search the book for where you want to go. Just go to page 47 and it will direct you from there.  * There is a very helpful page on the things you need to unify in order to be a successful leader (or individual).  * Unstuck is small, nice to look at and will look good on your shelf.  On the minus side:  * Unstuck seems to be style over substance. It follows the highly visual/minimal text style of The Brand Gap but seems to lack the meat that made The Brand Gap so good.   * Some of the solutions seem to be based too much in common sense while others seem to be too contrived.   * Although one of the main tenants of the book is "systems thinking," you never get the feeling that Unstuck looks at the entire system. Since I'm not currently stuck, I will read this again and post a review if/when I am. Until then...let's hope those flash cards hit the market. 
 When I think of the Civil War I think of excitement and danger. I expect  to read a good rich book about it. Yet this book squeezes all the fun out  of thesubject War. Yes, war is nothing fun yet it may be exciting and  detailed. This book totally lacks all this information. Yet it does tell of  the blood thirsty belligerent Generals that are awaiting battle. I have a  love of books, all throughout my life. I have read many too. I highly don't  recommend this book for pleasure reading. Unless you want to get details  for an essay, forget about it 
 I feel like a traitor since I love Seton's THE GREEN DARKNESS but this is probably the worst book I have read in ages.  The characters are amoral and unsympathetic and nothing really happens.  Blech--I want the two hours I wasted on this back 
 The third week of April, 2007 was laiden with tragedy and memoriam of other similar past tragedies, so we needed a good fun diversion from reality and sadly, "Happy Feet" was NOT it.  I SO wanted to like this film... after all, I like penguins, music, Robin Williams and good animation, all of which this movie had (thus the 2 stars), but (and it's a big one) what this movie did not have was any FUN.  Why?  Why make a film as beautiful and artistically conceived with singing and dancing penguins without... fun?  I'll tell you why... to oppress all of us lousy humans into being proactive environmentally... not that there is anything wrong with that, however that is NOT entertainment - that is preaching.  "Happy Feet" is anything but happy... it starts off very slow with a dreary, dark, uncomfortable feel.  Not until 45 minutes have elapsed does it begin to get a tiny spark with Robin Williams desperately trying to give this movie life.  Unfortunately, close to the first half of this film was so solemn and unendearing that the spark never really starts a fire.  The film's 'entertainment' catalyst solely relies from beginning to end on retreaded music mostly from the 70s/80s disco era... and it just doesn't work.  There is very little to no fun watching these peguins dance, because it never has a 'magic' feel to it such as other recent CGI animated films like "Cars," "Finding Nemo" or "Ice Age."    "Happy Feet" also lacks original humor like its predecessor "Ice Age" which was a true gem while still containing a message.  This film's jokes which are few and far between, mostly fall flat.  Not even the great Robin Williams in his character's Latin Don Juan-like flair could save this venture into oppression.  In our family viewing of this, there were some minor chuckles here and there and I think one real laugh out loud moment and the laughs were mostly those types of laughs that you are 'pushing' or 'willing' this film to be humorous - and then there is prolonged deadening silence as the humor is just too sparsely inserted throughout the script or just not funny.  The film's messages felt like they were being shoved down your throat - kinda like being forced to eat your brussel sprouts as a kid before you could have your reduced-sugar, semi-sweet jello.  Honestly, this film had everything it needed to be extremely entertaining, except an entertaining script.  It had celebrities, incredibly beautiful CGI landscapes that were simply amazing to view, technically detailed motion/action sequences, an almost 3-D feel to it, great sound, a cute premise about a dancing penguin... yet it fails miserably due to its 'gloom and doom' storyline.  Trust me... it gets its message across loud and clear, but it's too loud and too clear - nothing is left for the viewer to really think about except being lectured to, preached to and scolded for being a bad, bad human being.  It does somewhat redeem itself towards the end, but that is way too little... way too late.  The only "Happy Feet" you will get from this film is when you get up and change the disc when it finally ends... this movie was to me, a very solemn and disappointing experience.  "March Of The Penguins" was so much more fun... it took a much lighter approach as this film should have done.  I am so disappointed.  If you still want to see "Happy Feet" after reading all of the above, I strongly suggest that you RENT this BEFORE you buy it... you've been warned 
 I must say, I love this movie. The story is nice and sweet. The acting wasn't bad either. So the 1 star is not for the movie but for the DVD itself. I was so happy because I thought I got a good deal for getting this DVD for $9.99 but when I got it, the disc did not have any kind of print on the front side whatsoever like most DVD movies have. The only indication of which side goes which is a very small strip of red in the center which has the title and label in all-caps "reverse side".  And, the only special features it has is the movie trailer. So, anyone who's looking for cast/director commentaries, deleted scenes and other behind-the-scenes features, you'll not get it on this DVD 
 I got these to replace my yellow Sony sports headphones.  The yellow ones were kind of "rubbery" and I've had them for years.  These broke within 3 weeks.  And not under great stress or high use, either.  Just simply taking them off of my head by pulling them apart to get them out of my ear and they broke where the length of the left ear adjusts.    Very poor design and cheap plastic.  I'll buy other Sony headphones, especially if I can find ones made similar to my older yellow ones.  But I will never buy another set of these.  Plus: They sound great  Con: They are such poor design that they broke at a really thin place of construction that would get a LOT of pressure from anyone when putting them on or taking them off their head.  
 The moonwalk image on the DVD cover is misleading since there is hardly any mention of that experience in this DVD.  Also, the format was not what I expected. However, there was information in Dr Mitchell's lecture to connect-the-dots between science and ESP research in recent years--primarily methodology to support quantum basis for sensory/extra-sensory data processing.  Promising work is going on. The lecture could have been presented in an audio version as effectively (with a card listing his talking points).  
 Temperance Brennan is an American forensic anthropologist .The author is a anthropologist in real life and I feel she gave to much detail as to body parts & conditions ,& locations in the book , and in about the 3rd chapter to much time and space is wasted talking about "Gabby " including in detail where gabby lives and details that surround the outside of Gabbys place & How Gabby and Tempe were friends from GRad to man parts in life . Book was not for me I dropped it at the 3rd chapter . 
 The edit/fade of version of IRON MAN makes no sense to me at all.  It's one of their best and most beloved and well known songs and should have been included in its full length version, even if it meant leaving off one of their later, lesser songs.  Do yourself a favor and skip this disc and try to buy the remastered versions of PARANOID and MASTER OF REALITY from the Amazon UK site.  I would recommend you stay away from any Black Sabbath (or Ozzy disc solo for that matter) that list Sharon Osburne anywhere in the credits.  She has done nothing but try to rewrite the history the this great band....what a shame!  
 In general this was an ok product.  It was too big clumsy for the car but my son liked to play with it in the house.  It would be a good buy at $15 but no more than that 
 with so many wonderful, creative, and clever craft project books out there, don't bother with this one. i would suggest any book by jocasta innes instead- she is a designer who is always  inovative and original 
 I have always been a prolific reader and rarely do I come across a book for which I can find no value, no redeeming qualities. But I must extend a hearty congratulations to Julia Barrett for writing the most astounding piece of horse excrement I have ever had the misfourtune to purchace. Teachiing my cat to walk repeatedly over my keyboard would produce a work of more sense. If you are like me and just have to read it - just because you're obsessed with Austen - Buy it used for 45 cents and then burn it 
 Let's see. Ken Starr wastes the public money attacking Bill Clinton with false accusations while at the same time siding with KON-servative Mitch Mcconnel of KY to allow for more corrupt campaigns as if there aren't any already !!! This book is a perfect tool for neconservative NAZIS to enjoy and drool over but is otherwise useless trash for the rest of us who are already facing mass destruction by Bush/Cheney/Rove/Delay and GOP with of course a spineless opposition that barely got together to defend Clinton but easily caved into and defended Bush the liar-in-chief ! 
 After the 1700s, this play fell into obscurity. It was later revived in the mid 1900s. Its period of obscurity does not surprise me. Believe me, I am a champion for Shakespeare's underrated "Timon of Athens" and "Coriolanus." I honestly TRIED to like this play, but I was forced to concur with the great Isaac Asimov who said: "Though it ends happily and is therefore technically a comedy, it lacks a carefree fun and happiness of the previous comedies. it is, indeed, rather an unpleasant play..." Well, onto the play. We meet the widowed Countess, her son Bertram, and the elder Lafew. We learn that the king is ill and quite possibly terminal. Possibly, Helena's father could have cured the king, but alas, he is dead. The Countess gives Bertram some advice that is not so far from the advice Polonius gave Ophelia. (Though the bumbling Polonius ends up being easier to like!) Helena loves Bertram, but feels beneath him and contemplates virginity. One comical moment is when Parolles reveals that in a way, virginity is a form of vain self love. Later, Helena cures the king, and Helena asks for Bertram as a husband. Now this is where I have a problem. Bertram is made out to be a villain. But how can we possibly not sympathize with him? Maybe Helena deserves something for saving the king, but does she really have the right to impose marriage on someone who doesn't like her? Well, Bertram is forced to go through with the marriage, but he quickly decides to help Florence against Siena. Poor Parolles who knows this forced marriage was unethical is constantly made a subject of ridicule in this play. This is where I have another problem. Rather than the clever misunderstandings of "The Comedy of Errors," the clever marital confrontations and errors in "Midsummer Night's Dream," or the comical and clever passages from Jaques in "As You Like It," the comedy in "All's Well That Ends Well" is reduced to the lowest possible form. (Flat out ridicule! It is interesting that in the word ridicule, we have the letters for cruel, but I am digressing.) In one decent elemenet of comedy, Bertram makes it clear that he would rather go to war than lie with his wife. (And perhaps in time, Bertram can appeal to the king to release him from this marriage. It wouldn't be unheard of.) One interesting thing is that Bertram remains honorable in the sense that he does not 'ravish' Helena. He doesn't love her, and therefore will not engage in sex. It is rather repulsive on his mother's part how she fails to understand the situation. Even if she was on Helena's side, she might AT LEAST understand Bertram's frustration in that he did not consent to the marriage. (And possibly try to at least talk things over in hopes of coming to a peaceful solution.) But no. She just rants and raves. Later the Countess reads a letter from Helena stating that she will leave so Bertram can come home from the war. This throws Bertram's mother into yet another rage on Helena's behalf, and perhaps moves the reader into sympathy with Helena. THAT IS, UNTIL OUR GOOD OLD UNCLE ISAAC ASIMOV points out the hypocrisy of Helena: "Helena is not quite as unselfish as she is presenting herself to be. She does not go to the shrine at all but sneaks off to Florence in disguise as a pilgrim hoping that she may yet return her reluctant husband." Well, onward. In Florence, Helena meets with Diana (whom Bertram loves). And Helena thinks she can trick Bertram into making her pregnant. We then have the cruel practical joke on Parolles where he is blindfolded and threatened to reveal military secrets (to friendly forces of course) or else. Perhaps even Shakespeare felt bad over this scene as he has Parolles say: "Who can not be crushed with a plot?" (4.3.340). We also see Bertram try to win the affections of Diana. Diana of course feels nothing for Bertram. But again, the hypocrisy of the play is prevalent. If we accept the fact that Bertram should respect Diana's wishes that she doesn't love him, how do we account for the fact that Helena imposed an unwanted marriage on Bertram? But of course Diana consents to meet Bertram and of course it will really be Helena who meets him. But even tricking Bertram into getting her pregnant is not enough. Helena decides to throw a sympathy party for herself by spreading the word of her death back home. Now in "Much Ado About Nothing," Hero had a valid excuse for staging her death. She was humiliated and disgraced in front of several people for something she was totally innocent of. But Helena was the one who imposed an unwanted marriage on Bertram, and she still wants a sympathy party. One redeeming element of the play is that Lafew shows some sympathy for the disgraced Parolles and offers him a job. And of course, in the end Bertram feels bad over Helena's staged death and is happy to see her alive again. Helena may very well be the Britney Spears of Shakespeare's characters. 
 What's up with all these emo bands sprouting out of nowhere? I guess emo is to 2005 what rap metal was to 1999. I'm sure that the emo-originators played with heart, but now we have all these bands, such as My Chemical Romance, The Used, Hawthorne Heights, and Story of the Year, FAKING emotion. Anyone can sing in a high pitched voice, write some whiny lyrics, and convine people it's "nothing but emotion". Yeah, well, if all these people are really this emotionl, America really does have a problem with their youth. Fortunately it's all just show-biz, but if this is the lenghth some people have to go to just for attention, then I'd say America's youth DOES have a problem. Fortunately emo's just another trend and it will be gone and no one will be able to remember what they saw in it, just like people do about Limp Bizkit now days. So go buy a Mastodon CD and listen to some musicians who can REALLY play their instruments 
 This poorly executed story drags on for too long while the town waits for the return of Sister North. In the end, we really don't care if she ever returns. The ending is cliched and predictable. A waste of time 
 This is a very different story than the one told in other books, and several news sources. That in itself is a pretty dubious fact. I will leave it at that!  There are three types of books coming out of the Afghanistan conflict - Army Books, CIA Books, and SEAL books (Forgive me but I have not seen or read and USMC/USAF books). All charges of bias aside, it is natural for the author to write about that which he knows - CIA guys tend to focus own universe etc. My point in all of this is: this, is undoubtably a SEAL book.   If you are looking to fill in some blanks from resources available in print, or online by all means pick this up. If you are looking for a more definitive look at Anaconda - I would check out 'Not a Good Day to Die' by Sean Naylor 
 It seems that all there is to the bondage scene is people going to special clubs with silly customs and talking about if they are the one in charge or the one to serve.  Woah! So much to intrigue my non-BDSM mind!  Rosie O' Donald(?) and Dan Ackroyd probably demonstrated the lifestyle as well in Exit to Eden 
 When I first heard Ra's "From Zero" I was in awe.  A band that used cool effects, Egyptian scales, and was moderately heavy--the perfect mix for me.  Then, Duality came out.  Duality demonstrates a lack of creativity that was once there in Ra.  I wouldn't say they evolved, I'd say they devoled.  They still use effects, but rarely and they don't have as big of an impact.  On top of that they hardly sound Egyption on the album.  As for this album, Ra sounds more like other bands, but they are still distinct.  I just wish they went in a different direction.  I do want to say that their are some really awesome songs like Fallen Angels, Undertaken, and Taken.  The other tracks are bad either, it's just that I expected a whole lot more 
 I would gladly take my hour and a half back.  I enjoyed the humor of ST 1, and there's only a nod in that direction here - so lame, it only serves to draw attention to its absence.    Also, this turns into a slasher flick - a systematic knock-off of each of the characters and an exploration of how gruesome the special effects can be.  Now, I'm not necessarily against this, though I don't really care for slasher flicks, other than to say that it becomes super BO-RING!  And I do mean boring  There's not even really a "B" movie quality here that provides something memorable.  Nope - nothing redeeming here.  Don't bother  
 Read the Bible to see what Heaven will be like.  Don't rely on someone's delusional ideas from their "Near Death Experience."  Do some research and you will find that she isn't all that honest... she never comes out and tells you that she is Mormon. So much for embracing the truth.   
 It's a tough read. It does not keep my interest. I will finish it because I started it, but it is one I could definitely put down 
 As a fan of zombie movies and as someone who enjoyed City of the Living Dead and Zombie, I was very disappointed with House by the Cemetery. Fulci manages to create a good mystery in the first two-thirds of the movie, only to squander it on some poorly executed scare scenes.  House By the Cemetery is about an researcher (whose work is never specified) who moves his wife and his kid into a house in Massachussets in order to finish out the work of a colleague who killed himself and his mistress. The titular house is the only place they can really find for the moment, so Dr. Boyle, his wife Lucy and their son Bob move in despite a lot of bad signs, like the boarded-up door to the cellar and a tombstone for a Dr. Jacob Tess Freudstein in the front hall. Bob has little red-headed girl for a friend who keeps warning him about how bad the house is (though no one else sees her). Furthermore, people keep claiming Dr. Boyle has been in town before with a non-existent daughter (which he denies, not totally convincingly). He also seems to have some secret relationship with the babysitter, Anne, who starts unboarding the cellar door in the middle of the night. And Lucy seems to either be recovering from or suffering from serious psychological issues.   Got that? Good, because half of that stuff never gets explained. The only things that get worked out are the little red-headed girl's identity and the identity of the killer (neither of which are that hard to figure out). There are some nice visual moments in the earlier parts of the film (the fact that the killer has one normal hand and one rotting hand, the photograph that changes with each viewing, a mannequin that gets beheaded and starts bleeding) but Fulci's ability to handle the gore moments disappoints. He lingers too long over some deaths, makes the killer so ridiculously slow that a snail could outrun him and bits like the babysitter's head falling down the stairs come off as funny rather than scary. Compared to the injury to the eye scene in Zombie or Christopher George chopping through the coffin in CotLD, Dr. Boyle's chopping through the door around his son's head feels like self-parody.  Fulci's other films have incoherent plots , but rarely in a way that seems to work against the plot (the dream-like nature of City of the Living Dead seems appropriate given the prophetic dream the heroine gets and the mystical nature of the threat) and the execution of the setpieces is usually fantastic. House by the Cemetery has neither thing working in its favor. It's not Hell of the Living Dead-level bad, but the fact that it has some genuinely good acting (especially Paolo Malco, who plays Dr. Boyle) and an interesting set-up almost make the flaws worse.  Also, this version has a "never before seen deleted scene", but it has no sound and is just an extended reaction shot after the bat attack 
 [http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/faq/Genesis.asp] [www.answersingenesis.org] has numerous refutations of 'progressive creationism' and specifically of Ross' assertation of the meaning of the Hebrew word for day (yom). They clearly demonstrate the grammatical errors of his claim.  Also see the book "Refuting Compromise" by Jonathan Sarfati, Ph.D 
 Badiou is a joke. Ultimately his definition of Evil is that it's simply anything he wants it to be. It's like sophomores throwing the word "fascist" around. Capitalism causes every sex murder, every murder by a mother of her child. And Mao was a "genius" whose ideas have been insufficiently explored. Sure 
 Examples are few and offer little explaination. I find this book so hard to follow.  On a good note: algorithms are clear 
 Jim Messina has played in a some great bands. He played in the Buffalo Springfield, a group of young legends.  He also played in Poco, probably the most under-appreciated and under-rated band of the era.  With these credentials, you can put Messina's name up there with the likes of Stills, Furay, Young, Nash, Crosby, Frey and Browne.  Then he teams up with Kenny Loggins, and things get bad.  I picked up this album, expecting greatness from these two, and I simply didn't find it.  What I found was two decent tunes surrounded by silly and annoying pop.  Most songs on here have simple lyrics, and are over-produced.  I do like two songs on here.  "Till The Ends Meet" is a nice, easy tune, and Loggins sounds very nice on this one.  The other song I like is "Angry Eyes." The intro is very cool, and the singing interplay between Loggins and Messina is fun and interesting here.  The main point here is that this album does not live up to expectation in the least.  There's no folk, no country rock, no free and easy feeling to this one.  This is blatant pop-music.  If you like bouncy pop, this might be for you.  If you're looking for anything like Poco or Buffalo Springfield, you will experience a huge bummer. 
 It just didn't do it for me.  Like so many other people, I loved Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  It was such a rich, unexpected book and came alive in the reading.  But, I fear John Berendt had only one in him - one great story.  He found a crime and a city and another series of characters, but he just didn't find the magic.   Good writing?  Yes.  Interesting characters?  Somewhat.  Compelling plot?  No.   Maybe it's just that he tried too hard to make Venice new to his readers.  Maybe he tried too hard to replicate the formula and twists of Midnight, even though reality didn't afford him similarities to work with.  Maybe he just tried too hard. 
 The first two books in this series (Outfoxed and Hotspur) were great--I couldn't put them down!  And God knows I've stayed up way past my bedtime on a work night so I could finish a Mrs. Murphy story.  But this one?!  Slow cannot begin to describe it!  What a big disappointment!  
 I would consider this book to be of subpar quality.  It was decently written but the book mainly consisted of exerpts from other books and then a few comments on the authors opinions of those exerpts.  Usually I will finish a book of this size in one sitting and about a month later I'm still trying to get through this one.  I would only reccomend it if you're extremely bored 
 Where to start?  This is a positively dreadful waste of time and money....I feel sorry for the actors and technicians that had to waste good time  producing such rubbish. The story is slightly stolen from the classic "A Double Life" starring  Ronald Coleman in an Oscar winning role in the 50's.  ITs nothing but a lame slasher movie with the addition of famous leads.  If you were to bet me that a movie 90 minutes in length and  featuring  Elizabeth Hurley in all her stunning beauty for nearly every minute of it..and that I'd still regret wasting  the time I'd take  that bet....I did,  and lost.  Be afraid ,  be very afraid 
 I also, have had to find my spiritual path. At some point, many women "wake up" and take ownership of their own selves. I did this at age 35.  I chose to become a member of the Baptist (Southern) church because their doctrine was sound. If you read what their beliefs are...it's all found in the Bible. I know women dislike being linked to "EVE" but you either believe the Bible as truth or you don't. There is no middle ground. If any part of the Bible isn't "inspired", then it's all bunk.  So, I say...you're either a Christian (belief in Jesus as the only way to heaven) or you aren't....period. That was easy, huh? Why do we need a book 
 I have heard that this is a children's book (and perhaps there are abridged versions), but I have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense, verbose novel and understand the subtle, underlying themes Swift portrays. I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow. All in all, this book is an exploration into man's true nature and, despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge, expresses a mature intellect that reflects Swift's intelligence. 
 I hate saying this as a HUGE Good Charlotte fan but their new album is just a major waste of money. Their first album is one of my top five albums of all time, but this one sucks. The songs are all dance pop synthesized junk. No real guitars, no messages to any of the songs, no nothing. I dont know if Joel is just too busy running around town with Nicole Richie or what but they skipped out on this album. The only redeaming song is The River, on which they colaberated with M Shadows and Synester Gates of Avenged Sevenfold. I hate hate hate to say it but dont waste your money or time on this one, just listen to the first album and remember what a great band they used to be. 
 "The Glorious Cause" is the sequel to "Rise to Rebellion," and since the first novel was so good I eagerly dove into this one, but was disappointed to find it had nowhere near the same depth and quality of characterization. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 4, as compared to the 8 I would give "Rise to Rebellion."  The events recounted in "Rise to Rebellion" involving the lead up to the Revolutionary War seemed so much more detailed and interesting, with a vast array of characters that were so colorful; John Adams, Paul Revere, Samuel Adams, Ben Franklin, and others. "The Glorious Cause" was not without its merits, but it seemed so much drier and less appealing, with a more narrow focus. It was far too long in some parts, to the point my attention wandered, and getting through it was a chore in some sections, unlike the preceding novel which seemed to turn its own pages. I listened to this book on audio tape during my commute, and often found myself impatiently trying to keep my focus upon the narrative while controlling my urge to fast forward to a livelier scene.  One element I felt truly slighted by was the coverage of Benedict Arnold and his defection to the British cause. I assumed this would be one of the lengthier and more rewarding sections of the book, but it zipped by fairly rapidly with little genuine immersion into the subject material.  A mark of a good book is how I feel when I have finished reading it - if I am disappointed I have reached the end of the story, then I know it was time well spent. Getting to the end of "The Glorious Cause" felt more like finishing some particularly grueling outdoor project; it was uncomfortable work, and now that I'm done I feel I can do something a bit more interesting. Because Shaara did such a good job with "Rise to Rebellion" I don't feel my lack of appeal for this book is his responsibility; perhaps the subject matter didn't complement my taste as well. I prefer interesting historial detail over tepid, droning battle descriptions, and I feel the differences between those two categories represent perfectly the differences between "Rise to Rebellion" and "The Glorious Cause. 
 The author of this book hates freedom and his book is unsupported by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights 
 I picked up this book hoping to read about heavenly bodies. It turned out to be more of a trivia book focussing on events and/or attempts that are behind our present day knowledge about the universe. Not quite the same thing. At the very least, the title is a misnomer. Not very well written, either. Needlessly verbose and lacks substance 
 The only good thing about this book is the seaside atmosphere. The seaside restaurants were enjoyable. The storyline was acceptable but not my favorite 
 I like John Grisham, but I think his more recent novels have been lacking in the storyline department.  THE LAST JUROR is a typical example.    This book is a fairly decent coming-of-age novel about a young journalist growing up in a deep southern town in Mississippi.  Unfortunately, there is not much of a plot that holds the events of THE LAST JUROR together.  Instead, we get a rather rambling, slow-moving narrative that takes place over a ten-year period, with a generous dollop of Grisham's political views on Vietnam, Wal-Mart, religion, and a couple of other hot-button issues.  THE LAST JUROR is not a suspense novel or a thriller (despite being marketed as one).  The plot described on the dust jacket of this novel doesn't really get started until maybe the last 80 pages or so.  The whole revenge plot feels tacked on and phony.  The ending is anti-climactic, to say the least.  I think Grisham is an entertaining writer, and his description of life in a small Southern town in the 1970s is actually very interesting in spots.  There are some scenes in this novel that are quite charming and enjoyable.  But, in the end, it doesn't add up to a good suspense novel, and that's what I thought I paid money for.  If you're looking for a good thiller, my advice is to try Grisham's earlier work, or the books of Greg Isles instead 
 I think the author is a brilliant physicist with some incredible ideas, but he sure didn't express them in this book.  As stated by others, there a various anecdotes (many which are funny and enlightening), but most without real relevance.  I bought the book to learn about his ideas, but alas this book seems to be written for someone with a significant background in the subject matter already. My rating is really based on the readability (which is poor) since the book did such a poor job of relating his ideas I can't judge those 
 The tiltle threw me off since i did not know who Danny Gatton was.I was expecting to learn some amazing rhythm patterns and great strummings techniques because of all the other reviews that I have read ,but all I saw was the same pluck and pick patterns and different jazz chords (some blues chords as well).I guess You have to be a fan of Mr.Gatton to enjoy the material.I know I did not enjoy it at all or really learned anything(I could not bare to sit through the whole thing but I forced myself).The only part I enjoyed was about one minute worth, when Mr.Gatton had the acoustic guitar(he used an electric guitar throughout the dvd)and used a really cool rhythm.   
 Jim Hightower needs to quit stabbing people in the back. That is not how you solve America's problems. Another piece of pure fiction from a Michael Moore wannabee.  
 I like the smell of this fragrance very much but have trouble with the sprayer mister.  Maybe i just have a defective one but I need to unscrew the top and dab it on 
 I've enjoyed the prior books in this series.  However, I found this one plodding, and too wrapped up in emotional melodrama and inner conflicts. While I've eagerly and quickly read through prior books, I've noticed that this one was an effort to finish.  Everyone has their own preferences, but less introspection and more action in the next book would be welcome 
 viewed it 1st was disappointed knodded my head in disbelief while watching,waiting,hoping!!!,the second time i tried to keep awake but could not keep my eyes open long enough, must of been those gravity waves in interstellar space out there in umm well you get the picture.My advise is for you to save your money and buy comos (the best imo)To be honest, i couldn't wait to sell it used at a $10 lose through amzn.the following week(they get a commission for sold items)nonetheless,i am content i no longer own it.Next time i will rent before purchasing on amzn. Just So you know, "cosmos" i can watch over and over for years as this was my first box set from amzn..the late carl sagans"cosmos" blows away "the astronomer" 
 We've had our Baby Gaggia for a little over a year now and are already on our third set of buttons. After regular use the buttons that run the steam, the brewing, and power the machine stick or break outright. The plastic buttons are incredibly cheaply made and, even when handled with delicacy break or simply cease to function. What's equally surprising is that the rest of the machine seems to be well made, which makes me wonder why they would use such inadequate parts on for its cheapest components. Don't buy this machine if you want reliability 
 If you want to read the purple prose of a man who is deeply ashamed of being latino and gay--in fact, so ashamed of the latter that he paints a picture of gays and lesbians as a talentless lot of artificial people doomed by moral pestilence-- then this is the book for you. If you're white and heterosexual and you're looking for a brown-skinned person to make you feel like you're culturally superior, why this book will be downright therapeutic 
 The slight actor in the title role is more suited for light comedy. Unintelligible at time....Not what the books are about 
 I have felt some of the benefits of adopting the Young diet - but I do not believe that these results can be ascribed to the causes postulated by his theory. The theory that alkaline means energy (and that acid means energy deficit) is simplistic and is unsupported by credible evidence. I do not believe in the efficacy of Robert Young's patent medicines. I have found that sodium bicarbonate has equally beneficial 'alkalising' effects - at a fraction of the cost. Fundamentally, Robert Young is advocating nothing more than a routine healthy diet. But he tries to disguise this fact with pseudo-scientific jargon, unsupported assertions, a paucity of real evidence and an array of unnecessarily expensive commercial products of doubtful efficacy. Nevertheless, the type of diet which he recommends may well produce some beneficial effects 
 Item was not new and arrived with dents, scratches gouges and jammed doors.   Returne 
 I purchased this book hoping for some artistic pictures such as might be suitable for framing.  What I found instead is a jumble of photos that are anything but.  A completely disappointing collection at best 
 F this self-help industry crap. Quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst. I can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title. Humans are far more complex than the hack Man-Warrior/Female-Maiden title what's-his-name gives them. And remember, this "doctor," is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase. Your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives, so why do you? Let's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self-help industry to the torch. That's a great start to a sane life 
 That's what this book should have been titled. Erica Jong is, indeed, an incredible writer, but not here. Not even close. Her willingness to have two female characters candidly discuss the merits of dildos does not automatically qualify her as a feminist writer. I seriously doubt that Sappho, wherever she may now be, finds it entertaining or edifying to know that Erica Jong thought so little of her as to portray her as a dildo fan. If "Sex and the City" were still spewing out new episodes, perhaps Ms. Jong would have eventually suggested an episode featuring Sappho as a dildo salesperson and Carrie Bradshaw as her devoted dildo-loving customer.  Feminism is not about having to use "scary" words like dildo and (...)to prove how much of a woman you are. It's about knowing that you are enough of a woman to not have to prove your feminism to anyone...ever 
 The Columbia Sportswear story is one of the most compelling business building stories of our time.  However, this books is a totally incomplete treatise.  It is well written and somewhat captivating, but way too summarized if you expect to learn anything useful.  It is a waste of time to read, although you'll only have to waste 20 minutes to read the entire book 
 I'll be brief:  First of all: out of the 81 reviews of this product currently on Amazon, 31 are 1-star.  That should tell you something.  Pros: When it actually works, it /does/ cool down your 360.  Cons: 1) Crashing Caused more crashes than it prevented.  Running without the Nyko instantly reduced the number of crashes and freezing problems I had.  2) Loud as hell Turn on your 360.  Put a hairdryer next to it, and turn it on, on low.  Step back and sit where you normally play.  That is how loud this product will make your 360.  3) Hard to set up, frequently stops working. It took a lot of playing around just to get it to work the first time.  It snap fits well to the back of the 360, but despite that, there's some impossible magic to the angles and tightness of the power connector... we're talking millimeter tolerances here.  If you're off by just a tiny bit, it won't work at all, and the XBox won't even power on.  This wouldn't be too bad if you only had to go through this headache once, but no: it's loose enough that you risk disconnecting it (and setting it up all over again) every time you touch the power cord or move the 360.  4) Many people have reported this unit causing actual damage to their 360s.  You better have a replacement plan for your 360 handy, and never mention the Nyko when you try to RMA your box.  If you let it slip, you probably won't be covered.  That's it for the Nyko.  I returned mine within 2 weeks.  I've been searching for a good cooler for the 360 since I got one.  Unfortunately, it is my opinion that there are NO GOOD COOLERS FOR THE 360 ON THE MARKET.  The fan-stands (yes, I've bought and returned them) are decent coolers, but require you to run your 360 vertically, which is a big no-no.  A number of websites have shown that the 360 DVD-rom drive will EAT your DVDs and games when it's vertical.  I had hoped this was overexaggerated, but then the problems started happening to me... I'ver personally seen what appears to be damage on my /mint/ condition games when running the 360 vertically.  I also experienced frequent game-loading problems (including hideous slowdowns) in games like Halo 2 (where you can actually see a progress bar) when played on a vertical 360 (it worked just fine with it horizontally).  So, horizontal is the way to go.  In the end, I ended up building my own cooler out of some old (still loud, but MUCH QUIETER) computer fans and a 12 volt adapter, and slapped it on the side.  Works well, probably cools as well as the Nyko, but without the noise or the crashing!  Your best bet, if you can't do something like that, is to just buy a little clip fan (with its own power adapter) and have it blow into the right side/bottom (the vents away from the DVD drive) of your 360 
 The plot for this movie is actually quite good, a microbiochemical weapon accidently created and released on the world is captured and is being brought back from Russia, but the Russians are trying to recapture it and release it on the major cities of the world and it is up to our "hero" to stop them before it happens. What ruins this great movie is the very bad acting. When asked if he knew about Agent Red, Dolph's character said it best, "Sounds like a bad action movie," and it is. From LT. Christian being seriously out of uniform to the underlying "love story", this movie just reeks. The only good thing I saw in this movie was Randolph Mantooth. His small part made up for the movie in my opinion. So unless you're a big Mantooth fan, this movie is a waste of money 
 Jeremy Narby's The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge, started out decently enough with Narby reminiscing about his days doing field work in the Amazon Basin and from there he goes over some interesting ideas regarding DNA and Serpent Myths but then all goes down hill as he suddenly becomes a follower of Intelligent Design and makes an all out attack on Darwinian Evolution and Science itself.  A number of Narby's ideas regarding DNA and Shamanism are intriguing enough but he has apparently decided that all Shamanism is based on Molecular Biology, while he freely admits that he is being very reductionist on this point, I still see many problems with his view that Shamanism is based on Molecular Biology at heart. His argument mostly surrounds the symbol of the Serpent/Dragon which is present in many different mythologies often with connections to water and associations with twins. He decides that this is in actually a representation of DNA as viewed by Shamans and believes that all serpents in mythology and shamanic visions are actually DNA. Since DNA emits photons and this has been shown to possibly play a part in cell communication (along with the traditional chemical communication) Narby believes that in shamanic trances the shaman becomes able to see the light emitted by DNA (which often show up as snakes) and the shaman communicates with the individual bits of DNA (which is conscious) and the entire linked network of DNA based life. As justification for this argument he points out that some groups hold that spirits are beings of pure light, to him this is almost literally correct as the spirits are actually DNA and communicate through light as "spirits".  From there he goes on to say that all ladders, staircases, and ropes in shamanic quests are representations of DNA and when the shaman uses them he is travelling along DNA and similarly when the shaman goes to the underworld he is sinking down to the world of Molecular Biology (although since one can apparently work with and see DNA in the middle world one must ask why one would need to shrink down). While these views might make for some interesting theological discussion about some shamanic practices, Narby seems to have ignored the psychological aspects of visions and quests and any elements other than snakes or other things that just happen to be long and thin. Given Narby's view of spirits as DNA one must ask what spiritual helpers/allies are? Is someone's spiritual guides DNA in some bacteria on my hand? Will I kill Yahweh by washing my hands with anti-bacterial soap (hey maybe that's why Jesus decided that washing one's hands was bad!)?  A lot of his proof is like the proof of Erich von Dï¿½niken except that where Dï¿½niken saw aliens and spacecraft, Narby sees DNA and Molecules. Take for example this Dï¿½niken-esque proof from the book:  "The second was a rock painting of the Rainbow Snake. I looked at it more closely and saw two things: All around the serpent there were sorts of chromosomes, in their upside-down "U" shape, and underneath it there was a kind of ladder!" (p. 79)  By Chapter 10, entitled Biology's Blind Spot, Narby has decided that Evolution is Wrong and all of Science must be toppled. This bit seems to have come out of nowhere like someone spliced a Pro-Intelligent Design rant into a book where it didn't belong and as with all Pro-ID and Creationist literature we get the same old faulty attacks again and again. Attacks such as Evolution being based on a Circular argument because the most fit species survive to spread their genes and therefore are more fit. Yes, that is the definition of fitness, and sometimes the basis of things start as tautologies such as the Theory of Gravity but like Gravity Natural Selection and evolution is justified and testable by looking at it's predictive power. Population genetics and mathematics shows clearly that natural selection is very predictive and has so far not been falsified. Similarly, we can also look at the fossil record in geological strata for evidence of evolutionary change over time.  After that attack Narby then attacks the Central Dogma (Which is how transcription of DNA to proteins works) by misinterpreting what Francis Crick meant. Crick never meant the word Dogma in Central Dogma to be taken in the sense it is used in religion instead he meant it as a joke name for a grand hypothesis that he had at the time little actual experimental evidence for. Narby misinterprets Crick's joke to argue that evolution is apparently Faith based, since this argument has no basis in reality it falls flat immediately.  He then argues that ants and other animals are fully conscious because they do amazing things that seem to require forethought and they tap into DNA like shamans to do things. Higher animals are smart and may have consciousness but ants are pretty dumb. One is reminded of Edward Selous and others' ideas about thought-transference to explain how flocks of birds move and how ants and termites build hives, as it turns out birds flocking behaviour operates on simple instinctual rules (clustering, maintaining speed, and appropriate distance) and so are Ant Nesting behaviours. One proof of this is to put food just out of the reach of ants, and some dirt underneath, while they understand how to move earth and tunnel they will never purposely move earth to build ramps, bridges, or tunnels to reach a goal. The birds who flew in flocks and the ancestors of ants who had developed nesting behaviour managed to survive better and so these behaviours somehow became instincts and persisted.  Now Narby makes the extremely tired argument that life is too complicated to be determined by chance alone, and he is correct on this matter. Too bad there is more than chance guiding evolution, we also have Natural Selection guiding the process, to quote Richard Dawkins: "Life results from the non-random survival of randomly varying replicators." The combinations which work survive and prosper and are kept in the population. Narby argues "How can a small telephone directory of information emerge from random processes?" (P. 142) to answer this I wish to quote a bit of Michael Shermer's 25 Creationists' Arguments and 25 Evolutionists' Answers which nicely illustrates how natural selection can produce Shakespeare's Hamlet quickly from random letters:  "Natural selection is not "random" nor does it operate by "chance." Natural selection preserves the gains and eradicates the mistakes. The eye evolved from a single, light-sensitive cell into the complex eye of today through hundreds if not thousands of intermediate steps, many of which still exist in nature. In order for the monkey to type the first 13 letters of Hamlet's soliloquy by chance, it would take 26 to the power of 13 number of trials for success. This is 16 times as great as the total number of seconds that have elapsed in the lifetime of the solar system. But if each correct letter is preserved and each incorrect letter eradicated, the process operates much faster. How much faster? Richard Hardison constructed a computer program in which letters were "selected" for or against, and it took an average of only 335.2 trials to produce the sequence of letters TOBEORNOTTOBE. This takes the computer less than 90 seconds. The entire play can be done in about 4.5 days!"  Narby also tries to argue that gaps in the fossil record such as in whale evolution and other places where there are few or no intermediate forms indicate that evolution has not occurred. This however just means that in this instance there are gaps in the fossil record because the fossils have not been found yet. Narby also points to the seemingly rapid appearance of species in the fossil record as an argument against evolution. Apparently Narby has never heard of Punctuated Equilibrium.  Narby stunningly also tries to argue that because large portions of DNA is identical over many different species that this somehow indicates design, unfortunately for Narby a lot of these identical sequences of DNA code for the basic processes of life. A human who couldn't cope with oxygen or a fox which could not metabolize energy would not last long in this world. The fact that these sequences are identical is actually a point for evolution because the same processes have been preserved and we even see similar basic skeletal structures in animals even when it is not efficient or useful such as digits in the fins of dolphins or the appendix in humans.  Finally, we come back full circle to his argument about Natural Selection being a form of circular logic and he ties to paint Evolution as unfalsifiable (No, we can test it's predictions in such fields as Genetics and Palaeontology) and being denounce by an increasing number of scientists (not at all true).  All in all while Narby has some interesting nuggets of information and ideas in The Cosmic Serpent he ultimately seems to squander these ideas by jumping around in random directions and to strange conclusions based on very little evidence 
 i'll be the first to admit that i'm biased based on my expectations from shaara's father's great book, the killer angels.  it is not fair to compare the two, but because reading the father's book lead me to buy this one, i thought i should mention it.  this book does not contain nearly the details and intimancies of the father's book.  it is not surprising since this one covers a much longer time frame than the battle of gettysburg, so shaara has less pages to devote to each person and battle.  but the result is a less satisfying book.  it skims rather than digs deep 
 This edition may be contains 30 seconds of extra material that I had to watch 3 times to make sure was there! Stick with the original!  Go Sox!!!  But all that said this is a must have movie ..any version you can get. 
 I could not believe how bad this novel was. It was the first of his books I have ever read and I doubt i will give this hack another shot.  I am guessing his success has been propped up by wealthy activist who support his obviously extremist out look on the world.  There was no story. It was simply an anti-America, anti-Britain, anti-West, anti-business, anti-Christian, anti-Israel anti-everything the most radical euro trash could possibly come up with diatribe.  I do not know much about this guy but he left me with the distinct impression of someone suffering a mental breakdown of some kind.  How does garbage like this get printed? He is lucky it is a free world. (despite those of his ilk) If it were the world he seems to espouse he could never print something like this. 
 I enjoy reading sea stories such as "Working on the Edge", but it was a real chore to get through the maze of details which seemed to be included just to make the book 'thick' and did nothing to really add to the 'story'.  Pass on this one and spend your money on something written as less of a text book 
 I was a fan of the show until it disappeared from tv.  I was hoping for this book to be helpfull, and I read the other review.  I even paid extra for quick shipping.  But I was very disapointed in my buy.  The book was less of a helpfull guide to cleaning and more of just a book.  Sure, it's funny.  It's written by Mary Ellen!  She's hilarious!  But the book is less of a guide; it doesn't have a clear set of examples and rules.  I was hoping for something more like a thesarus.  Something I could I use to look up what I wanted to know and have my information.  This book you have to read it from cover to cover to get any information, and then, you are not guaranteed to find out what you want to know.  
 Reading this book was exhausting, confusing, and extremely unsatisfying. Sentences and parqagraphs ramble arround with confusing descriptions and conflicting information. Some major elements that are introduced are left hanging; never brought up again. Others are revisited ad nauseum. Barr's quirky way of describing people and places with bizarre comparisons slows down the plot and is just missleading. Although I did stay with it until the contrived end, this is the first book I ever attacked with a red pen and edited a I went along. I estimate it could have been 50 pages shorter, and have carried far more impact, without the extraneous language. I am shocked she sells well enough to have published so many books. I'd stay far away from her in the future and purify yourself by reading a clasic P.D. James or a pure and simple Sue Grafton 
 Argh - hoping to find a good survey of the geologic processes behind the Earth we know today but written for a non-geologist, I found his writing unfocused, tortured and pedantic -especially for someone who claimed to be targeting the geological neophyte.  Just ghastly and dry.  I suspect Mr Fortey's editor was handing out bonuses for using words that only 1 in 3 Phds had any chance of recognizing.  Mr Fortey must have picked up enough money on this incentive for a nice gourmet dinner.  This is an easy book to set aside. Just pick up a college geology text book and you will be better off 
 Tepid entry in the collection. Lorre's Moto a bit of a bore 
 I was at my cousan's house and we were listenening to these old tapes that were in a shobox. It was really funny. This is nothing like the music or today. This is the music you hear in groshery stores. We also listened to pink floyd the wall, dark side of the moon, and the first cut. These were a little better becuase they sound all angry and loud and how they hate school. 
 I read 560 pages of slow, long-winded prose and was rewarded with a hasty conclusion.  There was no ending to this book.  After making my way through extensive histories, foreign words, and confusing names worthy of any Russian novel, I was given five or six pages of slap-shod resolution.  I understand that this book is only the beginning of an ongoing series, yet the Harry Potter series, the most well-known, epic young adult fantasy, features definitive conclusions within each volume.  Mark Twain said that if he had more time, he would have written a shorter book.  Sherwood Smith should have taken more time with this book.  I love the Crown/Court Duel books.  They are gripping, concise, and ultimately rewarding.  Inda is nothing like those books, despite being set in the same world.  Some of the ideas and story lines were entertaining and even gripping.  However, any enjoyment I received from the story was swallowed by my overwhelming disappointment at the conclusion mixed with my impatience for the story to move forward.  Overall, this book was a waste of my time.  
 The author does a decent job explaining ISO requirements.  Contrary to the other reviewer's claims, there are "no" examples in the book.  Another useful tool would have been examples of ISO systems / process flowchart.  Instead, the author tries to get you to buy his software if you want to see any example at all.  I give the book 2 stars because it tries to do marketing instead of doing it's job of giving buyers useful information.  Based on the title of the book "ISO 9001 Requirements", the author did do his job explaining what the requirements are.  However, if you want to do ISO in order to improve the quality system of your company, as opposed to just getting a piece of paper saying that your company is ISO certified, then look for another book 
 This the first of Daninell's books I read.  I learnt that she was the Queen of romance novel since I was a teen.  I'm a little disappointed by the book because it's really boring for most of the part. It's like reading an alternative version of Princess Diana's traffic accident.  I realize that Daniell likes to repeat herself a lot.  There are too many reptitions of descriptions of all kinds.  It's also too predictable.  To me, everything that Bill did is really cheesy and unreal and his stubborness of rejecting and denying Anabelle after he became paralysed makes me wonder what a tyranny psycho he is that he just wants to inflict pain on the woman who loves him and who has nobody there for her at all. It's really hard to believe any man who acts so unreasonably stubborn on his own version of love and happiness that he can actually be an ideal partner for any woman.  Men like that are normally pretty controlling and emotionally abusive. This is the major element in the book that really turns me off.   I have to admit that the last part where Anabelle finally convinced Bill to be with her is quite touching.  I think Ms. Steel does have her crowds of fans.  My boyfriend's mother had been crying all the way thru the book.      
 Professor Yoo's writing style is as nearly befuddled and confused as his understanding of a Constitutional law.  I can say without fear of contradiction that this is by far one of the most ill-conceived, unsubstantive  and pointless books I have ever had the misfortune to read.  His theories and assertions are never clearly backed up with any real documentation or legal reasoning and he fails miserably in making any clear or concise point.  I feel this book was nothing more that a total waste of time. Perhaps Professor Yoo should stick to writing legal arguments, where style and in his case substance, don't really matter. 
 I am a Rita Mae Brown fan and have been from her early novels on.  I own and have read all of the "Mrs. Murphy" Mystery series.  This book is awful.  I can't believe she wrote it. I had to force myself to finish it.  Characters did things that didn't work.  The writing was just plain bad. Technical facts about wine and grapes and terrorism and you name it are thrown together and not wrapped in much story. Even the dialog is flat. I've enjoyed every topic Ms. Brown has tackled in the past because of her excellent writing so I concluded she is either ill, has writer's block, or had a crazy deadline that stopped the creative juices. Read any of the other books in the series, but don't bother with this one 
 I could not put this one down- I finished it in one evening, I just couldn't wait to find out what happened next, with the family and the court case. However, I was deeply disappointed by the ending. It was lame, it was soap opera-esque, it was so unworthy of this great story. Tacked-on and totally unneeded- it should have ended ten pages sooner, that would have be a fine conclusion 
 This is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention, keep you enthralled, and refuse to let you stop reading.  I read this book and literally did not sleep one night because I was too busy trying to finish the book.  But what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is, but it's because how good everything is until the very end.  That's right, the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel.  This is "deus ex machina" in its finest form.  This is unexcusable in my opinion.  I just don't get it.  I just don't understand how one can (seemingly) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages.  I gave it two stars (as opposed to one) for fooling everyone into reading through this book.  This is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever 
 This is the story of Cassie, who is found wandering helplessly in a cemetery by a young Indian policeman who just arrived in LA. Cassie suffers from amnesia and we don't know what brought her there, until a hollywood megastar recognizes her as his wife.  This is by far the most disappointing of Picoult's books, and I've read almost all of them and am a big fan of hers. Cassie is amnesic, yet she does remember stuff and it is not clear at all in the book how comes she recovers from her amnesia or actually how it happened. The story goes back and forth between the present, the past, the memories, and leaves readers lost in the middle.  I was surprised by other reviewers who were surprised by the ending. Chapter one gives the ending away in my opinion. What is frustrating is that it takes Picoult 350 pages to make her character realise the obvious.  I also found Cassie to be unreliable and unappealing, let alone her husband Alex, a massive egocentric. The story was very confused, mixing hollywood lifestyle with movie sets in Africa, with anthropology, Indian legends, domestic violence, alcoholism, amnesia - it was just too much for one book and the message was confused.   If you want a superb story of domestic violence, read Black & Blue by Anna Quindlen. If you want a good Picoult book, read The Pact or My Sister's Keeper, but definitely not Picture Perfect 
 This record kind of sucks, but that's okay, because it doesn't suck in the way where you think "oh hell we'll never get a good album out of this guy again" (like, for instance, Rod Stewart's latest garbage), because, I think, it's not really Lou's fault. The problem is Lou's trying to draw his material from somewhere else, in this case a mediocre poet. We've always been willing to overlook his (Poe's) considerable lack of talent (example:  "in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore") because he's so damn charismatic. Morbidly charismatic, but charismatic nonetheless. The danger is that too many people consider his pure dumb fun to be art (which I guess makes him a lot like the Rolling Stones). Lou, who's always shown himself to be a poet but a poet with a wink, has now chosen an artist who is basically Bernie Taupin with a better vocabulary to be his kindred spirit, and from someone who, Velvet genius notwithstanding, produced revolutionary and stunning works like Transformer, Metal Machine Music, and Berlin, this self-effacing friendship is the real tragedy 
 1- President Bush is building a base on the moon as our forward post for attacking evil aliens on Pluto. Just today we launched a ship toward pluto to start our attack.  2- A secret Cabal of Sceintologists have taken over the Defense Department and a working for Donald Rumsfeld who is actually L. Ron Hubbard come back from the dead.  3- Right Wing activists invented alcohol and drugs through funds from Jack Abramoff in order to make money for Tom Delay's trial.  4- Samuel Alito is actually Pat Robertson under a mission impossible style mask.  5- Edmund Burke and John Adams planned the JFK assination nearly 200 years before it happened and left notes in fortune cookies to tell their plans to future generations.  If you believe any of the above then you will love Brock's book. If not then its not the book for you 
 ... I read [this] book prior to a week-long trip to Venice.  This book quite simply accomplished none of its objectives.  It is a poor "guidebook" and is poorly written and uninteresting in terms of a travelogue--to quote Simon: "Abysmal with a capital A."  The history and art of Venice are covered better in books from those genres.  The only upside is that it is short.  Yuck, what a waste of time.  My advice is:  get a novel about Venice if you like novels, a guidebook if you want that, an art book, or a history book.  At least you'll get something out of those--this one tries all of these and fails.  Actually, in terms of a travelogue, "Vendela in Venice" far surpassess any other Venice book I have seen.  Although I originally bought it because it is considered a children's book, it is not dumbed down at all and adults will enjoy it... 
 This is a fun film and one of the few from the period where Jet just seems to have some fun and go off. But this is a pretty sorry release for it. So Tai Seng is releasing widescreen laser disc masters again? Niiicccee. Wait for a better release. At least that one might not have a Ric Meyers commentary on there. If there's a sure sign of a lack of care from a company releasing kung fu films, it's Meyers' name anywhere on the product. 
 There were moments in which I really enjoyed this book, but often I was thrown out of my state of disbelief by  little thing like the phrasing of dialogue, the changing sense of continuity between the  past and the "present," or the ferocity of the lust between the main characters (or their counterparts).  There was just enough eerieness to keep the mind engaged in the paranormal mystery, but somehow it never developed into a seamless whole.   An air book in places, but hardly a keeper 
 I heard "Heart of Mine" in the closing credits for the movie Runaway Jury.  After listening to the album, I found that was really the only tune I liked.  Peter Malick is a veteran of the hard-charging James Montomery Band (who I have seen tear up stages of Northeast blues clubs), which is why the sleepiness of most of these pieces mystifies me.  You could argue that he is going for a "relaxed" feel, to which I would repsond he succeeds all too well.  Norah Jones can sing, and sing well- no argument there, but these songs are not great.  The lyrics I found to be a little too clever, like some music student's term paper.  For most of the album I felt like everyone was trying way too hard to do something deep and meaningful.  Having said all this, "Heart of Mine" is an excellent record, and might even be worth the price of the CD.  Of course, to get the one good track, you could try downloading it for a dollar from itunes or your favorite MP3 site. 
 Maybe I am lucky... i have the original, limited edition New Falcon version.. even autographed by Chris Hyatt. I have owned the Llewellyn edition in the past, but disposed of it BECAUSE IT IS GARBAGE... incomplete, garbled... don't even bother with this edition. I believe "The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic" (New Falcon publications) is also still being sold on amazon.com. It is more expensive... but you truly get what you pay for. Don't waste your time on this Llewellyn garbage. I think ZERO stars would be more accurate.. 
 I bought this cable to connect 50" Plasma TV to computer. When we connected the cable with TV we could not get it to display computer screen. We spent 2 hours with Plasma manufacturer on telephone troubleshooting the connection. At the end, at our dissapointment, we found out that the cable was defective. When we tried different cable everything worked 
 Poor quality transfer. Two of the films are almost unwatchable, but The Executioner is a little better. 
 You can read all about the book just from what is included in the jacket. Unbelievable potrayal of a women cast off a ship by her husband. All she wants to know is did he love her when he married her? Why did he do it? I mean give me a break! I would not lay low and try to make him go insane. I would go to the police.   I read books from beginning to end to give them a chance. This was a waste of my time 
 Seriously , miles davis's music for me , i only can use one word to describe it : boring !! its just my personal taste , like hear some of his record , i cant really feel anything that will touchs me , charlie parker famous for his technique , charles mingles... cools orchestra setting , bill evans... great harmony and chord.  But Miles Davis ?? i just cant found any element that will makes me like him. kind of blue is not bad , but i just dont think its classic. 
 Average album from West Coast veteran, RBX, released from Daz Dillinger's independent imprint, Gangsta Advisory. RBX, who came up with Snoop & Tha Dogg Pound during the Death Row era of the early 90's, never really had a breakthrough solo effort despite a ghastly flow and an ominous voice. "Ripp Tha Game Bloody" has a few decent tracks but is far too guest-heavy to be considered a solo album. All-star appearances by Snoop on "Tell It! (The Remix)" and Daz on "Jus... Murda" are pretty underwhelming but his collabo with former Doggystyle artist, E. White on "They Run" is the highlight here. There are some other worthwhile tracks like "Summer In The City", "Crime", "RBX", and "Picasso", but for the most part, the album is nothing special. Another problem I had with the album is that it has no production credits, thus all of its young unknowns continue to go unknown. "Ripp The Game Bloody" should have been more 
 I had a waterpik which started having problems after a year (planned obsolescence, LA water...Who knows). I bought this hoping for better longevity but it is disappointing. I like the layout of the reservoir and controls but it is not nearly as powerful as the water pick and the reservoir is way to small. Just my opinion (humble as it may be 
 Alan Alda is a funny man. But his book is not. He jumps from here to there leaving one to wonder where he is going with his story. Our book club was anxious to read something different but it was unanimous - thumbs down 
 I have not bought this book as I would not let one penney fall into Garrison's pocket, but I've perused this volume heavily.  I wish that I could have given it 0 stars.  The author is an unreconstructed Confederate  who, whenever there is a remotely possible sinister way of interpreting  Lincoln's actions, prefers to submit that view rather than acknowledge the  findings of recognized scholars' research.  For example, he claims that  Lincoln is responsible for the creation of the "Imperial  Presidency", making possible the abuses of Nixon, Vietnam, etc.  But  he does not show that Lincoln's powers were often balanced by a war conduct  committee, that the Presidency went on to lose considerable authority and  esteem in the Reconstruction years, and that Lincoln himself acknowledged  that, except in the case of national emergencies, as the Civil War was  viewed, the President lacked powers to do many things (like the  Emancipation Proclamation).  Garrison also blames Lincoln for being  uncompromising and contends, without proof, that the Confederacy's desire  to continue as a separate nation would have faded, if allowed, resulting in  reunification.  But most scholars acknowledge that the individual states  would have sooner seceded even further into smaller nations, and that other  states in the Union would have found reason to secede into new  confederacies.  Thus, as I've said, Garrison's trash has been disproven yet  he pretends as though it has not even been noticed by scholars.  It is the  vitriolic spite of an unenlightened Confederate clinging to the bitterness  of ancestors.  This book should be relegated to the heap of trash-writing  never to be recovered 
 While I know that this book is considered by many to be a great classic, when I read it I literally had to force myself to finish this book over the course of a month, when normally it would have taken me a matter of days. The writing dragged on and on and on with little details and events I could have cared less about. The characters did not appeal to me, except for Claudia and ""SOILER"" she was killed off rather quickly, compared to the rest of the book. The only thing that attracted me to her was her determination and more ruthless personality than Lestat and Louis, who were, in my honest opinion, too effeminite for me to greatly like. I suppose the overall story is interesting, but it is so lost in a web of mind-numbing writing and weak characters that it was impossible for me to enjoy in any way. 
 It took well over 500 pages to write what should have been written in 300 or so pages, and in those last 200 pages, my interest was sorely flagging.  I didn't find Annie particularly compelling on any level.  Her personality, while supposedly she was the town pariah since her teens, was more milquetoast than troublemaker.  How an entire town could come to despise her for vague things she did when she was young is beyond my comprehension.  The exchanges between Annie and Grace Metalious were bizarre, and I didn't buy that they were the product of a creative writer-type.    Frankly, I felt that the author basically used Ms. Metalious and her novel Peyton Place to piggyback on to sell this mediocre novel of her own.  I would only recommend this book to a masochist 
 I found Mr. Riley's "Tell Me Why" a very entertinaing romp through the Beatle song catalog. Big an equally big Dylan fan, I expected the same joi de vivre to inhabit "Hard Rain," but throughout the book I got the sense that Riley didn't have the same passion for or understanding of Dylan's music and muse as he did with the Beatles. I suspect that he wrote it because it seemed like a natural thematic sequel to the Beatle book. You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows 
 Wolfe hero worships the Irish, and all others rank below them.  The Irish detective Martin, DAs Fitzgibbon and Caughey can do no wrong. The Italians, Jews and Wasps have their good points, but are flawed in one way or another. At the bottom are the "dark people" as Wolfe constantly calls them, who have created a great, dark hole in our once-great society. There is the single exception that proves the rule of the black public defender, though the narrative implies that his legal skills are inferior.  Granted it's an entertaining read, but don't be fooled 
 this book is ok, but it's a weak ripoff of The Great Big Burger Book, which is also 100 recipes, all kinds of meat and fish, etc but the first one is a much better book, easier to reproduce. 
 I don't know how this book managed to get a 4-1/2 star review which is why I bought it.  After seeing an interview with Carl Hiaasen I decided to try his books, starting with his first one.  This is one of the worst books I've ever read.  Hanging the psychiatrist out a window by his feet is too incredible to believe (I had to reread the paragraph to be sure that's what was happening), but then locking the door on a hospital room and having sex in the room while recovering from surgery was the last straw.  After reading 190 pages I finally spared myself the torture of finishing the book.  It found it's way to the trash can.  Don't waste your time on this 
 This book, the third in the trilogy, seems implausible, all the way through.  Nothing seems natural or real.  But that doesn't mean it's not readable.  You can read it and maybe overlook the implausibilities.  You have two young first-person narrators, Jory and Bart, both of school age.  Now, you know how important school is to people aged 14 and 10.    Jory and Bart say nothing about school, their classmates, their teachers, school events, you name it.  It is mentioned once or twice that they are in school, but that's it.  Jory talks a bit about ballet school, but that's not school-school.    It's very implausible.  Kids spend close to a third of their lives in school, at that age, and to leave only a blank wonderment there, where school should be, seems to mean that Andrews left it out on purpose.  But it's not plausible.  Next, the evil person in this novel is the butler.  That's plausible enough.  Butlers are known for sneakiness and suppressed anger.  Yet, the butler, John Amos (Jackson), turns out to be a member of the Foxworth family.  Can you believe that?  A member of this wealthy family decides on a career as a butler?  John Amos is not such a bad bad guy.  He's too old to be physically imposing.  Cathy and Chris, even Jory, can overcome him easily.  He apparently is not evil enough to carry a firearm of some type.  Guess what he uses as weapons?  Shovels and fire pokers.  The man is born to lose, and he does lose, in the end (off to butler hell for this old codger).    Yet, John Amos was really the most interesting character in this book.  Sometimes the bad guy is the most interesting character in a novel, because he or she is the only one who acts out of character, that is, unconventionally.  That's true in this novel.  Bart does act unconventionally, but in the end, he's excused for his idiosyncrasies, because of his youth.  Much of Bart's behavior is also implausible.  This ties in with his apparent non-attendance at school, because his classmates would certainly have made him more conventional.  That's one of the main purposes of school: socializing those who attend, making sure that they learn "the rules" of society.  Bart learns his rules from a book that John Amos gives him, a journal of his great-grandfather.  Is this plausible?  The boy sneaks around tasting dog leavings but reads like a child prodigy?  Does this make much sense?  Well, you decide.  And have fun.    Diximus.    
 "Mr. Mani" is the story of a Sephardic family over a couple centuries, told via one side of conversations, and going backwards in time.  Both devices are hoary. I didn't believe for a second that the characters were of their own time. They were not even three-dimensional moderns. The prose alternates between plodding and precious. It's beyond me why this novel is well-respected 
 I expected more african vocals in it.. thats the main reason i brought the cd, i recently became a fan of that kind of music.. it had like 3 songs on there that i liked, besides that this album is garbag 
 Not since the writing of Karl Marx has there been such garbage 
 I am sure this will be a great magazine, but I have not received my first issue yet 
 Includes a DVD with OS for Linux. Only the last few sections deal directly with Linux commands and only briefly. Most of this book deals with installation issues of different Linux OSs 
 I TOTALLY agree with "A Reader" that posted on January 10, 2004... titled." What Would Sue Monk Kidd Do?" This reviewer captured my thoughts exactly. WHY would anyone want to read a spiritual book written by a woman who abandoned her Christianity? Please! This author has one book that is good..."The Secret Life of Bees," and it's fiction! Stick with fiction, Ms. Kidd. You seem to do it in your own spiritual life, so writing it should be simple. 
 About 1st book: Taira Shinken is a well know name in Okinawan Kobudo. His "RyuKyu Kobudo Taikan" stands as a reference on Okinawan Kobudo technique not polluted by modern fashion which is almost always the result of plain ignorance and show-business. Mr. McCarthy issued this english version of the old master work apparently for the benefit of non-japanese practitioners.  However there are some issues: 1 - He boldly replaced all the pictures of sensei Taira Shinken for pictures of himself and one of his pairs. Some pictures, mainly the in kon-bo katas show some irregular handling of the weapon (with hands too close to each other) and some indefinite stances which can puzzle some inexperienced practicioners. 2 - He didn't respect the original material. Every kata in Shinken Taira original work has been somewhat changed! Techniques were added, omited or replaced in all katas! An entire sequence is different in Shushi-no-Kon.  Old katas were made as a global repository of knowledge by old masters in a age of practical life-threatening fighting. The knowledge they contain is unique and irreplaceable. Modern fancy-athletic-acrobatic pseudo-kata cannot compare and never will! These katas can have some school or local variations which should be respected and considered when looking for a "reference" form. Each new generation should try to respect the old forms keeping in mind that there is no way of reliably testing and improving them in life-threatening situations nowadays as they once were.  Works such as "Ryukyu Kobudo Taikan" should not be altered: they are a personal testimony of a great master and document uniquely an entire epoch and a long martial tradition.  I advise everyone interested seriously in Okinawan Kobudo to buy the recently re-issued japanese version of Taira Shinken work featuring the original (yes! They are still usable!) illustrations (along with Mr. McCarthy's "interpretation" if one doesn't read japanese) in order to get the correct knowledge.  About 2nd book: The 2nd book of the series is a repository of reference historical documents about traditional Karate featuring precious info about old karate masters and the true spirit of Karate. It's mostly text-based with only 10 b/w pictures but has a lot of "juice" in it. It should find a prominent place in the library of the serious karateka. 
 As a consequence of the proliferation of chick lit, SF authors such as Wilson have caved in and added all the chick lit cliches to the skeleton of a good premise. Delete all the emotional turmoil that the numerous hormonal chicks experience in this otherwise clever book and you're left with a great short story. They should provide a pair of pantyhose created by the "Hypotheticals" with each copy of the book. Maybe they should start calling the award the Huguette Award. Or the "Hug-Me" Award 
 Unlike most reviewers here, I really disliked this book.  The main reason is that the entire novel is a gimmick without any real substance.  There is no reason to tell such a dull story except for the fact that there is some mysterious story-within-a-story complexity.  The characters, especially the protagonist Iris, are bores.  Iris is like a 300 page wet blanket.  Most of the other characters are 1-dimensional cut outs.  Her sister Laura is the exception, but she got on my nerves too with her one-note quirkiness.  The story-within-a-story is more a gimmick than anything else.  The science-fiction meta-story within that story I thought was the most interesting part of the book, but it goes nowhere and its purpose is even more tenuous than its parent.  Finally, this is my second Atwood book, and I really dislike her writing style.  It reads as if she is trying too hard, and even the simplest situations feel forced.  I don't understand why everyone seems to like this book, but I would just suggest not to believe all the hype. 
 I give this film one star for the acting, which is often very good. However, the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness, and debase every aspect of lower income, urban people. In all honesty, I've seen more joy in an African famine. I sat through this film, against my better judgement. Still, if you're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban American misery and frailty, then I recommend "A Streetcar Named Desire", "KIDS", "Last Exit to Brooklyn", and "Traffic". 
 I didn't understand why so many people liked this book many years ago when I read it, and I don't understand it any better today.  A lot of people said they thought it showed a good perspective of the corporate climate of the eighties, but that was only a tiny part of the novel.  Stick to Liar's Poker or Bombardiers for a better look.  Most of this novel is taken up by a ridiculous crime story.  There is not a single sympathetic character, so it is like spending however many hours in a room full of highly unpleasant people.  Not only are they un-likeable, they are also unrealistic and they make unbelieveable decisions.  The young, energetic stock trader who is all charm and confidence in one scene is suddenly socially awkward and unpopular in another scene.  The smart, tough lawyer sends his client off to a romantic tryst wearing a wire, even though any idiot would know the chances of his taking off his shirt would be very high.  Other characters are just caricatures: the overzealous civil-rights activist; the arrogant cop; etc.  I seem to be in the minority, but I thought this book was dismal.  Tom Wolfe should stick to non-fiction, which he does well 
 My initital impressions of 'American Gods' were nearly uniformly positive.  Although I had not read any reviews previous, I was aware of the level of hype and praise for this novel.  But like a doomed traveler in Fred Pohl's 'Gateway', the book never achieved "turn-a-round".  The central storyline is further and further pushed off, and often seems to occur on the sidelines.  Gaiman's prose is engaging and easy to slip into, but I felt empty in the end, without significant payoff or a true sense of journey.  Those wishing to delve into urban fantasy may be better served by Tim Powers.  "Last Call" in particular serves as an excellent counterpoint to "Gods 
 This book was helpful as far as hotel info, and attraction info goes, However, there were more than a couple of errors that made it a little frustrating. We ordered this book because we wanted a good idea of what rides would be appropriate for our children's ages and heights, etc. There were a few rides that had one height requirement on one page, and then a different height requirement on another. This book was helpful in some aspects of planning our trip, but the discrepencies with ride information was not a help. I now wish I had ordered something else 
 I bought this 18 months ago and while I had some problems with the set up, I got help from the store where I bought it.  It has really nice sound, but it has a serious problem: not once but TWICE, when my children inserted DVDs in the player they would NOT eject!  Since no one could service it locally (I went to 3 places, and each claimed they could fix it but then later admitted they couldn't since they would have had to open it up), I had to send it to Bose.  That cost a lot, plus Bose charges a minimum of about $240 (I forget the exact amount) to even look at it.  Now, the exact same thing has happened (this is the second episode)!  They say you can repair this easily but I went through the recommended procedures with a Bose technician over the phone and it didn't work.   There's NO WAY I'm sending this machine back to them; I'm getting something else!  Any recommendations?  Finally, lest you think the kids are somehow to blame, let me note that they work daily with other DVDs, CD-roms, CD players, and personal computers and have never had any problems with any of them.  I normally don't like having to pay extra for a warranty, but if you insist on getting this product, I'd recommend buying it from a place that sells it with a warranty 
 CRUDE TO THE MAX ! sorry that I wasted the money 
 At a time when the baby boomer's were yet to exist, WW2 was happening. A school of boys are stranded on an island due to a plane crash with no adult anywhere. The leader Ralph created 2 teams to survive each having a certain task. Jack becomes the hunter team, while Ralph was more of the society creation team. Ralph's second had man, Piggy, helps out in more than a few ways untill tradgity strikes. The teams divide as the socity clapes and roles are broken. WIlliam Golding has created another timeless piece, full of changes and plot twists in "lord of the Flies" 
 I had heard good things about this magazine and so ordered a sample.  It is a lovely magazine, beautiful photos and it is interesting reading about "other coasts" (besides east and west).  But, at least with the most recent issue, in every article about families or couples and their coastal homes the people were all caucasian.  Even the advertisements had only white people (save for one about vacationing in Mexico that had some cute Mexican children in it).  While I doubt this is intentional, I would encourage the publishers of this magazine to put their attention on this issue.  There are plenty of people of color living on the coast who have interesting homes and lives that readers would enjoy learning about 
 I really didn't read it as it is too long and does not keep my interest at all.  I have read other books in the past like "Body for Life" and found them very informative and short and to the point.  
 I picked up an issue of this magazine last week because I wanted to take the picture of the cover girl into my hair dresser. After I got it home, I opened it up to check it out and discovered it is the most brainless magazine I have ever seen. The articles read like something from "Teen Beat", yet it's filled with adult material. There were about 10 articles on "how to please your man" and "what guys like" and even a "sex workout". These articles didn't contain any "real" advice--just unintelligent babble. For instance, did any of you know that guys don't like it when you act unenthusiastic during sex? HMMM, crazy.   Anyway, I don't see how anyone over the age of 16 could find any of this stimulating, and yet there are too many articles about one-night stands for anyone under 18 to read.   But if you're still into taking quizzes and looking at "half-naked hunks" who have barely hit puberty, then this magazine is perfect. I would have given this magazine 0 stars, but unfortunately it's not an option 
 The only reason I don't rate this as a no star or even 1/2 star movie is because it isn't an option on Amazon. I bought this film while serving in Iraq, where the only thing we had to do much of the time was watch DVDs, and still didn't even finish the thing. Troops in combat zones will watch almost anything, no matter how B-level or low budget as long as there is a coherent plotline but this looks like someone spent about $500 bucks on everything including crappy camera equipment and actors and edited the movie (and I use that term loosely) on their pc before releasing it. My title stands, if you're thinking of buying this movie don't and if you bought it don't open it so that when you return it you can get your money back with no hassle. 
 Even though this book is inexpensive, I wouldn't recommend purchasing it. The job ideas are not inspiring, and not really up to date either. It barely skims the surface of what someone can do with an English major and/or writing experience, and never steps outside of the basic areas that you've probably already thought of yourself. It also doesn't give you a single idea as to how to break into any of the few jobs it mentions, if you happen to be looking for that kind of advice as well. Purchase something a little weightier and a little more expensive, it'll be worth it. This isn't 
 This book is pure fiction.  Been trying to do what the book says for almost a year.  Have not been successful.  I guess if you are psychic than it works, but not for the rest of us untalented individuals.  What a total  let down.  Maybe her angels should have told her that the book wouldn't  work 
 I was grabbed by the title and his down to earth approach, but he never got indepth with the actual process of how his program worked.  He Redundantly, reexplained the ideas of random occurances in numbers and  tryed to apply it to text.  But was it my understanding or was it his lack  of explaination, I still don't comprehend where or how he started his  process when he applied it to the text. Does he apply his theory to every  Character or what?  If your interested in the bible code he helps clarify  questions I had from other books. Other than that, he hasn't convinced me  either way. A must have in order to keep up with his bible code ideas  because you know that next month someone  will write another book using his  theory to justify the code or rebuke it 
 Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller. Not recommended.  In his 1960 introduction to Tropic of Cancer, Karl Shapiro said, "I call Henry Miller the greatest living author because I think he is," ". . . as a spiritual example he stands among the great men of our age," and ". . . he [Orwell] predicts that Miller will set the pace and attitude for the novelist of the future. This has not happened yet, but I agree that it must." Shapiro does not support any of these points in his essay, and nothing about Tropic of Cancer supports them, either.  Tropic of Cancer consists of 318 pages recounting Miller's experience as an American expatriate in Paris and expounding his personal philosophy, often in ways that are rambling and painfully nonsensical. Miller's stories about his friends are tedious, pointless, and catty; like Miller, they seem to have been talentless hacks whose belief in their own artistic abilities makes them artists and writers, as though believing is being. Miller writes, "A year ago, six months ago, I thought I was an artist. I no longer think about it, I am"--which is the type of arrogant pretentiousness he mocks in virtually all of his acquaintances.  When they are not creating, or talking about philosophy or creating, Miller and his circle seem to spend nearly every moment picking up women (and disease). They rarely use a neutral term such as "woman" when there are so many obscene, demeaning words with which to objectify the gender. The women that Miller and friends find are invariably portrayed as stupid, drunken, irrational, loose, sly, deceptive, and good primarily for one function, which Miller turns into a squalid, cold, joyless act. In spite of all the vice and the "living," no one seems to be having fun, and some characters, notably Fillmore, find themselves nearly trapped into the bourgeoisie life.  Miller expresses contempt for the machine, the industrial age, and money--although he schemes to keep 2,800 francs from Fillmore's mistress and revels in having so much in his pocket. Often hungry, Miller obsesses about food and relies on his friends to support him. When he describes his Indian friend Kepi as ". . . a scrounger, a sort of human tick who fastens himself to the hide of even the poorest compatriot," he could be talking about himself as he bitterly complains about those of his friends who are stingy with money, accommodations, food, and wine.  Miller's logic about the working world is facile; he writes, "If you want bread, you've got to get in harness, get in lockstep." On the surface, this is true, but it never seems to occur to him that, if you want bread, someone must cultivate, raise, and harvest the wheat and produce the other components; someone must transform these components into bread; and someone must deliver it to the shops and cafes. In other words, if most people weren't in "lock step," Miller could choose to starve or set himself to produce bread, joining the world in harness. He makes his choice clear, then whines about it. He may despise those who support him, whether they are friends or workers, but that is perhaps because he, a misanthrope who finds fault with everyone but himself, needs the very people he denigrates (including "the grocer, the baker, the shoemaker, the butcher, etc.--all imbecilic-looking clodhoppers"), a reliance which he resents. He hates the machine and the machine mind, but offers no alternatives.  Seemingly incapable of sincere feeling, Miller finds human emotion amusing. When a friend says, "A boy can break your heart . . . He's so damned beautiful! And so cruel!" Miller writes, "We had to laugh at this. It sounded preposterous. But Collins was in earnest." When an acquaintance to whom he owes money dies, he writes, "At any rate, he was killed in an automobile accident shortly after my arrival, a circumstance which left me twenty-three francs to the good."  Shapiro claims that Miller is a poet, but his attempts at poetic and philosophic ramblings often make little if any sense. Speaking of buildings and statues, Miller says, " . . . they must be saturated with my anguish," the kind of bad metaphor in which he frequently indulges. He describes artists such as himself as the "inhuman ones." "I am inhuman! I say it with a mad, hallucinated grin, and I will keep on saying it though it rain crocodiles. Behind my words are all those grinning, leering, skulking skulls, some dead and grinning a long time, some grinning as if they had lockjaw, some grinning with the grimace of a grin, the foretaste and aftermath of what is always going on." Whenever these attempts at poetic philosophy appeared, rambling on for pages, I found myself yearning for a return to his insipid stories about prostitutes, disease, friends, and hunger.  Tropic of Cancer is perhaps the worst book I have ever read (and I did promise myself that I would read Tropic of Capricorn). Shapiro says, "There are not many of these emancipated beings left in our world [emancipated from what? --DLS], these clowns and clairvoyants, celebrants of the soul and of the flesh and of the still-remaining promise of America." If Miller, with his whining, his criticism, his holier-than-everyone attitude, his "art," his two-dimensional view of people, and his obsession with excrement, is the "greatest" of these souls, may I never meet the least.  Note: If there were a 0 stars option, Tropic of Cancer would have earned it 
 This book is a joke.  For a beginner looking for a comprehensive guide for investing, don't buy this book, unless you want a lesson in being ripped off.  This book is the size of a coaster, the kind you find next to the checkout at the pharmacy about how to get various stains out of your argyle socks.  It's made up to look cute; a two inch hardcover tomb, complete with dustjacket.  Misspellings and grammatical errors abound in this nugget.  Aspects of investing are listed, but not explained to any extent that might help someone actually pick stocks.  "A Fool And His Money Are Soon Parted," by Peter Lynch.  Buy another one of his books (a "big kid" book), but not this one 
 Novocaine for the funny bone. I ordered this CD along with one by Andy Andrist, because Stanhope recommended them both. Well, apparently ol' Dougie had one too many Jï¿½germeisters that day, because, while Andrist is a flat-out hoot, this Barry guy doesn't even approach funny. His delivery is whiny and flat, and his material is occasionally amusing but that's about it. He'll have his own show on the Tee Vee someday, no doubt about it, along with the rest of the safe, marginally talented hacks who currently infest American airwaves.  If you like Bill Hicks, Lenny Bruce, or Stanhope, avoid this guy like a bad sitcom 
 Trying to figure out the point. Language is good...but content Zip. I normally don't put books down half way. Am very tempted to do it with this one. Can't believe this won an awar 
 What the heak is this crap, did Gavin Rossdale need to pay of some debts? How much time did he spend on the artwork cover? (Just paint on some horse?) There is absolutley nothing good about "Distort Yourself" its a total bore, nothing fresh, exciting, sounds like Gavin doing a bad cover of Soundgarden.  Gavin Rossdale and these guys out of Helmet have got nothing to say at all, its a wonder why they even bothered.  Why Gavin Rossdale just does'nt get of his arse and make a decent Bush record is beyond the fans I'm sure 
 I bought this book eagerly, since I loved the first one and its kick-behind heroine Sirena. Sirena's fiery invincibility is absent here - she mourns excessively and irrationally for her dead son and caves to her abusive second husband. Regan van der Rhys is an insensitive jerk and philanderer and so is his son Caleb, who has developed into a major disappointment as a major character in this book. I wanted to see Regan and Sirena's fiery passion, not see them sleep around with other people. Read "Captive Passions" again and don't waste your time with this one 
 I picked this up because it's considered a classic and I knew it had been made into a movie.  I tend to think that if a book is made into a movie, then the book must be pretty good.  Not so with Howard's End.  The plot in Howard's End doesn't progress much outside of an early death and later marraige.  You have to have some interest in the characters, but they just weren't very believeable.  None of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world.  I kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting, but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance.  The story is clearly dated and doesn't hold up well so many years later.  Living in today's world, it's hard to understand what attracted Margaret to Henry.  There definately is an audience for this book.  I'm just not a part of it 
 Although a pretty kettle, and with a wide enough base to support a full flame on commercial range such as Viking or Wolf, the inside became pitted and rusted within months. When I inquired from LeCreuset, they explained that it was not an isolated incident, but rather that they had been having problems with the vendor that produced this particular item. Unless you are looking for a disposable teapot you will have to replace within 6 months, stay away from this on 
 I have finished about 5 different chapters for a Masters degree course I am taking.  This book is not for beginners!  I am an RN and have been working in business for 10 years.  The author assumes that you have had  basic accounting and the terminology is unfamiliar.  There are very few  examples given so it is hard to take the information and see how it is  really used.  I have had to buy another book just so that I could  understand this book 
 This is an awesome awesome movie.  I say that because it is one of the best renditions Hollywood has ever done of a person suffering from "psychotic depression."  Johnny Depp (who is effected by it) lets the viewer watch this illness evolve in a slow journey down into the dark pit of insanity.  The audience experiences this pure psychosis in a fashion that is authentic to the T.  The movie ingeniously shows this form of stress-induced-insanity which is so brilliantly triggered by (1) finding your wife in bed with her boyfriend, (2) the impending divorce, (3) Depp having to move out of his house and into a summer house on a lake, and (4) the inevitable financial stress on this lead character.  I mean, oh my god, he must be running about 500 stress points!  That's enough to trigger a psychotic attack on anyone who is predisposed to psychotic mental illness (paranoid schizophrenia, psychotic bipolar, psychotic depression, post-partum psychosis - about 8 million US people).  This is exactly the type of stress that triggered me to go into an almost identical type of psychotic episode a number of years ago while an army officer assigned to Germany.  For me, the stressors were very similar to the movie - move to Europe, new platoon leader, financial difficulties, relationship stress, new language to speak, etc.    Psychosis means delusions and the movie very realistically showed the onset of the "persecutorial delusion" (where you think someone is coming to get you) by showing Turturro coming to get Johnny.  And then the formation of the potentially more serious "grandiose delusion" where you think that others (real people) are conspiring against you.  This is where some psychotic people will actually lash out at others, and by so doing, if they harm them, they become criminally insane.  Of the 8 million of us who have this type of psychotic illness, about 50,000 of us will do this.  We'll read about the next one in the newspapers next week.  Almost all of these will be done by people who did not know they had a psychotic illness, were not previously diagnosed and were not medicated.  And this is exactly Depp's situation in the film (I have psychotic bipolar and must take lithium for mania, and Zyprexa for psychosis daily).  Psychosis also means hallucinations.  And Turturro has this part by playing an "imaginary paranoid hallucination antagonist."  This is really an ingenious Hollywood technique because it helps others in our society understand psychosis by showing a visual hallucination.  I believe the technique was first used in "Beautiful Mind."  This phenomenon, coupled with the delusions, is what makes paranoid psychosis a horrifying experience.  The movie shows this paranoid delusional psychosis very well and Depp actually lashes out at a number of people in his psychotic episode.  For me, I got these same types of delusions and similar hallucinations in Germany but never lashed out at others - therefore I got an honorable discharge as a captain, after getting out of the stressful situation and the psychosis dissipated.  I liked the above parts of the movie very well for its authenticity - it was good.  However what I didn't like about the movie is that it went way over board in the number of homicides.  This just adds to the mental illness stereotype and the stigma.  And so more people won't go in and get help when they should be getting help and medication.  It took me 23 years before I got help.  Why?  Because of the stigma and fear.  Maybe if society didn't have this stigma, we wouldn't have these types of terrible tragedies like in this movie.  My heart goes out to anyone who has been impacted by this.    Society has available the medicine and counseling which is needed to eliminate this type of tragedy.  Maybe if they educated the masses in a smart way we could eliminate it.  But instead we "monsterize" this illness by this type of movie 
 I purchased this magazine solely to get cheaper access to ESPN Insider Online.  The magazine is so all over the place otherwise that its hardly worth reading.  Its chock full of tidbits that barely gloss over sports topics.  I keep it in my bathroom and I guess its good there when I only have a few minutes to read while brushing my teeth or whatnot.  Don't expect SI-type depth though, its full of ads and slick factoid type departments.  Reading this magazine is like watching Sportscenter, a lot of many little things with no depth on anything.  I guess its worth it for less than 60 cents an issue, but if I sat down to read this magazine cover to cover I would be done with it totally in under 15 minutes....enjoy 
 Even though I would agree that "Erin Brockovich" is an entertaining movie, Julia Roberts performance in it is no more Oscar-worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in "Pretty Woman."  I am second to no one in enjoying a good "David and Goliath" story, but this movie has such shaky roots in reality, it is more of a tall tale, than the "true" story of a historic class action suit that, I would imagine, left more unhappy plaintiffs, than it did satisfied ones.  However, as the movie title implies, this is indeed Erin Brockovich's story, in the same way that the "Xena" character is the main attraction in "Xena: Warrior Princess" (though it should be noted that Xena's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the Erin Brockovich character).  Erin Brockovich is a vain, brassy, boorish, single mother of three young children, with no marketable work skills, a transparently opportunistic manner, who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character Roberts played in "Pretty Woman" (prior to Richard Gere's character taking her on the infamous Rodeo Drive shopping spree).  The movie's beginning finds Erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident; her lawsuit is lost, primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony (swearing, cursing and shrieking from the witness stand) while being questioned by opposing counsel.   Unbelievably, Erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney's (played by Albert Finney) firm, mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk.   Later, while handling the paperwork for a run-of-the-mill, pro bono, real estate sale, Erin discovers the file contains the seller's medical records, that, for reasons she (correctly) does not understand, seem to be of particular interest to the buyer, the mega utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric.  Erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that PG&E had (for decades) negligently contaminated the ground water (surrounding one of their power plants in/near Hinkley, CA on the edge of the Mojave Desert) with toxic, hexavalent chromium.  This discovery leads to the queen mother of all class-action lawsuits (at least in terms of the award), in which hundreds of Hinkley residents sue PG&E (by and through the representation of Erin's boss) in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs.  Roberts gives a photogenic, if not especially gifted, performance in her role as Erin. The movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of Roberts (literally gushing out skin-tight, low-cut, bustier-inspired "work clothes" that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet) as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated Hinkley residents. While there is much to be said for Erin's apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit, she is not an especially likeable character; rather, she is rude, verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests.  Albert Finney is considerably more appealing and believable as Ed Masry, the aged and  weary attorney who is Erin's boss.  The bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing; unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work, the focus for these scenes seems to be more on Roberts (strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy, five-inched-heeled mules) than on the sometimes-interesting personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters.  Aaron Eckhart plays the affable, gentle biker and next-door-neighbor, George, who becomes Erin's boyfriend-by-convenience.  The "convenience" factor is totally one-sided and for Erin's benefit exclusively; she  unabashedly uses George for free, live-in childcare, thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist Masry as they put together the historic case.  Erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar "bonus" check  (from Masry) when the tort action case settles; contrastingly, George gets a "thanks" for his nanny services from Erin and his walking papers.   The plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life, who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant.  Though the Hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed, make no mistake-this movie is about Erin Brockovich (indeed, I do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present) and less about the brave struggles with life-threatening, generation-spanning illnesses that the real-life plaintiffs were forced to face, due to the toxicity in their water source.  Erin Brockovich is presented to the viewing audience (in typical Hollywood fashion) as a sort of heroine; but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people, walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich.  Is the movie entertaining-absolutely.   Inspiring- not even slightly. 
 I rented this movie because Marguerite Moreau looked hot on the box.  But she didn't look nearly as good in the movie.  Her character was a smoking (gross), bed-hopping slob who looked like she harbored every STD known to man.  And she thinks she has to sleep with every guy she meets in order to find love (silly).  Really no focus in this movie, not enjoyable 
 was worthless...was not the correct match for my class book requirement.  Never used it...if someone wants it you can have it for free   
 The author attempted to cover the topic of capacity management in 122 pages and it failed miserably. Yes, the book has 324 pages, but 202 pages were used to cover the history of capacity cost management.  The book is useless! The authors had no intention to innovate in this book. It has neither concrete examples nor elegant theory; it describes neither engineering nor science; unlike what the title indicates, no optimization (other than the word itself) was ever part of the discussion. To top it off, the the figures and tables were made amateurishly as well.  It is hard for me to imagine how people, who claim to be the domain experts, can dump so many empty and dry words into one book and price-tag it $89.95 (I did buy it used at around $10).   I regret buying this book deeply and wish that noone else would do the same 
 i read this more as an essay and commentary regarding prewar england.  themes of church intollerance, school rigidity, classism, bigotry, etc. abound.  one can read this literally, leaving the task confused and befuddled.  one should read this metaphorically, perhaps as a dream sequence, to fairly appreciate what orwell sought to accomplish.  i enjoyed elements of this for the sheer brilliance of observation.  life at the hops camp was particularlly sharp.  if one appreciates gritty labor struggles and observations of the religiously constrained, this will be a pile of words worth reading 
 I have read many of James Patterson's books and have never been disappointed.   This book however, was a big let down.  I almost didn't finish reading the first few chapters because I had difficulty following it, they were choppy and confusing.  After the shaky beginning, it was much better and I found myself enjoying the storyline until the end.  The end was 'stupid' for lack of a better word. Twist, yes, it was a twist, but in a direction that made NO  sense. WHY??  I thought he would give some insight into the purpose of the ending, but he didn't.  
 This book was mistakenly placed in my preschool classroom and read to the children by another teacher.  If you are planning to buy this book be aware that some of the themes in the book may not be appropriate for children under 6-7 years old.  This book deals with a child being taken away from home, friends and family then losing a prized possesion.  The book also includes talk about war and soldiers with guns.  My class had difficulty understanding why Emi was being taken away.  This book is more suited to children much older 
 do yourself a favor - don't waste your time with this book 
 I haven't received my subscription to Sunset magazine yet.  I can't review the actual magazine, but I can say they are very slow at getting new orders out 
 Why would anyone buy a biography of Jim Morrison by authors who write on page 465 (bottom of page):  "Maybe what destroyed him was their refusal to let him set them free, or more likely, his realization that he had wasted the best years of his life on a few pages of misguided philosophy."  The authors are making reference to the period of time when Jim Morrison was down and facing the thought of having to return to the Florida court system to once again face the trumped up charges that he faced in the Florida crimminal case launched against him.  Jim Morrison "wasted the best years of his life on a few pages of misguided philosophy"? I think not. I think the authors "wasted their time writing this book, and it is a waste of time to read this book". Aloha. Peace. 
 This book is very dense, both in layout and writing style. It is long on verbose discussion and short on practical examples and advice. For example there 24 pages on release version numbering but only 8 pages on revision branching and merging.  The layout would have benefited from lists and more diagram. It would have been useful to have more example templates and processes.  What also annoyed were the basic mistakes e.g. How to correctly number a branch revision (it should normally be parentRev.BranchNumber.RevisionOnBranch, not parentRev.RevisionOnBranch).  I think the editors must take a significant portion of the blame for failing to help the author deliver a more readable boo 
 I'm not exactly sure how to classify this, nor do I think it really deserves the time.  How this album has garnered so many positive reviews is beyond me.  My only guess is that some tired, pretentious teen on MySpace raved over it and voila, the clique was born.    Now, I really wanted to like this and gave it numerous listens.  But each time, it sounds more and more like these guys were just doing some busy work around the house, started humming some melodies and then recorded them.  Immature and pretty much unoriginal.  And just because an album is labeled "concept" doesn't automatically qualify it as a masterpiece.  If you want a flawless concept album that actually has an interesting story just go and buy "The Wall".  Unless your circle of friends has threatened to emascualte you for not owning this, don't bother with this bloat.  
 Why is Dieselboy such a DnB stud?  I'd rather hear the creativity of Metalheadz any day.  This is just derivitive, with no subtlety, and a totally uninspired mix.  Spend your money on something else.  I will admit, though, that it is HARD 
 I was fooled.  I thought, "Oh, a vertically polarized, amplified antenna ought to work pretty well, at least a little better than the antenna built into the power cord of my tabletop radio."  Well, folks, it doesn't.  In a few minutes, you can make a very simple passive dipole antenna (i.e., a hunk of wire, basically) with a piece of 300-ohm flat twin-lead wire (you know, the stuff that's flat with two wires about a 1/4" apart in molded plastic...goes for about a dime a foot) that works better for FM.  I know because I did a side-by-side comparison between the Terk and my homebrew dipole...the dipole pulled in the station I wanted in stereo while the Terk antenna could only get me a noisy mono signal at any gain setting.  As a radio hobbyist (licensed ham radio operator), I am ashamed to admit that I fell for this one, so please don't tell anyone. 
 The poins touched by this book are good, however, I bought this book due to I use on class. Since 2nd. edition I found a lot of errors on the result pages as well some unclear steps on the text. I wrote to the author and he just say: "sent me the errors to correct them"...should I be co-author of this book or what?? If you're going to buy it, make a second tought 
 One of the many problems with this book is the order in which the topics are presented.  Right off the bat, They decide to put linear equations ahead of all other types of DE's.  Are they really as simple to solve as seperable equations?  The entire second chapter is a complete mess and is very disorganized.  The forumla for the integrating factor of linear equations is difficult to ascertain, and it is never clearly stated (it's there, but their notation is convoluted).  I don't want to sound like someone who is just having difficulty with the math taking it out on the innocent textbook.    I have consulted other textbooks on the topic, and I have to say that I really like Zill's DE's for the logical way in which it is organized, and    Kohler and Johnson's text for its clear explanations.  My professor actually commented on how bad this book is.  All DE textbooks are NOT created equally, and if you are struggling through this one, try finding older editions of those other two from your University's library.    
 Another bunch of blather, in my opinion. The biggest stock market crash in history may be coming. IS probably coming, even. But WHEN, Mr. Kiyosaki, WHEN? In 2016? It might, but you don't know, the chairman of the fed doesn't know, the President doesn't know, no one does. You're guessing. All your books say you're a money expert, based on a questionable autobiography, anecdotes, and a gullible public. I don't think Mr. Kiyosaki gives very good advice. I'd prefer Andrew Tobias, Ben Stein, or God help me, Suze Orman. Sorry 
 just awful  save your money, this book is not worth it. The pictures are dull and lifeless, boring composition. Mann hasn't captured anything here but a bunch of worthless photos. Any 10th rate amateur photographer could have done better. 
 I love to read about Hollywood, and I know I would enjoy this book if the "Eff-word" wasn't used so much. It proves to me that to get anywhere in Hollywood you have be very low-class and profane. Any really  educated person would have a stronger command of the language. The eff-word is a stupid substitution for any word at all, and I just can't get interested in the book because of it. If you don't mind eff this and eff that you might enjoy the book. Too bad. It could have been a good read 
 The writer has such talent for making everything truly convincing, that I was very disappointed to realise, as I read, that this was really fiction. Too many inconsistencies and oddities. Kokopelli in Manitoba? boy, he's a long way from home! I've travelled in the South-West and known Navajo people, and Lakotas in South Dakota, and I've lived in Canada, though not Manitoba, and the points made by those who describe that western province are very convincing. No way do Andrews' descriptions ring true.   The clincher was where at the end Andrews is strictly enjoined not to tell anyone of her experiences: she asks "what should I do" and is told "Write a book!" I think Andrews is almost slapping the more gullible readers upside the head!   And it's sad, because on its own terms, it does in some ways convey a quite meaningful view of the world, and encourages us to be open to the deeper meanings and the spiritual connections and resonances of the natural world.  So I wish it were a real account, but as it isn't, I have to feel that such transformations of reality must do more harm than good. What happened to a medieval Christian when it was proved that the famous saint's relic everyone had revered was the bone of a dog's hind leg? Didn't it hurt the faith that had sustained him, and damage the good that was in that faith? Other reviewers have mentioned more accurate, reality-based reports of the shaman's world: I'll have to follow some of those up. 
 I started this novel primarily because of massive amounts of praise heaped onto it by various family members, claiming it to be a 'DaVinci Code'(with which I have an entirely different set of issues) worthy thriller. More importantly, I am a student of mediaeval history and am willing to give most anything historical fiction/thriller-related a go. I was greatly disappointed with 'The Templar Legacy' not only because of its ridiculously slow pace and rubbish character development (if that phrase can even be applied to the novel at all) but primarily because of the astonishingly apparent lack of in-depth research by its author, Steve Berry. Whilst reading the novel, I honestly felt as if he had merely read abstracts on the topics he covered in the novel and felt that to be sufficient enough to put into final draft. Everything from theology to mediaeval history to religious life seemed to have a veil of inaccuracy hanging upon it, as if the author felt addressing his opinion to be more important than being correct. I was repeatedly shocked at the incorrect, awkward grammar, numerous misspellings of common words, and often overly camp expressions ("The land, as far as the eye could see, oozed the romance of history when marauding knights swooped like eagles from the fortified heights to prey on their foe,"- please.) Where was the editor??  Berry's knowledge of the French phrases and place names in the book is underwhelming, repeatedly changing the accent and capitalisation of the word 'abbï¿½' and misspelling the Palais des Papes. There are numerous errors seemingly every few pages that agitated me more and more as I went on: Berry refers to a character as 'half-Muslim' (Islam is an ethnicity as well as a religion?), misuses the word 'anachronistic', refers to the ancient Egyptian deities Isis and Osiris as Greek, and repeatedly makes errors regarding Catholic dogma and practices. There are numerous more glaring errors that I fail to recall. It may seem petty on my part, but I felt insulted continuously at the transparent lack of research and commitment on Berry's behalf, almost to the point of being unable to finish the book. It was as if he was attempting to seem very educated about the subject matter, spewing facts out left, right and centre, but the overall effect given off was one of shallow arrogance 
 These collections of CDs are a piece of crap. Why make 3 cds of the greatests hits if they don't even have that many studio albums? The simple answer is money. They've lost the talent to make another studio album so they just live off their past glory. They put a nice cover a recycled songs and "enhance" the cd. So stupid unknowing fans will go out and buy it. If you already have their past albums no need to buy this garbage. If you have bought it you're out of luck. A blank CD is worth more than this crap 
 I was originally attracted to this version by the look of the packaging and the idea of the Tudor Rose back design, which I thought would be a welcome change from the unattractive blue and black plaid of the the standard Rider Waite Tarot.  I thought it would make a nice gift set.  I was never so disappointed with a set of cards!  The coloring here is atrocious: washed out yellows, mucky dull tans, blues that appear as faded green, and grainy orange dots for skin color.  The companion booklet is not much help either.  Drawn from the work of A.E. Waite, while possibly a paradigm of its time, the prose is early twentieth century and not easily read today.  If what you are seeking is a softer alternative to the bold colors and heavy black outlines of the Rider Waite, and it is Pamela Coleman Smith's images that you love, a better choice would be the Universal Waite Tarot Deck, which has the gentler coloring but is of a far richer color quality than this dull, washed out version.  Look further than the Original Rider Waite Tarot Pack before making your decision . . . . there are so many other options available
