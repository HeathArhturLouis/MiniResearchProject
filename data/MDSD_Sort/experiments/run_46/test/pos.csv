 If you're really "in" to the Dead Sea Scrolls, then you won't want to miss this volume. The subtitle ("The Parting of the Ways Between Qumran and Enochic Judaism") really only tells part of the story; Boccaccini devotes a lesser portion of this book to a quite reasonable hypothesis of the origins of the Essene movement in what he calls "Enochic" Judaism. The majority of the book is devoted to descriptions of the life and literature of the Essenes, and includes a collection of secular data on them (from Josephus, Pliny, Philo, etc.). As such it is an excellent reference. 
 I've bought this book again today (I gave away my first copy). It's the most truthful, honest account I know of the ups and downs in the so-called spiritual path: our everyday life, as it happens to be. Jack Kornfield writes as he lives -with honesty, candor, wisdom, his share of mistakes and much, much humor and love to top it all. Being one of the best teachers of meditation that you'll ever find, and having a large number of students all over the world hasn't -thank God!- made Jack forget that, first and last, he is mostly a quite common human being (like you and I). So there are no poses here, or false pretences, and you feel that -probably for the first time- you are listening to a good friend, a likeable guy who shares with you a lot of stories and anecdotes about trying to live a good life. With all that that implies about joy and sorrow, happiness and sadness, moments of bliss and times of depression... I greatly recommend this book to anyone interested in going beyond the usual "cult making" approaches to spiritual life and spiritual teachers. Reading it exposes one to a sane, no-nonsense, sobering effect, and makes one deeply reflect on what "seeking after Truth" really might mean... I live in Caracas, Venezuela, and haven't met Jack, but his books and recordings irradiate so much warmth and kindness that I feel like he's an old pal. Sorry I can't give "After the Ecstasy, the Laundry" more than five stars, but that's the maximum allowed!!! :) 
 I have been a Brother in Aleister Crowley's O.T.O. for now going on 3 years. I was a dabbler in the occult as a teenager; knew concrete stuff about real life magick described in these books but never really did anything. I finally got a portable temple in my bedroom with most of the stuff described in Aleister Crowley's Book 4. So my parents were out of town and out of the house and I did a legit ritual from this book earlier this evening. Whether it works or not I'll wait and see, but this is legit ritual for those who have a real magick temple. As a teenager I was dreaming of becoming a ceremonial magician and now I am really at that point where I am one, so it takes a lot of time and patience, as well as some money and a lot of research on proper magickal theory. If you like this book and want to do legit ceremonies yourself this is simple if you have any common sense and balls to really do it. This is the confession of a naughty little boy becoming a man. Thank you and do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law 
 Then you have to read this book.  Thomas Paine was so amazing, not only did his writings (along with him personally) influence the colonial revolution, but it also heavily influenced the French Revolution!  Even though it can be difficult to read something written over 200 years ago.  You cannot help but be in awe of the pure genius and talent of this man.  It took me three months to read this book.  Not because I work 70 hours a week and go to college.  But because I kept going back to read parts again and again.  I always wondered what the Usa has become and what it was supposed to be.  After finishing this book I knew the answer.  The United States of America now resembles more the oppressive regime of England then the dreams the colonists/founding fathers fought for!  Canada more resembles what the founding fathers wanted and they never had to leave the Commonwealth.  Life is strange.. 
 I really love Bones.  It has everything: suspense, drama, humor, pretty people, fun storylines.  I have yet to miss an episode, and even into Season 2 this is probably my favorite.  It adds depth to all of the characters.  Also, the winter holidays are my favorite time of year.  I like holidays that are about what is good in the world.  Bones is about people standing for the good in humanity even though they explore the very worst every day.  I cry through half this episode, but in a completely good way.  Buy, watch it, love it.  But watch it with a friend if you don't want to cry alone.  So moving, great performances by the whole cast.  Emily Deschanel was powerful in this one, she brings real vulnerability to Brennan here.  David Boreanaz, as always the perfect sympathetic hero, loveably old-fashioned. Cute, funny moments.  Touching, poignant moments.  This really is the best of what is great about Bones 
 Unlike other reviewers, I didn't have any problem putting this item together.  While I'll admitt that the directions are poorly written, anyone with a little mechanical common sense can do this with no problem.  This certaintly isn't a fine piece of furniture (it's from Target, what do you expect?, but it looks pretty good, is functional, and the price is right.  
 This is revolution a great book for someone that has somewhere to be. The writings are mostly just a few pages long so you can begin and finish a thought before you have to stop reading. The only setback is that Thomas Paine's "Common Sense" isn't in the book in it's entirety. Only the appendix for "Common Sense" is in it. It is really hard to label that a setback because this book has so much packed into it for such a reasonable price 
 I wish this book had been available when I was 30 years younger as it might have helped me avoid some serious life errors. I would have even been happy if this book was available when my daughter married 8 years ago.  However, even though the gems of wisdom came too late for us, I recommend that all brides and wives read this book if they want to learn to improve their life, being supportive of their husband yet never giving up their right to be treated well.  Robin McGraw strikes just the right balance of compassion and determination.  It is instructional without being "preachy" - though best for Christians the wisdom could apply to women of any or no formal religious faith.  It would be a good idea for young grooms to read this too (to get an insiders view from the other side).  I bought the book because of the show on Dr. Phil about the book (okay I confess I wanted to read the "dirt" on Dr. Phil) but it was a delight in that you got the "dirt" but learned that the truth was given with a heaping helping of compassion.  I don't know if I would enjoy hanging out with Dr. Phil (he is intense) but I think I would love Robin.  She admits to what she did wrong and tells women how they can find their voice to make the best life possible for themselves and their families.  If your life isn't perfect (and I've yet to find anyone whose life is) then read the book, and if you agree pass it on to your sisters (biological or otherwise).  Here's to McGraw family values!!! 
 Interesting and sad story of the members of a pilot boat Can Do, who go out to help a stranded tanker that did not need help.  This tragedy is part of the larger recounting of rescue and loss during the Blizzard of '78 that devastated the Massachusetts and Rhode Island coasts.  I was captivated by the transcripts of the actual communications between Coast Guard boats, the Can Do and the Global Hope tanker.  There is great detail regarding the Coast Guard as an service and the individuals who were part of the rescue services.  As I was listening to the recording, my only minor complaint was the artificial Boston area accent utlized by the reader.  Otherwise, no complaints. 
 Rethinking the Wineskin is, quite simply, one of the first places anyone should begin when examining the peculiar genius of Jesus and his earliest apprentices in orienting and growing organic, indigenous church communities.  Frank balances fresh biblical exegesis with a broad range of scholarship and church history.  OK, so why did I only give it four stars?  Well, I think it could use an edit, reincorporating some of the style of the earlier printing of this book.  Also--and this might be more my "fault" than the author's--I feel a growing need to address matters of justice and solidarity with the poor with regards to the communion of saints being Christ's hands and feet in the world.  I say supplement this with Steve Chalke's "Lost Message of Jesus" or Shane Claiborne's "The Irresistible Revolution," and you're getting pretty comprehensive.  My bottom line: read "Rethinking" for what it is, not what it isn't.  It is an excellent book for reimagining supple wineskins to contain the Holy Spirit's move in the twenty-first century. 
 Love this book.  I want to make every bag in it.  In fact, I made one the same week I received the book and have the yarn to work on another.  All the instructions are clearly written and easy to follow.  The bag I made worked up quickly and looks just like the one in the photo 
 This book is a great help to those who are needing organization direction in the scrapbook area. It shows how to use household items as well a spurchased solutions for storage, organization and efficiency. You learn to take a look at HOW you use your space and tools instead of just more sorting and more bins. It also deals with good products and knowing WHICH ones will suit your own style. I loved it! It got me going in the right direction 
 ...but it is out of date. The fact is that feminism has forced us to recognize (for example) that the ambiguity of "he" MEANS something, namely, the very idea of patriarchal speaking-for, and more generally the notion of speaking-for-another.  The fact is that demotic speech, in ignoring tense rules that are themselves demotic with respect to older layers, is a bold attempt to make sense of that which is deliberately and with classist and racist intent obfuscated.  The irony, the paradox, is that the curmudgeon at one and the same time insists on being quite prolix on a fine Fowler point, but when an attempt is made to be equally prolix on matters of linguistic justice, that very same curmudgeon paints himself with woad and reverts to barbarism.  Underneath the academic gown is brute force, in other words.  If you want to be a professional bore and ass, if you long to be a Dead on arrival White Male, by all means get the "real" Fowler which is available, along with other antiques, as an Oxford Language Classic. If you want to communicate, get this "Fowler's".  In Fowler's day, there was indeed a need for precision which Fowler fulfilled. This need remains, but more important is a need for justice and for fairness which excludes the very idea of speaking-for and deliberate exclusion 
 From the novels of this type (the romantic classics) that I have read, I would say this is one of the better ones.  Her other book Wuthering Heights (that I read few years before this), left me baffled at the notion that that was a love story.  Jane Eyre, however, is a true love story.  It is beautifully written, and Bronte does a wonderful job in developing the character: Jane.  By the end I felt I knew her.    The book is quite lengthy, which is its only fault.  There are many places in the book that could have been shortened.  I tried to read the book a second time, but I managed to get only a third way through.    It is a lovely story.  I recommend it if you hunger for a love story.  It is lengthy, so some patience is needed at times, but it is well worth it. 
 This is great even if you have the NES games. For one you can bring it anywhere and it doesn't have 2 player mode. It IS compatible with GBA SP because it does not require the game link port on the SP. The only flaw is you need to scan 10 cards to play one NES game and you can only save one at a time. Still, that won't stop you cuz when you get proficient at swiping them, its nothing. But the e-Reader does more than NES games; you may play e-Readers from Nintendo Magazines, you can play Game & Watch games, look at Pokemon (who cares about that feature???), connect to games like Super Mario Bros. 3 and get power-ups as well as new levels, and hook up to a Gamecube for double experience. The only problem is to connect to games you need 2 Game Boys and a link cable but that it isn't too much of a problem. Also, e-Reader packs are fairly cheap even in New York City. Gameplay and graphics are faithful to the originals, too 
 This is one of the best, most enjoyable books ever written, in my opinion.  It is a combination history (of a now by-gone America), essay (on what it means to be American, on the coming modern world, on racism, on travel, even on what the mind of a dog may be thinking), memoir, history, travelogue and poem.  Steinbeck sets off with his dog Charley in a glorified pickup truck to see America in 1960.  He explores as many themes along the way as he does landscapes and states.  He meets people, he offers opinions, he converses with his pal Charley, and he offers a comment on America - past, present, and future.  I find this a fascinating, thoroughly enjoyable (and I'd even say "classic") read.  And I would highly recommend it for anyone who wants to reflect on America and travel with Charley and the great author who drove him around.  For those familiar with John Steinbeck only as a writer of fiction, this book reveals a new side, and one I think you will enjoy 
 I have purchased a few of these beautiful color luggage tags as gifts as well as for myself and have found them to be very a very welcomed gift- they are practical as well as nice to look at. 
  Flush by Carl Hiaasen does not disappoint! Who knew that a story about raw sewage would rate five stars! Hiaasen's Flush does just that! Noah and his sister Abby acquire some strange cohorts along the way as they try to keep their family from going down the drain! Sorry, but I just couldn't resist that pun! Their father's action in sinking a floating casino leads them on a quest to not only help their father but to save the environment. Along the way you will see how setbacks will sometimes end up as a success while their successes often end up having unwanted consequences! This was a Christmas present for our oldest granddaughter.  She loved it! Carl Hiaasen is a terrific author. His writing has made us laugh out loud numerous times. While this was written as a children's book, it was just as enjoyable for me to read as those geared to adults 
 Loved the picture and was and easy setup.  Price was right and the style seemed to blend right into my room.  
 The Power of Intention is both inspiring and troubling. As an environmental and social activist who lives off of less the 10k per year, I was wondering as I read this book if I was holding in my hands what was once an Ancient Tree? Our Ancient Ancestors are being clear cut at an alarming rate in the Pacific Northwest. Most will go extinct in our lifetimes. Corporations continue to consolidate their political power in both mainstream parties: Democrat and Republican alike enact legislation on behalf of corporations that will open what is left of these ancient giants to clear-cutting. Stories will be told of these trees on day, perhaps even to our own grandchildren beginning with the words, "Once upon a time there was a great and majestic forest."   Your Democratic and Republican representatives are now organizing the last Buffalo hunt. You can still have your voice be heard on behalf of these ancient trees before it is too late.   On page 48 of his book Mr. Dyer makes the following observation, "Practice kindness toward the Earth by picking up a piece of litter that's on your path, or saying a silent prayer of gratitude for the existence of rain, the color of flowers, or even the paper you hold in your hand that was donated by a tree."  Sadly, Mr. Dyer's observation is confused. The paper we hold in our hands is produced by multi-national corporations on public lands administered by bureaucrats marching to one tune: politicians who accept large gratuities in the form of moneyed transactions so favorable legislation opens these national treasures to exploitation.  This book review is offered as a creative challenge to Mr. Dyer to connect to the field of intention on behalf of non-sentient life. Hopefully, the field of intention extends the same beneficence to the astonishing field of nature, not in a fashion that promotes anthropocentrism and narcissism, but rather amplifies the web of life and its connections to human life so that a win-win situation is advocated rather than diminished.   This begs the question: is the book worth the $24.95 I paid to read it? I suppose that if the field of intention can be tapped into for the benefit of our Earth Mother, my answer is yes! If, on the other hand, the spiritual principles are used only for generating prosperity for the self alone, then the $24.95 would be better spent planting a tree to help offset the expense of Mr. Dyer's next best seller. 
 It is typical in this day and age to pay little attention to bands who have been given the title of playing "darkwave" music. After all, darkwave or "Gothic" bands have nothing more to offer than solemn, sometimes Satanic outings that feel like dudes in leather trying to connect with the forces of evil through their amps (Electric Hellfire Club, even Marilyn Manson). But Rhea's Obsession proves you cannot judge a band by category, theoritically this band is a goth band, but their music is only gothic in the classical sense, in their sound and lyrics they are a band that strives for something more poetic and atmospheric than simple distortion. "Between Earth And Sky" is a wonderfully evocative album, a little gem of underground rock that mingles and mates with Middle Eastern textures and poetic flavors. Comparisons with Dead Can Dance are not out of order, indeed this band (who appears in the Dead Can Dance tribute album with a great cover of "Mesmerism") evokes the kind of other-worldly vibes Dead Can Dance achieved through their work. Some of the songs such as "Spiritual Fear" experiment a little and add techno flourishes, but not of the dance beat kind, they stand simply as musical brushstrokes. The married couple of vocalist Sue Hutton and guitarist Jim Field are an amazing team, together they create, invoke and bring to life music of the kind we wish more popular bands would experiment with. Take for example the track "Dreaming Blade," the wall of sound is hard rock with Field's guitars, but Hutton's vocals evoke Lisa Gerrard and take us to another place other than just the confines of normal music listening. The album's best cut is "Nightshade," a poetic, hypnotic experience that also boasts a Dead Can Dance vibe but also proves the band as an identity all it's own. Here Sutton's vocals really shine as well as the instrumentals, all combined with some enchanting lyrics create a song of great atmosphere. The song "Between Earth And Sky" is a myth-like little invocation that summons-up the spirit of Jim Morrison and "Spill Elixir" feels like something ancient and mystic. Rhea's Obsession is not an enormously popular band, indeed, this is the kind of group that is discovered by the listener seeking new sounds and flavors and who is willing to search in the underground, beneath the metropolis of MTV and VH1. Rhea's Obsession captures us and for a few songs manages to let us escape, which is what all great music does 
 Encore to Tanika Lynch for writing a superb story! Poor Kamone has been dealt the poor hand in life but through it all she prevails. She's defintely a S-U-R-V-I-V-O-R in every sense of the word! The spiritual message throughout this book is definitely on point! God never gives us more than we can bare and sometimes He puts us through adversities/tests so we can prepare ourselves for the blessings He has in store for us! This book is FIRE.......read it within 2 days (could've read it faster if not for work)!  ****Highly Recommended*** 
  I think most believers, after initial salvation, want to please God. So they attempt to try and do something for God. Even many sermons given speak much on worship in a manner of working for the Lord but the source is of one's own zeal rather then God's life opperation within. But immediately after the creation of man, God put man in front of the tree of life that man may take the tree of life as his food. God had no intention to ask man to do anything for Him. God's intention was that man would simply take God as his food!       
 I was very satisfied with the CD I ordered. I had this CD before and lost it and I liked it so much, I had to have another one. I would recommend this to anyone, especially someone who enjoys her music. I think the CD is an older CD, but it is really good 
 Green really hits home with this one.  While I can't compare myself to any one character completely, I found myself, instead, relating to all three at different times in my life.  At the end of the novel, as stories resolve, I found myself with tears in my eyes...wrapping the book up to send through the channels to other friends who need to read and connect with this creative, entertaining and insightful book .  A great weekend read or beach book 
  Well worth the positive reviews - which restricted themselves to what H.P.Blavatsky actually had to say in the S.D. Too much review space seems to have been dedicated to 'defending' - or 'refuting,' ideas not explictly found in Blavatsky's book.  At the worst, this includes reviews making the S.D. a prelude to the work of Samael Aun Weor. The 'larger picture' alluded to by H.P. B. was not a hint that some future writing/s would fill in the gaps, but that it was incumbent upon individuals to discover the 'larger picture' - for themselves.   As for the hysteria over the allegedly 'rascist' elements in H.P.B's work, it was a relief to find one reviewer reminding us that Theosophy advocates the pursuit of truth "without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or colour. " Nuff said?         
  Little known film, but excellent actng throughout!  No wonder Diane Lane has become a star 
 If you understand that all the action and thought in the novel is through  the main male character than you can understand the point of the novel  better.  Ben Joe feels responsible for the women in his life.  He wants to  take care of them, but he doesn't realize that they all are very strong and  in control of their own destinies.  Sometimes they are even in control of  his.  Once again Tyler is able to get us into the head of her character and  what a foggy place that can be 
 I have to say that I have never disliked anything that Joanne Harris has written. But this is the best since Five Quarters of the Orange. In a complete change of setting - hardly any mention of France - this is set in a posh Private School in the north of England. It could be described as a whodunnit. But for much of the book  it could be described as a whodunwhat. We know that some mayhem is afoot but do not actually know what it is. All of this makes it very difficult to put down - I read it in about three sittings.   The characters are typically well written. Especially the wonderful Straitly - aiming for a century of terms in the school that has been his life - and the Brodiesque devotion to 'his boys'. As ever there is a lurking and increasing darkness with twists and turns on every page.  Five stars. Read it 
 We are very happy with how quickly our fiest issue arrived.  We ordered on 1-25-06 and our first issue arrived 2-24-06 (almost a month earlier than anticipated!)  
   When I brought this album I love it so much I could'nt stop listening to it.The songs, the lyrics,the beats are just ear candy that I will waste batteries on my cd player on it.But something bothers me about this album the disc itself is cheap I had to buy it FOUR times because the disc kept breaking,maybe thats why the album went platinum.Lil'kim's disc last forever because my are all Scratch but still play really good. Missy maybe a good rapper but her disc company sucks so if you buy this album make sure you have a ipod or computer because once that this breaks (and it will) you'll regret not recording it to your computer or ipod other wise then that A MUST HAV 
 This reader is jam-packed with disaster stories and the science and geography that caused the event.  My children love real stories above those that are made up.  More school subjects are covered and History has become a bit more interesting. What more can I say but WOW 
 Power Yoga, Beryl Bender Birch's first book, is a great introduction to  developing a strong asana practice. In Beyond Power Yoga, Beryl reminds us  that true astanga yoga is about more than physical health; rather it  includes ethical living, a disciplined mind and body, and openness to that  which is larger than ourselves. Beryl presents this information in a  conversational, friendly manner, similar to how she spoke at a workshop I  recently attended. Asanas, of course, are at the core of this work, and BPY  gives us a good overview of a mixed primary and secondary series of  practice. However, BPY goes beyond the asanas by linking the chakras to the  8 limbs of astanga yoga practice as detailed in the Yoga Sutras. The  section on pranayama is exceptional--she brings a relatively obscure  practice down to earth in a way that reveals not only how to do it, but  *why* it's important to practice in our lives. This is a book for those  interested in the larger picture of yoga and how it fits into a  spiritual/philosophical worldview of how to live rightly on this earth.  Highly recommended for those who like to sweat but are ready for even more  from their practice, as well as those from other hatha yoga traditions, if  just to prove that astanga yoga is rooted in spirit as well as matter 
 At the urging of her husband Walter (Peter Masterson), aspiring photographer and obviously less-than-full-figured Joanna Eberhart (Katherine Ross) becomes an unwilling resident of Stepford -- a town of apparent marital bliss. Uxorial devotion strikes the former woman's libber with suspicion. Befriending a wild and unconventional new resident named Bobbie Markowe (Paula Printiss), they attempt to uncover what appears to be a misogynic plot to subjugate beautiful wives. After a weekend nuptial renewing retreat, Bobbie returns as another ultra-domesticated Stepford housewife. This sends Joanna on a high-adrenaline quest for immediate answers that ultimately brings her face to face with a revelation of epic proportions.   Scenes include brief violence, emphasis on female anatomy, and discussions of marital coitus.  Movie quote: "If I'm wrong I'm insane. And if I'm right, it's worse than if I'm wrong. 
 I read Ferling's biography of Adams after reading McCullough's John Adams. I was a bit disappointed with a few aspects, and thought reading Ferling would round out my knowledge of our second president.  I wasn't disappointed.  Ferling's masterly and scholarly work provides an outstanding insight into Adams, his activities, his motivations, and his relationship with his wife Abigail.  In particular, Ferling pulls no punches in describing some of Adams' rather significant character flaws, particularly his burning ambition (and his subsequent abandonment of his family in pursuit of it).  Richly footnoted, the work still remains THE biography of Adams, despite McCullough's recent work and its NY Times bestseller status 
 As soon as I saw this book listed, I knew I had to buy it since the folks at Cook's Illustrated created it. As with anything they do, this book is a complete reference for anything to do with pasta and noodles. There are chapters on fresh pasta, dried pasta, pasta without eggs. There are also chapters on couscous, gnocchi, and Asian noodles and lots more. Scattered throughout the book there are also step-by-step instructions on preparation of ingredients for some of the recipes, such as seafood or vegetables. The recipe selection is staggering, with something for everyone from the novice cook to the more experienced. As host of my own Italian cuisine website Italian Food Forever, I buy every pasta cookbook I see, and although many are disappointing, I know this one will be a useful reference book for many, many years 
 High flying, fast living F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896-1940) attained great commercial and critical fame early in life--and then began a rapid fall into a ferocious alcoholism.  In 1925 THE GREAT GATSBY, now regarded as his masterpiece and often described as "the great American novel," was published to only mildly enthusiastic reviews and sold poorly; in order to fund the lifestyle to which he had grown accustomed, Fitzgerald set aside his next book length project and turned to short stories and the occasional bout of "writing for Hollywood."  Although Fitzgerald began to formulate ideas for TENDER IS THE NIGHT as early as 1925, the project was slow to take form and was not published until 1934--by which time it had become a reflection of Fitzgerald's stormy marriage to the equally high flying, fast living Zelda Sayre, who gradually sank into insanity and was permanently institutionalized by the early 1930s.  Originally published in serial form in Scribner's Magazine, it received mixed reviews, and when it was published as a novel it did not prove the great commercial success Fitzgerald hoped.  It was the last novel he completed before his 1940 death.  The story is set in Europe, where the Fitzgeralds themselves lived through much of the 1920s, and begins with Rosemary, a very young woman who has recently jolted to fame and fortune as an actress in silent film.  Beautiful but in many respects innocent, Rosemary vacations on the Riviera--where she makes the acquaintance of Dick and Nicole Diver, an incredibly wealthy, exceptionally attractive couple who seem to be the height of all the modern era has to offer.  Rosemary quickly subcums to Dick Diver's immeasurable charm and falls in love with him, but Nick is determinedly bound to Nicole, as much from responsibility as love.  Nicole's apparent flawlessness is a facade.  Dick is a psychiatrist; his wife, Nicole, is also his patient.  She is insane.  Fitzgerald was often accused of writing about rich and pretty but trivial people.  In one sense this is true, but in Fitzgerald's work the shiny surface is precisely that, a false front that the characters present to the world in order to maintain both their social standing and self-image. As the novel moves back and forward in time, we see how Dick has been "bought" by Nicole's family and how he is repeatedly torn between love for Nicole as a husband and care for her as a patient so that--even as Nicole begins a final recovery--he begins his own destruction, sucked dry by the endless personal and professional compromises required of him.  Increasingly dark in tone, TENDER IS THE NIGHT is not so much disillusioning as it is ultimately, painfully  nhilistic.  Fitzgerald seemed to regard TENDER IS THE NIGHT as both his most personal and his favorite work, and there are few who would not regard it as a masterpiece.  Even so, it is very much a flawed masterpiece, occasionally problematic to a point at which it snaps the reader out of the very reality it attempts to create, most often due to Fitzgerald's own authorial self-indulgence.  That said, the characters and their situations are not always as convincing as one could wish and the structure of the novel is occasionally muddy.  And yet--  Even with these glaring issues running throughout the novel, TENDER IS THE NIGHT is the sort of book that you think you will not finish and then suddenly find yourself on the last page.  Whereas THE GREAT GATSBY tended to focus on the mask, TENDER IS THE NIGHT focuses on the face beneath it, and the result is uniquely powerful.  You care about the Divers and even though you sense their ultimate fate you, like they themselves, fight against it.  It has moments of brilliance as powerful and often more so than any other novel of the first half of the 20th Century.  Strongly recommended.  GFT, Amazon Reviewe 
 I remember going to my grandmother's home and insisting on playing my "Flying Nun" album  on her stereo unit in the sun room. I know she got so tired of hearing that album but I would play it over and over! Alright, let's face it-the plot is as ridiculous as any plot could be but the series is CUTE and FUN! The storylines far-fetched? YES The special effects?-sure you see the wires (poor Sally explains how painfull the whole ordeal actually was) The series takes you away from the stress and craziness of everyday life, if only for a few moments! The cast was a fantastic group of individuals and the acting was "first-rate" even if the storylines were not! The DVD set is bright and fun. Contains an interesting interview with Sally. She really didn't enjoy doing the series but it doesn't show in her acting. She does have a funny story of her whole ordeal on recording the LP. Purchase this DVD set and you'll be "FLYING" high with laughter. They've just announced Season TWO coming in August-Can't Wait! Now we can enjoy the early work of Sally Field over and over again! Do you think they will ever release the LP on Compact Disc 
 Defending Our Wildlife Heritage: The Life And Times Of A Special Agent is the autobiographical story of Terry Grosz, a man who worked and struggled for 32 years to protect wildlife in America. Poignant, emotion, filled with the travails of an endless struggle against human greed and carelessness, Defending Our Wildlife Heritage is a fascinating glimpse into the lives of those who labor so that future generations may share in the wonder of America's natural beauty and wildlife. Defending Our Wildlife Heritage is strongly recommended reading for nature enthusiasts, as well as environmental and wildlife protection activists 
 This resource for fans of Frank's Diary is a photo essay of over 225 black and white photos, many never before published, compiled by the Anne Frank House for a travelling exhibition. Images in the book are dedicated to preserving the history of not only Frank but the Holocaust and how its issues affect contemporary life: images thus are gleaned from the extent of the war and its aftermath and detail not just Frank's life but the experiences of all sides 
 I found this book to be very helpful in getting you to think of the box. Instead of being like a picture book with not much information, it tells you how to come up with ideas and explains the process of making a good design. This is a great book to have if you already have those picture books with just designs and need something to help you with actually creating your own designs 
 This is a fun book.  Older kids can write their own books on their name using a format similar to this 
 I'm a huge, huge fan of BV 90210 from Brazil and I have never missed an episode of all ten seasons. I really look forward for their release on DVD!!! Beverly Hills 90210 definitely needs to be on DVD ASAP! I still watch the show everyday! Maybe this is the third time!!! But I NEVER get tired of it! I REALLY LOVE THE SHOW! I wish they would come out with all the DVDS soon 
 What I like about this book is the author's upfront honesty.  this is a book about magickal theory and exploring your dark side.  The author never sets out to do a book that's focused on practice.  He wants you to critically think and explore the concepts that he touches on, but in a manner that I believe gives a lot of respect to the reader 
 I highly recommend this book to every woman.  It is a treasure trove of information.  Dr. Northrup has left nothing out.  I have read things in this book that I have never read anywhere else.  You will gain valuable information and new insights that will enable you to take the best care of your body.  I have given this book to all my sisters, daughters, and now I am giving it to my nieces.  Don't pass this book by, put it on your wish list and buy it as soon as you can

 The book covers and links fractals, neural networks, CA, GA to computability, randomness and chaos. It switches nicely between theoretical and more practical aspects of computer simulations. I think that it is comprehensive and very nicely written 
 	Ever since I discovered this player in the summer of 2005, I have been highly impressed with how much it met both my normal and oddball demands.  As a student of Musical Theatre, Opera, Classical vocal and choral literature, and Jazz and Classical piano, DVD-AUDIO capability is of great importance to me because there are a lot of titles especially in the Classical genre available in this format.  One thing that sets this player apart from the other manufacturers' players is Yamaha's CD UpSampling feature.  For those titles which are currently only available on CD and possibly will never be released on DVD-AUDIO and/or SACD, this option converts standard CDs to the quality of DVD-AUDIO.  On the Musical Theatre, Opera, and choral side of things, this player is capable of playing both NTSC (North American) and PAL (European) DVDs on corresponding as well as opposite TVs.  For certain titles in these genres, the North American editions are either four percent slower in tempo and picture movement and flatter in pitch than the European editions due to the method of PAL-to-NTSC conversion used by the distributors of such DVDs, or do not include as many bonus features as their original European counterparts.  Sometimes, it can be the other way around, except the European editions might be four percent faster and sharper and have less bonus material than their original North American counterparts.  On both ends of the spectrum, if the audio pitch is corrected without changing the audio speed to keep the picture and sound in synch, a subaudible breaking-up effect may be noticed as the result of slight artifacts from slightly bending or stretching the pitch in the conversion process.  However, because of this player's bicompatibility with both color systems, I have the freedom to choose and purchase whatever editions are the best.  Although it is not in the manual, this player can be made multi-region compatible including RCE DVDs.  Turn on the DVD player.  Make sure there are no discs loaded.  With the tray open, using its supplied remote control, slowly press 99990.  Wait for the 'Region 0' message to disappear.  Close the tray.  In conclusion, if you are looking for a DVD player with wide compatibility, you have come to the right place 
 There is likely no more romantic ending to a Hollywood movie than the one in this soufflé-light 1957 romantic comedy, where Audrey Hepburn tries to keep up with a departing train upon which Gary Cooper stands and listens intently to her babbling about her fictitious sexual conquests. Hepburn plays Ariane, a young cellist and the daughter of a Parisian private investigator named Claude Chevasse. She has an unbridled interest in her father's often tawdry cases, chief among them the affairs of Frank Flannagan, a millionaire industrialist and aging playboy who finds himself in various trysts with married women around the world. A certain Monsieur X has come to Chevasse to catch his wife in a suspected extramarital fling with Flannagan. Overhearing Monsieur X's intention to kill his wife and her lover, Ariane decides to warn Flannagan, and they embark on an afternoons-only affair under the pretense that she is as much a worldly bon vivant as he is. Things come to a head when Flannagan becomes infatuated with this mysterious "thin girl" and recruits Crevasse to find out who she is.  Master filmmaker Billy Wilder leaves his unmistakable stamp on this confection with a clever, ironic script co-written with his long-time partner I.A.L. Diamond in their first collaboration. The dialogue is full of their trademark sparkling banter, and leave it to Wilder to use a Gypsy string quartet to act as a chorus for Flannagan's sexual shenanigans. Hepburn is her usual impeccable self as Ariane and especially good fun when she layers the deceptions about her checkered past. Cooper played this type of boulevardier role in the 1930's under masters like Ernst Lubitsch, and it is quite enjoyable to see him come back to this milieu two decades later as an aging lothario. Looking weather-beaten after years of Westerns and adventure pictures, he was given a lot of grief because of the age difference between him and Hepburn, but I actually find the gap quite touching and Cooper surprisingly game. Maurice Chevalier is ideally cast as Crevasse even if he has to play down his naturally effervescent manner. Granted the film runs a little too long at 126 minutes, but it is fine, light entertainment similar to Wilder and Hepburn's previous collaboration, the classic 1954 "Sabrina". The print transfer on the 2005 DVD is fine though not outstanding. Unfortunately there are no extras included 
 Yup, and the professor gave out many problems in addition to supplementary problems.  The book was an easy read but in order to do well in this course you simply need a mind for genetics.  This is probably the best book I've seen 
 What a brilliant album. Beautiful lyrics and music, and very different from any other album; strange but nice lyrics, alot of talant no one knew Vanessa Carlton had. In my opinion, the best song on this album is 'Private Radio', 'Annie' and 'Half A Week Before The Winter' are also both beautiful and unique songs. I didn't expect this album to be anything like it is; but it's brilliant and i am very pleased with it. Definetly a five star album, anyone who says otherwise does not know good music. 
 I did this workout, and I enjoyed every minute!! The warmup is 8 min; Arms with weights is 6 min; Aerobics 1,is 12 min; aerobics 2, is 6 min' aerobics 3, is 6 min; aerobics 4 is 6 min; standing legs is 5 min; standing legs with weights is 5 min; cool down is 6 min. Keep in mind that you are moving through all the segments and you're heart rate is elevated the entire time! This is a 90's workout and I'm so glad they put it on dvd!! They change costumes and backdrops through out.1 backdrop you get them in a studio wearing all black; then a 2nd they change to a spring backdrop with colorful outfits; then to a 3rd a darker studio with fall leaves;A 4th is a summer at the beach; A 5th is a retro 50's backdrop complete with a big city in the back ground, and a used car sign on one side and a  retro gas pump on the other side.They go back and forth between sets.It is effective as well! you are moving for the entire 46 minutes!!I love the workout, and the costume and scene changes!!!!This will have you smiling the whole time!The moves are easy to catch on to, and I myself really liked the music; it did not sound to eighties or ninties at all.Who said you had to leave you're sense of humor at the door when you exercise!!   
 I cannot tell you how good this Anime soundtrack is. When I bought this soundtrack, I was really looking forward to just hearing the song "Tell me What the Rain Knows" but then I found out that all these other tracks are also unbelievable. "Cloud 9" is one of the greatest songs ever in this soundtrack, as it really gives you a weird feeling once you listen to it. I also really like Steve Conte's vocals in "Heaven's not Enough." That is truly a great song, yet also a sad song in a way as well. "Cycle" is also a very good song, and the vocals to go along with it are great. And you can't forget "Tell me what the Rain Knows" wither. That is also a great song, but also a very sad song as well. There are also many other tracks on this soundtrack that are truly unbelievable, and many of them will send chills down your spine.   Overall, I DEFINENTLY recommend this soundtrack to everyone, even if you're not a Wolf's Rain fan, because in my opinion, this is the greatest Anime soundtrack ever made 
 These cards are GREAT.  I had wondered why they were so expensive, but I hadn't realized that they're HUGE:  the size of large greeting cards, not the standard postcard size.  They're glossy and beautiful and arty, and they come with a sheet that shows thumbnails of all the cards so you don't have to go through every single one when you're trying to think of what you want to send.  The box they came in broke apart as I was taking off the plastic wrapper.  It's very cheap, lightweight, rough wood.  After one end broke off, the rest of it started falling apart as I was carrying it gently to another room.  But I didn't care about the box, or need it, so I'm still giving five stars:  it was the postcards I wanted, and they're great 
 Whatever your stance in the creation/evolution debate, this book is a "must read."  You do need some amount of science background to get through it.  Of all the books relating to this topic that I have read (and they have been many), this book is my favorite.  This is one of those books that was impossible for me to put down---I wanted to just read on and on.  Spetner does an outstanding job and, in my opinion, deals a death-blow to evolution.  Quite frankly, I believe that if Darwin could read this book today, that he would agree that his theory just does not hold water in light of what is currently known about mutations and molecular biology.  After my sons have completed at least high school biology and chemistry, I will work through this book with them as a supplement to their science education.  I am a science teacher (currently homeschooling) and would love to see this book receive the wide circulation that it deserves 
 I read so many bad reviews about this product, I was almost positive I would hate it. Then I came across the review Roger Ebert gave it for the Chicago Tribune. HE gave it 4 and half stars out of five. That peaked my interest. I found it at my Wal-Mart for $4. Figuring I could spare four bucks, I bought it, and watched it two days later. By far one of the best movies I've seen a LOOOONG time. Very intriguing plot, great acting, plus it's just plain fun. Combine Indiana Jones with Mission Impossible 2, and you have an idea what this is like. Plenty of special features to keep die-hard movie buffs happy. Plus it's got Angelina Jolie. Need I say more 
 I have downloaded the dictionary/thesaurus on my laptop.  It is very convenient when writing papers.  I certainly recommend it 
 I'm starting my second year of law school. I got this book near the end of my first year, and it proved to be an invaluable tool for editing journals and working for law firms over the summer. I wish I had this earlier.  As a side note, I would strongly recommend this book over Garner's American Usage if you are in a legal field. Even non-legal terms are covered in a way more useful to legal writing 
 Pay without Performance: The Unfulfilled Promise of Executive Compensation was the best book published in 2004 in the field of corporate governance. Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried focus on one aspect of corporate governance, executive pay, and clearly demonstrate that many features of executive pay are better explained as a result of shear managerial power, rather than arm's-length bargaining by boards of directors.   After thoughtful analysis, they find "systematic use of compensation practices that obscure the amount and performance insensitivity of pay, and the showering of gratuitous benefits on departing executives."  The cost of current corporate governance systems is weak incentives to reduce managerial slack or increase shareholder value and "perverse incentives" for managers to "misreport results, suppress bad news, and choose projects and strategies that are less transparent."   Their recommendations on improving executive compensation are clearly aimed at eliminating or reducing some of the most egregious of the practices  of those they document.  Interestingly, the recommendations are written to shareholders, apparently because there is little likelihood such reforms will be raised by even "independent" directors without further corporate governance reforms. A few examples are as follows:  *	To reduce windfalls in equity-based plans, shareholder should encourage that at least some of the gains in stock price due to general market or industry movements be filtered out. "At a minimum, option exercise prices should be adjusted so that managers are rewarded for stock price gains only to the extent that they exceed those gains (if any) enjoyed by the most poorly performing firms."  *	Executives should be prohibited from hedging or derivative transactions to reduce their exposure to fluctuations in the company's stock and should be required to disclose proposed sale of shares in advance to reduce perverse incentives to benefit from short-term gains that don't reflect long-term prospects.   *	Do not provide large payments to executives who depart because of poor performance.   *	The compensation table should include and should place a dollar value on all forms of "stealth" compensation, such as pensions, deferred compensation, postretirement perks and consulting requirements.  *	Allow shareholders to propose and vote on binding rules for executive compensation arrangements.   Although many directors now own shares, their related financial incentives are still too weak to induce them to take on the unpleasant task of firmly negotiating with their CEOs. Recent reforms requiring a majority of independent directors, and their exclusive use on compensation and nominating committees, may be beneficial but "cannot be relied on" to produce the kind of arm's length relationship between directors and executives needed. CEOs retain influence over director compensation and rewards, as well as social and psychological rewards.  "The key to reelection is remaining on the company's slate." Remaining on good terms with the CEO and their director allies continues to be the best strategy for renominatation.   Executive compensation "requires case-specific knowledge and thus is best designed by informed decision makers." They conclude, "While we should lessen directors' dependence on shareholder, we should also seek to increase directors' dependence on shareholders." After discussing the now failed "open access" SEC proposal to grant shareholders the right to place a token number of candidates on the ballot after specified "triggering events," the authors propose the following significant corporate governance reforms:  *	Access to the ballot should be granted to any group of shareholders that satisfies certain ownership thresholds. Their example is 5%, held for at least a year.   *	Such slates should be able to replace all or most incumbent directors in any given year.  *	Companies should be required to distribute the proxy statements of shareholder nominated candidates and should be required to reimburse reasonable costs if they garner "sufficient support."  *	Legal reforms should require or encourage firms to have all directors stand for election together.   *	Shareholders should be given the power to initiate and approved proposals to reincorporate and/or adopt charter amendments.   In their conclusion, the authors recognize the "political obstacles to the necessary legal reforms are substantial" and that "corporate management has long been a powerful interest group." The demand for reforms must be greater than management's power to block them. "This can happen only if investors and policy makers recognize the substantial costs that current arrangement impose." Pay without Performance will certainly contribute to such recognition. It should be required reading for every fund fiduciary, SEC board and staff, as well as all members of Congress. Shareholders should read will sitting down 
 I remember the movie on Sky some weeks back, and as with all well written books, it knocks spots off the big screen version. Grisham's portrayal of the eleven year old kid is masterful as he jumps into the kids head in every chapter. Absolutely gripping and highly believable. 
 I don't know how I missed this jewel until now, but I'm glad I finally found it.  I haven't been this moved by a work of fiction in a long, long time.  I found myself so drawn to Charlie and to what was happening to him, to his longing for acceptance and love, and to his quest to make sense of his world.  The desire for acceptance and love--from oneself and from others--is something all people have in common regardless their IQ.  I cried as Charlie regressed, all the while knowing what was happening to him, realizing the profundity of his loss, yet finally being grateful for the short period of intellect and what that contributed to science.    I can't disagree more with the reviewer who says the book's ending was predictable.  For a while, I thought the book would be about the trick of combining great intellect with human love.  When Fay put the female mouse in with Algernon, I kept waiting to see if this theme would be played out, first with the mouse, later with Charlie.  One possible ending would have been to let Charlie have his high IQ but, unlike Algernon, be able to integrate intellect with emotion.  Another ending would have been to go back to the lower IQ, and have a completely sterile existence devoid of anyone.  This of course did not happen as the people at the bakery also showed growth by the book's end and were able to truly take Charlie in and befriend him.  I think the author came up with a good ending by causing Charlie to lose the intellect, but to have gained self-love and the love of others, things he did not have at the start of his journey.  
 This 1530 piece puzzle was the first either my wife or I had done in decades. This was also the largest puzzle I ever remember doing. The pieces are cut with great accuracy. The dark areas were a little hard to sort out but we completed it in 5 weeks. 
 LAB color provides yet another way to maximize Photoshop's capabilities.  Dan Margulis has provided instruction and explanation of this color space for both the beginner and advanced user, separating some of the chapters into basic how-to's and more advanced explanations.  Highly recommended 
 Hitchcock's STAGE FRIGHT is, indeed, one of his most underappreciated films, which is surprising considering how entertaining it is on all of its levels.  The music is exciting, the acting of all is first-class, the cinematography of Wilkie Cooper is marvelous and the movie is bright, fast and amusing throughout.  As a film, it is not to be missed.  As a DVD, on the other hand, it leaves much to be desired.  Much can be forgiven in this release, which was not given too much care in the transfer from film to video, but what cannot be forgiven is the fact that the picture and sound are out of synchronization.  And this is appalling for a major studio like Warner Brothers.  It is unacceptable, in fact.  Warners seems to be the worst in this regard.  Their DVDs of BLOOD ALLEY, MAVERICK (the TV series) and about three dozen other titles that I am personally aware of are out of sync.  It is fofr this reason that I cannot recommend this disc to fans - unless Warner Brothers remasters it with the sound and picture correctly in sync with each other.  The picture quality is only OK.  There is a theatrical print of this film circulating in the classics movie houses which is vastly superior to the print used for this DVD.  All in all, a great film, but an unacceptable DVD  Dan Guenze 
 Anne Lamott is amazing!  Her metaphor for writing and for life may be a  little irreverent at times, but she tells it like it is.  The unexpected moments of humor delight us while opening us to her keen insights on life.  A manual on writing, a daily meditation, and a joyful read, Bird by Bird reaches us on many levels 
  This book along with "The Battle of Villa Forita," The Greengage Summer," "In this House of Brede.", and "China Court" are forgotten treasures.  I wish everyone had a chance to experience these books.  "An Episode of Sparrows" is my favorite book of Miss Godden's. She writes with amazing sensitivity about children -- almost as if she were one of them.  But this is not a children's book.  Rumer Godden understands the passions which drive people.  She has a true author's ability to get beneath the superficiality of people's daily lives and expose their true hopes and fears.  "An Epsisode of Sparrows" is set in post-war London.  It concerns the plight of Lovejoy Mason, one of the "sparrows" (slum children on Catford Street) who has been abandoned by her mother; Lovejoy finds solace and escape in planting a garden in that most unexpected of places, Catford Street.  Catford Street is teeming with the raw lives of slum people.  In contrast, Olivia and her sister Angela, elderly spinsters live on the other side of Catford Street--the respectable side.  Olivia especially yearns to experience the joy of being needed.  How these people and other rich characters such as the Irish Malone family and Vincent, the restaurant owner-- interact is wonderful to behold.  I own very few books; this is one of them.  I'm sorry that "An Episode of Sparrows" is out-of-print.  
 I use this mug primarily so that I can have coffee at the office without having to depend on the gross communal pot that nobody ever cleans.  It is quite satisfactory for that purpose, as it is convenient, easy to clean, and portable.  I always pour the coffee into another mug after steeping to stop it from continuing to steep.  It loses one star because it is only an okay French press.  The filter leaves a little more sludge than it ought even with a pretty coarse ground.  But it's certainly passable.  On a camping trip, this thing would be heaven, as it is very durable and easy to clean.  The bottom line:  If you need a portable French press, this definitely will do the job 
 This is a great book to aid a beginning blacksmith. Lots of helpful tips, useful exercises, and practical projects 
 Just beautifully written, with no lapses in quality throughout its length, this novel is both terribly romantic and terribly tragic.  Rather like a Greek tragedy in it's drama and grandeur, this work was much better to my taste than the better known "Heart of Darkness" which inspired Francis Ford Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" - a very thinly veiled adaptation set in Vietnam.  I cannot propose this work to be the pinnacle of literature, and yet, when only 5 levels may be granted, this is definitely a 5.  Well worth reading. 
 I had my training sub read this book.  She got very wrapped up in the story and the character, but there was several things about this story that scared her.  This story has a lot of strong slavery and hummiliation in it.  Also at first glance I didn't realize the story was very pony play related.  In that context it is a great read. But I wouldn't recommend this as a early read for a sub who is just getting into BDSM. 
 Erich Fromm, the author, was born in Frankfurt in Germany in 1900. He claims that love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problems of human existence. However, most people do not bother to develop their capacity to love. Learning to love requires practice and concentration. Dr. Fromm discusses romantic love and all the wrong notions that surround it as well as love of parents for children, brotherly love, erotic love, self-love and the love of God. The book is filled with challenging observations about a complicated subject that the author treats in a lively, human and extremely interesting manner. This is a must read for anybody who desires to expand their ability to give and receive love 
 Hi, Dan Brown book is always loved by any person who loves art , architecture, sclpture, thrill, suspense, and wants to feel adrinalin rush in thei system..... Must read book. Hasit Dav 
 This book tells the story of a number of elderly ladies with quirky personalities and a zest for life.  They embroil themselves in a murder mystery in their condo complex.  Lots of characters, sometimes hard to keep them clear in your mind.  An easy "beach read."  Look forward to additional books with same heroine.  
 If you are a sci fi buff, this is a must have. It is a definitive collection of some of the most important science fiction ever written. It spans works from the late 30's into the earlys 60's with a good portion coming from the 40's (arguably the most pivotal era for sci fi). I had to read this book as a requirement for a class in high school and somehow, I "accidentally" failed to turn it back in (oops!). Some of my personal faves: "Arena," "Helen O'Loy," "The Little Black Bag"... heck! I love the whole book! 
 Originally released in 1970,as this was the original band's second lp.About as good as the first effort 'Pretties For You'(see my review).As I remember,BOTH albums were pretty much a stiff UNTIL 'Billion Dollar Babies' became a million seller.After the Alice Cooper Group had become world known,that's when fans became interested in their early works such as 'Easy Action'.You can hear their Zappa influence.As for myself,I've never been that much of a Frank Zappa fan.Also felt the band's first two records showed just how much Alice&crew were,in fact ahead of their time.'Easy Action' is like part weird psychedelic and part hard rock.Tunes here I thought were impressive include "Mr.&Misdemeanor","Below Your Means","Return Of The Spiders"(dedicated to Gene Vincent)and "Lay Down And Die Goodbye".One of Cooper's lesser known gems.Recommended 
 Oh, the Thinks You Can Think is the best book that expresses a childs best of thier imagination. This is the type of book, if your a parent and you have a little one that has a wild imagination than this book is great for them. Now i may of read it quite a while ago, but it is still stuck in side my head after all these years 
 I've read all 20 and a half volumes of the Aubrey/Maturin series and will read them 5 times over as soon as I have finished all else that is available by POB. The Golden Ocean is just pure delight. I can not really add anything substantial to the praise from the other 12 or so reviewers, but I wanted to add my contribution. POB was truly a master at storytelling. Who else could have come up with Sean's version of the gambling/pickpocketing disaster story in the first chapter (Sean starting like a proto-type for Padeen, but then developing into somebody else)? Or the fluency of the dialogues between the partners in poverty in chapter 2, even if the actual story does not have any real surprises? Who else can jump time gaps with this efficiency at summarizing longish periods in half sentences (like the probably epic, but untold journey through Ireland with one lame horse for three men, which is of course the proto-type for all Maturin's races, failed or not, towards reaching his ship in time)? Who else can squeeze whole commentaries into one verb or adjective? There is also a proto-type for Jack Aubrey's joking style in the person of an "elderly" midshipman. Great stuff 
 Gorgeous illustrations and a charming story. This book is for everyone - boy, girl, young, old. Don't hesitate 
 When I puchased this item, I wanted to replace my portable DVD player. this has done just that for me. I travel alot and this really makes life easier for me. I can watch movies and listen to music and still have battery life in the iPod. The screen is great for 2 people to watch as is the dual headphone jacks. Great product 
 I saw the film at a young age.  Never forgot it then Oops I wanted to read the book, books are always different than the movie 
 This is one of the best albums of the last 25 years and certainly one of the best I have ever heard. If you like good music like the Beatles, Kinks, Rolling Stones, Wilco, Fountains of Wayne, Beck, Coldplay, Prince, or Radiohead, then you will probably not be disappointed by this CD 
 As before, "The Waste Lands" has a direct connection to "Drawing of the three", exactly like it was the case between part I and II in the DT series. Here you have a simply PERFECT King novel, especially related to the DT series: The playground keeps changing on and on all through the plot, the same with the Tet; one person joins them probably every single reader would've expected at he very last to arrive again, and a non - human being's also supposed to join Roland on his further way to the tower, I dare to say until the last episode of the series...  Yeah, as I said above, here we have a simply FANTASTIC novel where I hardly found any difficulties to follow the story. The book's a bit longer than the parts before, due to its MASS of action and change of playground, of course, but here I can't even complain about this in ANY WAY!!!    
 A good book, it gives examples of the many jobs a team member performs to contribute to the success of all of hte teams 
 Quicksand was an overlooked treasure during Renaissance. Pay close attention to the detail, the surroundings, and the inner thoughts of the main character.... simply marvelous 
 Overall this book is GREAT.  The information in the book is very thorough and my dog loves everything I've made using this book. However, for the main meal recipes, they are all kind of no-brainers.  What the author could have done was just provide a list of ratios - so much meat, so much grain, so much vegetables, so the cook could mix-and-match ingredients.  I could see people who are DEPENDENT on sticking to recipes being very limited by feeling they have to make these dishes exactly as spelled out, but in reality the author could have provided better instruction on being flexible as long as the right food-type ratios are stuck to 
 Great idea! The bound book is sweet, not cheesy at all, nice quality. Makes a great gift for grandparents. My teenagers even enjoyed making them. 
 This book wasn't what I expected.  It is a well documented, incteful look at the news.  I was surprised to discover that this book was written by a liberal!  This book is a must read for anyone who watches the evening news 
 This book, and the slightly more detailed "Million Dollar Consulting" are "must reads" for any contemplating consulting, as well as us 'old timers'.  I have 10 years experience in full-time consulting (medical device / pharma / regulatory affairs), and have read all of Weiss' books, rereading several many times.  However, these two books present the best over-views of this career, with solid advice.  While his advice is no longer new, I personally know many consultants who employ very few of his suggestions, and most of these fail after a few years.  A periodic read of these two books allows me to continually readjust my strategic plans.  A key benefit is that this causes me to act on another of his points, resulting in greater business success.  Some complain about his books, but I value the points made and his method of presentation.  Although I think most of Alan's income is now gained on the speaker circuit and mentoring (which other consultants may also choose to follow), the information in these books is firmly based on experience from his early years in consulting, as well as on his current experiences with those he mentors. For the cost of 2-3 magazines, one can often significantly increase their income by really applying the advice in these books.  His key premise of value-based pricing, up-front fees (33, 50 or 100%), plus his suggestions for recycling material, have  greatly benefitted my practice. That's real VALUE in my 'book'. 
 What do you call a book about abandoned babies in coin lockers, a homicidal pole vaulter, a gay, straight, then gay again Jrocker, a drug called Datura, a filipino gun maker with missing teeth, a model who keeps a crocodile as a pet, discriptive images of blood, images of sex with men and women and prostitutes all around, a "sea" voyage, matricide, murder, weird out psycho antics, and an "end" to end it all? Well, if you guessed Coin Locker Babies then you're cool. Coin Locker Babies. What can I say? I've never read such an interesting, messed up, funny, yet sad book in my entire life. All kinds of things happens in Coin Locker Babies that it's almost unbelievable. Reading about it makes me think of some weird comic book or some crazy Tarantino movie. Actually, if Tarantino made a movie about this book it would probably be pretty cool. I've never enjoyed reading a book in such a long time. It's like a 400 page comic book without pictures. I think that's what one of the reviews said about it and honestly it's true. The story is easy to follow, the desriptions are vivid and it feels like you're directing your own sort of movie about this book. I totally recommend it. It's an awesome book though it almost made me sort of sad when I finished because I so want to read more. It was like a total adventure. Then again, if you don't like reading bloody descriptions of various things and reading about psychos living in Murakami's version of a Tokyo ghetto, then it isn't for you. Otherwise... WOW... I loved it. I've never read such a long book in such a short time.   I would have given it 5 stars but because there were some trouble spots in the editing department I have to give it a 4. Otherwise, I think the book is perfect 
 If you don't own the entire VU catalog, then this is essential listening for every fan of popular music of the last 50 years.  I am not one to give out 5 stars blithely.  If you are reading this page, then buy this record 
 Possibly one of the best dance singles of the 80's was Buffalo Stance. Put with the other selections like Manchild provides some listening you will never get tired of. Future selections just dont match the raw edge of this  CD. Neneh was and still is miles ahead of her time 
 They are ok because one of them broke the first day but i think it broke because my guitar was messed up that day when i put them on but other than that they are ok 
 There are no words to describe how fantastically astute this book is. John Limon is diabolically intelligent 
 Wonderful read, and unlike such weightier classics as THE ART OF WAR or THE BOOK OF FIVE RINGS, this one is readily accessible to the western mind.  After reading it twice, I came to think that everything after the first chapter -- nay, after the first two paragraphs -- was mere repetition. This is because all the behaviors and philosophies the author recommends would be the natural consequence if one truly were to "keep death in mind at every possible moment."  The book is a series of short chapters like "Loyalty," "Finances," "Personal Appearance;" each describing the ideal behavior of an ideal samurai with respect to each.  I can't comment on the organization or skill of Cleary's translation, though, since I know of no other version of this book. However I am inclined to think it is adept, since the nature of the work suggests the original Japanese would be extremely stiff. This is not the case with the English.  Gripes:  1. Note that this is a thin book; you can read it in about an hour. I was expecting something much thicker, at least the size of THE UNFETTERED MIND, say.  2. Oscar Ratti's illustrations will be disappointing to those familiar with his work in SECRETS OF THE SAMURAI and AIKIDO: THE DYNAMIC SPHERE. There are only a handful of them, and that handful isn't very interesting.  3. The binding of this book came apart rather quickly, after just the first read. Perhaps just my copy, though.  4. Sadly, the introduction by Cleary is completely forgettable 
 Because the information in these types of books is often the same (DIY is DIY after all); the presentation becomes very important.  The Stanley series of home improvement books has step-by-step instructions with a large volume of clear photos and diagrams.  I learned how to install a ceiling fan using this book and feel confident about doing basic electrical wiring in my house.  If you are a beginner, read all the safety instructions... very sensible advice 
 Sometimes the simplest thing can be the best thing in the world. Gee, I wish I came up with this gadget, I would be a millionaire by now.

 Hachiko is a wonderful young puppy who lives with his master, Professor Ueno. Each morning the Professor tells Hachiko these same words, as he boards the train: "What a good dog you are. What a fine dog you are. Hachi you are the best dog in all of Japan." And every afternoon, at 3 o'clock on the dot, Hachiko arives back at the train station to greet his owner once again. However, one day, the Professor doesn't step off the train. So Hachiko waits. He waits for ten years. Not even the kind young boy known as Yasuo can persuade Hachiko to leave his post, and take shelter in a warm home. Soon Hachiko is known around the country, and the world, as the dog who never gave up on his owner's return.  I love animal stories, and I've always been interested in the Japanese culture, so I adored HACHIKO WAITS. Leslea Newman has done a marvelous job of capturing the love an animal - whether a dog, cat, etc. - holds for his or her owner, as long as they treat him/her well. The prose is wonderful, and will hold young readers enamored for hours, while the gorgeous black and white illustrations by Machiyo Kodaira bring the story even more to life. This is an absolute must read for all animal lovers.  Erika Sorocco Book Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspape 
 Wow, this girls are amazing! They differ from many other gospel girl groups out there. They have a style of a typical R&B girl group but they bringing out the messages of God. The tracks on this album are extremely well done by the girls. The debut video "Holla" I think already proves that! "Holla" has two different parts on this CD. One is the first track the Urban Remix where J.Moss spits a rap and the last track which is just the girls and is a little more slower than the Urban remix. They did excellent remakes on this album of Musiq Soulchild's "Love" turning it into "Lord" and Curtis Mayfield's classic "People Get Ready" where they even break in their own breakdown and hit today's scene with a flavor. The title track "With A Kiss" is extremly romantic and the words just bring the song into reality of how the Last Supper actually went. They hooked up with Darkchild Entertainment where Uncle Freddie produced the dance hit "Dance Like Sunday" which is a message say that when you down, dance like it's Sunday. The girls do some of their writing on the album! They all hook up for "Sixteen Again" which is an R&B flavored song with lyrics about feeling sixteen again with a boyfriend and about how they older looking back on the memories of being sixteen. Angel wrote a track called "The One for Me" which is a song about a girl saying how she wasted most of her life looking for the right one not knowing that He was always with her. It has a Traditional Gospel feel to it. Chanelle wrote on two tracks. One being "I Wish" which most of Trin-I-Tee 5:7's fans enjoy the most from this album. It's a mysterious sounding track about someone missing somebody and other people knowing how special that somebody actually was. "Greater Than You and Me" Chanelle wrote about how this a place (Heaven) which is filled with amazing things. The song has a Rock edge. The song which Adrian wrote on is the BEST song on the WHOLE album! It's called "All of My Life" where she wrote all the lyrics with Big Bert helping out with some music. It's a song about how someone hasn't been living up to the standards they should and that God should guide me cuz we need Him all of our lives. It's a sweet song cuz it's inbetween a Happy and a Sad, it's got a Melancholy feel to it. A happy sadness. The album, of course, ends with the original version "Holla" which is slower than the original. Overall, this album is da BOMB! The album of 2002, besides Kirk Franklin's "Rebirth" and many others. Still it's hot, it's joints are cool, tight tracks, aiight one! God Bless 
 almost the same as the newer addition , has all the things you ned to know about labor economic 
 An adaptation of the real life story of a family that gave their all to bring down a major organized crime family.  It is not just the law enforcement officers who paid but their families who had to live in fear with absent members unable to support them.   A moving, dramatic, and intense story that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Pacino and Depp are a perfect match for their roles and their talent shines.  Impressive 
 This was when PBS and the CTW were making programs that were both "educational" and entertaining in all sense of the words.  Today, while PBS still does Children's Television, the programs are not quite as effective as the earlier shows were.  Seseme Street is still on, but replacement shows like those shows that are made by Scholastic Company, just do not have the same effective ability to get kids to learn, while shows like Seseme Street, The Electric Company, and Mr Rogers's Neighborhood did.  Anyway Volume 2 of the Best of the Electric Company is being prepared for a DVD release, Like Volume One, it will also feature a selection of shows from the six seasons that it aired on PBS.  I understand Rita Moreno will host new episode Introductions to each episode.  A few more of the cast and crew will be interviewed in their work on the show (if only they could get Bill Cosby and Morgan Freeman to do interviews), and yes, more of the shows will feature Spider-Man segments 
 I liked this book.  It challenges you to move past basic cabinet making to furniture quality construction.  It includes good detail and suggestions that improve your skills. This book has the quality of it's namesake magazine 
 There is not one bad song. Not one. This is his best album. Buy it now 
 If anyone had tried to tell me we could get 80 church members to come to a Saturday retreat to talk about Evangelism, I would have told them they were crazy...   We're a mainline church - and Evangelism just isn't something we are comfortable with..    But Unbinding the Gospel motivated my church to move in ways I couldn't imagine..  As the book suggested, we prayed - not just once, but faithfully...  and 80 people read the book and showed up on a Saturday..  And they joined in groups to pray for each other... for the church.. and for all those who needed to hear the story..    I have been an active layperson in my church for a decade..  We've tried many things along the way..  This book challenged us to be more faithful - and to share our faith more faithfully.  I'm convinced it has planted mustard seeds that will bloom in ways only God can imagine.    
 I was living on the island of St. Thomas in 1977 when I first heard this recording. I was on a beautiful beach, drinking those powerful rum punch drinks. Someone played the first song, "Natural Mystic" and for me, it was like being transported to another time dimension. The musical cadence and beauty of the song just captured me. I was instantly hooked to Bob Marley's music. The entire album has a quality to it that has made it one of the true classics in music. Not one bad track on the entire set. Played with passion and love by one of the greats, the main "rude boy" himself, Robert "Bob" Marley. 
 This book is everything a physician needs. It's the most comprehensive and  almost detailed book available on Pharmacology after G & G, It is a really great purchase 
 If you've listened to any Brian Tracy tapes, or seen his videos, you know he can go on for a long, long time--on many different subjects.  Much is repeated, on virtually every one of his programs, this is no exception.  However, a lot of new, invigorating stuff is on these CD's.  The price alone makes this an excellent program.  All of Tracy's audio/video programs on Nightingale Conant sell for $70 and up.  I keep these CD's in my car all the time, and listen to them often.  His tone of voice is much more soothing than Zig, and he is almost every bit as enthusiastic.  If you are thinking about getting an auto-audio education, this is a great starting point 
 I really wanted to like "Third Man Out" more than I did.  It had all the makings of a fine movie, but I felt it was a little forced, a little scattered, and the story didn't hold up terribly well.  I am happy to say that "Shock" is a really fine movie and a vast improvement over "System."  It preserves the continuity of the Strachey character, and we get a new murder mystery, tons more back story, and a much more natural-feeling, interesting, and thoughtful feel for the relationship between Strachey and his partner.    Along with some chuckles and inside jokes, there is real feeling here, and this film takes some chances.  It deals with coming out, self-identity, parenting, and more.  Mr. Strachey's investigation takes him inside a gay conversion group, or "ex-gay" group, and the film is thoughtful and deals respectfully with all the characters.  Of course Chad Allen is the best part of this movie, and seems born, almost, for the role which he pulls off, somehow, conveying feelings and emotions with barely a perceptible change of expression.    This film is worth seeing, enjoying, and thinking about.  I look forward to the next installment of the Allen/Stratchey series 
 There are two striking qualities to be found in Monica Ali's debut novel. First, although the book's pace is measured and at times even slow, I never found it boring. The second feat is that all her characters are far from perfect, and their actions are often blameworthy, but--with the exception of a a nosy and malevolent neighbor, who figures late in the plot--they are nevertheless endearing. It's rare to find a writer who strikes such a delicate balance between the ordinariness and the uniqueness of the lives of everyday people.  The heroine, Nazneen, is far from a saint, and she could even be called simple (both deferential to her husband and meek in her expectations), but she commands the sympathies of her husband, her neighbors, and the reader. She comes to England from Bangladesh, to enter into an arranged marriage and raise two children and to live as a stranger in her both her new country and the neighborhood around Brick Lane. The bubble in which she lives bursts when her children become teenagers and when Nazneen begins an affair with a young activist. Gradually, she matures beyond her deference and her low expectations--and she begins to love her new home.  The men in Nazneen's life are equally conflicted. Her husband is oafish, pompous, and even delusional--one daughter finds him utterly embarassing, the other is anxiously eager to please--but he's basically a good, caring man. Constantly seeing the mirage of success on the horizon of his flailing employment prospects, he plans to return to Bangladesh--intentions thwarted by the economic realities of his life in London. Nazneen's lover, in contrast, is idealistic, arrogant, and passionate; he fills her life with excitement, but he encloses her with a trap of a different sort. A reasonable request for information or a calm appeal for respect can be greeted by rigid certainty: "He looked at her up and down, as if she might be an impostor. 'Because,' he said with quiet emphasis, 'it is.'"  Until the unexpected, frantic climatic chapters that close the book, "Brick Lane" is composed of scenes from a marriage, scenes from an affair. She understands she can't have both, but she is confronted yet by another choice: her native country against her adopted one. The ghost of her mother tells her, "It's easy. You just have to endure," while her best friend in London asserts, "You can do whatever you like." Yet none of her decisions are "easy. 
 You will not want to put this book down once you pick it up.  I like the way the author gave the characters some depth in this book instead of focusing on their sex lives.  The sequel is better than this one but this one is nothing to sleep on either!  
 With a cable modem, took about 1 hour and 15 minutes to download Unbox, install the program and download the episode.  It's a great download speed considering the file is 803 mb.  I was able to still use my computer, IE 7.0 and RealPlayer, so the download is not a resource hog.  The menu bar includes a link to shop for more Unbox titles, which I found very convenient.    The quality is great, but the video stutters in Unbox.  Maybe because it uses 3 applications when playing video?  I chose to watch the episode on Windows Media Player 11 and I had no problems at all.  I've bought and watched 3 episodes, all with the same results.  Fast and unobstrusive download, great quality and low price.  Just use WMP, or another player that can handle wma files, to watch.      
 I love this. Now my DVD's are in order and they fit perfectly 
 Quality product, arrived sooner than expected.  Would definitely purchase from this seller again 
 This is a wonderful card game to play with the family.  We have two teenage boys who don't usually want to spend time with the family but love sitting down all together to play this game with us.  When I first bought it, I wasn't sure anybody would like it so only bought one deck.  It has been so popular with us as a family as well as guests that I had to search for a second deck since you need two decks to play with more than four people.  I highly recommend this game 
 Robert Munsch does an excellent job of bringing humor to something that can be scary for children - losing a tooth.  He makes the story very silly by introducing a few silly characters to help Andrew rid himself of his  lose tooth 
 This is one of the books I have followed to successfully raise and process free range poultry for human and cat consumption - as well as give proper care to my pet chickens, ducks and geese for many years 
 I just read this book again for the first time since it came out about ten years ago.  While a lot of other Star Wars books haven't held up well over time, I was really happy that The Paradise Snare was as fun to read as I remembered.  Crispin does a great job of getting the mannerisms and character of Han Solo right, even as a developing teenager, and by the end we see Han as somewhat idealistic but still willing to break the rules and the law if it will help him get what he wants.  It must have been difficult to be handed the task of creating a backstory for Han Solo, while fitting it with the films and other novels.   But Crispin does the job very well with a good mix of humor, action and romance that was not over the top.  While the scope of the book isn't as sprawling as other Star Wars novels, it wasn't meant to be and really shouldn't be.  This book is more about the first personal journey of Han Solo, and the tone fits perfectly.  Crispin shows that Han knows what it is like to be hungry, to be afraid, and to suffer while growing up, and you can really understand by the end of the book why as an adult he chooses to put himself first.  In the story we learn about his upbringing, how he learned to speak Shyriiwook (the Wookiee language), his first experiences with running spice, piloting freighters and working for the Hutts.  A bittersweet love story is also woven throughout the book, which actually seemed believable as a tale of first loves.   If you're looking for a fun and quick Star Wars read, pick this up.  You will not be disappointed 
 filled with tons of contacts this is definately needed for anyone looking for places to sell photographs... thanks!!   
 I would have to say this was a brilliant movie. I was highly entertained from this Mr.Corman and Hill flick. Beautiful women getting roughed up, from the somewhat feminine guards. Pam Grier gets your full attention 
 I bought my thermometer about a year ago and have used it to cook beef and chicken to perfection.  No more dry meat whether it is in the oven or in a smoker or grill.  Then I tried it to make fudge.  Best fudge I've ever made and the temperatures were very accurate.  Plan on buying one for each of my children for Christmas 
 Crime and Punishment is regarded as one of the best books of all time by many, but few people have actually read it.  While I read it, I didn't let the hype that surrounded it cloud my thoughts about it.  It is one of the most interesting books that I have read, going into the mind of its protagonist far deeper than any other novel. However, I found some of Dosteyevsky's themes and beliefs offensive, especially his stereotypical view of Germans as fools with thick accents.  His knowlege of the human mind is amazing, though, as he writes about multiple personalities and the subconscious many years before they were first suggested by Freud.  This book is definitely not for the casual reader, and is tough going for about 100 pgs in the middle, but readers who make it through will be rewarded with some of the best writing ever.  Don't read it because of the hype, read it for its fascinating and completely unique view of the criminal mind and a look into the thoughts and beliefs of a very complicated author.  
 hahahaha, you have never seen a movie quite like this.  The biggest favor you could do yourself is *not to read anything about it* and just watch it.  The beginning *is* slow; stick with it.  I think most people, if they'd seen a synopsis for this movie on paper, would've thought it was the most ridiculous thing they ever read.  Granted, one of the most off-the-wall movies you'll see, never what it seems, constantly changing and constantly surprising you.  But it totally works, thanks to the performances 
 This is a frightening look at how badly justice can miscarry.  It's the true story of Randall Dale Adams, who was wrongly convicted of murdering Dallas, Texas police officer Robert Wood. This gripping documentary lets the story tell itself, with the group of people that were directly involved in the case, witnesses, law enforcement officers, the judge and the lawyers. The film, with an incredible music score that sounds like musical teardrops, pulled me deeply into this real life drama to the point one wonders how in the world could something like this happen to an innocent man.  Notice what is stated about the prosecutors in Dallas.  First Assistant District Attorney Douglas Mulder, the prosecutor in this case, should have been interviewed for this  Thin Blue Line DVD that was released.  What would have happened to Randall Dale Adams, if the public had not viewed this film?  The book, Adams V. Texas, tells the story of Randall Dale Adams. 
 I am about to start my second year of teaching (my first year I taught first grade and now I'm moving up with the students!). I am thrilled to be teaching second grade and am very pleased with this book. The author has a lot of experience to speak from. She does a fine job describing a second grader and what they are capable of. Not only does the author offer general advice about teaching second grade, she has included many lessons complete with reproducibles! There are also many photographs in the book.  This is a very useful book for any second grade teacher.  
 I very much enjoyed this book (until the ending) --- It was fast reading as I wanted to see what was going to happen to this poor little orphan girl  This book made me realize how something can be too good to be true (or someone) and how it is vital for one to use wisdom before embarking on major decisions  Hope others will enjoy it as much as I did 
  If your goal is to understand the depth of Richard Nixon's involvement in the Watergate scandal, Stanley Kutler's `The Wars of Watergate' is the book for it.  It's a great introduction to Watergate without that qualifying caveat, of course, but Kutler perches his narrative squarely on Nixon's shoulder.  This book doesn't take extended side trips to the creation of the Plumbers, to that dirty trickster Donald Segretti, or the back desks in the Special Prosecutor's offices. The wars of Watergate, Kutler writes, are "rooted in the lifelong political personality of Richard Nixon," a personality that is marked by political paranoia, a determination to wreak vengeance on his enemies, and an overweening concern with winning his own elections.  For those who dismiss Watergate as a third-rate burglary, or a vague `everyone else does it,' Kutler provides a substantial "discussion of the abuses of power that precede the burglary and the obstruction of justice that followed it."    Kutler sets the stage with brief chapters on the LBJ Administration, Vietnam, and a biographical sketch of Richard Nixon prior to the presidential election of 1968.  We're taken closer to our subject with Kutler's next few chapters on Nixon's first term as president, where Nixon's relationship with the media (antagonistic,) and congress (disdainful,) as well as his executive style (obsessive micro-management) are surveyed.  Providing as they do a context for the crimes of Richard Nixon, these prelude-to-war sections properly prepare us for the battles of Watergate.    An American constitutional historian, Stanley Kutler is well qualified to guide us through the battleground that was the second term of Richard Nixon. The war analogy is apt.  For Nixon the Wars of Watergate officially begins with the immediate Administration response to the break-in at the DNC headquarters by the Watergate burglars.  The first phase may be called "The War of the Burglars' Silence," a phase that is marked by Nixon's active participation in those acts that would lead to his resignation less that two years later.   One gets the strong impression that `The Wars of Watergate' is Kutler's response to future revisionist historians. The revisionist template was already being hammered out by Nixon, and others, when this book was published in 1990.  If Kutler is forestalling an alternate interpretation, he does so with a well-coordinate, thoughtful, balanced, and overwhelmingly convincing presentation of facts.  His interpretation - that Nixon was at the center of the Watergate cover-up from the beginning - is, with the evidence he provides to back it up, irrefutable.    Although `The Wars of Watergate' is not a complete history of the scandal, it's a good chunk of it - the heart of it, if you will.  It would make a good introduction for the uninitiated.  Even for Watergate wonks its expanded chapters on the Rodino chaired House Judiciary Committee, which considered impeachment, will provide fresh insights and a more complete story of an under-reported Watergate subject.  This may not be the best single volume on Watergate, but if it isn't I haven't read its rival.  Highest recommendation.    
 I must say I am truely impressed...and that is not the usual for me...I popped it open and it just beamed at me...so it looks good. It fit on both versions of my babies strollers the full size and the light weight umbrella canopy stroller. The velcro straps let you adjust tightness of the fit and secure it to the handles and legs of the stroller!No more fly aways!!!. The only thing I could see making it not 100% full proof is the blue material that makes the roof...but  even that repelled most of the water when I sprinkled it kind of like windbreaker jacket material....but doesnt the roof of your stroller get wet when it rains regardless?!Sure it does!If you dont want to get wet at all Stay Out of The Rain!With that said I must give this wonderful Product the Big Mommy Approval Stamp 
 This is a true Patricia Cornwell book.  It is pivoting and holds your interest.  I thoroughly enjoy Cornwell's books and cannot wait for new ones to be released.  Outstanding book 
 I've used a number of types of rechargeable batteries from various companies in the past. I bought these batteries to power my Olympus FL50 flash for my DSLR camera. Other rechargeable AA batteries only last for 150-200 flashes, with a slower and slower recycle time in between flashes. These Sanyo batteries lasted me over 1500 shots on one charge, with less than a second of recycle time in between flashes; that is simply amazing. I highly recommend these batteries to anyone who has a power intensive device that requires a quick recycle time 
 This novel, I admit is a little disturbing, but it is very well thought out, and is poorly judged because of some of the gruling descriptions of some events, but I think it is neat how he really doesn't hold back on anything. The book Monster, by Jonathan Kellerman is a really twisted book. I'm not saying I don't like it, because I do, and I think it is a truly unique book. It is about a cop and a detective who are in search of a killer, who committed two murders, but for all they know, it could be two separate killers, and everyone is a suspect. They investigate the victims backgrounds to come out with several different outcomes of suspected killers. This book is recommended to anyone who really enjoys a good thriller. I like the way all the plot lines tie together in the end, and somehow all relate to each other. It is very well written, and the ending, in my opinion, is unexpectedly the best part. This is one of my favorite books, and I very strongly reccommend it 
 Mind, Body & Spirt Fitness Magazine is wonderful. I get a lot of exercise ideas from them and I try to incorparate them into my workouts for my clients in Chicago. Thanks Fitnes 
 Nora, "They say you were shot in the Tabloids."  Nick, "It didn't come anywhere near my Tabloids!"  Need I say more?  Just buy it because there's plenty more where that came from 
 I've enjoyed Robert Parker's fiction for many years now and it still entertains. He aspires to offer some wisdom along with the story and that is also fairly enjoyable. True, sometimes what he brings forth as deep psychological truth is actually pretty ordinary, but then most truth is. I long for him to undiscover psychology and discover other sources of wisdom. But you can't have everything. This particular book is up to his usual standards of clear, concise prose 
 I was fortunate enough to meet and spend some time with George a few months ago.  At the time I didn't own any of his cd's, but now I do, and I gotta say he is incredibly talented!  I don't usually listen to this style of music, but my wife loves it, so I try to find artists that I find bearable so we don't end up fighting over the car radio on trips.  I find myself being the one to recommend putting George in the cd player.  He is a great artist, and a wonderful person to boot.  In person he is just as genuine, kind, and nice as he appeared on Idol, and that carries through to his music.  Great guy.  Great music.  Great purchase 
 The cradle is just what I wanted for my granddaughter. It is plenty sturdy and should last as long as it is needed. The pillow, mattress and blanket were kind of flimsy so I made new ones 
 I first read The Israelis about a year ago, and I enjoyed it very much.  With the recent events in and around the country (the Hamas election victory, Ariel Sharon's new political party, his incapacitation) I decided to read it again.  I started by looking up a few facts for a discussion group, and became so involved that I read the book a second time from cover to cover.  I've discussed the book with friends from Israel, and all but one of them feel that it is an accurate view of modern life.  The one person who didn't agree said it was "skewed," with not enough weight given to the various Orthodox communities and beliefs (she is Orthodox).  The impression I had of her comments, though, were that she wasn't unhappy with the boook per se, but rather with the current path being taken by Israelis, and that this boook is promoting this path.  My feeling was that it wasn't promoting, just reporting it as accurately as possible.  If you plan to take a trip to Israel, read this book first.  You'll enjoy your trip much more than you expected.  
 Estoy satisfecho del producto. Era lo que buscaba, me siento muy bien con la compra. 
 Chesterton writng is for the scholarly reader. His discourse is more question and answer to the theological and philosifcal issues surrounding Francis than a history or biography. As my  readings enlarge my scope I will go back to this title and hopefully appreciate the discourse more than at it's first reading. 
 I think that when the phone rang was a pretty good book.  Personally I like the book because it had all the conflicts that brothers and sisters go through.  I also like how they figured out there problems so I think that this book wasnt really a bad book at all. So I would recommend this book to some body who like changes that happen in real life and what and how the little girl who is twelve changes, her name is Lori 
 Just amazing. My wife and I visit Paris for ten days yearly... and this book is our dining directory. Absolutely reliable and accurate. Over the last two weeks, we visited six of the twelve Top Picks. And then seven of the Highly Recommended. We indulged in fois gras at least once and most often twice a day. Two additions to the book: Under new management, Benoit is much better, and more wonderful, than the last two years, but still as "Parisian", so be sure to insist on the main dining area instead of the back room. Reservations far in advance are important. Also, the most wonderful La Grille, the off-the-beaten-path home of the Turbot of the Century, is an absolute must. Retirement can't be too far off for Yves and the gracious Genevieve Cullerre. Get there while you can. If you love traditional French fare, this book is essential. I hope the Twenty First Century Edition will be updated often. We are counting on it.      
 I'd like to know who "Trevanian" is, but biographical details appear to be scarce. From reading this novel, I picture a disaffected former employee of some intelligence agency. The humor which Trevanian directs at the CIA is caustic, and very witty. In his/her novel, the agency is a sort of petty bureaucracy which bungles its way through various operations, always suffering from commically high levels of groupthink. Picture a classically James Bond-esque character working for a bunch of delusional government bureaucrats, and you get a pretty good sense of how this novel plays out.    Another thing which sets this novel out of the classic spy novel mold is that it doesn't portray The Soviet Union as necessarily eeevilll. Instead, we are told that, "`If you're saying that the average shopkeeper in Seattle is a humane  guy, that's perfectly true. But so is the average shopkeeper in  Petropavlovsk...'" This novel gives the impression that it was mostly the people in power who made the world a dangerous place, and it didn't much matter which side of the "Iron curtain" they hailed from.    All this is quite subtly wrapped up in a story which is quite a lot of fun to read in its own right. It's humor with teeth 
 This book should be required reading for anyone serious about breeding quality dogs. Easy to read with lots of valuable information, but detailed enough for the experienced breeder 
 I laughed out loud while I read this book. I was surprised that it is so slim, yet each story is packed with humor. The reader cannot help but enjoy the Professor's adventures in the crazy academic world of Philology. This is a great book to take with you if you will only have the chance to read in short sips or if you only have time for one more story before bed- just make sure you close the windows so the neighbors don't complain about the laughter 
 I enjoyed this light read. It is something I would reccomend to read on a day you want a "lite" read. It is fun, and quick. No heavy morals,fights scences. It is set up for a series that looks lie it is going to be great.  I Have ordered (used) all the other books. If I were you and looking into this series for the first time, I wouldn't buy it new, I would either go to the library or look for it used. 
 Here is another example of the bad job done by the mainstream media in informing Americans about the state of the world. This book presents a number of facts, with accompanying essays, that will not be covered on the evening news.  In 2002, more than 80 percent of the world's executions took place in just three countries, China, Iran and America. Black men born in the US stand a one in three chance of going to jail, while white men have a one in seventeen chance of going to jail. Because of the Asian preference for male over female babies, and because of China's one-child policy, China has 44 million missing women. Over one-fifth of the world's population lives on less than one dollar a day. One-third of the world's obese people, and over 80 percent of the smokers, live in developing countries.  Did you know that nearly half of Americans believe that aliens have landed on Earth? According to one estimate, there are over 67,000 lobbyists in Washington, which equals 125 for each member of Congress. Ten languages disappear every year. Every year, America spends $10 billion on pornography, the same amount it spends on foreign aid. More than 70 percent of the world has never heard a dial tone.  This book also includes sources for each of the essays, and organizations to contact for those who are inspired to get involved in any of these areas. It is excellent, and I enjoyed reading it. Compare the subjects in this book to what is shown on the "all-news" channels. To get a very different view of the world, this is a fine place to start.  
 A great book, very readable. It does have some equations, but they are not essential to the argument; feel free to skip them.  I found the explanation of how the deficit has been fudged to conceal the huge future liabilities of the U.S. government fascinating. A "balanced" budget can conceal big liabilities.  Did you know that Dwight Eisenhower was the most profligate President of all time?  Read the book and find out why!  Depending on which historian you consult, I was born in either the last year or so of the Baby Boom or the first year of the Baby Bust.  Either way, according to the authors' calculations I am going to end up paying more in taxes to support Social Security and Medicare than I can ever hope to receive in benefits.  My eight-year-old son, of course, is in an even worse position.  I liked the book's characterization of today's children as being taxed without representation.  Amen!     As far as Social Security, the authors' proposals are the most realistic I have seen.  They certainly deserve serious consideration.  I am somewhat more skeptical of Kotlikoff's and Burns' Medicare reform ideas.  There have been dozens of attempts to rein in Medicare costs, but none have made any difference.  The problem is that decades of insulating people from the real cost of medical care has put their expectations completely out of line with fiscal reality.  My personal opinion is that we will have to abolish Medicare altogether, at least temporarily, so that people will be able to understand what high-tech medicine really costs when they have to pay for it themselves.  This lesson might not be as bad as it sounds.  Keep in mind that there are countries that spend enormously less than we do on health care, and yet have health nearly as good as ours, or in some cases better.  Having someone there to hold your hand when you are sick has a surprisingly good cost-benefit ratio compared to conventional American high tech medicine.    I differ with the authors on a few things.  The authors mention the World War II Greatest Generation in a way that seems to suggest that it is the Baby Boomers who are to blame for our present fiscal problems. This is true in the sense that it's the demographic bulge of the Boomers that is causing many of our problems.  But who is responsible for the Boomers?  The World War II generation, that's who.  The WW II veterans came back from the war with the idea that American know-how could do anything, that prosperity would go on forever, and that they could invite as many new people to this party as they wanted.  Well they were wrong, but they're still voting benefits for themselves, and they have apparently long since forgotten the Depression Era lessons they learned about debt being a bad thing. Today they are the most pampered seniors of all time, with people like me paying for it all.  In my opinion, the Social Security/Medicare systems have created an aristocratic leisure class in America.  The Greatest Generation?  I would suggest that today's seniors start wising up.  Otherwise, they may be remembered as the Worst Generation.    The authors suggest exercising and taking other steps to preserve one's health as a good way to prepare for the coming fiscal crisis.  I think it's important to add here that Americans' lack of exercise and poor eating habits are not only personal failings.  They are the natural result of designing our cities and towns around cars, making it difficult to walk anywhere, and subsidizing agricultural production.  For a start on the subject of urban design, see Shoup's book "The High Cost of Free Parking" and Kunstler's "The Geography of Nowhere."    Kotlikoff and Burns are careful to make the most generous assumptions possible about future economic growth and government revenue.  I think their projections are way too optimistic.  For one thing, they ignore the fact that much of today's economic growth is illusionary.  The most common way of measuring economic growth, GDP, is a measure so inaccurate as to be completely misleading.  It takes no account of the effects of population growth, exhaustion of resources, or decline in the quality of life.  More accurate measures of economic growth, such as the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare and the Genuine Progress Indicator, show that there has been little or no real economic growth since the 1970s.  The passage of Hubbert's oil peak, global warming, and the numerous other environmental problems of today's world are going to have an even more serious negative impact in the future.  For more on this, see Kunstler's book "The Long Emergency," or Daly's "Beyond Growth."    The authors are skeptical that our government will be able to pull itself together and solve its fiscal problems without resorting to printing money.  I hope they're wrong, but I have to agree with them here.    The authors don't mention this, but there's plenty of research showing that wealthier people are not happier.  If we focused our efforts on improving America's quality of life instead of piling up more money, we could be a lot happier even with less.  The coming crisis doesn't have to mean misery; we have a choice.    "The Coming Generational Storm" is highly recommended for anyone with an interest in economics, public policy, or in making sure our country has a livable future 
 This book needs to be back on College Philosophy and Religion reading lists! Never before have I read such a clear and obvious explanation of the religious mind. Wonderful translation and editing work by George Eliot makes this a revolutionary work of religious philosophy. I'm a wife, mother, English Literature graduate and a spiritual seeker whose life was changed by reading Feuerbach's analysis of God as our subjective projection as Other. Please don't let your questing mind miss this one 
 This is a short book that can be read in a day or two. It is very well written with an interesting setting and plot line. You can see, hear and smell the authors description of Hong Kong, and the references to Viet Nam during the war are very haunting. This book would make a good gift. 
 Menace II Society was the debut film from the directing duo of the Hughes brothers, released in 1993 at the height of popularity of "hood movies".  As most other reviewers have stated the film is an extemely powerful look at growing up in L.A in the early 90's.  The movie grabs your attention straight away with the robbery of the liquor store and the controversial shooting of the Korean owners, and the pace never lets up throughout.  Caine (Tyrin Turner) is basically a bystander in the opening scene as O-Dog (Larenz Tate) goes on a rampage, and this continues throughout the film, Caine is a good person but very much a victim of his circumstances, whereas O-Dog just "doesn't give a f**k".  Without going into plot details the events in the film all conspire against Caine and it all catches up with him in the inevitable ending.  There are also good performances from Jada Pinkett and MC Eiht and a small role at the start from Samuel L Jackson as Caine's father.  While the film is very powerful and a sad and realistic take on ghetto life, it is not without it's faults, the main one being the lack of depth of some of the characters.  They never really explain Caine's relationship with Parnell, though he regularly refers to him as "like a dad" throughout the film.  Also several of the other characters are hard to sympathise with as their background is never really explained (something I felt was done better in Boyz N The Hood),and I find it hard to believe Parnell would be cool with Caine's relationship with his girl.  Despite these minor faults the film is still great though and the ending in particular was tragic and inevitable.  One of the better hood movies of the early 90's, if your into them you should definetely check this out 
 "The Malay Archipelago" is Wallace's most celebrated book.  It went through fifteen editions during his own life alone, and has been translated into every major language (and a number of minor ones).  It is clearly one of the greatest scientific travel books ever written, both for its well-constructed survey description of the region in question, and for its scientific value to the professional naturalist.  Wallace spent eight years in Indonesia as a natural history collector; during this period he collected an incredible 125,000 specimens, carried out the first important field studies on the orangutan and paradise birds, clarified the ethnology of the region, discovered the faunal discontinuity known now as 'Wallace's Line,' was one of the first Europeans to take up residence for an extended period on the island of New Guinea, founded the modern approach to biogeographical analysis, and last but not least arrived upon the theory of natural selection.  Today's casual reader will be troubled a little here and there by lists of Latin names of plants and animals, but this is a minor distraction from the telling of one of history's greatest feats of natural history investigation 
 Now in an updated and expanded second edition, Business Protocol continues to be an invaluable compendium of "user friendly" information for entrepreneurs and business managers in the protocols of the workplace. The corporate manager will receive gift-giving guidelines; communication (email, fax, cell phones, beepers, voice mail) etiquette standards; business meal and entertaining guidelines; the do's and don'ts of office friendships and romances; ethical conduct standards, holiday officer party norms; and much, much more. Business Protocol is "must" reading for anyone wanting to master those social skills that can help make their career or company successful in today's highly competitive marketplace 
 These are amazing glasses--they dramatically increase the experience of a fine scotch. While I imagine they would work for any aromatic spirit, they seem very well suited to scotch.  I prefer Islay scotches, which have an aggressive nose, and these glasses really improve the experience by concentrating the bouquet. The glasses are a delightful heavy crystal, and a pleasure to hold as well as drink from 
 Flapper is a wonderfully interesting book to read, from the start you are interested in the complex wild women portrayed. Zeitz doesn't simply stop with an interesting story however, he uses primary sources to explain how the movement rose out of the times and the public reaction to it. He also explains how flappers were often thought to be frivalous (okay so maybe a bit frivalous) misguided youths who betrayed their mother's feminism, though by living a lifestyle they chose and enjoyed they were actually representing feminism by their freedoms. Highly reccomended 
 "The Bee Tree" is another of Patricia Polacco's superb explorations of intergenerational friendship, and the significance of culture and tradition.  Her expressive, folksy, slightly loopy style are all her own, and she has long been one of my favorite illustrators. Here, the warm, homey pictures just draw you into the story, and suffuse it with the familiarity of a family heirloom.  That's part of the magic here:  Polacco's stories and colors are so vivid and personal that they seem like par t of your own history, when really she is merely honoring everyone's personal history in general.   The colors are vibrant and soft at the same time, the narration has action and unique characterizations, and the obliquely offered message is even more powerful for it's brevity.  Very definitely recommended, and I encourage you to discover more of her work 
 A fascinating and in-depth look at one of the most tightly knit clans history has ever known.  A great read 
 You won't be disappointed with this book. It really covers the territory--everything from qualifying tips to government programs to seller financing to saving big dollars. Before I read this book I didn't know a an ARM from a leg. Now I can talk mortgage talk with any lender and not feel like I'm prime meat for the wolves. Really gives  the lowdown on all types of financing alternatives and how not to get caught by the fine print. Thoroughly shows how to pay off your loan faster and save tens of thousands of dollars. Nuff said. This knowledge will pay back a thousand times the cost of the book 
    It's a genuine pleasure to visit the town of Mayberry again and again. It's worth it to collect these dvd seasons. Overall they are nicely done. Quality is good considering how old the show is.    It's amazing how people are so furious over the absence of laugh tracks (a.k.a. canned laughter) on some episodes. It's not a big deal at all. You only miss it because you're so used to it being added to shows in post-production. Why would you need to be told when to laugh at something? I know what's funny, and do not need a cue. And the recorded laughter gets so repeptitious, there are certain ones they use over and over: like the one where the lady goes "aaaw", when the gag doesn't call for a huge laugh but a little chuckle at something cute. (Just like the "Uh, oh" lady on the I Love Lucy laugh tracks when something wacky is about to happen.) It's a recording, nothing more. Sometimes there are funny moments that the studio didn't even add fake laughter to. It can get fairly subjective. We laugh at hilarious programs like Malcolm in the Middle, Arrested Development, and The Simpsons; and they all have no canned laughter.    Anyway, I love this show and am really grateful that it's available on dvd. It's still one of the funniest and warmest TV programs. 
 The book is very informative. The only suggestions would be in the layout. It was a little cumbersome in reviewing 
 I've been a fan of Rodgers and Hammerstein for years, but Oklahoma was far from my favorite R&H show. The fifties Hollywood version always dissapointed me, I always thought the characters were so cardboard and one dimensional and the story so trite. Then one night I caught the second act of the London Stage Revival during a PBS pledge drive and had to get this. This is the reason I love musicals. This version enchanted me. The story was ACTED and acted so well. The dancing was rousing, robust and masculine. I haven't seen anything to top Seven Brides for Seven Brothers until now. I defy anyone to declare that the dancing in The Farmer and the Cowhand is sissified or to be able to sit still watching it. All the performers are wonderful, but Skyler Hensly is the quintesential Jud and  Hugh Jackman is the essential Curly. He may not sing as well as Gordon McCrae but he makes up for it in making Curly a real character. Run and get this version!!! 
 I LOVED this book! I read it before I lived in New Orleans, and I still think of it now that I live here, whenever I pass the area that was once Storyville. A very fascinating period of time. I recommend E.J Bellocq's photos to take a look at these ladies lives at that time 
 Amir Aczel spent his childhood on the Mediterranean Sea--literally--sailing around in and sometimes steering a passenger ship that was captained by his father. This romantic personal history makes Aczel particularly suited to tell the story of the compass, which so improved navigation in the late thirteenth century that it sparked a commercial revolution and made possible the Age of Exploration that was to follow.   In his highly readable narrative Aczel provides a brief history of navigation centered on the compass--from navigation by stars and sounding lines to the naval supremacy of the Venetians in the 14th and 15th centuries to the masterful sailing of the great explorers--da Gama, Magellan--who opened up the world in the 15th and 16th centuries. We learn, too, about the early invention of the compass in China, where it was evidently not used at sea, and of its perfection as a naval instrument in the Italian city of Amalfi.   The Riddle of the Compass is at its best when Aczel discusses the actual "riddle" to which the title of the book refers: the question of the historicity of a certain Flavio Gioia, whom the people of Amalfi credit with having invented the mariner's compass in 1302. Most interestingly, the question of this Gioia's existence involves the correct interpretation of a single Latin phrase, a reference to the invention of the compass in an early 16th century commentary on the poetry of Lucrezio Caro.   Readers of Dava Sobel's popular book Longitude, which tells the story of the invention of the naval chronometer, will enjoy Amir Aczel's equally readable history of the compass.

 When the First World War ended in 1918, Evelyn Waugh was fifteen years old. Over the next decade, he saw a continuation of the wrenching that England had suffered first on a material level, then on a moral and social one. In DECLINE AND FALL, Waugh expresses his dismay that the psychic underpinning that had bolstered England for the fighting proved incapable to lead it in the years that led to the Great Depression. Everywhere Waugh looked, he saw a gradual disintegration of the English social fabric, and for him, this fraying of that fabric allowed him to use his new found sense of biting satire that could lash out in all directions.   DECLINE AND FALL (1926) was Waugh's first novel. His protagonist Paul Pennyfeather is the contemporary English Everyman, a basically decent sort of chap who seeks to do the right thing, but finds out that all too often that he is the only one interested in doing that. Pennyfeather's approach to life is a passive one. When dire events happen, he tries harder to deflect their severity than to eradicate them altogether. The opening chapter sets the tone for his inability to confront dire evil with purposeful resolve. He is a student at Scone University who is subject to a mean trick by a group of consciousless upperclass cads, the result of which is that he is expelled for moral turpitude. Rather than fight to stay in school he meekly accepts his fate. From this point on, the novel descends into a series of events whose reverberations and ripples drag him ever more deeply into the muck and slime of existential disarray. He finds a job teaching vicious urchins at a tenth rate school, where he predictably encounters both students and teachers whose only purpose is to bedevil him. Eventually, he meets a woman who promises to be the Great Love of his life.  She unwittingly involves him a white slavery deal that results in his imprisonment. By the time the novel ends, Pennyfeather has gone in a big circle. He returns to Scone University in a disguise (he needs one since he escaped from prison), but this disguise is external only. Inwardly, he is the same passive but good hearted naive youth that he was in the beginning.  DECLINE AND FALL proved to be the first in a series of novels that allowed Waugh to explore the bitter angst that bubbled beneath the surface in an English middle class society that increasingly came to see itself as having lost its moral compass in an age that prized breaking the rules over following them. As with all good writers, Waugh depicts a society that draws the reader inwardly, all the while urging that reader to judge the worth of that society as viewed through the bitterly satiric lens of a man who wants his reading public to feel the same sense of outrage that he does. In DECLINE AND FALL, Waugh succeeds admirably 
 We watch one episode each evening and dread the day we complete the series.We have seasons one and two and will probably buy season four. They are wonderful stories and promote strong family values 
 Two years ago I saw Rosalene Glickman being interviewed about Optimal Thinking on national TV and was struck by her warmth and intellectual clarity. I bought the book the next day,  read it from cover to cover, and hired her to conduct optimal thinking seminars for my company. The growth in my company has been remarkable.  Pre-optimization with optimal thinking, we were struggling with productivity, trust and motivation issues.  As an optimal thinking company, we have seen an outstanding increase in productivity and employee and customer satisfaction.  I strongly recommend this book for business and personal optimization 
 This is an excellent selection of original and heart warming songs.  You will be spiritually blessed listening to these. The artists are absolutely superb!  Highly recommended 
 I'm a Title 1 teacher in Oregon, and I work with the types of readers that Kylene Beers talks about in her book "When Kids Can't Read: What Teachers Can Do". I found her book to be loaded with practical, "use in your classroom the next day" ideas that are easy to implement.  Now, my school is an elementary school, and initially I avoided this book due to the "Guide for Teachers 6-12" label on it. Boy, was I wrong. While the focus of her book is for middle and high school teachers, most of her techniques are excellent techniques for the younger learners as well, especially the fifth grade students that I'm working with. She has taken many of the concepts we use in elementary school and upgraded them for older kids; but good teaching is good teaching, no matter what you are trying to do.   This book is so practical, on the inside front cover, you are given a simple chart that list reading problems that kids have, and the chapter that you can immediately turn to in order to get ideas! It can't get any friendlier than that.  However, I also suggest a more thorough read through of this content. Beers talks throughout the book of a student named George that she taught early in her career, before she knew much about teaching.  Sprinkled through the text, before and after each chapter, write writes lovingly to George about how she failed him time and time again, in direct relation to the content of the chapter. As a teacher, looking back on my own career, I can totally relate to that. If I knew then what I know now... the letters become Beers "mea culpa", and they are a beautiful addition to the text.  I highly recommend this book for ANY teacher struggling to teach struggling readers reading. It's practical, easy to use, and loaded with great ideas. 
 If you've ever fell in love with a movie and love reading "screenplays" you will love this book. It contains some of the best movie plays ever! Such as "It Happened one Night" with  Gable, "The Women" which had a all women cast with Joan Crawford,  "My Man Godfrey" with Carole Lomard and William Powell, also  "Here comes Mr. Jordan", "Rebecca", "Wuthering  Heights", "The Grapes of Wrath", "Make way for  Tomorrow", "How Green was my Valley", "Little  Caesar", "Fury", "Mr. Smith goes to Washington",  "The Life of Emile Zola", "Juarez", "Mrs.  Miniver", "This Land is Mine", "The Good Earth",  "All that money can buy", "Stagecoach", "Yellow  Jack", "The Fight for Life". Each play is in movie form  giving you the cast of players and who made it (MGM etc.). It's a really  fun book 
 For the people saying that this book is dense, impenetrable, hard to understand, etc., I would suggest simply going a little slower and, if possible, studying other works by Foucault in order to get used to his style. Among Foucault's books, I think this is probably the "easiest" to read in that the motives of its writing are clear, the themes are laid out for you in black and white, and the documented evidence/archival history that he returns to time and time again is at least documented and built on solidly. Foucault had a way with seeing history in new ways, this book is a beautiful demonstration of that, it uncovers and unveils currents at work within history other than the "accepted" or "offered" ones, one of his favorite projects, and as such...I think it's essential. As with his other books, though, be prepared for bold, grand statements and stylistic flourishes that are not always backed up with demonstrated evidence, but...he knew that part of writing was rhetoric. He states his case, and does so with amazing eloquence...this is a very powerful book. 
 Political scandals, judicial controversies and an extortion plan that will make three disgraced former judges very rich and powerful men make up this fast-paced thriller.   The Brethren have waited for just the right time--the right moment. And that moment has come. While the country is distracted by a presidential election with its own ulterior motives, the three judges have targeted their next victim.  I found this novel to be very entertaining and pure Grisham at his best. His characters are multi-dimensional, human and evil, and exploit the adage of "how far are you willing to go to get what you want?'  Still, my favorites remain The Client and The Pelican Brief.  Overall, John Grisham packs a punch and hits his target every time. Kudos!  ~Cheryl Kaye Tardif,  Author of Whale Song (978-1-897339-02-2) January 2007 Kunati Books www.kunati.com or www.cherylktardif.com  
 I have seen 2 versions of Anna and the King of Siam and I have not been impressed with either actor who has played the king.  To me Rex Harrison will always be known as Professor Henry Higgins and the original Dr. Doolittle.  The actor who played the King of Siam opposite Jodie Foster didn't have the same arrogance that Yul Brynner did.  Yul Brynner is the king 
 BUY THIS BOOK!! They hardly ever make them like this anymore! Just the type of book you remember from your childhood. Beautiful cover, layout, and illustrations. The poem is lyrical and mysterious, appropriate for all ages. A small jewel 
 I have read most of Crichton's books. I obviously got sucked into his books with Jurassic Park, Congo, and Sphere. I have continued to read his books through Prey and State of Fear. Crichton's writing has evolved from a lot of science woven into an action story to overwhelmingly science heavy with a good story underneath that.  Jurassic Park is an entertaining, action filled book that has quite a bit of science and mathematics that enhance the storyline and the characters. Jurassic Park is one book that I look back into my childhood with the fondest of memories and it truly captured my imagination. I wish that everyone could have the same reading experience that I had with Jurassic Park 
 Ive read this book front to back; I love facts. It's a tad nerdy, but if you like to know things that are obscure that make great for awkward silence or everyday conversation starters, this book is for you 
 The book, "Tuck Everlasting" by Natalie Babbitt was a stunning fantasy novel. The main them was the circle of life.  The book was about a family that will never die. There was a girl named Winnie who had to decide if she was going to take the water that would make her live forever or die a natural death.  I liked when Mae hite "the man in the yellow suit" in the back of the head.  I did not like when Mae went to jail. My favorite quote in the book is, "Do not be afraid of death be afraid of the unlived life

 Evelyn Waugh wrote very funny, sophisticated novels about the British upper and bohemian classes.  His short novel Helena is set in the late Roman empire, long before those categories existed, at least as we know them.  It is about the mother of Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor, and her search for the True Cross in fourth century Palestine, after a life of imperial politics that took her from one end of the known world to the other.  She was not active in politics, but born and married into it, being the daughter of a British Celtic chief (whom Waugh names Cole)and the wife of Chlorus, a Roman aristocrat and soldier who was the father of the future emperor.  The first two-thirds of the book is a beautifully written fictional account of her life at the top, and we discover that after all there was an upper class with bohemian hangers-on not unlike Britain's in the last century.  Waugh creates a completely convincing imperial court that is treacherous and sophisticated, and a very convincing saint who discovers her purpose in life in it.  The supporting figures in the novel--a tutor; an architect; a humble, over-worked bishop; a pair of coniving witches--are among the best things in the book 
 Even though this book is targeted for young/teen readers, it is an excellent adventure story for anyone to enjoy. While it's not my favorite book, it is one of the best adventure stories I've ever read. If you crave adventure, & want to enjoy a great story, don't let the fact that this is a "youth reader" type book dissuade you from reading this one; its a grand adventure 
 Evita is the movie version of the popular Broadway musical of the same title.  It tells the true story of Eva Duarte Peron, the wife of famous President of Argentina Juan Peron.  The story starts when Eva is 15, and ends when she tragically dies of cancer at the age of 33.  The story stars super-stars Madonna, who plays Eva, and Antonio Banderas, who narrates the story as a character named Che.  Jonathan Pyrce plays Eva's husband, Juan Peron.    This movie is very moving and will make you cry and laugh.  Most of it is singing, and the songs they sing are catchy and fun to sing along with.  Madonna is a singer and a very good actor, while Antonio Banderas has proved his acting already, but now surprises us with his singing voice.    This movie is an excellent movie.  It is beautifully shot and never got the recognition it deserves.  This is a movie you will not soon forget 
 This book HAD to be written for my daughter & me!!  My daughter had started reading it & was not even past the 2nd chapter when she was yelling, "MOM!! YOU JUST HAVE TO READ THIS!!" Ohmigod, It is DEAD ON our relationship. Unlike some books that before you finished it, would have you seeking professional help, this makes me feel WONDERFUL that we are obviously not the only ones with all these same feelings and interactions. How comforting in itself! I absolutely love this book so far & am looking forward to reading the rest of it. HIGHLY recommended :) Thanks for writing such a good one.  Beverly (& Jennifer) Armstron 
 not having yet read more than a few pages of mr. graeber's work, i can already wholeheartedly agree with him when he says it is the only readable book on the subject 
 EW&F is one of the best groups of all time there style and music is way ahead of its time. The vocal sounds of Maurice and Phillip who can sing better than Phillip Baily the ranges of his voice is extremely great. I have always loved this group and will always be there biggest fan. A group like them will last for all times keep the music coming. I love all there music and my favorite is That's the way of the world songs with meaning and substance. 
   ETC is one of my favorite artists of all time. This collection of his hits (except a few including the one he did on soul train! (the african american R and B music show....He is the only country star I'm aware of who ever appeared on the show)is the best there is for a man of his calibur.   In the 1980's when country was still trying to loose it's urban cowboy persona it gained due to the 1980 movie (as well as some other not so highly thought of movies like "any which way you can"), ETC came out of Alabama (where he was a regional star but originally is from Ohio) onto the national scene using instruments (such as saxophone) and arrainging not heard on country radio at the time. He was young country and classic at the same time. My favorites are actually his mid to late 1980s songs such as "Honor bound","Love out loud","that was a close one", and my personal favorite "What I'd Say"...These songs sound as modern as any song on the radio today, even though they were cut 20 years ago (and are played on many country stations in the south today as newer music instead of as classics)  This In my opinion would be on my top 5 cd list if stranded on a desert island... It's a albumn you won't get tired of and is timeless 
 If you read one book, read this. If you are on a spiritual quest, this book will set you on the right path. Tolstoy is brilliant, full stop. As a Russian Orthodox person who is disillusioned with the Church and the state of Christianity, I found this book clarifying and life changing. If it was good enough for Ghandi, it's good enough for me! This book contains the essence of true Christianity and comes from a man who spent his life agonizing over religion and the meaning of life. Brilliant 
 For me Ice-T is one of the best rappers ever and I've spent long hours listening to his hardcore gangster rap.  Kind of odd for a middle-aged white guy but what can I say?  His in your face, pro-freedom of speech attitude is one that I hold myself.  He is one of the founding fathers of gangster rap and one of its most innovative lyricists.  The heavy metal band Body Count allows Ice-T to really roar with energy and creative expression.   I've seen Body Count live 4 times.  With the release of their first two albums they played shows at Hammer Jacks in Baltimore, MD and a small venue called the 9-11 club in Washington, DC.  I friend and I made both shows each time.  Ice-T and Body Count put on a tremendous performance.  Born Dead follows up the controversial Body Count debut with a very solid and entertaining CD.  This CD contains one of the most outstanding remakes of Jimmy Hendrix's song Hey Joe I have ever heard.  It's fabulous.  The hard driving Body M/F Count is such a short tune it's hard to call it a song but it gets my adrenaline pumping every time I hear it.    This is another 4 star effort by Body Count and all the songs are entertaining.  Body M/F Count * Necessary Evil * Hey Joe **  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Ratings:  CDs are rated simply by how many good songs are on the album.  Great songs get two stars, and good songs get one star.  Songs that get no stars are those that I might like but not enough to give it a star  or ones I find boring or actively dislike.  CDs are not penalized for songs that I don't like because they are easy enough to skip over.  There is no maximum number of stars a CD can get, but of course the more stars it gets, the better the CD.  As with all reviews, these are my subjective opinions on the album.   
 ...and why we want so much..In my opinion, society doesn't want it's members to ever feel like everything is ever good enough or you  are ever perfect already enough without all this stuff. I trip because our world,  our universe is already miraculously designed to be perfect and just to  witness some of the things and people in it should have us well pleased,  but that ain't the case. My mom used to say "God created the heavens  and the earth and everything in them and WE have the nerve to be  dissatisfied with the heavens and the earth and everything in them..."  As an example, look how much money is spent on advertisements and  commercials during "events" like the Super Bowl or the  Oscars...the money spent on a 15 second spot gets up to the millions. This  sensory bombardment is one of the ways this  insecurity creeps in--And, for  why? The American Dream? To make sure everybody has the opportunity to stay  ahead of the game? To flesh out some Madison Ave. photocopy? The questions  are--are you really less of a person without this jazz? And why is it such  an empty feeling even after we've gotten all we ever imagined  wanting?--Most people I know, however, disguise this emptiness with a  competitive nature thing akin to the ol' "Nah, nah, na-nah! I've got a  new bike and you don't" stance of the neighborhood kids...are we that  spoiled? And what happens when that emptiness returns after we can't find  anyone to compete with? Do we look within or do we look for new  competitors...? Don't get me wrong, I would be the wrong person to endorse  unproductive activity. I would suggest some kind of healing activity....  Kushner's book is about this 'looking within'. He uses the book of  Ecclesiastes to help us thru the 'vanities of vanities', our human  restlessness, our desires and our sufferings. I agree with what  the  several other reviwers have stated. It is a book everyone should read, if  only to witness a well elucidated interpretation of Ecclesiastes 
 Versatile master recipes, well written, meticulously researched -- all the things that you would expect of a Julia Child cookbook. As several reviewers have said, if you only buy one cookbook, make it this one. It teaches a wide variety of techniques through recipes that can carry you through a lifetime. I've had a copy of this book for almost 20 years and I refer to it constantly. I'm on my second copy; my first was signed by the late author, so I put that splattered copy away for posterity. I have given this to all of my girlfiends when they've gotten married; invariably, it ends up being the book the they use most, too. I own about 400 cookbooks, but this is one of few that stays out on my kitchen counter bookshelf. 
 Dr. Peter D'Adamo has it all right. All of his books will make you physically better. His books have changed my eating habits and health 
 Having just reread Even Cowgirls Get the Blues after about 25 years, I agree with some of its fans and detractors that the narrative does get mired in some pedantic and pondersome navel gazing. Even so, this is still the classic countercultural novel of the 1970s with a rich fabric of comical characters and zany plot twists. The opening dedication to the amoeba lured me in again. Two giant thumbs way up! To quote the story's hermit sage: "Ha ha ho ho and hee hee! 
 Very helpful.  Since the translation isn't right there, it's great for forcing the student to really translate the Greek on their own 
 It's as if Peter Dunne were telling you this book by flashlight, at your elbow on a very dark night, whispering a steady stream of the most necessary, seldom-mentioned cautions, directions, encouragements, as he accompanies you through that dangerous tanglewood he knows so well, the writing of a screenplay.  Your heart grows quiet as you go along together, dark shadows begin to assume familiar shapes and you know you can do what he asks 
 "Clearing your Clutter"  as Meryl Starr so wonderfully says, is a great step by step method that enables a person to take the right approach without getting overwelmed by the task in sight. My husband and I decided to make our lives more organized so things would run a little more smoothly in our home. The book allows you to go to a chapter and empower you with great ideas and solutions. By having chapters at your fingertips this is making our task alot easier. I would highly recomend buying this well thought out and easy to read book 
 His unique experience an an SF Operator and his real world experiences and Lessons Learned but Ignored by the Current crop of Managers (Not Leaders) makes this a great read. Accurate, Factual and without Bias, this is a must read for anyone who wonders why the Global War on Terrorism is stumbling 
 This is one of the most practical guides to therapies and treatments for FAS.  There are references for physical therapies, sensory therapies and food allergies.  Jodee and her daughter have tried to collect all their experiences to make them available to other families so that they do not hve to "reinvent the wheel".  The companion book, *All That I Can Be* by Liz Kulp is perfect for teenagers who want to know what FAS is all about 
 This CD is the perfect background for having friends over.  Healthy beats layed over mellow music for the most part.  It sounds like a late night drive down a dark highway 
 A superb analysis of the cultural impact of the muscular female body.  Heywood helps us understand that when a woman lifts weights, she does far more than strengthen herself physically and psychologically.  She strengthens women's place in society and weakens the old patriarchal notions of female frailty and passivity.  Heywood also helps us realize that the common practice of oversexualizing female athletes -- which is practically the norm in the bodybuilding industry -- diminishes the woman's power and serves to bring the potentially revolutionary female athlete back into hegemonic standards of feminity.  Being a female powerlifter myself, I appreciate the fact that, unlike so many feminist theorists, Leslie Heywood derives many of her arguments from personal experience.  Bodymakers is a must-read for any female athlete, or for anyone interested in women's studies or the sociology of sports 
        The book "Weapons of Mass Deception, the Uses of Propaganda in Bush's War on Iraq," written by Sheldon Rampton and John Stauber generally deals with the United States' current conflict in Iraq.  However, it does not deal with the strategic side of the conflict itself but rather the steps taken to get there.  This text focuses primarily on the supposed false information that President Bush and his administration provided the American public in order to gain their support.  Rampton and Stauber deal with the psychological aspects that come with preparing a nations people for war.   	Rampton and Stauber set out to make a contribution to their field by expressing their points of view in this particular text.   The fundamental point that both authors set out to make is that the war in Iraq is a battle that is being fought unnecessarily, based on false pretenses. President Bush blatantly lied to a nation in order to better serve his own needs while asking thousands of men and women to give their lives in the process.  Both authors make it their business to make clear the fraudulent steps that President Bush and his administration took in an effort to coerce a nation into believing that going to war with Iraq was the right thing to do.  Furthermore, it is Rampton and Stauber's goal that after reading their work, American citizens will analyze carefully and be more skeptical of the different types of media that they come into contact with. 	There are several areas covered in this text regarding the war in Iraq and the deceptive measures employed by President Bush while doing so.  In fact, Rampton and Stauber claim that Bush was involved with the invasion of Iraq even before he was elected into office.   Bush's key officials advocated the invasion all along but opted to wait until September 2002 to inform the public, through what the White House expressed as a product launch.  This is simply the Bush administrations attempt at selling the war in Iraq to the American public through a well thought out public relations operation.  The White House representatives apparently used propaganda along the lines of misinformation and constant replication in order to create the false notion that Iraq was behind the September 11th terrorist attacks on the United States.  Additionally, there were allegedly forged documents which fabricate the claim that Iraq possessed vast supplies of destructive weapons.  Apparently, Bush's public relations firm facilitated an opposition group known as the Iraqi National Congress, which contributed largely to the decision to go to war.  While these lies were taking place, the American news media was entirely occupied with the propaganda being provided and continuously kept repeating White House communications.   	"Weapons of Mass Deception, the Uses of Propaganda in Bush's War on Iraq" is put together by authors Sheldon Rampton and John Stauber.  Both men work for the Center for Media and Democracy; this is a non-profit association that Stauber himself founded in 1993 in an effort to observe and expose deceptive public relations campaigns and other assorted propaganda distributed by corporations and governments.  John Stauber is a longtime activist who has worked in the field of public interest, consumer, family farm, environmental and community organizations at the local, state, and national levels.  Co-author Sheldon Rampton is a graduate of Princeton University and has worked as a newspaper reporter, activist, and author.  Rampton and Stauber are both clearly opposed to the work that the Bush administration has done while in office.  In fact, based on the work that they have done with this text as well as past work, both men appear to be against any type of governmental or public relations group that misinforms the public on any issue.  Rampton and Stauber present a strong argument throughout their book, supporting their points of view with documented facts.  In addition, both authors remain true to their feelings and points of view in an uncompromising fashion; perhaps this is the most concrete element to their text.  The only flaw, if any present in this book is that both men are partially biased because of their dislike for President Bush.  It is likely that a supporter of President Bush would not be so critical of the tactics he has used in recent years.   	This text seems to be quite useful and a positive addition to work in its field.  It offers readers and consumers an alternative source of information that is able to rival the media.  In addition, to it being an alternative source of information, it is written by well educated and experienced men who support their adamant views with concretely documented facts.  Therefore, this text is not merely two liberal men running their mouths about issues they are not well versed in, but a brilliantly put together political argument.  Lastly and perhaps most importantly, Rampton and Stauber attempt to relay an important message to the public; that they should never settle and accept information that the media and government give to them.  There is always the right to question the government and related associations when the public is being misinformed 
 It is a pleasure to read Orwell. I think that there are two major reasons for this. Stylistically he an exceptionally clear writer. His work has a quiet elegance. Secondly, he is a writer who says meaningful things. Whatever subject he writes about he writes about not only with knowledge but with real ' sense'.  In this third volume of his collected essays, jouralisms, and letters there are a number of outstanding longer pieces, including those on 'The English People' 'Notes on Nationalism' and 'Anti- Semitism' He is an excellent letter writer and I especially enjoyed his insights into literature. His remarks on Conrad and Koestler and European as opposed to British Literature are sensible and insightful. All through this work there are scattered gems of humane perception. 
 This book is set in the small Southern African country of Malawi, the country in which I spent the first 19 years of my life. This book is very dear to me because of its connection to my home. However, it is a good book in its own right. I can say that the language used in the book is authentic (galimoto is, in fact, Chichewa for car).  The illustrations are also accurate.  The book also has several plot elements which are great discussion points for parents or teachers. For instance, the main character has to make several deals with people to get the things he needs for his project. This provides a good lesson in compromise. The main character also shows planning by setting a goal and then following through the motions to reach his goal. Although the book is intended for smaller children, I think that it is a helpful book for older kids as well. I have read this story to my 7th graders, and it has prompted many discussions on other cultures. 
 Stunts, Blunts & Hip Hop (Chemistry Ltd./Mercury/Polygram 1992)  Diamond D, or Diamond, which was his official name (another artist own the rights for the name Diamond D), where trained by the old-school legend Jazzy Jay, first as a DJ, then as a producer. The Bronx' best kept secret had also learned to rap, and this soloalbum came as a little surprise on many.  As a producer (and D.I.T.C.-member) Diamond D already had the chance to work with names like Lord Finesse and Showbiz & AG, but after Stunts, Blunts & Hip Hop, new and bigger opportunities opened. He became an exceptional popular remixer during the 90's, with names like Brand Nubian, Ras Kass and Tha Alkoholiks knockin' on his door, and today he is looked upon as a legend up there with DJ Premier and Pete Rock.  Naturally it's the production that is this records strong side, with genius samples and a refreshing jazzy sound. You gotta search long, if you wanna find great breaks like these, I mean they call themselves "Diggin' In The Crates" for a reason.  Besides help from Showbiz, Jazzy Jay and Q-Tip, Diamond did most of the stuff here himself, both behind the boards and on the mic. When it comes to the rappin', he has an ultracomfortable voice and flow, and he is great at tellin' stories (Check out "Sally Got A One Track Mind", "I'm Outta Here" and "Red Light, Green Light".) The first single was the rough "Best Kept Secret", other favorites includes "Step To Me" and "F*** What U Heard" which uses a Grand Puba vocalsample on the hook. 23 songs might have been to much, but except the new jack swing contribution "Confused", everything here worked perfect. Stunts, Blunts & Hip Hop was an impressive solid debutalbum from an unique multitalent, and all fans of D.I.T.C. and New York-rap from the early 90's, seriously need to check out this. 67 minutes of pure hip-hop, without gimmicks. 
 Not only do these songs work beautifully in the (recommended)film, they all stand up as fine, dirty R&B and rockabilly tracks for your twisted listening pleasure. Your stereo will throb and pulsate to the beat, and so will the appropriate body parts. Buy the CD! Buy The DVD 
 Why the bad hype? Women need options, we need information & resources to make educated decisions for us as individuals. Suzanne Somers gives us information; well researched, well defined information, it does not mean you have to do everything her way; find what works for you as an individual. I for one want options when it comes to anything regarding my health, hormones, etc. I am greatful that Suzanne Somers writes these books and shares her knowledge and research! Controversy just stirs up interest, I think women should read this book and then discuss with your practitioner your feelings & concerns; perhaps not everyone wants to access bioidentical hormones, it's a choice....an option, isn't it wonderful we have that option & choice? By the way, I am a vegetarian and I will not start eating meat but I do not resent Ms. Somers comments; it's like anything in life it's information being shared some things may help you if you apply them and others are better left alone. Thanks Ms. Somers, well done....again!   
 What is a 'quotation'? It is something which someone has said which has been repeated so often so as to in effect become part of the collective consciousness. It is a 'saying' which has become 'immortal' at least for the foreseeable future.  The YBQ seems to understand however that the foreseeable future is not forever and so reduces the space it gives to pre- modern quotations and adds more from contemporary American life. It includes less matter than its ertswhile predecessor the 'Oxford Dictionary of Quotations' but provides more spice and story. It too uses the most modern of electronic means in hunting down the ' true source' of its quotations. It for instance will not rest content with attributing Henry Kissinger the well- known quotation  'Academic politics is so bitter, because the stakes are so low' but traces it back to a Columbia University political - scientist  Wallace S. Sayre who reportedly repeatedly said this in the early 1950's.  Editor Shapiro seems to take special interest in providing carefully researched attributions for the quotations.  All in all works like this are an unending source of 'dipping in' reading. Like the Talmudic sea there is no end to them and one can begin anywhere get lost in the middle and remain there for an unreasonable period of time.  There is no end to the next interesting thing which may come up anywhere. One of course will always find no matter how comprehensive a 'missed quotation' from an author one especially favors.  I would only say that with the rise of the 'Internet Culture' and with so many millions of people making their gems of wisdom available to the worldwide readership that perhaps a corollary to Warhol's famous five minutes of fame for everyone should be instituted in the next great quotation work. That one should be one in which each human being is given a chance to contribute their own favorite gem to the world.  A signature- sentence or sound- bite for each 'MySpace' sounder- off. In the meantime however the 'Yale Book of Quotations' is a tremendous treasure of memorable sayings which no doubt will be much mulled, and highly enjoyed by its readers.  
 My two year old granddaughter thinks Maisey is the best.  She has been fascinated by all the books and videos.  Quiet, kind, simply presented characters teach colors, letters, and friendship 
 I bought this book because of the wide variety of images shown and discussed, and also because of how well the sections covered typical topics.  While not a quick reference guide (like "Posing Techniques for Digital Portraits" by Jeff Smith), I enjoy owning this book because even flipping through the images prompts me to think about posing creatively while portraying my subject in the best way possible.  While the images are not directly referenced in the text that I noticed, that was ok with me -- I was not looking for a cookie cutter approach on "how to pose."  The table of contents is descriptive and allows you to easily find the section you are interested in.  In order to get the most from this book you will need some time to sit and read through the sections -- skimming probably won't allow you get a comprehensive understanding of the techniquest described in the text.  This book also reviews composition techniques (the golden mean)and discusses the camera angle in relation to the film plane (useful to remember when photographing large groups).  Both of these topics provided helpful diagrams to illustrate the concepts.  If you are looking for a book that gives examples of "good" and "bad" poses/shots, this one is not for you.  But, if you are interested in reading about the techniques and concepts behind posing, then you will probably enjoy this book for its creative images and in-depth discussion of posing techniques 
 While on the computer, in your car, at work or just want a tasty snack, Slim Jim is the perfect treat!  Not big enough to ruin an appetite for meals, it is just the right size to curb hunger...and tastes great!    The size of the Slim Jim in the 100 count box fits anywhere - pocket, purse, glove compartment...so you can have a snack anytime.  Enjoy 
 This collection is a lot of fun, spanning the ages from the 50's to modern pieces. My only criticism is that there are two singers who are represented twice on this cd. It's not that they aren't good songs, but weren't there other performers to represent? 
 Shortly before leaving for vacation, Jack and Annie remembered that they needed to go to the magic tree house to solve a mystery. Morgan said "your aventure is going to the Roman times you need to find this book or it will be lost forever""WOW! I always wanted to go to the Roman times this will be fun Annie" said Jack.  The magic tree house takes them to the seaside town of Pompeii during Roman times, which was 2,000 years ago.  Many Romans traveled to Pompeii for vacation. They built large houses called villas and planted groves of olive trees on the slopes of a nearby mountain called Mount Vesuvius.  As they walked into the town of Pompeii, they noticed there were no birds and the stream under the bridge was dried up.  Once in Pompeii, a soothsayer said "go home".  Jack and Annie walked by the town forum, public baths and the Temple of Jupiter while looking for the library.  When they get to the library, they start looking for the book "Vir Fortissinus in Mundo". After finding the book, Jack opened the door and noticed everything crashing down in front of them. The ground started to shake as Mount Vesuvius erupted into a deadly volcano. "That is what the soothsayer meant" said Jack.  Jack and Annie ran from the library and headed back to the tree house. As they ran, a great cloud of pumice, ash, and burning rock formed over the city. When it rained down on Pompeii,it coverd the town. They used pillows to cover their heads from the falling ash.  The tree house was in the olive grove on the side of the mountain. Jack and Annie were running towards the volcano while everyone else was running away from it. When they got to the dried-up stream, the brige. They were trapped in the pumice, when a big, strong man named Hercules saved them.  He pulled them from the pumice and took  them to the other side of the stream.  Jack and Annie made it to the magic tree house, which took them back home.  Morgan made them Master Librarians and they went on vacation with their family 
 The most lucid explanation of the basic ideas of Judaism I've ever read. Reccomended for the scholar and the layman. Be sure to read the ethical will to Dr. Ariel's children 
 Having studied French in HS and College, I needed to reveiw it and learn some more practical travel phrases before going to France.  I bought this about 2 weeks before leaving and read it now and again before the trip and on the plane.  It had a lot of good info and the review was helpful because it was geared to the way textbooks taught me in school.  However, I found it much more practical and informative than any textbook I'd read growing up, and the phrases I memorized really paved the way to a positive experience abroad.  
 I love Iyengar's original book, Light On Yoga.  It is truly the 'bible of modern yoga'.  Many poses are featured in that book.  However, one of my beefs about it was the lack of pictures of poses utilizing props.  Anyone who has ever taken an Iyengar Yoga class knows that props will play a big part in the class.    This book is an amazing guide to Iyengar yoga - including the use of props.  It is a big book with TONS of photos.  The pictures are clear as a bell and they are even clever enough to include different views of the pose so that you can learn what all parts of the body should be doing in the pose.  Iyengar yoga is very alignment based - postures are precise.  Through props, all of us can achieve the perfect alignment that Iyengar is a stickler for.    BKS Iyengar offers tips throughout the book - not just on the poses, but on other aspects of the yoga lifestyle - such as philosophy, diet and more.  What I really like are the sequences for different medical/physical conditions near the end of the book - this is REALLY handy!  With this book and his other book, Light on Yoga, you'll have everything that you need to begin practicing confidently and correctly.  
 This book contains a lot of useful information for the new teacher or the burned out teacher who needs a boost. It's useful in the sense that it tries to get teachers to stop taking negative beahvior personally (usually it's not about the teacher) and to use positive reinforcement as much as possible--always a good idea whenever you are trying to change behavior, be it animal or human! But I had to laugh out loud when the author suggests praising the consistently tardy student for being in class "most of the time." Give me a break!  
 Daringly forthright, this suspenseful story of blackmail (expertly performed by a great cast led by Dirk Bogarde) is a valuable time capsule of the pervasive homophobia that dominated all reaches of 1960s society.  There are great, timeless moments that remind the audience of simultaneously how far and how little we have progressed since then.  A 30 minute television interview from 1961 with Bogarde is also quite interesting, particularly for American audiences who may only be peripherally aware of his wonderful work on the stage, in film and as an author 
 A very interesteng read, If you are old enough to remember all the players 
 This album is fantastic! Mr. Wesley's Wudda Cudda Shudda is a true musical classic! If you like jazz, you'll dig this album. If you like funk, you'll dig this album. If you like a little hip-hop, you'll like this album. If you are a fan of music period, you must by this album. Now I find it interesting that "Funky Wesley", played for James Brown and Maceo Parker. You can really hear their style of music in Fred's music and lot of Fred's stlye in their music. Trust me, if Maceo Parker likes Fred's music, anybody should 
 Those four simple words are at the root of the Disney business philosophy, established by Walt himself and carried on by Michael Eisner.  I found this book to be both entertaining and informative.  The business principles outlined by Capodagli and Jackson seem like simple, common sense - but bear repeating numerous times until more businesses adopt them.  Principles like encouraging innovation (and even failure, since you learn how *not* to do something) ... building on the strengths of your employees (development plans instead of demeaning performance appraisals) ... all will make any business work better.  I found numerous ideas here that I will be applying in my workplace as well as to my personal life.  This is a must-read for any manager who wants to motivate his or her team to really excel -- and for any employee who wants to be his or her personal best 
 I first read this book aloud with my family as an adolescent about 30 years ago.  I read it with my own children, and now it is time to think about reading it with my grandchildren.  This book tells of the great adventure of life, lived with the eternal knowledge that--though mistakes and poor judgment will be made by all of us--they can all be made right with determination, responsibility, and faith.  This story of two boys facing overwhelming challenges together, and discovering that there are few problems that don't have at least one solution, and you're sure to find it if you just don't give up.  Exciting, encouraging, challenging, funny, and inspiring--all can be said about this book 
 Anything by Le Creuset is worth the price.  This skillet is just the right size for my stove top...and, it's only one I could find that is good for any stove type.  I highly recomend it, and any of their products for fabulous cooking result 
 I almost didn't pick it up because it is from the Luna imprint.  Their books have been real hit and miss for me.  I'm glad I got it because it turned out to be one of the nicest reading surprises I've had this year.  Book revolves around a young women who was due to hang for murder who has her sentence commuted so she can become the food taster for the Commander, the military ruler who overthrew her country's corrupt royal family and set up a utopian, highly socially regimented, dictatorship. She gets pulled into political intrigue on several layers and has to worry about the powerful family of the man she killed, her developing, illegal, magical power and her growing feelings for her boss the Commander's spymaster and assassin.  The book is written like a straight historical novel, not a  fantasy, and although there is magic in the book it is not integral to the plot.  That, and unique, almost socialist, culture that Snyder creates make Poison Study stand out from the huge mounds of blood and thunder, sword and sorcery, pseudo medieval, epic quest fantasy novels out there.  The texture of the book is more like a well done Romance novel than standard Fantasy or SF, and that may turn some people off which is too bad because it is an enjoyable story 
 Hadn't heard of Laura Pedersen until the Virginia Book Festival. She did a wonderful and hilarious presentation and so I read BEGINNER'S LUCK and LAST CALL.  They were very different novels, though both humorous, uplifting, and with enjoyable characters. The storylines were creative and engaging. The LAST CALL ending is a blockbuster -- won't give it away. Pedersen is young and writing a book a year -- the sequels to BEGINNER'S LUCK are coming out soon.  I rarely write in reviews but I think this author is bound to become a classic in women's fiction, of the feel-good variety (rather than doom and gloom), and will continue to be enjoyed by young and old readers for years to come.  I guess she will always be classified as an author of women's fiction and pitched to reading groups, but there are some great guys in the books -- Bernard in BEGINNER'S LUCK and Hayden in LAST CALL, so I think men would enjoy the stories as well but doubt they'll ever pick them up based on the wonderful but somewhat feminine covers. I especially like it that she gives older female characters brainy, sexy parts, and doesn't relegate them to the backseat of the family car.  Hollywood will no doubt be calling soon if they haven't already.  Looking forward to more 
 Rather than brekaing new ground with "Goldenstate" Bush sound like they've incorporated everything from "Sixteen Stone "Razorbalde Suitcase" and "The Science Of Things" into one album, its a genius.  The guitars have a new buzz to them in which Gavin Rossdale was very pleased with, in which laid to waste the stupid Nirvana comparisons.  TO bad no one noticed, it sold half million, all because "Atlantic records" never bothered to release more than two singles or even promote the album at all 
 If forced to it at knifepoint I would probably have to admit that Angela Hewitt's account of the second volume of Bach's 48 doesn't make quite the impact on me that the first did. All the same characteristics are here as before. Everything is 'right', and absolutely nothing should give the slightest problem to anyone who is prepared to accept the piano as an appropriate instrument for Bach. The very first prelude begins with a pedal-point in the bass, and on a modern grand it seems natural and right to me to use a certain amount of sustaining pedal. Elsewhere the pedal is used with tact and restraint, exactly as I had expected; and the part-playing is a model of clarity without exception, exactly as I had expected again. The level of tone that Hewitt uses is natural and unaffected, not played-down in any self-conscious way but with very careful discrimination in building up the volume, as she does to great effect in the fugues in E minor and A minor. As in the first set, she provides her own commentary in the liner, and as before it is nearly as good as the performances themselves. If a performing artist of this stature can write with such unpretentious clarity and helpfulness it may not be too much to hope that certain others will take the hint and learn how the thing can be done.   Where I felt this set was not absolutely the equal of its predecessor was in a certain sense of freshness and alertness. There's not a lot in it, and I'm perfectly open to the possibility that the lack is in the listener rather than in the performer or the recorded quality. She hits completely top form in the fugues in G, G minor and A flat just to take some instances that impressed me particularly, and in a number of the preludes she hints that the player has to be watchful not to let them sound dull -- a danger that nobody listening to her would even suspect, I'm quite sure. To some extent it may be a matter of the steely machine-tooled clarity in the trills and other ornaments that Gould got us used to. Others of the younger generation of Bach pianists are at some pains to replicate this, Hewitt less so, and of course it's arguable how important, even how desirable, this is in the first place.   The preludes in the second set of the 48 are on average longer than those in the first. If they weren't too long for Bach they are certainly not too long for me, and I'm completely behind Hewitt's decision to repeat both halves of the prelude in B flat. One particularly interesting point that Hewitt makes in her commentary is that Bach kept tinkering with these pieces, usually to make them longer, and at several points she tells us where there are variant readings of the score, and why she opts for the ones she does. One has a distinct impression that if Bach had lived longer a number of these masterpieces, seemingly incapable of improvement as we have them, would have been quite significantly different.   The recorded quality is unexceptionable and the piano tone is superb throughout. As in the first volume, a listener new to the works will find here the best and least idiosyncratic introduction to them that I know of. Other great interpreters have a different vision of the 48, but whether there is a better one anywhere I greatly doubt 
 Talk about rough adolescence.  Imagine if undead necro-liche and uber-mystic Russian mad Monk Grigori Rasputin had taken occultic things in hand, gotten bankrolled by Nazi Gold and backed by Nazi guns, and found a way to tear a portal open to Hell.  Your birthplace.   Mike Mignola (with writing by John Byrne) burst on the scene with "Seed of Destruction", the first in the chronciles of the orphan Demon named Anung Un Rama ("Beast of the Apocalypse"), christened by his BPRD (Bureau of Paranormal Research & Defense) adoptive 'Dad'---HELLBOY.  Hellboy was raised up from the bowels of Hell by a vile alliance forged by Mad Monk Rasputin and Hitler's Thule Society---but the plot to unleash the Minions of Hell on the Allies was foiled by a plucky squad of US troops, and Hellboy joined up as the BPRD's secret weapon in the war against the Forces of Tentacled Darkness everywhere.   So: Hellboy hooks up with mentor Trevor Bruttenholm, only to find the poor old boy rambling about a failed, fatal expedition to the Arctic with the doomed Cavendish boys, from the House of Elihu Cavendish, wealthy industrialist, doomed to distraction with the Occult, so much so that he would sacrifice his entire family, his patrimony, and his sinking Victorian house, to the plumbing of dark depths no man was meant to fathom.  And so one Reptilian turn leads to another, and Hellboy is drawn into the bowels of Cavendish Manor, along with fellow monstrous spelunker of the bizarre Abraham Sapien, a sentient, telepathic fish-man fond of rotten eggs and useful in the extreme, particularly in this outting. And, oh, a firestarter named Liz Sherman.  Frankly, I don't find the plot here all that interesting. It's very elementary, lots of nasty mutated frog-hemoths, Grigori Rasputin, opening up of Doors that were not meant to be opened, that sort of thing. Very basic.   But here, basic is good. First off, Mignola's chiaroscuro artwork is amazingly engrossing. It's intense. It's brutal. For all its minimalism, and it *is* minimalist, it manages to express a maximum degree, and arc, of emotion.   Now: it is also amazing beautiful, proving that the pulpiest of pulp fiction can be artistic. The art here, by Mignola, is gorgeous, making up for the starvation-diet writing, which is competent but scanty.  Now: "Seed of Destruction" is an origin story. To that end, it moves in fast, hits the beach rough, does its job, and leaves you wanting more. It does it with high style and good humor. Byrne has been critiqued for not having the roll and pitch and wave of the Cthulhu mythos, but folks---that's not the point here. Anyone reading "Frog" knows that Byrne has a crawling kingsnake notion of just exactly what creeps and crawls in this classic.  Buy it. Savor it. Dig deep into it. Conjure something up that will leave you terrified, digging under your sweaty bedsheets in the middle of the night. Enjoy.  JSG 
 I cannot believe that this material is not standard material for schools.  Coupled with "Good to Great," "Topgrading," and "The Toyota Way" you've got the ammo you need to be a killer leader.  Pro: -Reveals one of the great secrets how "true leaders" separate themselves from everyone else (based on numerous hours of first-hand corporate study) -Describes "fight and flight" and other responses and how to tame them -Details a near foolproof method/recipe for approaching others when stakes are high, topics are embarrassing, people disagree, etc. -There is a two-day class that I took with this book which is the only commercial class I recommend.  Find it and take it! -I have improved myself immensely, have successfully approached beligerant co-workers and to diffuse tense family clashes.  I've even been thanked for doing it!  Con: -I honestly can't think of any  Bottom line: this book is a must read for everyone.  Applies to everyday life, in and out of work.  I also got the CDs, which are good now and again during my commute 
 Marion Woodman and Robert Bly are both masterful story tellers and in their new book, "The Maiden King", they combine their talents to translate an important story.  Some critics have not truly read this story  for what it is.  This book uses a mythological tale because that is how  people were explained things long ago.  The resurection of this technique  of understanding only enhances the meaning and the importance of its  message.  It is evident that critics such as Ms. Lohrman may be afraid of  facing the ideas expressed by the two authors.  We will face these ideas at  one time or another in our lifetime.  The authors explain how men and women  have evolved and how they may live together now.  There are many  mythological references as well as highlights from other poets, authors and  anything else that has shaped our society.  In a day and age where our  culture is defined by "Must See TV" and the 'goings on' in the  White House, "The Maiden King" weaves a mythological soul-seeking  jouney to understand who we really are how we came to be that way 
 We loved this book so much, we named our two cats Olly and Ginny.  'Nuff said 
 In The Eternal Frontier, Tim Flannery starts his ecological history of North America with the major asteroid impact near the Yucatan 65 million years ago.  He writes of the catastrophe with great verve, and the book becomes quite a page-turner.  From there he moves forward through time to the present showing the changes in climate and habitat, and then how the advent of humans in North America impacted its ecology.  I grew up in Wisconsin, and I had no idea what a distinct climate and ecology the central portion of North America has compared to the other continents.  Because the major mountain ranges (Sierra Nevada, Rockies and Appalachians) run from north to south compared to east to west (the Alps, Urals and Himalayas), North America has a "climatic trumpet" where hot air comes up from the equator in the summer producing near tropical summers even in Wisconsin, and then cold air comes down from the arctic in winter producing a sub-arctic winter.  I hadn't realized that Europe and Asia don't have areas with such major swings in temperature as the norm.  Flannery also explains how this trumpet will cause global warning or an ice age to be most severe in North America compared to the other continents.  Flannery presents and explores in the latter portion of his book many theses on how he thinks North Americans need to take care of their continent so that life as we know it is not jeopardized.  Many may think his predictions more dire than need be, but all are worth some careful thought, and many are new ideas (such as the need for large carnivores) that most people would not have thought of.  All in all, The Eternal Frontier is a thoughtful, well-written and surprisingly exciting book 
 To fully apreciate this movie you have to be a trader, a trader who has experienced loses.  Many of the emotions that Nick goes through are similar to the emotions that most people experience when they begin to trade.  While Nick's trading style is different than most people's (price arbitrage and huge amounts of equity), the emotions are still there, fear and greed 
 I bought this book after collecting rifles for a few years, it is in fact the ONLY contemporary book to cover the history and development of all the major manufacturers and models in such detail and with great pictures too. The chapters of the book are well planned and as I find myself exploring a new area of collecting, I  read the relevant chapter again. After collecting German bolt actions for some time I got interested in Lee-Enfields and the discussion and pictures of these rifles was very helpful in getting a good coverage of the rifles and models.  It can also be helpful to the more experienced collectors, some time ago I came across a rifle in a store marked as a Greek Mauser. I know what a Greek Mauser looks like and this was not one, it is marked 'Breda 1927' on the side of the receiver. After perusing Mr. Scarlata's book I came across a whole section including pictures of the rifle, it is a Mannlicher Schoenauer 1903/14 rifle. Scarlata explains how in 1926 the Greeks signed an agreement with Societa Anonima Ernesto Breda of Brescia Italy for 100,000 of these rifles which were delivered in 1929. He also mentions that there is some speculation that the rifles were in fact produced by Steyr and assembled and finished in Italy so as to bypass restrictions imposed on the Austrians by the Allies after WWI. If you are at all interested in the history and development of bolt action rifles you need this book 
 I grew up in LA, and I assumed I knew everything about all the secret spots and the do's and the don't of LA. However, this book blew me away on how much I don't know about LA. It was a ton of fun rediscovering LA with my girlfriend 
 This is the finest book I have ever read about Immigrants. As an Italian American it is especially rewarding. If made into a real film (not like the cheesy 1949 version)it could be a masterpiece -- it could be to Scorsese what Schindler's list is to Spielberg.  One note -- wait to read Fred Gardaphe's introduction until after you read the novel as he gives away a lot of the story 
 This is probably the most definitive and best-researched book on the topic of dyslexic cognition available. Having done quite a bit of research on the gift of dyslexia while co-authoring a book about therapies, I found Tom West's accounts of notable dyslexics both fascinating and invaluable, as you can see if you read the review of the book  elsewhere on the internet. This is a masterful job of research and insight 
 I am going to keep this review short and simple. This book is much like all the other Prey novels so far, except the killer is not necessarily a serial killer. The antagonist is a person who killed a family in the first chapter in order to try and save himself from being arrested later, because of the knowledge they hold.   This book succeeds because of the drastic change in enviornment (the frozen tundra of northern Wisconsin), the nature of the crimes compared to previous books, and some fresh charcters. The snow-mobiles are pretty cool, too.  This book will more than likely be one of your favorite Prey books (so far) IF you are a Sandford/Davenport fan. It is a great change of pace from a slightly overused serial killer formula from the previous books. This book will hopefully change the pace for all Prey books to come and make sure they are not just the same books with different names and settings 
 Thomas Mann has taken an ages old theme, the attraction of an older, worn out man for a youthful boy, dressed it up in a series of classical allusions, and details how this attraction merely accelerates the decay of the man whose decline began long before he first saw the boy.  In DEATH IN VENICE, Gustave von Aschenbach is a German writer living in pre-World War I Europe, who has been trying to balance the struggles involved in maintaining his hard-worn writing laurels with the demands those struggles have placed on his life, his health, and his emotional keel.  He has become an ascetic, denying himself the pleasures of the flesh.  His muse is a jealous one and demands his attention full time.  Over the years, he has willingly paid the price, but the true cost becomes apparent to him only as he turns fifty years of age.  He senses a void in his life.  He does not know what it is or how to compensate, so he decides that travel in the answer.  One of the ironies of Mann's novella is that Aschenbach's readers undoubtedly give him credit for the worldly-wise sophisticate that his many literary works of art suggest he must be.  But the truth is that because of his rigorous denial of himself, in terms of maturity and emotional serenity, he is a greenhorn.  He tends to view the world as he does through his books, which are laden with an abundance of classical erudition. But the real world is not Plato's Republic reborn.  It is a testing ground which favors those whose feet are firmly grounded in the world of the body.  Early on, as Mann subtly alludes to Aschenbach's mental and physical infirmities, his fate is a doom foretold.  Aschenbach is puzzled by the continual appearance of a weird looking old man who pops up at convenient moments to glare at him in a puzzling manner.  The first time that Aschenbach sees him, he pays him scant attention, but as the visits increase in his trips around Europe, both Aschenbach's and the reader's wonderment grow.  After a while, the old man begins to assume allegorical--or at least mystical--proportions.  One can almost see a misty haze envelop both during their encounters. It is tempting to treat these visitations as unreal hallucinations of a mind slowly unhinging with Aschenbach seeing a version of himself, following him around Europe, as if to remind him of his looming mortality.  While in Europe, he notices a good looking Polish boy of about fourteen. Aschenbach begins to fantasize about him but dares not do more than just gaze at him from a distance.  As if in a rush, the years of ascetic self-denial rupture, opening the door to his latent homosexual tendencies.  Mann cleverly avoids calling a spade a spade. Instead he dresses up this fantasy in terms of Aschenbach's limited social background that had been fueled by a lifetime of classical learning.  The boy, whose name is Tadziu, is described as a young Adonis, an Apollo, and other such. The only words that pass between then occur at the very end, when Aschenbach sees the boy tormented by bullies and almost, but not quite, intervenes.  Aschenbach locks eyes with the boy and in that moment he knows the forbidden joy that, in a different universe might have been his.  He dies, possibly of the plague, happy and decidedly ignorant of who he himself really was.  Mann passes no moral judgments against Aschenbach. This is no gay bashing novel nor does he hold it up as a trumpeting to engage in illicit activities, but in the ending of what-might-have-been, Mann suggests that life's choices and future happiness might better be served with a clearer moral vision of who we are, what we want, and where we are going.     
 I initially saw this played on the now defunct TRIO satellite channel.  At the time, I owned a once played copy of Doolittle.  After hearing all of the commentary on the importance of the Pixies to modern music, seeing the powerful (yet physically still) nature of their live performance, and seeing some of the music videos for the first time, I was convinced that Doolittle was worth a genuine try.  Yes, the Brits in "Gouge" do some kissing-up, but you can tell (they're not actors, after all), that it is truly sincere.  Bowie and Bono, while neither one is half the artist of B.F., do seem especially informed and heart-felt in their analysis and praise.  How humbling it must be to have so many renowned artists and journalists praise your work !  This is a good primer for further study of the band - it was for me.  I'm in a cover band (as David Bowie says in the DVD - everyone who's heard Pixies, forms a band), since I feel a strong urge to try to cover Pixies' music.  The other members didn't know of their work, so I am going to use this DVD as a seminar on the Pixies' work.  I watch it regularly, for personal inspiration - I can't get enough.  Thom Yorke (of Radiohead) says that you must be "that good for a start" - we are going to give it a shot.    I was in high school when the more favored 3 CDs were published, but alas, was never exposed.  A year and a half later, I am so glad that I saw, and now own this DVD - most importantly I "discovered" the greatness of Pixies.  I even went to see them at a small local venue in June 2005 (got Kim's autograph!).  I will be buying the "Sellout" DVD, when released in Oct2005.  I feel that this is a very satisfying DVD, and a DEAL ( no pun intended) for the price of < $20 - a quarter what I paid for my wife and I to see them live.  By the way, to the author of one of these commentaries - the name of the album is SURFER Rosa, not SISTER Rosa - you seem like you know what you're talking about, bone machine head!  LONG LIVE THE PIXIES ! !  
 excellent 
 Steve Miller released his tenth album Fly Like an Eagle in May of 1976. This was Steve's first new album since the 1973 album The Joker put him on the map thanks to that album's title cut becoming a hit.  However, after almost eight years of being on the road, Steve burned himself out and he retired and bought a farm in Medford, Oregon and didn't record for almost two years. Then in spring of 1975, whilst writing songs and demoing, Steve got a call from Pink Floyd(one of rock's greatest bands) asking him to open up for them at Knebworth Park in England to 125,000 people. Steve upstaged Pink Floyd(whose set was marred by technical problems that day) and premiered the song Rock 'n Me which he wrote as a showstopper and a hit.  With the momentum going from his concert with Pink Floyd, he went in the recording studio with bass player lonnie Turner and drummer Gary Mallaber and recorded 20 plus tracks in 12 days. That could have made a double album but Steve played it safe and put out Fly Like an Eagle and then Book of Dreams(see review) a year later.  Would this album be a classic or redundant, read on and find out(as I did when I got the album in June, 1991 on cassette(with original vinyl track listing) and later CD). We begin the album with winds ala echo-plex and the synthesizer laced Space Intro which was a great intro. Then the echo-plexed winds segue into the album's title cut which was a Top 5 hit in early 1977. The song developed from when it was called In the Ghetto in the early 1970s. The song has a great riff, great vocals and superb synthesizer effects which go throughout the track and the synthesizer echoed ending was superb and the beeps at the end were from the master tape. Next is Wild Mountain Honey which is a nice relaxing number which doesn't change key during the song but doesn't bore one. Next is the rocker Serenade which is a great rocker and had Steve singing all of the harmonies and just rocks. We then have the country-ish Dance Dance Dance which is country to the core and features some great acoustic work from Steve and dobro from John McFee. This track was not on the mid-1980s reissued LP or cassette for some reason but appeared on the original album, cassette(and the 1991 cassette reissue), 8-track and CD(remastered CD version as well). Next is a rockified version of Mercury Blues which is a great rocking version of the blues standard about the car and Steve made the track his own. The album's second half starts with the rocking first single Take The Money And Run which was a Top 10 hit in the Summer of 1976. The song was a story of a man and woman trying to rob some cash and the song was chosen as a single after kids at an elementary school liked what they heard. The #1 hit Rock 'n Me follows and is a great rocker(see early in review for song's creation). Next is the remake of the late Sam Cooke's ballad You Send Me. This remake is superb with excellent electric guitar playing and harmonies all from Steve. This track, like Dance Dance Dance, was not on the mid-1980s reissued LP or cassette version for some reason but appeared on the original album, cassette(and the 1991 cassette reissue), 8-track and CD(and remastered CD) versions. The second of two instrumentals Blue Odyssey is next and is called a poor man's Space Intro but with great synthesizer work and the synthesizer used was ironically an ARP Odyssey synthesizer, hence the name. Then the echoplexed induced wind segues into the bluesy Sweet Maree which featured the legendary James Cotton on harmonica and staccato acoustic guitar with limited lyrics from Miller and is a showcase for Cotton's harmonica and Miller's bluesy electric guitar soloing. The album ends with the spacey ballad The Window which has a great synthesizer riff, excellent vocals and ends like the album began with a collage of echoplexed synthesizer and wind effects.  Fly Like an Eagle went all the way to #3 on the Billboard chart and sold 4.5 million copies, went Platinum right when released.  In 2006, the album was re-released with three bonus tracks which were an early live recording of Fly Like an Eagle from 1973 and demos of Take the Money and Run and Rock 'n Me. Plus, a booklet and a 2 plus hour DVD faturing a concert from San Francisco in 2005 which had guests George Thorogood and Joe Satriani and a documentary on how the album was made. The documentary is amazing and the sound of the CD is SUPERB! RECOMMENDED 
 William Manchester is one of our finest writers, and "Alone" is the best book I have read about Churchill.  Manchester's brilliant opening chapter about a Churchillian day at Chartwell, his country home, establishes quickly in the reader's mind the virtues and foibles of a man who described himself as "great" and never suffered from false modesty.   I have a couple of quibbles about the book. First, I thought Manchester's admiration for his subject was occasionally a bit cloying.  Secondly, and more seriously, I don't think Manchester did a very good job detailing the ideological currents of the 1930s.  Manchester portrays Britain's leaders during that era as clueless, weak, and something close to wicked. I would tend to regard them as people who thought that Communism was a greater threat than Fascism and reacted accordingly in the spirit of "the enemy of my enemy is my friend."  They were nearly right.  But Churchill, unencumbered by an attraction to foreign ideologies, despised both Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany, and early on correctly identified the Nazis as the immediate and most serious menace to his beloved Isle.  That Churchill was right and had the courage to stand isolated and steadfast in his convictions is the basis of his greatness. Manchester has written a masterpiece biography about the essential man of the 20th century.   Smallchief                        
 I bought this while interviewing and now I keep it at work.  I got the job I wanted with my top salary request.  Useful, easy to understand and put into practice.  Things you didn't realize about posture, facial expressions, simple phrasing, voice tone, etc.  Great investment 
 Excellent book for comparing different brands/manufactureres of New Mobile Homes.  I've found it very useful while searching for a used home to buy.  I would like to see something like this for older models and obsolete brands but this one goes a long way.  I now know which manufacturers sell in my state,  What their typical prices are,  How well they are constructed on a scale of 1 to 10.  It does not break the value down to specific models but there is a chart i can compare with what ever home I'm looking at to see how it compares with the others. If I had found this book at the library I would go out and buy my own copy 
 For those who fear being crushed under the weight of John Daido Loori's arrogance - fear not.  This book is a fasinating display of writings from various masters.  While the theme of each essay is the practice of Shikataza we are also offered a smorgasbord of other insights.  The excellent editing of this book provides the reader with an assembly of some of the best Zen writings to be found under one roof 
 this story is very exciting.I'm glad that Crane disappeared at the end,whatever his destiny is.The Sleepy Hollow is so secluded and beautiful that we don't allow anyone to spoil the beauty there.I view Crane as an intruder of the Tarry town.People there take story-telling,especially the horrable storys, as a pastime.This brings then some excitment.I myself brought up in the rural area, I can understand this 
 I read this because I was required to for (MBA) school. I read the entire book over two weekends; a difficult task for me because of poor reading speed and poor attention span. I generally do not like to read and find most of what I read a painful bore and highly unbeneficial. This book was an exception. This book gives us an interesting insight into Michael Lewis' real world experience, something we cannot get a real feel for in traditional textbooks. If it is not already, this book should be required reading for all MBA programs. Thank you, Mr. Lewis, for sharing your story 
 Don't be fooled by that sultry over-the-shoulder cover photo - Hilary Duff's third studio album bubbles with enthusiastic electro-pop rhythms that would inspire even hardened couch potatoes to take a turn on the dance floor.  First single "Play With Fire" is about a young woman who has gotten over a break-up, and has just encountered the former object of her affection. Though not the best song on the album, it has an infectious '80s style chorus which makes up for a slightly monotonous vocal performance. Second single "With Love" is another '80s retro track and is strictly for dancing, but all is forgiven with the third single "Stranger", which has an unusual Eastern influenced beat running through it.  "Stranger" mixes up the rhythms and allows Duff to show a little more range, and the lyrics are also much better than the first two singles. The song is about a couple who appear perfect in public, but this image quickly dissipates when they are alone.  And now for the rest of the album -   The title track is a wickedly funny take on the young publicity-hungry starlets, hotties and heiresses doing the entertainment circuit, and is one of my favorite songs on this album.  "Danger" is another track with an Eastern influence, but although I like the beat, the lyrics make me feel really old.  (The song is about dating an older man, who was born in 1974 - this makes me archaic)  "Gypsy Woman" is about a woman who breaks up a family, a short track which leads into the bouncy "Never Stop", a disco number reminiscent of "Knock on Wood".   The slower paced "No Work No Play" didn't do it for me, but I like how she does the chorus lines - "Let the clouds roll in and fill the sky / Get that melancholy feeling inside". "Between You and Me" is just more of the same old, same old, except for that "oompah oompah" tuba bit, and the intro for  "Dreamer" (a song about a stalker) sounds just a bit Paris Hilton in delivery.   "Happy" doesn't really come over that way, but it's about a girl getting over a bad relationship and feeling much better about herself.  Rounding out the album are "Burned", "Outside of You" (the only song not co-written by Duff, with Pink and Chantal Kreviazuk doing the honors), and "I Wish".  An enjoyable, danceable, guilty pleasure album that you should buy for a teenager and borrow every once in a while.    Amanda Richards, April 11, 2007 
 Thom Hartmann has written a series of books related to ADD/ADHD.  They all are wonderful easy to understand and useful books.  They introduce a powerful perspective to those labeled ADD/ADHD. ADD/ADHD, being based on labeling behaviors is challenged in many ways by these books of Hartmaan's.  Thom Hartmann's books provide a useful tool to help people recognize the psychological coping mechanism that are associated with ADD patterns of behavior.  This was very helpful to me since I am not ADD/ADHD and had no idea how to relate or what I was relating to!!!  This book Healing ADD gave me some useful tools for me and my daily life!  That alone was worth the cost of the book!  Bottom-line these books helped several people I know and love.  So this review is one of a personal point of "been there done that!"  I learned much as did my family and friends.  These books of his help!!!  Yours in good health  nieem 
 The globalization of the world's economy, with all of its implications for wealth and poverty, international security and cultural homogenization, is clearly one of the defining issues of our time.  But it is one of the most difficult stories to understand, with so many subplots and cross-currents, actors and institutions.  Much of what truly affects the pace and character of globalization occurs behind the scenes and is transparent only to specialists in one field or another.  With his books on the International Monetary Fund and its role in the international financial crises of the past decade, Paul Blustein illuminates an important dimension of globalization in an understandable and highly readable manner.  His previous book, The Chastening, was concerned primarily with the East Asian financial crisis of the late 1990's; this awkwardly-titled book focuses soley on Argentina's crisis of 2001.  It lacks the narrative drama of the The Chastening, but its narrower scope makes it easier to digest.  The IMF he portrays is a less assertive  institution than its critics might expect.  I would think that there are many business professionals, academics, and informed citizens who are not specialists in international finance who would find this book useful and interesting.  
 I find myself turning back to this book every year.  Its an easy read because Tozer writes so well...yet every word he says is full of substance.  He says little but says everything.  His words bring conviction and the overall flow of the book causes you to see your need for the true untainted God and the satisfaction in that need...and in that finding.  Read it.  You will not regret it.  One of my top 5 all time favorites (and I love to read!)  blessings.. 
 This book was an over all enjoyable read.  There are some parts that get a bit conspiracy theory (I particularily wish that my fellow liberals and feminist would spare Christianity for a while, just because it has been  used by men and WOMEN to do some harmful things doesn't mean its evil in itself or that all Christians are woman hating republicans).  Maybe you won't switch from a nice little tampon to a blood towel or agree with her view on home abortions but it will make you think about your position in the world as a female.  Alot of what she says really makes sense; or at least are worthy subjects to consider whether you agree with her or not.  All in all, it is a beautiful book written sincerely. 
 I've read several of the Pride and Prejudice sequels and "his side" stories.  I think this series is the best. Unlike others, which seem to be written just to add sex to the original novel, this series actually has a good plot and character development.  I highly recommend it 
 A "MUST",  If you don't read it, you will miss something in your life.  There is a lot to lear 
 Dayna and Heather  think they'll die a martyr's death  for talkin' 'bout Christ 
 I read Prodigal Summer a couple years ago and it is still one of my favorite reads ever -- highly recommended 
 It is perhaps true that you don't like this album like Hopes and Fears in the first hearing, but, man IT  IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN HOPES AND FEARS!! The frog prince, Crystall ball and Leaving so soon? are songs to make any band proud of their efforts. Tom Chaplin's vocals in The frog prince are simply awesome. There aren't many singers today that can sustain the chorus (Inherit the earth/ while your prince's crown) at such a high note. The music also is much better and varied than Hopes and Fears, where the songs were much similar from one to another (Listen to the intros of Somewhere only we know, Bend and break and Everybody's changing, for instance). Maybe, simply, I like the new darker and at times eerie sound of Under the Iron Sea more than its predecessor. After considering (and I still do) Hopes and Fears a five star album, I'd rate this one higher, if I could. I do really love this CD 
 I am almost certain that the first two reviewers of this excellent book are confusing Schell's content in this book with the one he previously released.  Mr. Schell has another book entitled "Baseball's All-Time Greatest HITTERS" in which he concludes that Tony Gwynn was the greatest HITTER of all-time.  I can easily understand the mis-interpretation of "All-Time Best Sluggers," as Mr. Schell includes several tables, charts, graphs and discussions that would lead an uninformed reader to assume this book was about HITTING instead of SLUGGING.  Schell examines all sorts of topics in "Sluggers," ranging from discussions of pure power to ones of walk and strikeout frequency and success.    If you do decide to pick up a copy of "Sluggers," do yourself a favor and also pick up a copy of "Hitters" and read it first.  Doing this will give you a MUCH better understanding of the direction that Mr. Schell is taking with his newest book.  He is looking at the numbers from all sides in "Sluggers," but his ultimate goal is to derive information about slugging, not pure hitting 
 Finally, a raw food (un)cookbook I can use! I'm not much of a cook, or perhaps I should say food-preparer, but I can do these recipes.  The ones I've tried so far are very good.  They don't require extremely unusual ingredients (which I don't have access to here) or expensive machines.  I give this book five stars 
 A detailed and extensively documented account of the history of the Middle East focussing on the period from WW1 to the present from a journalist that has lived and worked there.  It answers the question "why would terrorists strike the US".  It will shock you and perhaps break your heart to realize how the actions and policies of the US, Britain, et al have sowed the seeds for the hatred and rage that we are experincing. It is a very long book (more than a thousand pages), and the detailed descriptions of the torture and carnage that have plagued this region are harrowing.  But it covers the countries and events that make our situation in the Middle East understandable. It shows just how misleading and ridiculous are the statements from our goverment that we have been attacked because "they envy our freedom" or that this is a "religous Jihad".  
 Although this is not my favorite Christie story (hence, the 4 stars instead of 5), I still loved listening to it.  I think Hugh Fraser (Captain Hastings) does a superb job as reader.  
 As a recent transplant to the south, I found this book not only entertaining but extremely informative. Take two old men, several theories on gardening and an unlimited number of pages for arguing and you've got Gardening in the Humid South. Ed and Leon have never steered me wrong, and they're a hoot to boot 
 Read this and understand the true thoughts and meaning behind the Constitution and its Amendments, its interesting to read how the founding fathers interpreted what they wrote in a very different way then the courts and federal gestapo interprete them today. Especially of interest is the paper oon the true meaning of the term "for the general welfare" which has been used to allow all sorts of power grabs from the nuts in Washington, and which has been interpreted completly contrary to what the founding fathers intended. Be a true patriot, read this book 
 This is a must have for anyone in a supervisory or managerial role.  Simple concepts, easy read...with actual dialogues to help you practice the coaching techniques discussed.  And best of all, IT WORKS 
 Bob Dylan is the greatest living American composer. As essential to his generation as Irving Berlin and Cole Porter were to theirs and sure to be remembered with the same reverence. This is a great collection of most of his finest work -- all remastered. An avid Dylan fan, I can't help but notice the absence of some of my favorites, like Tonight I'll Be Staying Here With You, from Nashville Skyline and One More Cup Of Coffee, from Desire. I guess I would have liked to see a three disk Essential -- he certainly deserves one. That said, it is hard to argue with the song selections. For example, other than the original Greatest Hits collection, which was originally released in the '60's, this is the only other place you can find Positively 4th Street -- his follow-up single to Like A Rolling Stone.  If you want to purchase one disk for your CD collection that best represents Bob Dylan's body of work, this is the one to get 
 Fans of Gary Chapman's perennial bestseller, The Five Love Languages, will appreciate this new fictional series, which offers readers an opportunity to see how Christ's love can transform marriages.   It Happens Every Spring is the first of four books, co-authored with award-winning romance novelist, Catherine Palmer. The cozy neighborhood of Deepwater Cove on Missouri's Lake of the Ozarks offers the perfect setting for exploring the various seasons of marriage.  Like the movie, Steel Magnolias, the hub of this quiet community is Patsy Pringle's "Just As I Am" hair salon and tearoom. Here we meet our cast of characters: five women who form "The Tea Ladies Club" (TLC).   Brenda Hanson has seen her last child off to college and faces her empty nest alone, while her husband of 25 years spends every minute on his new, fast-paced real estate job. Lonely, she resents his time away and wonders if their marriage will survive.   A couple of dramatic events lead the TLC women to rally together, with plenty of laughter and tears along the way. Not only is the novel entertaining, I came away with new insight into what makes a beautiful, long-lasting marriage.  -- Christian Women Online Book Buz 
 As an Emotional Intelligence (EQ) Coach, I teach people to develop their emotional intelligence competencies, one of which is Intuition.  As Naparstek is so quick to point out -- we all have it, it's just a matter of developing it and using.  Now, the clients with relatively high Intuition already, know "intuitively" what it's all about.  But those other folks??  They're the ones who need a good scientific explanation (empirical evidence, upon which my coaching is based) to help them bridge the gap.  In a field such as coaching, empirical evidence (scientific fact) is rare.  This gave me just what i needed, has helped me develop  my own Intuition and stay safer.  Read it and get to work 
 Whether or not you agree with Ms. Roy, reading her book will provoke you, and thus, to me, it is worth-while.  It is particularly incendiary if you a regular American living a regular life.  Ms. Roy spares few in allotting responsibility for the troubles of the world's poor and war-stricken.  I did find her somewhat anti-American, but then, I'm biased.    Definitely take a look.  Ms. Roy is extremely readable.  I loved God of Small Things, and though I normally don't read political non-fiction, I thoroughly enjoyed this book 
 The author is a history professor, historical editor, and the author of _Bringing Your Family History to Life through Social History_, and her background is obvious in the subjects this book covers: Locating and preserving family archival documents, organizing a documentary project, the professional fundamentals of transcribing, editing, and annotating documents, how to dispose of documents when your project is complete (stick them in a drawer or place them in a repository for the use of others?), and publishing the resulting book. The style is smooth and engrossing (more so, admittedly, if the reader is predisposed to reading archival materials), and the advice is generally pretty good. There are interesting digressions into such subjects as dealing with your ancestors' words on topics that we today would regard as socially offensive. As in most Betterway publications, tips, notes, reminders, and warnings are emphasized throughout, and a selection of useful forms is included. The bibliography is lengthy and detailed and there's also a useful list of organizations, specialty publishers, and suppliers of archival products. However, I could wish that the index were more analytical: "Archives and archivists" includes ten rather broad locators with no subheadings, which is not very friendly to the user 
 Anthony Hamilton is the type of cat that makes you sit back, relax, close your eyes, and listen.  I have not heard a song he does YET that I wouldn't replay.  I'm not even a big churchgoer and I'd reply his gospel-like songs as quickly as I'd play his Neo Soul/ R&B songs.  "Sista Big Bones" is my jam, but every other cut on here is just as outstanding.  I don't even have any cons for this man; just pros.  Great job!  I saw him perform live at the Taste of Chicago and I wanted him to stay up there forever.  You should've saw the sad faces in the crowd when he ended his performance and how we all cheered when he came back out to do "Brown Skin" with India Arie.  His voice is rich, his songs are excellent, his beats are perfect for his tone.  I just love his music to death 
 This is a cool little production from 1971 that Paul produced only (he doesn't appear on the music) for his album Ram. Paul was so taken with the finished results of Ram that before it was released, he hired Richard Hewson to arrange and conduct instrumental versions of each song. The sessions finally took place over three days in June (only a few weeks after the vinyl release of Ram) but remained shelved until '77. It seems when Paul is hiding behind someone else's name (Thrillington, Country Hams, McGear, Suzy & The Redstripes, Fireman), he's unafraid to take risks and the outcome is always something unique and wondeful. Give this album a spin for nothing more than the joy of Ram set to 'muzak' 
 I've been reading a lot of political analyses lately (Thomas Friedman's The World is Flat, T.R. Reid's The United States of Europe to highly recommend two) but for sheer, weighty scholarship this one takes the prize.  Phillips' critique of an oil-based economy, religion in politics, and the American addiction to debt is meticulously cited, exhaustively examined and ultimately devastatingly conclusive, with a final paragraph that nearly moved me to tears.  I wish I could say that I found it comforting to be told that this has all happened before, to the Romans, to the Spanish, to the Dutch and to the British.  What really stings is that this guy is a Republican with serious street cred.  He's not some wild-eyed way-to-the-left liberal, he's my dad.  
 Starting with a pale-green Leo the Lion (the trademark of MGM), Saul Bass creates a vibrant title sequence, seamlessly transitioning from an animated crisscrossing of animated black lines to a real-life skyscraper reflecting the bustling traffic of New York City below, all accompanied by Bernard Herrmann's most underrated musical score. This splendidly sets the stage for the fast-paced action of the film set to follow. It is here we meet Roger Thornhill, the protagonist of our story, played charismatically by Cary Grant, as he rushes to a business luncheon, dictating his memos to his secretary who is feverishly trying to keep up with him. Even from this brief encounter we can sense that Thornhill has an air of confidence about him (too much perhaps) and acts frivolously and boorish to anyone other then himself. To his loyal secretary he sums up the seemingly unethical life he leads, "Ah, Maggie, in the world of advertising, there's no such thing as a lie. There's only the expedient exaggeration. You ought to know that". It is ironic therefore that he should later be so trusting of Eve who in turn deceives him through `false advertising' and leaves him betrayed by her `expedient exaggerations'.  As Thornhill arrives for his business luncheon at the famous Plaza Hotel, he remembers that his mother is playing bridge at a friend's house at that very moment and she can not be contacted at home as he has instructed his secretary to do (to reminder of a play they are attending that evening at the Winter Garden Theatre). Unfortunately he remembers this small detail just as the taxi carrying her pulls away. A little annoyed, he shrugs it off and goes inside. It is however this minor detail that will set off a chain of events which will ultimately lead him to a ledge on Mount Rushmore, far from his laidback world in New York City. Before he conducts business with his clients at lunch, he calls for a busboy the precise moment a page for a Mr. `George Kaplan' is announced over the hotel's PA system. Two henchmen laying in wait for this `Kaplan' assume Thornhill is the man they are looking for and as soon as he walks away from his table to send a telegram to his mother, they grab him and take him off in a car to their boss's headquarters.  Grant's dry wit and acid humor is the driving force of this picture and it works expediently well. Upon hearing of a dinner party at the Townsend residence as he is dragged by the two henchmen to their boss's office he exclaims, "By the way, what are we having for dessert?" And when he is confronted by a man who claims to be Lester Townsend (later we learn that he is actually a foreign spy named Philip Vandamm who has taken up residence at the UN diplomat's home for the time being) about what he, or rather what Mr. Kaplan, knows he replies, "Not that I mind a slight case of abduction now and then, but I have tickets for the theatre this evening, to a show I was looking forward to and I get, well, kind of unreasonable about things like that". A tall glass of bourbon is then forced upon, making him entirely bombed. The two henchmen then plan to place him in a car and have Mr. `Kaplan' drive himself off a cliff. Things don't go quite as planned and somehow Thornhill is able to grab control of the wheel and drive manically through oncoming traffic. This as well as the booking scene which soon follows are classic. Seeing Grant, an actor notorious for his serious demeanor, pretend he's drunk is priceless.  Hitchcock manages to truly put himself into the mindset of his audience. Having just watched Thornhill weave intoxicated in and out of traffic, the precise moment we query to ourselves as to where a police officer is during all of this, a police car's sirens blare as he is in pursuit of Thornhill.  Having been made a fool of by his abductors (when Thornhill returns to the Townsend residence with his lawyer, mother, and two police detectives in tow to investigate his claim, Mrs. Townsend - in reality Vandamm's sister - greets Roger Thornhill as Mr. Kaplan and coyly insists that Kaplan became quite drunk at their little dinner party the other night), he returns to the Plaza Hotel and breaks into Mr. Kaplan's hotel room to see who this man truly is. He is then chased by the same two henchmen who abducted him the night before from the hotel to the United Nations Assembly Building where Lester Townsend works. However the man he meets is not the same man who had him abducted at the Plaza Hotel. Suddenly, a knife is thrown into the back of Mr. Townsend (presumably aimed for Roger Thornhill but missed) and coincidently (wink-wink) a photographer is right there in the Assembly Building to `capture' Thornhill holding the murder weapon in his hand and standing over the victim's body. Not only does Thornhill have to track down this George Kaplan and figure out why these foreign spies want him disposed of, he must also clear his name of a murder he did not commit, all while avoiding the detection of either the police or the foreign assassins.  After learning that Kaplan is headed for the Hotel Ambassador East in Chicago, Illinois, Thornhill decides to pursue this mysterious man and clear him name. In a quick call to his mother Thornhill tries to convince her that for a man on the run from the law traveling by train is safer then flying. "Well, because there's no place to hide on a plane if anyone should recognize me...oh, you want me to jump off a moving plane?" which is of course a foreshadowing of the famous crop-dusting sequence later on. Recognized by the sales clerk working at the ticket counter booth, he successfully sneaks aboard the train destined for Chicago and is concealed from detection by the police by a platinum blonde bombshell named Eve Kendell, played scintillatingly by Eva Marie Saint, who he bumps into on his way aboard the train.  The two meet again a few moments later at dinner (we later learn that Eve tipped the waiter five dollars to seat him with her if he entered the dining car). Roger and Eve, perceptibly attracted to one another, exchange sexual innuendos over dinner. She reveals to Thornhill that she knows exactly who he is and what he is accused of, but she doesn't care. He asks her why. She responds, "It's going to be a long night" and that she doesn't "particularly like the book" she's started. Inquiring as to whether he has picked up on her sexual proposition, he replies, "Uh, let me think. Yes, I know exactly what you mean..." She then invites him to her drawing room in Car 3901 (a reference of course to Alfred Hitchcock's The 39 Steps which this film is modeled after) where further double entendres are made by the two lovers to make the censors squirm. As they kiss passionately, she lets him know that she's `a big girl' to which he responds, "Yeah, and in all the right places too". Wanting to know more about him, acknowledging his taste in clothes and food, he quickly retorts, "...and taste in women. I like your flavor". However, Hitchcock bows to the censors and forces Thornhill to sleep on the floor.   Easily one of the most identifiable sequences not only of director Alfred Hitchcock's career but in all of motion picture history, the crop-dusting scene in North-by-Northwest is magnificently choreographed to the hilt. Roger Thornhill, traveling by bus so as to ensure that he is alone, is led to a desolate cornfield in Illinois under the pretext that he will be Kaplan. In reality this is merely a bluff, a plot by the foreign spy organization to lure Thornhill into a false sense of security and eliminate him with the least amount of witnesses as possible. However, Hitchcock does not simply deliver the sequence to the audience, Heaven no. He builds us up with excitement and anticipation when the moment finally arrives. He does so by having Cary Grant stand alone on a deserted dirt road while cars pass by occasionally. Does Kaplan actually exist? If so, will he show? And then what? The tension builds. Suddenly a car drops a man off on the other side of the dirt road and takes off. Is this Kaplan? Hitchcock couldn't make it that easy, could he? He must be an assassin then. But before we even have time to query our suspicions, the man points out to Thornhill that the crop-duster across the way is dusting a field with no crops. As soon as the man boards a bus and is out of sight, the crop-duster proceeds to terrorize Thornhill by running him down. He hides in the cornfield to no avail; the plane sprays the crops with poisonous pesticides, forcing Thornhill out into the open. Thornhill successfully flags down a gasoline truck just in the nick of time, causing the crop-duster to swerve out of control and crash head-on into the gasoline truck, creating a marvelous explosion.  After tracking down Eve at the Hotel Ambassador East, the same hotel George Kaplan was suppose to be staying at (`Kaplan' supposedly checked out a full two hours before Eve called his hotel room and claimed that she had arranged a meeting between him and Thornhill - the encounter with the crop-duster in the cornfield), he pursues her to an auction where he is confronted by Vandamm and his two henchmen. He provokes a fight and uses the police escort to escape Vandamm's henchmen who were lying in wait for him. He is then taken to an airport where a kindly ol' man referred to as the Professor brings him up-to-date on the situation (Eve, Vandamm's lover, was recruited by the C.I.A. to spy on Vandamm who in reality is a foreign spy trafficking government secrets in and out of the country - `importer/exporter' as the Professor refers to his occupation as which is a coy reference to `The Man Who Knew Too Much'). Realizing Eve may be exposed and presumably killed by Vandamm, he flies out to Rapid City, confront Eve, and pretends to be critically wounded by her (a gun loaded with blanks) so as to convince Vandamm Eve is still on his side.  Leonard, one of Vandamm's henchmen, doesn't trust Eve and for good reason. Vandamm on the other hand believes him to be jealous of his mistress, clearly a homosexual allusion. "You know what I think? I think you're jealous. No, I mean it. I'm very touched, very". Leonard then exposes Eve for the fraud she is, firing her gun with blanks straight at Vandamm. He is of course left unharmed but stunned and (emotionally) hurt. He knows what he must do, choosing to throw her off the plane as soon as they are over water.   The crescendo of crescendos in North-by-Northwest is the chase scene on top of (what appears to be) Mount Rushmore (but because the government would not allow the famous director to shoot such a sequence on top of a national monument, gigantic busts created on a soundstage out in California and rear projections were used instead). The film ends with a scene in which Eve, dangling dangerously over the edge of Mount Rushmore, struggling to hold on to Thornhill's hand transitions immediately to him pulling her up to their compartment bed aboard a train heading east after they are married. It properly sums up the entire atmosphere of the film - sadly and deliciously absurd (to quote the federal agent earlier in the film, "It's so horribly sad. How is it I feel like laughing?") 
 I'm rating this as an overall "bang for your buck" type of thing.  I'll start with Suicide Club. The movie has got a lot going for it.  Great suspense, buildup and twist.  It does a good job of bringing a lot of tension in the viewer trying to figure out on their own what is happening, but to me takes a turn into nonsense because of who they are saying is causing these acts.  I don't like to spoil for anyone so my words are well-crafted I think.  The movie is good up to the point of this ingredient, it then becomes silly.  Had they taken a different route it would have been thoroughly enjoyable, but as it is, only about 65% so.  Moon Child. It's not bad.  I think the movie tries to ride on these popstars Hyde and Gackt more than the story itself.  Eventhough I like jpop, I know very little of these 2 guys.  Take a look at my pic...I think I'm "cuter", lol.  So, that said.  The story is interesting and has a lot to go for it.  It deals with difficult choices individuals have to make and rides on "good and bad" or yin and yang fairly well.  Keep that in mind, yin and yang.  It's more that than the black and white good and evil.  A little bit too low budget.  I think if it was kicked up a notch it would have been much better.  Last, I rate 2ldk. Out of the 3 I believe this is the best.  Of the 2 stars, I recognize Eiko Koike.  I'm one of those that picks up on details.  I recognized her from her voice alone...so after this if you haven't yet, go watch Kamikaze Girls.  She has a small role in that.  Eventhough the basis of this story is the most outrageous, vampires and suicide clubs aside, it's all about the premise.  It's not "urban legend/myth" like Suicide club and it's not sci fi vampire stuff ike Moon child, but it's more tangible...plausible.  2 roomates, that not only have to live together, but do so with the fact they are complete oppposites...and if that wasn't enough, they have to compete for something that is very dear to them.  A dream to become an actor.  Throughout it all, you witness them acting within their own world, facades and all.  It's quite interesting and very intense.  Buy the pack, you won't be disappointed 
 This specialized gardening guide provides a set of full-color photos of different varieties of amaryllis, and represents the author's world journey in an effort to acquire as many varieties as amaryllis as she could. She grew each plant herself, documenting its growth pattern, blooms, and demise: Amaryllis is thus far more than a picturebook, providing gardeners with invaluable, practical growing tips 
 Rice's treatment of Burton's life is extraordinary, and the definitive biography of this man's many lives. If this were a novel the reader would find the narrative impossible. All the more to admire in this biography of one of the most unlikely, curious, and talented characters of the nineteenth century 
 Years ago I read The Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Hobbit.  I was delighted to find the Jordan series to be even better and longer.  I just completed the last book and have started reading the first again.  On  rereading, it reveals more depth than I had seen the first time through.   If you want to lose yourself in an exciting world that never was, read  these books.  My only regret is that there aren't more of them

 The theme was never give up on love.  Garrett and Theresa were two people from different worlds who had both been inlove and lost it.  Both of the had retreated back in to their work, shutting out the world, having no hope of ever finding love again until they met each other.  They grew together and experience things that they were never thought they were going to be able to feel again.  When Theresa lost Garrett, she knew now that she would one day love again and that life was still worth living.  She was able to do this because of what she and Garrett had gone threw and learned together. 	This was a fantastic book.  The whole story revolved around Garrett's letters to Catherine.  These letters changed Theresa's life forever.  "Immediately after reading it, she had read it again, then a third time.  What would it be like, she mused, to have someone love her that way?"  (Sparks, Message in a Bottle, pg. 28.)  This showed the beginning of Theresa's interest in finding and meeting Garrett.  With Theresa wondering about Garrett, it kept me reading to find out if they would eventually meet and then what would happen.  After reading a news article that was posted many years ago about a letter washed up on shore, Theresa knew that Garrett had written more than just one love letter to Catherine.  Enticing her even, she couldn't wait to meet him.  "She stopped eating and abruptly put down her fork.  It can't be!  She found herself staring at the words.  It's simply not possible....but who else could it be?  She wiped her brow, aware that her hands were suddenly shaking.  Another letter?" (pg 68)  While Garrett and Theresa grow closer, Garrett has flash back of him and Catherine.  It adds the feelings that Garrett still has for Catherine and the relationship they once shared.  While Garrett and Theresa are sailing, Garrett has the flashback to his and Catherine's last time on the Happenstance.  "Catherine sad at the small table with a bottle of wine already open.  In front of her, a vase with a single flower caught the light  of a small burning candle.  The flame swayed with the boat's motion, casting long shadows across the interior of the hull.  In the semidarkness, he could just make out the ghost of a smile."  (pg 118).  Garrett's flashback of him and Catherine, while he and Theresa are sailing on the Happenstance, showed that Theresa brought out those feelings that he hadn't felt since he was with Catherine.  Just a glance into the future for him and Catherine.  After Theresa found out about Garrett's death, she immediately went to Wilmington.  Once there, Garrett's father gave her a letter that Garrett had written for her.  Theresa read that letter over and over.  Eventually when she was ready, she wrote Garrett back and set out to send him the letter at sea.  After throwing the bottle into the ocean, Theresa smiled because she knew that Garrett would get her letter.  This was showing the true and ever lasting love they had shared.  "When the bottle vanished from sight a few minutes later, she started back to the car.  Walking in silence in the rain, Theresa smiled softly.  She didn't know when or where or if it would ever turn up, but it didn't really matter.  Somehow she knew that Garrett would get the message."  (pg 370).   
 This novel is (forgive me for a regrettably trite analogy), like rich chocolate cake. It can either be devoured with a fiery voracity or savoured for its intricate nuances, and, in fact, should be read in both ways. The extremely complex and suggestive web of motifs present in Ondaatje's masterful work makes this novel tasty and satisfying the second and even third time through. I have heard it criticized for excessive sentimentality and romanticism, but that is exactly what is needed in response to the desolate emotional wasteland of a post-war world. Additionally, the end of the novel, I think, might disabuse many cold cynics of such notions. In any case, a striking, artistic masterpiece that would be a disgrace to overlook 
 I first checked this book out from the library for my son when he was 3 1/2 years-old. He was transfixed as I read to him all the different types of things that people have eaten and still do eat today. Instead of being grossed out, he wanted to try them all! He loves squid and seaweed and is just dying to eat some grasshoppers. We ended up buying the book after checking it out twice in a row and I'm so glad we did. When he was 4, he took it in to share with his Montessori pre-school class. Last year he took it into share with his kindergarten class. And this year he's taken it into his 1st grade class twice; once to share and once to "prove" to his teacher that bugs really ARE a good example of a protein-loaded food. Fabulous, interest-grabbing format and illustrations just add to the great information within. A great intro to cultural studies, too 
 My parents gave us this cookbook in 1965 and it's still on my kitchen shelf.  Vincent Price was the king of horror and it was such a surprise to find that he was a genial man with a nice wife and that they were "foodies" before the term was invented.  The cookbook takes us to Europe, Mexico and the U.S., with recipes from famous restaurants abroad.  Then we are invited to the Price's gournet kitchen with advice from A to Z:  how to make a Bloody Mary and fold a napkin along with cooking special hot dogs and making brown sauce.    Over the years we have particularly enjoyed the recipe for Colcannon, Caesar salad, and Blue Cheese Salad Dressing which I make all the time.  The Yorkshire pudding is excellent.   I recommend this book to anyone who is into the history of food, from when we went from Campbell's mushroom soup casseroles (hey, some are still good) to a serious respect for various cuisines and fresh ingredients.    
 Reviewed by Irene Watson for Reader Views (1/06)  Much has been written about sexuality as well as theories have been formed about it. Most people seem to be curious about sexuality and want to explore the mysteries that are attached.  However, not much has been revealed about the "why" certain behaviors occur until Dr. Aline Zoldbrod published her book "Sex Smart:  How Your Childhood Shaped Your Sexual Life and What to do About it."  Zoldbrod explores the multidimensional nature of human sexuality by presenting information through a cognitive base as well as emphasizing skills in communication and self-awareness.  She covers sexuality from biological, moral, psychological, and social perspectives with research, client experiences, and theory.    According to Zoldbrod, what is considered as "normal" sexual behavior is typically based on observations made of family and society.  She explains that how we are treated or what parameters are set upon us during our childhood reflects on sexual development.  Touch, trust, feeling good about the body as well as oneself are just of the few dynamics that shape the attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors.    "Sex Smart" gives the reader the opportunity to analyze, reflect, and come to terms with their own sexuality and behaviors through explanation and reading vignettes about experiences of others.  After each chapter the reader can do exercises and self-assessments to become aware of their own issues and development.  "Sex Smart" also gives the opportunity to examine the factors and decisions one has made in the past, and find ways to explore and replace them with new healthy patterns by re-writing the scripts brought down through the generations.   Although I highly recommend this book for every reader, it is necessary to note the importance of having a therapist at hand to discuss issues as they come during the reading and exercises of "Sex Smart."  This is not a book to skim through in a day, nor is it a book to take lightly.  It is a book that evokes much inner thought and exploration of behaviors and attitudes that have been framed within the identity of the reader. 
 This is the third Alex Delaware novel written by Jonathan Kellerman, but it's the second one I've read. The first one I read was a much more recent novel (Therapy) and was kind of slow going at first, but this one had me hooked on page one! Alex Delaware is an intriguing character and it makes a nice twist to have a crime novel told by someone more on the fringe of the investigation. Delaware is a Psychologist who sometimes does consulting for the police department. His good friend Milo Sturgis is a homicide detective, so Delaware is often drawn into complicated and grisly cases.  This book starts with a phone call in the wee hours which turns out to be a crisis call from a former patient. James Cadmus had been a child genius, but now has evidently gone off the deep end. When he is found with two mutilated bodies and the bloody knife in his hand, it seems obvious he's a homicidal maniac. But Delaware isn't so sure. It's a wickedly tangled web, but Delaware finds help in some unexpected places and the truth slowly becomes clear. Great stuff.  I love the dynamic between Alex and his friend Milo. Poor Milo has a new captain who doesn't like him, so he's going through hell at work at the moment and that leads to the bottle and trouble at home too. But you'll just have to read the book to find out how that turns out.  And now I must go read all the other volumes in this series. There are TWENTY of them! ARGH 
 As usual, Mr. Maltin has suceeded in capturing the excence of the movies.  While I do not agree with him on every review, He continues to provide the best review of all the critics.  A MUST-Have 
 The Peaceable Kingdom is subtitled "A Primer in Christian Ethics". However, unlike most introductory ethics books Hauerwas' book is not issue based offering a chapter on say abortion, war or any other issues). Instead however invites the reader to gain a insight into a christian ethics based not issues but the Christian story and the Community of God. This book is an excellent introduction to Hauerwas' thought that unlike his other essay based books reads very well.  One of the advantages of this edition is the helpful postscript Hauerwas has written marking the twenty years since the book's initial publication. Twenty years on Hauerwas still claims this is the most helpful introduction to his thought, I tend to agree 
 Dr. Vliet's newest book is a super addition to the others! As a sufferer of PCOS, I found this book to present a thorough understanding of the condition, filled with medically sound advice.  She exposes the common practice of doctors prescribing mood-stabilizers for womens emotional problems, instead of checking blood hormone levels. She discusses the various diagnostic tests that should be performed, as well as drug therapies, including important information on oral contraceptive and Hormone Replacement Therapy. (I have my own mixed views on the use of OC's for PCOS due to the blood clot risks, but can appreciate her approach and reasoning behind recommending them, though they are certainly not for every woman).  Also recommended, are sensible alternative/nutritional approaches, along with advice on overcoming the emotional effects of the disorder. I really connected with the patient stories. Overall, this book is a validating, holistic approach to treating the complexities of PCOS.  I highly recommend it to patients, and their physicians 
 I believe in giving credit where it's due.The Bee Gees piece of this album (4 new songs and 1 song from the year B4) alone make this a classic.But you add "Boogie Shoes" (Originally a K.C & The Sunshine Band B-Side),Yvonne Eliman's "If I Can't Have You" (The original Bee Gees' version was the B-side to the "Stayin' Alive" single and can be found on "Greatest") and the sublime,long version of "Disco Inferno" and you have a pretty good album. Originally released as a double album late 1977,today's CD technology allowed it to be released on one CD. I only spoke of 8 songs,that leaves 9 more really not bad songs 
 Reading a screenwriting book by Dr. Linda Seger is like taking a hundred meetings with Hollywood's best writers and directors, and listening in as Seger helps them mold their stories and scripts into a hit. Seger's experiences are vast, and she's generous with her advice, which is smart, visual, commercial, and practical. If you do what she says, your chances at selling and getting your screenplay made are tremendously magnified. Making a Good Script Great, for instance, is one of those books that every screenwriter should read (again-and-again) before starting the next project. A good screenplay is complex and sophisticated, but must read simply, easily, and enjoyably. The task is a multifaceted, intense, and long-suffering. Seger, however, provides the chisels and rouges to take your diamond in the rough, sharpen its edges, and polish its faces, until your script gleams and sparkles like a Hollywood star.  Linda's writing was helpful in the writing of my own book on screenwriting published by Michael Wiese Productions -- THE MORAL PREMISE: Harnessing Virtue and Vice for Box Office Success 
 This book has some great recipes, very easy and yet the food tastes very sophisticated.  The BBQ chicken and potato salad are the best I've ever had.  The only negative is that there aren't many beef or pork options and seems a bit more female oriented but overall a good buy 
 Finally you Can Understand Her! Women, complicated and impossible to understand? Do you love and want to please the woman in your life, but just can't seem to figure her out? That was before For Men Only . Now at your fingertips is the tool that will unlock the secret to her mysterious ways. Through hundreds of interviews and the results of a scientific national survey of women, this book demonstrates that women are actually not random and that they really can be systematized and mapped. In fact, much to men's delight, this book shows that women are actually quite easy to understand and please as long as you know what it is they need. This simple map will guide you to loving your wife or girlfriend in the way she needs to be loved 
 I would like to focus my review on the bonus dvd. The actual cd, Digit is the start of Klaus Schulze's digital period (hence the title) and for many fans, including myself this is where they step off. That is why I didn't give it 5 stars. Buy it for the dvd!  Okay its not really officially "industrial" music. However, Klaus Schulze playing live at a steel factory with the workers going through a day's work in the background is obviously a nod to the then burgeoning industrial movement. He plays on digital synths but then refocuses his energy and plays some music from "X" (one of his best albums) on his huge Moog set up.  This is a television performance and the cross cutting can get a little annoying but when you see Klaus Schulze coaxing fascinating sounds out of the Moog, it makes everything worth it 
 This is an excellent source for those who already have some knowledge of eating disorders and want a more in depth look at the behaviors and histories often associated with them.  For those who are new to the  subject, I recommend Mary Pipher's book Hunger Pains 
 My daughter (now 18 months) recieved this for her 1st birthday.  She loves it, especially at bedtime.  The only annoying thing is she usually doesn't grab it until I have turned the lights down to get her to calm down for bed and then she holds it up towards the light and cries until I get up, turn the light back on and hold it to the light to make it glow.  I never knew the ears and toes glowed though until I read the description, maybe I just didn't pay attention.  But I always focused the light on the nose and tummy so I will have to try the ears and feet next time. : 
 Great retro holiday record.  Also look for Royal Crown Revue's contribution on Maybe This Christmas Tree, equally as charming 
 Forget Disney's version of Mulan!    Robert San Souci's adaptation fleshes the simple storyline, symbolism and imagery of the original Chinese poem, with imaginative use of  details such as the use of The Art of War by Mulan as a commander.  In addition, Mulan's filial piety is portrayed fittingly as she sought her parent's approval to join the army instead of running away from home. Mulan's feelings of romance for her comrades and fear of punishment by her ruler serve to endear us, just as her courage and wits impress us, making this a tale suitable for the young and old 
 This man is so prolific! Hes been drawing the family Circus for decades now! This reminds me so much of what American life is all about, each cartoon does. Those ghosts are so funny, and so are the little children's  malapropisms. Bill Keane does poignantly  capture the American family's  essence 
 The Life of Moses is two books in one. The first one deals with the history of Moses. The second takes accounts from this history and explains their meaning. Gregory not only demystifies Moses' lifeby explaining the symbolic meaning of it's events("The master of deciet endeavors to turn the drink of the Hebrews into blood by polluting it with falsehood",page 69), he also encourages the reader to apply the beliefs to his/her own life("The firmer and more immovable one remains in the good, the more he progresses in the course of virtue",page 117). He even explains why God resides in the heavens("The divine is by it's very nature infinite, enclosed by no boundry", page 236). This is a very good book for anyone in the Judeo-Christian community, but need not be limited to that group alone. It is thought provoking enough to appeal to theologians, and the heavy use of metaphor reminded me of some of the writings from eastern religions 
 Great stuff as ever from Bill Fitzhugh.  As well as the usual endearing characters, a fun plot that breezes along, and plenty of smiles, there's also tons of interesting stuff about classic rock and radio stations which had me reaching for my CD wish list.  Bill Fitzhugh has a real knack for making even his not so nice characters likeable, and sometimes even loveable.  Left me with a good feeling for days after I finished it.  Can't wait for the follow up 
 If you can get past all the extraneous material (such as the highly negative introduction and footnotes) which seem to be working overtime to make sure you *don't* like this book, you will find it to contain many truly inspiring pieces of political wisdom, put forward with a rhetorical flair and energy that keep you turning the pages, even if you may not agree with everything he states. There's nothing "tortured" about the prose at all (try reading Spengler -- there's some tortured prose for you.) Of course, Hitler was writing as an ordinary, self-educated man: he makes no claim to be an academic or even a professional writer. We must remember that this was written in 1925 while he was imprisoned for political activism. He had served bravely in the disastrous Great War of 1914-1918, was severely wounded, no doubt saw many of his buddies killed on the front lines -- only to come home to economic and political chaos and despair. That would be enough to make any man highly angry and bitter. But Hitler didn't just sit around and mope, he did something about it; he became active in politics and put forward a philosophy that, though it has its detractors, is still "controversial" eighty years later. And despite the hypocrisy of those who publish this book (repeating how badly written it's supposed to be), it's still a worldwide bestseller, so *someone* must be reading it. And the publishers don't mind cashing the checks either -- if they were sincere they would put it into the public domain and wash their hands of it. BTW: go for the new black cover edition -- it's a huge aesthetic improvement over that really ugly old orange edition 
 This was a required text for my Small Business Management class. I am usually not too fond of textbooks. But this one really sparked my interest. If there were ever a step-by-step guide for starting your own company, this is it. It is very easy to understand. It was written in clear English without any severely technical terms, so you don't feel like you need your MBA before you read the thing. Anything remotely complicated, it breaks down into realy simple terms. I really enjoyed this book. Its not very often you come acroos a textbook you wouldn't mind reading even if you're not taking the class 
 Good clear prsentation of the various facits of the stock market. Designed for the novice. Does the job in good fashio 
 I ordered this particular bunco set because the company's description said it was PINK!  I received a very ugly cream and red set.  
 The sweeping symbolizism in the three colors trilogy culminates in the end of rouge, the excellent concluding chapter,  where the major characters from the trilogy are saved. This last story-- involving the seven primary characters from the three movies, who are loaded with the full human range of flaws and problems-- tells how they all recieved the same reprive.    The triology, and particularly Rouge, can be seen as a counterpoint to the conclusions derived from the dreary, sad decologue. It tells us that there is hope, order and purpose in the mayhem and chaos of life. 
 This book was well written for folks like me - those having relatively little farm experience in the process building a flock.  As I am still learning, only time will tell if all the counsel was well founded - however, the advice thus far has made good sense to me and focussed me on executing the fundamentals well.  Most importantly, the boys and girls in my care seem to be doing fine 
 This software seems brilliant - does a very accurate job of scanning and decoding. It could be improved by allowing for multiple page scans (without having to set a timer for page insert)It will defintely save you time. IT does not appear to have an page storage/filing system like some ocr programs but 5 Stars for its scanning and decoding.  Registration becomes a problem if you have to reinstall the software several times (I redo my computer frequently), it is not smart enough to know it is the same machine and forces you to contact technical support. MS Office will recognise its the same machine so its not a hassle.  If you are interested in document storage and filing on the computer then other ocr might be a better choice. If you want ACCURATE page scanning for modification and changes I would MOST HIGHLY recommend this software. 
 I've been dealing with computer networks in theory and practice for quite some time. This book is excellent reference and give in depth details and knowledge. The structure is well designed and the materials are following each other. If you are looking for a startup book though, this might not be the right choice 
 This movie is by far the best documentary I have ever seen! Having worked in the music industry, I've seen a lot of the "fake" artists out there. We all know that the industry needs a shake up, and I thiink this is the best start yet. It's about time they started bringing attention to the flaws in a lot of artists, and pointing out how studio magic fixes their flaws. And it's sad that they can bring this technology into live shows now. The harsh realities stated by some of the artists interviewed is quite sad at times. Things like "Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder. They wouldn't even be looked at today. It's because they're blind." Thanks for saying that Branford.  It's largely because the industry is focused on image, and what can sell. It's got nothing to do with music anymore. Jeff Healey (who's not in this doco) has a club in his hometown Toronto, with t-shirts reading "Close your eyes and listen". There are so many talented people out there. You just have to close your eyes and listen. The interviews with artists like Bonnie Raitt, Erikah Badu, Doyle Bramhall II, Branford Marsalis. These are all exceptionally talented and real people who should be given a lot more credit for what the contribute to music. They get recognition from their peers, but why not from the record labels. So if you want to know more on how the music industry works, and see a LOT of great music, get this DVD now! You will not be disappointed 
 This story is one of the best I've read. Talk about a "page turner". Downside....I didn't get much else done after I got to Chapter 4 
 This is one of a series of books which features Dr.Alex Delaware, a young, handsome and wealthy psychologist. At a rather ritzy party, he meets Sharon, an incredibly beautiful young psychologist with whom he had a brief fling some years previously. Drawn to her despite many misgivings, he is caught up in a web of lies, deceit and intrigue which culminate in several gruesome murders. The plot involves a now deceased but sinister mega millionaire who is a direct copy of Howard Hughes, complete with matted beard, long, filthy fingernails and all of his unattractive anal retention habits. The story becomes more and more involved, using identical triplet sisters, mentally retarded carers and a Svengali like therapist who controls Sharon. At times I was muttering"hurry up and get on with it" but, in all, an entertaining read 
 This book was really interesting, and what made it so interesting was the way every single passage was made with lively characteristics. Every single thing in the story was put with so much characteristics, that i thought i was really there living the same tragedy. What i also liked was the way the many different perspectives were made to make ONE SINGLE CONNECTION. Everybody lived that same life and everybody gave their effort to make a different living out of what they had already experienced. The only thing that disappointed me was the constant usage of wings and blood, which made me think that they were symbolically placed there, but it just made me more confused about what i was reading. I don't want to comment a lot about the book because then i will throw off that main idea, but this is a nice book if you are trying to experience the reality of what is still going on to this day on Earth 
 I grew up reading about John Carter & Barsoom & loved the whole series for the imagination Burroughs used. Altho not a worry back then, it's nice to read a book without profanity now. I wish Steven Spielberg  would make movies out of these books, they would be SO exciting & fun 
 Billy Bob co-wrote and stars in this tightly woven, deeply textured, well-written off-beat thriller about a couple of drug dealers heading from CA to AK; combines the personal, the interpersonal, the deviant, with an unusual love story embedded craftily in the middle.  This was on Roger Ebert's top ten list the year it came out.  Although there are a couple of plot flaws, it works well enough to keep you anticipating the "showdown," because these seem to be authentic people trapped in a tragic destiny.  This is a rare type of film nowadays: the kind that comes from the heart, not from the sterile factories of M.F.A. programs and lunkhead studios.  
 I really recommend this book, I couldn't put it down. If you are a small business owner and looking for a way to get out there. This book will definetly help you out. 
 this is one of the classics of victorian erotica and definitelyworth reading. it depicts a womans path to prostitution with none ofthe attached moral lectures and is a good buy 
 It's amazing when you read some of DS stories, and they are written from a man's point of view...I'm a woman, but I think she does a very convincing job of placing herself & the reader in their shoes.  This is such a great story, I like to read about places & things I haven't experienced.  And this story takes you to a place & life style not everyone knows, it's very interesting 
 This book is a must read for entrepreneurs and wealth seekers. There is a saying "Even if you are the greatest jockey in the world, you have to be on the right horse to be a winner". The streams of income Mr. Allen suggests in this book are the RIGHT HORSES that should be pursued - those that ultimately generate residual income. In addition, the concept of diversification of income sources is a key concept to be taken from this book. I have given a 4 stars rating only because the action steps are a bit limited in scope - understandable though as it covers a lot of grounds. This book helped me understand where to begin to put my efforts/energy towards and conceptualize/visualize how my income sources should look like going forward. Although it seems overwhelming after you read the entire book, if you break down the concepts and pursue generating the income streams one by one, i think achiveing financial independence is definitely possible.

 If you want a better compilation, maybe buy the Metallogy-Box or just all of their records...By the way, to the insulting coment of: "Anywhere but a red state" - seems like your parents are brother and sister from somewhere behind the cowbarn of Yankee doodle redneck United States of A..holes. Long live the leather- Queens and especially the NERDS OF INDIA!! 
 Very rarely does a book deliver on its promises.  To have a book deliver while presenting a new, fresh idea about instruction is truly a gift that teachers and instructors in every field should take advantage of.  Katherine Dowling's book manages to offer much more then standard fare: "Side By Side" shows exactly how much parents and children can truly benefit from each other in the writing process.  The ideas presented here are meant to help both parent and child reach their full potential as writers, thinkers, and comunicators.  I can't imagine how this book and the ideas presented in it would not benefit anyone open to experiencing the joys of writing with their child 
  	Were someone to write a biography of Carl Hiassin in fifty years it is hard to imagine that he or she wouldn't focus on the author's latest triumph, Skinny Dip. It is one of his seminal achievements. The book simply shines with humor, well drawn characters, action and as usual everyone gets their just desserts. It is also one of his smoothest rides. One gets the feeling that Hiassin was very confident in every sentence that he wrote. 	Here is an overview that will stimulate readers' interest Hiassin's. The book opens with Chaz trying to kill his wife by flinging her over the rail of their cruise ship, but by some twists and turns and luck Joey survives long enough to be rescued. Much of the rest of the book circles around the characters interactions and relationships as Joey and her team pursue vengeance. By the midpoint of the novel Chaz is already an emotional wreck and it doesn't look like Joey is about to let up any time soon.  	The moral backbone of the novel is twofold. One is the pitting of the Everglades Forest and her defenders against big business and her pollutants. The Everglades is quickly turning from pristine swamp into another type of ecosystem entirely and many Floridians want to prevent the remaining land from being destroyed, which means millions of dollars loss to the big agricultural business. Hiassin's two segments on the real life plight of this swamp standout a bit apart from the book, but also lends it a feeling of seriousness. 	And two is the pitting of criminals against victims who aren't going to take it anymore.  Hiassin is at his when he reapetedly refers to the attempted murder as an insult to Joey. As most survivors of violent crime can ascertain there is a severe indignity attached to one's helplessness.  	There are six main characters in the book: Joey and her horny husband Chaz, Joey's rescuer Mick who is a kind and eccentric ex-policeman who lives alone on an island, Joey's brother, a rich expatriate who raises sheep in New Zealand, Mr. Hammernut, the owner of a large agricultural empire and Tool, the books muscled goon who undergoes a moral transformation. The small group of sub-characters is entertainingly populated in part with a hermit who lives in the swamp, a street-tough hairdresser, a slap-happy senior and a cowardly lawyer.   	Though similar elements live in many of Hiassin's works his books never feel like he has used a formula to create them more easily. This can't be said for all or most of crime writers and should be accredited to Hiassin's love for storytelling, his skill as a plot weaver and his ability to evoke so many different emotions. In this line of thought this reviewer took note of the characters subtle (except for Tool) character changes throughout the book. Joey for example seemed learn a bit more restraint as she calmed down a little and the same can be said even for characters that have appeared in some of Hiassin's previous works (Mick). 	Hiassin has never been a fan of superficial materialism, but the issue is slightly complicated by Skinny Dip and does not simply fall into place along character axes. While the villains all crave money some of the heroes are loaded too. Joey maintains a very frugal existence considering her $ 13 million trust, but her brother spends lavishly. Joey's rescuer on the other hand lives on a disability check. One may wonder if the only difference between Chaz and his wife is that she never had to work or hustle for a buck, but there is one other way in which the enemies contrast and that is the way they treat their associates. Chaz is continuously scrambling for something and in his desperation - be it for sex, money, or escape - uses other people as tools rather than relating to them as equals. On the other hand, Joey has a good sense of humor and she enjoys the companionship of her pals. 	Like most of Hiassin's work this book is not an overly violent one. Although it begins with an attempted murder, the event is quite peaceful. There is no struggle, no blood and the victim, Joey, does not die.  	After reading Skinny Dip I immediately lent it to my best friend Katie who has not been able to put it down. So, potential readers be warned: Like Katie you may not be able to get any work done for a day or two, but the time is not wasted on Hiassin's best work to date. One comes away gaining not only pleasant memories of laughs and smiles, but also the feeling that one has poured one more drop into the bucket of our minds that we must fill in order to make this world a better place. In short, Carl Hiassin puts us in touch with the good guys in ourselves 
 This book promised to give the best information on pattern design and it delivered all that was promised 
 West always reminds me of Fitzy. Extremely cynical views on love and the America dream 
 This account of the Wars of Israel from the War of Independence is written with fairness and a real attention to the facts. Herzog can fault Israel, and is aware of mistakes but points out to the essentially defensive character of the Jewish state's major military actions. As a participant in the War of Independence and as the major commentator and in fact ' national spokesman' in the 1967 war he well understands Israeli society from inside. He has great military knowledge and shows this in detailed explanations of the battle. Considering however the tremendous drama of the events involved the work is a bit less humanly moving than it could have been had he written more personally about the major characters involved 
 I brought this book with me a month ago for my first trip to London a month ago and reread it for likely the fourth time in 40 years under an oak tree in Hyde Park. Ranking along with Flowers for Adonis as one of Sutcliff's most bleak but sweeping books, The Lantern Bearers features a a classically great and complex hero who is a tough, thorny, quiet brooder caught between old and new worlds. As both the young romantic risking all to give his world one last blaze of hope and the bitter  general fighting to hold back the enemy tide, Aquila is an engrossing study of a man trying to make sense of his duties to his families, friends, and ruler. The choices he is forced to make at the twilight of British-Roman England are heartbreaking but of a piece with the man and his world.  Arguably the most complete of Sutcliff's novels as she weaves the bits of recorded history into a tale that pulls together an important era for England, this a hard but rewarding novel. Full of great settings including the Roman lighthouse, Saxon war camp, British mountain stronghold, and various battlefields, the book also includes the dolphin ring that ties together a string of Sutcliff's novels from early Roman Britain to Norman England as she highlights the many peoples who made England.   
 Proper is a newer label out of the U.K. that focuses on boxed-set compilations of some great American music - and not just jazz. This Lester Young compilation is amazing, especially for the price. Mostly all of Prez' classic early stuff is included - with Basie, Holiday - but what floored me was the inclusion of some of the 1943-44 (immediately before Lester had to go into the war) material with the small Basie groups including Slam Stewart, Sid Catlett, Buck Clayton, Freddie Green, and the "Kansas City Seven, Six, and Five": namely "Afternoon of a Basie-ite", "Destination K.C.", and more. I have most of this stuff scattered on various LPs ("The Lester Yong Story Vols. 1-5" on Columbia, and the aformentioned tracks with alternates on the Emarcy label) but to have a set like this on CD for this low of a price is a dream come true for anyone interested in Prez' best stuff. Yes, his post-war material is still good and valid, but there can be no doubt that this is the cream. I have only a few complaints: Where is "Evenin'" with Jimmy Rushing and the Count? That is one of Lester's classic solos and a classic Basie tune. I could easily do without "Blitzkrieg Baby", an RCA recording with Una Mae Carlisle in 1941. But that is nit-picking. Proper has many other great box sets of Coleman Hawkins, Charlie Parker, and more, with great pictures and presentation. Someone has the right idea. It will be interesting to see which takes of some of these they have chosen. As a huge fan of 'alternate takes' myself, that is an important part of a great compilation. I see no way to go wrong with this set 
 World War II was over, and the imperial way of life that had brought it and its predecessor seemed to be crumbling. India, the Philippines, and other nations had gained their independence. France had lost Indochina to communist rebels, and around the hills and scattered towns of Algeria they were facing a new threat. A true danger, however, came in Algiers when the FLN, the proponent behind the revolution, began terrorist attacks against the French quarter of the city.  Gillo Pontecorvo's "The Battle of Algiers" focuses on the Algerian struggle against French rule, as well as French retaliation for the terrorist acts. However, it looks at this conflict from both sides equally, and the French are never dehumanized to any degree. As Colonel Mathieu, the man in charge of most operations, says to his men, "There are over 400,000 Arabs in Algiers. Are they all our enemies? We know they're not." Through out the film he is very respectful and admirable of the FLN leaders and their strong faiths. Spike Lee, in an interview on the DVD's many features, says that even though Colonel Mathieu claims the French are not Nazis or sadists since many French officers fought against the fascists, they really are. I don't think director Gillo Pontecorvo would agree at all with that statement. In an interview on the DVD he says that it was important to get in the minds of both sides, and so there was no reason to portray the French paratroopers as monsters, specifically mentioning the SS. No scene drove this home to me more than the scene where an angry French crowd mobs a young Arab boy, beating him near death until a French policeman dives into the violence, sweeps the boy in his arms, and darts away from danger. Would you expect to see an SS soldier do the same for a Jewish boy assaulted by a German crowd? The blame of this conflict is not on the French paratroopers or the French themselves but, as Pontecorvo says, on "the error on error and transigince of colonialism."  Sadly, I think much of this is lost on today's audience. Many TV clips or documentaries that mention the film will show French atrocities but not a single bit of French dead or the acts of Algerian terrorism. I've even seen (and I swear I'm not making this up) the scene where French paratroopers spot terrorists disguised as women re-edited and the subtitles changed to make it look like the French are firing on unarmed women. That's the problem with most political films nowadays - they are self-serving or one-sided, meant only to "preach to the converted" (as Mira Nair says in the DVD's interview) - and it is so hard for people to admit that maybe, possibly, the person they disagree with could be in the right. The film doesn't take that route: when Algerians are killed from a bomb placed by French officers, sad music plays; when French civilians are killed by Algerian bombs the same sad music plays. Life has an equal value no matter what your cause or nationality may be. Nowadays, the Algerians would be portrayed as strong, upright moral people who were fighting demons, and the paratroopers really would be portrayed like the SS.   The film also looks at issues of counterterrorism often overlooked by reviewer and critic alike, such as the role of the press. When asked by reporters if he can win the war, Colonel Mathieu responds that "it depends on you," saying that they need to give him "political will, which is sometimes there and sometimes isn't."  Gillo Pontecorvo, with experience in documentary work, shoots his film much like a documentary. Specific characters will have their background read to the audience by a narrator, and dates and times will be captioned under events. However, this doesn't make you feel distant from the characters and they are allowed to develop. The filmmaking is astounding, with camera work and use of music that seemed ahead of their time, or at least something you would not expect to see in a film from the mid-60's. One of my favorite shots came from the end, where a French policeman shouts into a rioting crowd, "What do you want?" and we watch the crowd slowly move through the smoke, shouting for independence.  It's clear to everyone that the film touches the subject of terrorism and counterterrorism, as well as political and social issues. It's easy to name-drop current events and locations, but I personally think this detracts from the point of the film, which is stronger than that. Historical events happen only once - ideas and concepts are eternal 
 This book gives good insight about the history of the most famous street in america.  A must have book for any business person or studen

 Madeline Hunter's writing style is pure joy to read.  Even when the plot is not altogether exceptional, her writing is so exquisite that her books are a pleasure to read.  This book in the series is no expcetion.  Her characters have maturity and depth - who wouldn't fall in love with Julian ?  Integrity, loyalty, strength, passion - he has it all.  The only criticism if at all is that Madeline's heroines tend to be victims - bullied and controlled by men and requiring salvation from other men.  Nevertheless, I am now starting on her next book - Lord of Sin 
 I read a negative review of this show but I just watched it and it was better than foretold.  I expect it will do better than people think.  It's basically a Danielle Steele novel come to life.  Courtney Cox is a somewhat stern and enigmatic publisher of a Los Angeles gossip magazine.  The other characters are troubled celebrities (who have sex a lot).  The show feels very contemporary.  It is definitely a drama.  Despite moments of levity, it is basically a dramatic story.    In any case, my bet is that this show will get better and that naysayers are jumping the gun.  
 47 joins the rare pantheon of young adult literature that is badly mislabled.  This is simple literature at its most illuminating, haunting best.  This is not a read just younger children.  However this should be read and interpreted by an adult to elementary school children who need to understand the horror that was American slavery but also the strength and fortitude it took to survive.  It should be read by everyone else because it is a fabulous story well told.  Mosely is a gifted, gifted writer and here's hoping that young and old of all cultures experience his unique gift 
 This is the first book review I've written since about sixth grade. That is how strongly I feel about Melissa Fay Greene's new book.  She tells the story of so many amazing people working to make a difference in the current desperation of Ethiopia.  Her description of grief from a child or adult's perspective will literally knock you over.  My husband and I wept through some of the experiences she tells.  The amazing thing about this book, though, is that while her writing is honest and beautiful, she also masterfully weaves in the background that gives us a world context for the individual stories she writes of.  She educates and enlightens us about the politics, history, and science that affect the current state of AIDS in Africa.  At a time when Americans have almost forgotten the horror of AIDS, this is the most important book of our time.  I don't believe you can read "There is No Me Without You" and not be challenged to act.  You will find yourself considering adoption, activism, missionary work, or at least supporting the people who act on their beliefs.  You will have the passion and the most up-to-date information on AIDS available to educate those around you about what is really going on, and what could help.  I considered myself a compassionate and aware person before, but I can never be the same after reading Ms. Greene's book.  I truly hope that anyone who ever considered adoption will pick this up.  You won't regret it, and neither will the lives that you choose to touch because of "There is No Me Without You" 
 Okay, so not every song on here is great, or even good.  There's a lot of crap, especially in the second half.  Still, when this album is good, it's really good.  Take "Headache", or "Abstract Plain", or "Ole Mulholland", which all prove that Frank Black is great, with or without the Pixies.  And what's even more impressive is the variety of musical styles he uses.  There are some all-out rockers, but there are a lot of catchy pop numbers, too, like the aforementioned "Headache", or the quiet (dare I say romantic, even), "Sir Rockabye".    If you like the Pixies, or even if you don't (which I don't see being possible, but... whatever), this is the album that will prove just how good Frank Black can be on his own.  Forget about his first solo album, which is good, but way too overrated.  This is the one to get 
 I had never owned a devotional Bible before purchasing this one, but being that I'm 37 and a mother of two I thought maybe it was time to treat myself. I am so glad I did. There are a couple of features that I really like in the Bible. First, the devotionals give me a good guideline on what point I should read to at minimum. I often find myself getting through three devotionals plus the scripture reading per evening. I also absolutely love the "callouts" which are highlighted, framed verses found on various pages. There are 500 of those in this Bible, which are the verses that are often memorized. This Bible also has an easy-to-read double column format and in addition, the various stories are titled to make you take notice that a new story or concept is being presented. Also, within the devotions they point to additional scriptural reading to be found elsewhere in the Bible that directly relate to where you are in scripture. I love that feature!!!  The fonts are beautiful and I love the format of the devotionals. I cannot imagine a better format. Women, if you need a new devotional Bible or have never have one by any means please treat yourself today 
 Part-time P'town resident William Mann's Wisecracker was the first (and definitive) bio of Haines, on of the silent era's greatest stars and one of its first certified heartthrobs. But Haines was gay---something eh refused to hide---and when MGM honcho fired him. Haines began a new (and much more lucrative career) as a self-taught decorator. His work graced the homes of Joan Crawford, Marion Davies, Constance Bennett, and mega-watt socialites Alfred and Betsy Bloomingdale an d Walter and Lee Annenberg; even in his death in 1973, Haines` legacy followed, with his associate Ted Graber in charge of the dï¿½cor of Ronald and Nancy Reagan`s private riddance at the white House. This coffee table book is the price of a good steak dinner (with wine), but the hungry of film fans and stylists and interior designers will long be satisfied by the intellectual text and more than 300 vintage and rare drawing, illustrations and photos 
 A great cast with Jack Lemon and Betty Garrett doing a great job together and Bob Fosse showing why he is among the greatest dancers of our time 
 The loss of one's pride while the accentuation of one's innocence is the irony that made "Tess of the D'Urbivilles" one of the boldest and most honest novels to come out of the 19th century. Thomas Hardy's novel about a girl who is disgraced by the society that destroyed her is compelling and controversal, and in my eyes, difficult to transport onto the screen. Yet somehow, this adaptation of the Hardy classic, though different in some ways, is successful in bringing out the travesty, tragedy, and short-lived passion of a girl whose pride is ripped away from her bit by bit, yet through it all remains pure and innocent.  Justine Waddell was so captivating as Tess, embodying all the sadness and diminishing hope of her character. I was particularly impressed how as the film progressed, (especially in the final half-hour or so), Tess's once bright and accepting outlook on life turns dead, replaced by bitterness and dismay. Waddell did a clever job in portraying these opposite traits with subtlety and care.   Olvier Milbern was a good choice for Angel Clare. I liked how his physical presence stepped somewhat outside the stereotype of other men at that time. Conventional slicked back hair and spotless suits were replaced by a slight grubby, rebellious twist. This was good in bringing out Angel's emotional removal from normal 19th Century society. It was a simple, yet successful element.  I did not, however, care for Jason Flemyng's portrayal of the dislikable Alec, whose very exploitment of Tess is the reason for her terrible downfall. I thought Flemyng's performance was laboured and weak, and he did not blend well into his character's shoes at all. Generally, I thought his acting was poor, which is rather unusual for him.  That aside, for me, the film's greatest part was the heartbreaking final scene at Stonehenge. Broken and disgraced (not to mention a fugitive) Tess spends her final happy, passionate hours with Angel on the quiet dark hills next to the ancient ruins. This scene moved me greatly. The presence of the stones  represented her family's distant connection to an ancient lineage. Angel's redeemed love for her, dispite everyting, is the most precious gift Tess could ever receive. But fate it seems is unsympathetic, and her dark past traps her once and for all. It's just so sad.  So, I was really impressed with this film. The scenery and bittersweet musical theme added extra essence to this great adaptation of Thomas Hardy's original story. As the film's bright opening progresses towards its climactic and heartbreaking end, we are forever reminded of a girl who lost everything to Fate... except her innocence. 
 One of my meditation leaders recommends this book and uses similar meditations in small groups.  The book goes into more detail than the small group has time to do.  But, I found the meditations easy to read and comprehend.  This book has extended my meditation practice with both breadth and depth. 
 Bewitched is one of the best shows ever. Forty years later their still fun to watch. Each ep. is funny and well written. Samantha marries the mortal Darren and promises to give up her magic to the endless dismay of her mother the wonderful Endora but luckily somehow Samantha ends up using magic. Aunt Clara pops in often and creates her own chaos with her mix-up spells.  Every single ep. is my favorite. 
 Living A dream is a wonderful example of a couple retiring with a plan.  Although cruising to Newfoundland is not part of a typical retirement, Suzanne Giesemann has written a wonderful guide to a successful retirement.  Anyone delaying retirement because sitting at home is their future plan can broaden their options using Living A Dream as a pattern.    This is a well-written nonfiction book that moves along at a fast pace.  The descriptions of Newfoundland and its inhabitants will make cruisers more apt to follow Liberty to the cold north country.    I highly recommend this book.  
 Someone once told me I'd have a hard time relating to the story because I didn't grow up during the fifties. Although there were probably references to things I didn't understand, I enjoyed it immensely. 
 Let's face it.  Most audio cables are WAY over-priced (Monster in particular)!  These are priced where they should be and provide very satisfactory performance at the right price.  You might get a little better performance with a more expensive cable, but you'll have to pay 50% more to get just a small improvement (law of diminishing returns).  Buy these.  You'll probably never know (or hear) the difference 
 Not as good as her first book but has some good advise on cortisol control a real issue with both men and women. Especially women starting or going through menopause. I have been a Pharmacist for 30 years. I have seen many diets come and go, and Suzanne recommendation are was I teach my customers every day. Well worth buying. I have purchased 20 book to lend out to my customers so they can learn about themselves 
 This offers very important insights for those of us in the financial field. Based on Thorburn's statistics, I would imagine many financial advisors have seen the impact of addiction in their client's financial lives, but most have not been trained to recognize it. The ramifications are far-reaching.   I had the opportunity to interview Doug Thorburn about his book on my Internet radio show and it was an eye-opener to say the least.   This is a must read for anyone who work in a financial advisory capacity with clients. 
 This very informative book certainly helped me train my golden puppy--when all other attempts failed.  The book is concise, informative and written with a delightful sense of humor.  It would have been so much easier training over the years had I known about Kathy Santo's technique.  Everything she says makes so much sense--and is applicable to all dogs.  I'm giving the book to all my "dog loving" friends for an X-mas present this year.  Dog Sense certainly makes sense 
 While I dont believe Kelli O'Hara is the best Clara, (I prefer Katie Clarke actually), the compositions are rich with emotion.  You have to see the show to fully comprehend and absorb this.  And while the show comes of slightly Sondheim wanna-be, it still has excellent songs, but no one can right the disconances like Sondheim and the disconances in these pieces make no musical sense at points. My particular gripe with this show is "Auitami." Even when you see the show more than once and listen to the songs it makes no sense. It has NO MUSICALLITY!! This song ruins the second act.  It does not fit in with the show at all and makes the story go nowhere for quite a while.  However, there are a few tunes that stand out and really make the show excellent: The Beauty Is (and the Reprise)(My personal favorite) Passeggiata (May need to listen to a while, youll catch on) Say It Somehow (My other personal favorite) Dividing Day and Im beginning to like the title song The Light in the Piazza, its ok. Overall its a good show but not my favorite. As I mentioned before several of the songs dont make sense in the show or even musically at all. I cannot emphasize this enough, and Im not cutting on the vocalists they are terrific!!! Only on the compositions!!!!!!  If you want a good show with good musicallity that actually makes sense I suggest "Into the Woods", or "Assassins", or even "Sweeney Todd" All excellent shows written in a similar style.  
 people plz  ive had my ps2 a month after it came out ok i have had 2 controllers the ones i bought that day i play at least 8 or 9 hours during summer 4 to 5 hours a day during school year i have never had any problems at all my cousins have thrown these across the room at the wall when they get mad nothing happens these are very durable  
 brought back good memories of watching when it showed on TV, if anything the DVD enhances the picture and sound quality, waiting anxiously for season 1 
 this games is just great, i found funny to play everything in it almost like in the game, the controls are very easy, the graphics are quite nice, and the music too. great choice 
 Everyone will not understand of feel this story, however I loved the Glamorous Life and the Hustler's Wife.  If you have ever lived like Yarni/Bambi and tryto break away from the "addiction of the fast life,"  this book is a great way for you to relive the good times and remember the reason you left.  I loved it and waiting to read Forever the Hustler's Wife 
 An excellent description, not only of the Hydrogen atom, but the way that very simple structure informed scientists about more complex structures in the universe.  Very well written and not mathematically intense 
 While I like the general concepts behind agile development methodologies, sometimes they seem to be focused on speed with a disregard for any documentation.  Alistair Cockburn has an agile methodology that appears more palatable in today's environments...  Crystal Clear : A Human-Powered Methodology for Small Teams.  Contents: Explained (View from the Outside); Applied (The Seven Properties); In Practice (Strategies and Techniques); Explored (The Process); Examined (The Work Products); Misunderstood (Common Mistakes); Questioned (Frequently Asked); Tested (A Case Study); Distilled (The Short Version); References; Index  The tendency to want to compare Crystal Clear (CC) to XP is something that can't be ignored.  In fact, Cockburn addresses this in the Questioned section.  He sums it up by saying that XP is stricter in several ways and more loose in a few.  XP wants shorter iterations, CC can be longer. XP calls for pair programming, CC permits it.  XP requires a customer to be an active member of the team, CC wants easy access to one.  XP requires no documentation, CC does.  It's probably that last point that makes CC an easier sell in a business environment.  Some methodologies are documentation-heavy (like RUP) and some are documentation-absent (like XP).  CC strikes a balance between documenting what needs to be known and remembered by the group, without having multiple binders of paper as a "product" to explain every last iota of code.  While XP is the methodology that has all the mindshare these days, I think I feel more comfortable as a developer using something like CC.    If you're looking to slim down your development methodology or add some structure to a seemingly ad-hoc XP methodology, this book might be what you're looking for.. 
 I have read a number of books by survivors and the horrific accounts of abuse all seem believable to me.  I'm not sure who Emily is only hoping that it is not another means of disinformation.  My cousin's wife had a nervous breakdown due to past ritual abuse.  This is happening and it is real, make no mistake.  Sad but true.  If you really want an eye opener read this book.  People need to start pulling their heads out of the sand 
 This book tell the author's own real life experience in two years from 2002 to make  his way from an employee to a real estate investor. He shares his own lessons and experience, and knowledge to start from a small multifamily real estate.  By reading the author's real life success story, I believe his strategies really and still work today. Though the real estate market is becoming cool down, at a buyer's market, there will be more deals come. From long term, investments in multifamily can lead you to be a millionaire for sure.   The author told us in his book, everyone who sold his apartment in Boston area in the past 40 years, will feel regret if he know how much his properties worth today.  I'm living in Boston area, same as the author, and I'm going to follow his way

 See, I'm a huge fan of everything Japanese and anim, so of course, I love this CD.  I just bought it today and haven't listened to anything else.  The tracks that really stand out to me are:  Planet Tokyo Angel of Love Invisible Tomorrow (I love the ska influence in part of the music) Your Love is a Drug K2G (LOVE LOVE LOVE the ska sound with the Japanese lyrics) Shiawase(Happiness) Urei Teen Titans Theme (love the B-52's-style sound) Red Swing  Hell, I love the whole CD.  What got me interested in this group was the show 'Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi' on Cartoon Network.  I recommend this group to everyone 
 i remember the 1st time i heard sublime...i was 10 and heard wrong way and loved it on MTV......but then i didnt listen to them again until my friend gave me the self titled CD for my birthday and i now have a bunch of their CD's and stuff......but this review is for Stand By Your Van....got this for christmas and it hasnt left my CD player in my car....its amazing.. my favorite songs are date rape (classic) and dont push...if you liked 40 oz. to freedom and the self titled its really good plus its got some songs from robbin the hood.......shows the emotion and just amazing music that Bradley, Bud, and Eric had created until May 1996, when Bradley died due to a drug overdose....now some people say o well he deserved to die for being a herion user....well bradley was different he was a family man who had gotten married just a few short weeks b4 that fateful day.....the sad thing was that he worked hard 2 get clean after being sent home from self titled CD recordings due to drug use......it was just that one time relapse that did him in and killed the leader of my favorite band of all time.......also i love the song pool shark...listen to the lyrics....he knew he was gonna lose the war...but now at the very least Bradley is out of the hell his drug use created and we fans are left with the music created by a musical god......  RIP Bradley James Nowell 1968-1996 May your soul be saved now and forever...... 
 I reread this recently and I laughed as much as I did the first time I read it.  David Sedaris is quite a national treasure even though most people don't know who he is!  His writing is wonderful, poignant, sentimental and hilarious.  The man knows how to write well and you can tell he continues to love his craft.  I don't think I have read a book that made me laugh as much as this one did.  I think I had to put this book down at least a hundred times and walk away from it because I was laughing too hard.  You know, the kind of laughing that causes mild asphyxiation.    This book is delirious with humor and great story telling.  A must read for anyone who wants to have a wonderful reading experience.  I don't see how you could miss with Me Talk Pretty One Day 
 Oustanding book. Great stories along with the pain and pleasure of the restoration process.  Despite my MS in Mechnical Engineerign and owning two Porsches I learned a good deal  from reading this very entertaining book. 
 I was amazed at the depth of this book. Chapter after chapter Wells was able to pin point weaknesses and compromises being made daily in our churches. This book is not just a for pastors and clergy, its a laity book that takes the reader into areas of church life that will make or break Christianity. 
 As a fan of Shakespeare (both on the stage/screen and written page), I have added to my appreciation by reading various works about this playwright.  First there was Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare, which was a well-written commentary on the historical contexts of the plays.  Then, there was Harold Bloom's Shakespeare, The Invention of the Human, a scholarly work offset by a tone of high-toned intellectual snobbery and condescension.  Now, there is Shakespeare After All, a work that fits between these two in quality.  In Shakespeare After All, Marjorie Garber's 900+ page tome on the Bard's plays, we are given an opportunity to learn more of what makes Shakespeare Shakespeare.  As a long-time Harvard and Yale lecturer on Shakespeare, Garber certainly has the credentials and experience to back up her extensive essays on the plays.  If there is a problem with the book, it is only that she is perhaps too familiar with the plays and is unable to be truly critical of them.  The book begins with a lengthy introduction which serves as a biography of Shakespeare and provides a bit of historical context for his body of work.  Then we get a chapter on each of thirty-eight plays, including The Two Noble Kinsmen, which is not always included in Shakespeare collections.  The plays are presented in rough chronological order and focus only secondarily on plot, with a greater emphasis on character and the use of language.    Garber is a good writer, and each chapter is insightful.  As this is written more as a collection of essays, there is not always perfect continuity between chapters and there is more than a little redundancy (which I suppose does make this easier to read this work in portions or out of order). As stated before, however, the principal flaw in her writing is that she refuses to say anything really critical about any of the plays.  In Garber's view, Shakespeare batted 1.000, all hits and no misses.  Henry VIII seems to be just as worthy of merit as Othello or Hamlet.   Furthermore, there are no mistakes; any apparent contradictions or omissions are cleverly intended, not just an error.  Certainly, Shakespeare is worth a lot of praise.  When you consider what he did - writing over three dozen plays with an adeptness that is readily apparent - he is definitely deserving of the title "genius," but he wasn't perfect.  It would be nice if Garber acknowledged this, but her strengths clearly outweigh her weaknesses, and if you are interested in learning more about Shakespeare's plays, this is a worthwhile way to get that education. 
 All have already been said about this book. Planning to program in C? Buy this book 
 This book has it all! It has a very likable Hero and Heroine, great secondary characters, a tightly woven adventure story that is very fast paced, and sizzling HOT HOT romance scenes that are very passionate. Even the ending was the most satisfying ending I've read in a romance in a long, long time. Wow, GREAT book!! "If You Dare" is a great adventure story that unites two very different people into a deeply passionate romance. Though the romance takes time to build, by the time it does it becomes sizzling. Court (our hero) is a solid HE-MAN. There is nothing soft or wimpy about this guy. Love him!! Though all romance novels have the predicable "happily ever after" ending, this one makes it really hard to guess HOW they are going to make it. The dilemma they face is based on their love for each other, which just tugs at the heart. I am very impressed with Kresley Cole's writing. I now have all her other books on rush order so I can start devouring them this weekend.  
 I am a culinary student and this book was a required purchase.  It is very detailed and has great photos.  I also love the questions at the end of each chapter, but unfortunately no answers.  The baking section is very good too, but I was having a little bit of trouble getting through those particular courses.  After buying the Study Guide for Baking and Study Guide for Advance Baking I was able to get a passing grade. It asks and answered all the questions I was looking for 
 "Less Than Angels" is full of classic Pym characters: the eccentric, Alaric Lydgate, who sits in the evenings with an African mask on and wishes it were permissable to wear it out in public; Rhoda Wellcome and  Mabel Swan, sisters, Rhoda given to peering at the neighbors from behind  lace curtains; Catherine Oliphant, a writer and spinster, but with a twist  she is living, unmarried with; Tom Mallow, one of many anthropologists in  the story. Readers of "Excellent Women" will enjoy the  reappearance of Esther Clovis and the references to Everard and Mildred  Bone. The men in this story have more character development than in  previous Pym novels. They are shown to be real people not so different form  their feminine counterparts. There is competition in this story, a  three-way competition for Tom Mallow's love, and a four-way competition for  the Foresight grants, for the study of anthropolgy. The competitions mirror  each other in subtle ways. Catherine is one of Pym's most endearing  characters. You really yearn for her to find happiness. This is one of my  favorites 
 When the atomic bomb dropped at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, Hiroshima was a thriving city of two hundred forty-five thousand people.  By 8:20, one hundred thousand of those people were dead.  Combining the broad perspective of the absolute devastation of the city with the tiniest details of six individual lives, John Hersey provides a powerful closeup of a few survivors of the atomic attack on Hiroshima, giving the carnage a human perspective.    Focusing on  Mr. Tanimoto, a Methodist pastor; Mrs. Nakamura, the widow of a tailor, and her three children;  Dr. Masakazu Fujii, a physician in a private clinic; Fr. Wilhelm Kleinsorge, S. J, a priest in a Catholic mission; Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, a young surgeon at the Red Cross Hospital; and Toshiko Sasaki, a clerk in a tin works, as they survive the initial attack,  the author follows their daily movements, their subsequent illnesses, their fears, and the eventual outcomes of their lives.  The victims become human, and their concerns become universal, as Hersey shows them digging themselves out and helping their neighbors, filled with an "elated community spirit" in the days and weeks after the bombing.  Details of the fires following the bombing, the unexpected radiation sickness, the mysteries surrounding the kind of bomb this was (some Japanese believed that the allies had sprinkled powdered magnesium over the city and then ignited it), the devastating rains that followed, and the monumental scale of the damage are presented in straightforward, factual style, the horrors of the reality so overwhelming that Hersey had no need to try to control his narrative by selecting details or ordering them for effect.  Published in the New Yorker in August, 1946, this anniversary remembrance had immediate and dramatic repercussions, perhaps because the focus on "ordinary" Japanese citizens, much like the Americans who read the article, as opposed to "the enemy," resonated with his readers.  Thousands listened to four days of its reading on ABC radio, and many others bought the New Yorker to read his account.  By raising also the question of the ethics of dropping such a bomb (which some of the Japanese agree was acceptable as a normal part of the war), he also forces his readers to consider the long-term implications of atomic warfare.  Dramatic, powerful, and very personal, this account of six lives, changed forever, is a monument to the human spirit in the face of incredible adversity. n Mary Whipple 
 In a shop close to the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem the author spots a map. The owner of the shop informs the author that the map depicts King Solomon's mines in Africa, the mines from which gold was extracted to build his famed temple. The fact that the map was not genuine (Shah finds an identical copy in the same shop soon after) does not deter Shah from embarking on his journey. Like many other travelogues by Shah, it is the experience but not just the goal that counts.  This is not to say that the author wanders about aimlessly. Quite to the contrary, he even risks his life for his quest, for e.g. in crossing deserts in northern Ethiopia with the infamous (for killing) Danakil tribe. As a review on the back cover of the paperback edition puts it: "...Shah wins you over with the mad purity of his quest." I can't agree more.  Apart from the very beginning, the book situates itself in Ethiopia. From the country's epicenter and capital Addis Ababa some of the major sites the author visits: are Kebra Mengist to the south, Harar to the east, Lalibela (where the churches carved from crevices -- like Petra of Jordan -- are located), Debra Damo (the monastery located on top of a mountain top plateau) and Mekele to the north, and Tullu Wallel to the west.  The rich historical and anecdotal background Shah provides together with his wonderful sense of humor make for a powerful concoction. A group of eccentric characters make appearances, Shah reveals his reverence for Victorian era adventurers, and at times ponders over why his job is so much difficult compared to others'. There was hardly a dull moment during my read 
 I bought this album in LP form back in 1975, and dug it out and listened to it today for probably the first time in 20 years. Although the record hasn't held up well, the music still astounds with its freshness and originality. Paul's collaboration here with the Incan group Urubamba shows he was playing "World Music" decades before it became the cool thing to do. His songs with the Jessy Dixon group similarly show him pioneering so-called "American Roots". And when he takes the stage alone with just his guitar, his presence and musicianship are breathtaking. "American Tune", written on the wreckage of Watergate, takes on a shattering new meaning in the wake of September 11th. I am amazed at how prescient these songs are. He recorded this album live in 1974, and by some strange trick of imagination and talent, the songs are still live and rhymin' today 
 Vince Gill has an amazing voice, and this album showcases it very well. Several of his best songs including "Tryin' to Get Over You," "I Still Believe in You," "Never Knew Lonely," and "Don't Let our Love Start Slippin' Away" and included on this great album. If you are a fan of Mr. Gill, you will love this album. It is a must-own too. I recommend it thoroughly 
 This book is superior in every way. Intended to explore the university grounds from a primarily architectural perspective, the author's writing is both impassioned and objective in its analysis of the unique architectural qualities of this wonderful university. Yet despite a clear cut architectural purpose, this book also manages to provide the best single, practical guide to the university grounds available. The author organizes his well written descriptions around a series of walks, and provides in-depth information, photographs, and history for each building or site encountered. The result is the ultimate guide for newcomers exploring the university grounds for the first time, as well as for those who already know them intimately 
 Should be required reading for anyone aspiring to develop themselves professionally in a professional services firm. Especially pertinent for leaders and managers.   As Maister points out, some of his recommendations require the courage of ones' convictions to be realized. Yet, this book   provides inspiration (along with wonderful advice) to achieve its ends.   Maister is simply the best in this niche...and this book, once again, demonstrates that.  Bill Wiersma, Author, The Big AHA         
 `North Atlantic Seafood' and `Mediterranean Seafood', both by noted culinary writer Alan Davidson, the author of `The Oxford Companion to Food' are reference books which a serious cook must have in their library where time is spent deciding on what to eat rather than time spend actually cooking. These books belong to a rare breed of books in English such as Elizabeth Schneider's `Vegetables from Amaranth to Zucchini' or `Bruce Cost's Asian Ingredients' which thoroughly cover a broad single subject or the `Larousse Gastronomique' which gives an overview of virtually every culinary subject, at least from the point of view of French cuisine.  Both books are organized in the same way that gives primacy to information on the aquatic species and secondary coverage of recipes.  Biological family, genus, and species organize the first part on the catalog of species in order that the biological similarity of the fishes is clearly shown. Each article gives the most common English name, the two part Latin scientific name, the scientist who assigned this name (most commonly the great inventor of biological Taxonomy, Linnaeus), the biological family name, and the common name of the fish in virtually every language of the major fishing nationality bordering the relevant body of water. The North Atlantic species, for example, are named in Portuguese, Spanish, French, Dutch, German, Polish, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, and others such as Gaelic (Irish). The Mediterranean species' names are given in French, Spanish, Greek, Italian, Tunisian, Turkish, and others such as Bulgarian, Romanian, and Russian if, for example, the species is most commonly found in the Black Sea, which is included in the coverage of the Mediterranean. These names in themselves are entertaining to the linguistically inclined, as it is interesting to see the similarities and differences from country to country. For example, even though the Turks came to Asia Minor from central Asia, most of their names for fishes are very similar to the Greek name, making a lot of sense, as a traveling people is likely to name things new to them based on the names given by the indigenous population. The articles on every species also have a highly detailed black and white drawing of each animal. The great value to these is that it makes comparing the appearance of different fishes very easy, as every species is depicted in a similar style. It is too bad they could not be depicted to scale, but this would have had the sturgeon filling two pages while the anchovies would be the size of a period. Instead, the remarks on each fish give the average market length and a description of the typical color and markings.  The catalog entry also gives a paragraph or two on cuisine, which is a discussion of the culinary desirability of the species and typical ways in which the animal is prepared. For most fish, this includes methods by which the fish is butchered. The catalog entries also include a list of recipes and page numbers for these recipes in the second major section of the book.  The second major section divides recipes by country. The Mediterranean volume has chapters of recipes from Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, the Black Sea, and Northern Africa. The North Atlantic volume has recipes from Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Russia, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Canada, the United States, Scotland, England, Ireland, and Wales. France merits two sections, covering the southwest and the northwest. The US merits four sections, covering New England, the Middle Atlantic States, the Chesapeake, and the Carolinas and Georgia.  Other books, such as `Fish' by Shirley King seems to have copied this scheme, but seems to be much less successful in that not enough valuable information is packed into the catalogue to make it interesting enough reading to outweigh the annoyance of doing a two step search for a recipe on haddock, for example. The other side of the coin is that if you live in Maryland, you are much more likely to be interested in recipes from the Chesapeake than in recipes from Maine.  One is tempted to expect these recipes to be very generic and not as interesting as those you may find in books of `haute cuisine' from a fish specialist such as Eric Rippert. This is partially true. Davidson is less the great cook than he is a great writer on food. This means that while his recipes may come from common sources, he gives us much more information on the background of the recipes than the chef may do. Two perfect examples of this case are the recipes for bouillabaisse (French fish stew) and Maryland crab cakes. Davidson confesses to giving us something simpler than the `de luxe version', yet this simple treatment is entirely appropriate to the simple origins of the dish, before the gourmets got their hands on it. Similarly, the crab cake recipe has very few ingredients, mostly just crabmeat, seasonings, breadcrumbs, and enough egg to hold it all together.  The supplementary information tells much about the fish cuisine of both regions. The most interesting information is on the fact that while the Mediterranean is very shallow, it has relatively little continental shelf while the North Sea is practically all shelf, suitable to the spawning of young fish in shallow water. This does much to explain the popularity of the North Atlantic cod in peninsular Italy, virtually surrounded by water.  The bibliography shows that the author has based most of his material on local sources in native languages such as Polish, Turkish, and Portuguese. This may only help the multilingual scholar, but then it is the rare English culinary work that does this. One of the greatest things about these volumes is that all of this great material is available in trade paperbacks, which list for no more than $25.  These are must have books for devoted foodies!  
 This book is a wonderful tribute to one of America's finest poets.  The book appeals to both children and adults.  The poems are whimsical and fun.  In my own classroom, the children list these poems as some of their favorites.  The art work inspires my students to achieve as much as they  can in their own art work. The introduction and afterward provide the  reader with a history of the Harlem art's movement and Langston Hughes'  contribution to this movement.  The information provided could be shared  with children, however it is written for advanced readers.  Overall, this  book is one of the most well thought out books that I have seen 
 RETROSPECTIVE is tied with LEON RUSSELL and LEON RUSSELL AND THE SHELTER PEOPLE as the best Leon Russell album ever. This anthology contains material from throughout Leon's early-to-mid-70s career and is an exceptional collection of pure, unadulterated Great Plains rock, with a strong gospel flavor. The eighteen songs here include the original version of "Delta Lady", as well as a generous helping of material from SHELTER PEOPLE. The fact that Russell currently advocates sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist, and increased funding for law enforcement, makes this anthology an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience. 
 Ok, it's official. This is the best Kyuss album. No doubt about it. Josh Homme's low-tuned riffage, Scott Reeder's Geezer-ish bass lines and fills, Brant Bjork's energetic drumming, and the stoned voice of John Garcia all combine into one energetic groove of an album.  From the opening notes of "Gardenia," this album grabs you and never lets go. There are different atmospheres throughout the whole cd. With songs like "Supa Scoopa" and "Whitewater," the feel is agressive, yet mellow too. Other songs like "Space Cadet" feels like a calm wind blowing by. Other tracks like "Conan Troutman" and "100o" are pure agression. Yet there is a cohesive flow to the whole record.  While some people might complain about the album being tacked onto 3 tracks, I love it. I think that each part has a powerful beginning, a cool middle, and an explosive ending. It works on that behalf.  So, if you're interested in entering the world of Kyuss, get this album, or their other masterpiece, Blues For The Red Sun. You can't lose.

 This is an excelent source book for the voyaging sailor,or anyone, who wants to learn how to have better success when fishing the worlds oceans. The authors have cruised extensively aboard their yacht,Ian, and have a  background in marine biology. They have a unique perspective into how you  can increase your success rate in having fun while catching dinner. Topics  cover equipment selection, tips for catching specific species, toxicity  issues, and much more. Even if you are not cruising the Seven Seas, you  will learn a lot about offshore fishing from this book. I reccomend it 
 Alfred A. Cave presents us with a quick moving, concise, and interesting narrative of the Pequot War.  This is significant in and of itself since it is the first notable narrative of the war in almost a century.  Cave attempts to correct the early historiography that was very sympathetic to the Puritans, and also tries to temper the interpretations of later historians that viewed the conflict as being caused solely by Puritan greed.  Cave argues that the latter interpretation wrongfully diminishes the significance of Puritan ideology as a cause of the war.    Economics did play a role, but it was not a simple case of Puritans versus Pequots.  Instead, there was fierce competition between various tribes, as well as the Dutch and English for control of the trade in the Connecticut Valley.  Essentially, English plans to extend into Connecticut conflicted with Pequot desires to defend their interests.  However, Cave sees that ideology, not Puritan greed or Pequot aggression caused the war.  Puritans viewed the natives as "savages" and "children of the Devil," and, therefore, were the Devil's earthly servants deserving destruction.  Cave argues that this worldview served as the catalyst for provoking a war with the Pequots.    Cave tends to take this interpretation a little too far.  His efforts at correcting the excesses of past scholarship is appreciated, but leaves one wondering why a people so bent on the destruction of Native Americans, allied themselves with the Narragansetts against the Pequots.  Nonetheless, this is a very good and interesting book. 
 [...]  Mr Reich's argument is based on sound appeals to reason and  evidence.  Unfortunately, a substantial number of Americans are immune to both.  Fiscal conservatives continue to admire Reagan although his reductions in taxes and increases in federal spending doubled the national debt.  And many fiscal conservatives voted for Bush despite his ballooning of the national budget.  Reasonable Americans do not carry enormous balances on their credit cards, paying banks 18% per annum for that privilege, yet the majority of Americans do.  If so many people cannot manage their own finances, small wonder that they do not recognize Reagan's and Bush's fiscal profligacy.  Many Americans also believe Bush's prevarication that the war in Iraq makes America safer, despite national intelligence estimates that show that our presence there creates and trains ever more terrorists.  Reasonable, well informed people know about the national intelligence estimates; most Americans do not.  Bush claims to be a pro-environmental president.  Evidence shows that he favors more pollution because that aids the power industry.  But again, Bush's relaxation of pollution standards is not generally known.  Many Americans are so naive that they genuinely believe that because Bush is a man of faith, or so he claims, he must be a good man.  Men of faith have, of course, been responsible for some of the most outrageous atrocities in human history, from the wars of religion in Europe to the attack on the US by Osama bin Laden.  But one must know a bit of history to know that.  Would that Americans were as amenable to reason as Mr Reich supposes 
 a facinating account of an antropologists journeys into the world of indiginous knowlege and utter amazement at the depth of knowlege that these "uneducated" shamans have regarding DNA (which they call "language twisting twisting") and mitosis and medicinal properties of plants.  Also includes a very interesting set of statistics (you are welcome to view a post at gotblogua for my redigestion and investigation of these statistics) about the likelihood that the complexity of life that we observe as the result of evolution, could have actually emerged by pure chance...  Which raises a few questions i have for you: Do you believe in evolution as a process of diversication of life via genetic mutations? If so, do you believe that the primary driving force of these advantageous genetic mutations is random chance? Do you believe that DNA is a language? Do you believe that the use of language is a sign of intelligence?  Please consider sharing your answers with me via email  or via the comments page at gotblogua  regardless of what you prefer to think and or believe about these questions, i promise you that this book will engage you to think about them at great depths, providing a balanced and enlightened perspective grounded both in personal experience and solid scientific research 
 I published a review for the 2000 edition of this book not 2001 or 2002.  Many of the reviews listed under this edition are for earlier editions and some comments may not pertain.  Books like this one can change dramatically from year to year.  Errors could be corrected, new errors introduced and there is always a whole new season of statistics that has an effect on the flavor of the book.  For instance 2002 was the year that Bonds broke McGwire's homerun record, so I am sure that there is coverage of that.  These books are not worth buying every year.  But these authors do a credible job and I would expect this to be of similar quality to the one I own.  I would suggest buying a copy once every 5 years if you are a baseball enthusiast and only every year if you are a fanatic.  However for sports statistic fanatics it may be that Total Baseball has more information 
 The Third is, besides one of the greatest symphonies written and a milestone in musical history (some musicologists even divide music history in before and after Eroica), one of those works where the ideal performance is only in your mind. Except here it is, on CD.  I bought this recording on LP in the 70s, and could never find another one that came close. Many of the other symphonies are also very good. Full and spacious early stereo.  The only reason the set is not more famous must be that the conductor's name is not Herbert von Karajan 
 This is such an interesting book that believe me after you read the first couple of pages you wont put this book down. I recommend this book for those who are interested in studying Forensic Evidence and for those who also study criminology! The book is worth it believe me i loved it! It has lots of interesting topics on DNA, Evidence, Collecting Fingerprints, and alot more... 
 this is one of the finest if not the finest biographies on the life of Martin Luther. it may well go down as the authentic biography for seminary students....oberman's thesis is that luther stood before God and the devil, waging a war for luther's soul....historically one cannot deny luther's depressions which often alienated friend and foe alike...depressions are oppressions of demonic activity but not possessions...this ongoing battle lead luther to find the only solace he could find in this life, the safety and surety of the cross which lead him to the theologia crucis (theology of the cross). while this book's scholarship is breathtaking, it is easy to read because luther's spiritual battles are too fascinating to be obscured. This book shows that luther often failed in his battle with the devil, but knew that the war had already been won on calvary and that is the joy for all christians. Luther's last written words, he lapsed from latin to german and said, "Wir send Bettlers. Das ist wahr." yes, brother martin, we are beggars, and that's the truth 
 Being a military spouse, I found myself very interested in "The Last Detail" when I happened to see it a short while ago. The film is about two Navy men (Nicholson, Young) who have to transport a young Randy Quaid to the brig.  This was the 70's and times were different that they are not.  Quaid is not handcuffed as they transport him.  He is allowed to walk freely as they escort him via various methods of public transportation to Portsmouth where have faces 8 years in the brig.  Along the way they befriend the young 18 year old man and even have doubts about turning him in.  The African-American character, played by Otis Young is very strong in his beliefs about not putting his career on the line.  The trio have a lot of fun.  They try to cram as much excitement and life experience into a short few days as possible before they have to turn in Quaid.  It's a very interesting film.  As the viewer, you really have conflicting thoughts about what they should do 
 Secrets Of A Civil War Submarine, by Sally Walker, provides a nice, quick overview of the Hunley's history, recovery, excavation, and conservation.  Targeting the late grade-school reader, the book is written in the style of and at a similar level to a National Geographic article.  Any reader will enjoy it and come away with a good understanding of the Hunley project.  There are a few detail mistakes, such as in an explanation of neutral buoyancy, but the main point is always delivered successfully by the text.  I've been studying material on the Hunley since 2000, but I found several important bits of information I haven't seen elsewhere.  The explanation of archaeological techniques as applied in the Hunley excavation is the best I've read.  The book is nicely illustrated, although most of the photos have been previously published, and the interpretive drawings contain some fairly large inaccuracies.  Overall, I'm happy to have this in my collection of books about the Hunley and I'm glad to recommend it. 
 "Beloved" by Toni Morrison is a beguiling, beautiful story. I too, as others have said, found myself a little lost at first. It seemed like the story would shift at a crucial point, and we were left wondering what happened. But I was pulled in, even from the first couple of chapters,the characters had a hold on me, and I had to know their story. The more I read, the more I saw that the story was actually coming together beautifully.   The tale which is told through the memories of the main characters, revolves around Sethe, an ex-slave who has escaped and is making a tough journey to be reunited with her children. The house in which they all live, is occupied also by the spirit of a baby girl. Sethe and daughter Denver, seems to take this spirit for granted and learn to live with it. When a man comes into Sethe's life, he banishes the ghost from the house, and soon after a strange young woman comes to live with them. Has this the spirit come back in the form of a woman, to claim her territory? As the past is slowly revealed to the reader through flashbacks, we learn the strengths and weaknesses of the characters, the hardships they endured, and the story thus unfolds wonderfully.   Morrison's style in this story leaves the reader with great anticipation of what was to come. It was okay, not to know how someone got somewhere, or what the relationship is between others, as the suspense was very much a part of it. The reader also gets a good feel for the true nature of the relationship between slaves and owners, and some of the abuse was pretty tough to take for the reader. But it also served to bond with the characters, understand a little why they acted as they did, and maybe feel their pain.Could the ex-slaves, ever really be free of the chains of the past? Some of the flashback are pretty intense and emotional scenes, and I thought Morrison painted the pictures brilliantly. There were sometimes I thought the way she wrote a phrase, or a thought were so beautiful, I read them again and said "Wow".   It is the story of one mother's great love for her children, of people coming together in times of need. The story and it's characters had me under a spell. One I was happy to be under.   A beguiling read...enjoy...Laurie 
 It was up and running in 15 minutes. Had to order WiFi adapter to get program updates - got it and it installed automatically. I would buy it again 
 Explores economics, management, computer science, psychology and  phylosophy to understand human being and artifacts, the work of human  being. Ideas presented are highly philosophical but widely applicable to  the real world, especially when designing organization or large projects 
 A Sci-fi Classic. Had not read it in years. Enjoyed as much now as I did in the past 
 A very interesting subject, and the author has accumulated a substantial catalogue of tales about murder in the seventeenth century.  "Shakespeare's England" is a little misleading, considering that virtually none of the crimes mentioned here took place before 1624, by which time Shakespeare was long dead.  While the book is interesting, the major flaw is the quality of the writing, which is redundant and rather dull.  It feels like she repeats the point that male violence was more tolerated, while female violence was more shocking, on nearly every page.  After a while, one gets the point!  Dammit!  Anyway, if you can get past the writing style, there is a lot of good stuff here 
 I have seen glowing reports on this lens in several magazines, most notably in Shutterbug. It is truly a splendid performer and one well worth paying for if a photographer needs the extra working distance afforded by a macro lens in the 180mm to 200mm range. Its performance is certainly as good, if not better, than Nikon's venerable 200mm f4 Micro Nikkor, which was one of the first - if not the first - telephoto macro lenses in this focal length. This Canon lens excels not only in macro photography but also in nature photography, getting close-up images of animals in the wild without working too close to disturb them. If I owned Canon equipment, then this lens would be an essential part of my kit 
 Jim Ladd is a true lover of the music and spirt of the 1960's, and has made a radio "bio" that speaks  deeply to those who live in LA and love radio.  The major weakness of the book is not the nit-picking about the names (if you where in the 60"s...) but the fact that it is a book. Jim Ladd the artist is his best behind the microphone. Mr Ladd has the respect, love and understanding of music and combines it with a presentation style that dares to move your mind and soul. The book is  damm funny and touching 
 Sherwood Smith did a great job making the story line interesting. She has great ideas on what other people like to read. Most of all the books were a great source of entertainment, and I really liked Wren 
 I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it years ago.  And besides.... the castle is really cool too.  :  
 my neighbor totoro is another film from the same guy who made howl's moving castle. it has the same kind of story and if you like howï¿½'s moving castle then this is one that you would like to see too 
 This book is so magical... so wonderful that I couldn't put it down (sorry professors). The book was written so well that I could smell the food every time they were eating... (or maybe it was my Chinese take-out that I was drawn to buy while reading this book).  Excellent Book!  I highly recommend it!  Also the audio book makes it even more real!!   
 LOTS OF USEABLE INFO HERE. THE CHAPTERS ARE SHORT, PUNCHY AND INFORMATIVE AND THE TEXT NEVER BECOMES TEDIOUS. THE BOOK IS VERY EASY ON THE EYES WITH EXCELLENT PHOTOGRAPHY AND A COLORFUL, MODERN FORMAT THAT REALLY HOLDS YOUR ATTENTION. I FOUND LOTS OF GOOD HOME IDEAS BOTH "GREEN" AND OTHERWISE. I WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMMEND "GOOD GREEN HOMES" AS A GIFT FOR ANYONE WITH ANY KIND OF INTEREST IN HOUSES 
 This book was WONDERFUL; Meredith Small presents all sorts of research and data in a very easy-to-grasp format and presents an amazing book about the childraising tactics of various cultures.  Of all the books I have read about raising babies, this was the absolute best one, because it presents everything - NOT just the Westernized version.  I cannot emphasis how helpful this book was!!!!  I am buying copies to send to everyone I know with children 
 The other reviewer is correct in her assessment.  This is an attractive doll.  Her hair is great.  She's very angely if I may make up an adjective. She is beautifully packaged  I collect Barbies so I have not taken her from the packaging, but I have peaked at her feet.  I wanted to see what they put on her feet.  I was hoping she'd have on slippers or sandals.  The doll is actually barefoot, which is fine, but she does not have any toes (no lines to mark toes) from what I can see.  This is my first collectible without shoes, so I don't know if that's common or not.  I've given her a 4 because  of the lack of shoes and in my collection she falls in the middle.  She's great for a pink label though.  
 I took piano lessons as a kid, although my skills aren't far beyond reading specific (and simple) pieces of music and playing them pretty much as written.  On the other hand, I play guitar with semi-pro bands and ensembles, and write and arrange a lot of music for those groups and for church.  This book was exactly what I needed...it provides basic licks and techniques for comping and playing along with an ensemble.  Further, it relates practical theory along with the lessons...which allows anyone with a bit of musical knowledge to transfer the lessons to many different situations.  Finally, while it's not enough material to turn anyone in to a complete solo pianist, it would be easy to pick up a few tunes to play for your friends.  Great book, great approach, not an overly ambitious curriculum (which I see as a positive...there are lots of well known study materials for "serious" pianists) 
 Kaleem 9984....LOL....THIS dudes a hypocrit! First of all...a foreigner (who's probably an Indian programmer) is not a impartial reviewer. I am a programmer and work with numerous foreigners...BTW they are not as talented as rumor has it. They frequently lie on their resumes to get into positions and...as evidenced by the exporation of NUMEROUS PROGRAMMING jobs back to India...they are not loyal to this country or any corporation that hired them on the H1b visa (a political bill that was fronted by american corporations). This book however...is right on target.   Kaleem should speak in terms of the substance of the book..and not of other reviewers who may differ from his opinion. I believe, as many americans, that we should no longer import items from other countries...we don't need them 
 this is the best of the series of his books he is finally able to somewhat be kid in this book the book is trying to help kids cope he finally gets friends paul and dave i highly reccomend reading this book  along with his others they all get five stars in my book lo 
 Phenomenal CD! Sanctus Real just keeps getting better.  "The Face of Love" is by far the best music I have ever heard.  I really didn't think that they could outdo their last CD, "Fight the Tide" but "The Face of Love" has definitely stepped things up. Great music, great message, fantastic production.  If you liked "Fight the Tide" you'll love "The Face of Love"!   
 Micheal Caine plays Frank Jones a decorated ex-British Navy veteran and now businessman.  His beloved son Bob played by Nigel Havers is a Russian linguist working for the British Secret Service before the days of detente.  He tells Caine that he suspects some strange things are happening in his agency, that he would like to expose.  The Secret Service suspicious of Havers has been bugging his conversations and ultimately liquidate him, covering up his death.  Caine, unsatisfied with the official declaration of an accidental death, commences his own investigation.  He eventually is lead to John Gielgud playing high ranking politician Sir Adrian Chapple who acting as a Russian mole, has been feeding them sensitive bits of intelligence for years.  With a distinctly British flavor, "The Whistle Blower" is an above average vintage Cold War drama that uses at it's conclusion the incredible pagaentry of a monarchy sponsored parade filmed in the streets of London 
 We bought this toddler swing for our grandchildren to use when they visit. It fits all sizes from 1 yr old to 3 yr olds and is easy to get them in and out. The plastic body is thinner than others I have seen, but it's fine for the amount of use it will get at our house. They do recommend that you bring it indoors when not in use and not leave it in the weather year round. Since we only use it part time, that has not been a big problem for us 
 I loved Murder Uncorked, so couldn't wait to pick up Murder by the Glass... and now that I've finished it, I'm thirsty for the third.  If you're looking for an escape to the wine country... spiced with a touch of murder, plenty of romance (with two dishy, to-die-for men), and lots of great wine and food, look no further.  Scott pulls you in on the first page and doesn't let go till you're done.  Her characters are great -- I love the Bridezilla in particular, as well as the two men who are vying for the leading role in Nikki's life -- and the plot is a puzzler that will keep you guessing to the end.    Murder By the Glass is a perfect read for a summer afternoon -- with a glass or two of wine and some munchies, of course.  Be warned, though -- the ending will leave you anxiously awaiting the release of the next installment.  Fortunately, you can pass the time trying out the fabulous recipes (and wine-pairings) sprinkled throughout the book.  That's what I plan to do 
 Caroline Myss gives some interesting ideas in helping a person to heal. I don't agree with everything she says, but I still learned alot from her book.  I think if you are going to read her theory of healing, it is also good to read other people ideas as well. And then use what works for you. I think there are alot of benefits to Myss' beliefs and ideas. And this is a good book for anyone interested in healing 
 This book is the most heartfelt book I have ever read.  It moved me to tears every time that I have read it. Instead of the symbolism stuff and the boring poems they teach in our school, they should teach young adult poetry like this book here. It freely deals with issues such as being an outcast, homosexuality, religion, and breakups and crushes.  It is a wonderful book for teenagers to read, and maybe if people who are homophobes read it, they can gain a better understanding of the issue they vehemently oppose 
 i have had this book on my kitchen shelf for 10, years.  i particularly love the soup recipes.  laurel robertson's soups are old favorites with a new spin.  many of the legume soups include potatoes, which, though seeming  a strange ingredient at first, give a marvelous, velvety texture to such  old favorites as pea soup and lentil soup.  anyone interested in vegetarian  cooking, or just cooking with vegetables, would do well to have a copy of  this book in his or her library.  yum 
 Pastor Hagee does a wonderful job in presenting Biblical prophecy. He not only describes the book of Daniel and King Nebuchanezzar's dream of the image, he also cites prophecy's from the other Old Testament prophets, such as Ezekiel and Jeremiah, as well as cite New Testament verses, from Jesus, Paul and John the Revelator. This book has many key verses that you can look at and study yourself, and make you realize that the Rapture and Tribulation will be soon and perhaps in our current generation. Although there are a few things Hagee mentions, that I would question, such as the population of Heaven after the Great White Throne Judgment, the key is that you need Jesus now! And to reject to gospel now with all the evidence that is present in the Holy Word of God, means to face tribulation and judgement. Read this book and study the Bible as you do. It will open your eyes 
 Amy Tan writes about wonderful people.   Amy Tan creates exceptional characters.  Amy Tan will write you a story that is so rich and clear you can almost touch it.  That is what I love in reading Amy Tan. As your average southern white female, I'm not exactly versed in the world of Amy Tan's characters. But she takes me there. I find myself so completely involved in the world she writes about that I forget where I am. Isn't that why you pedalled your bicycle to the library in the summer when you were a kid? Amy Tan will remind you of that sense of discovery you had back then, when you were reading all the great classics for the first time and the discovery of it all was an addictive thrill that kept your library card smoking and well worn with use.  She has a gift in her storytelling for expanding the universe. Read this book. 
 Books like this are regrettably--but understandably--rare. Alan Taylor takes on the entire sweep of the human presence in North America up to the turn of the nineteenth century: from the earliest migrations across Beringia, to the European impact on Hawaii. It is astonishing how much he is able to include in a single, compact volume. While somewhat slanted toward an Anglo-centric account after the sixteenth century (for instance, the chapter on the West Indies from 1600-1700 is almost entirely about the British presence--Hispaniola and Cuba are completely ignored), it is only a moderate bias, admirably offset by his full and comparative accounts of the French in Canada and Louisiana, the Spanish in the southwest and California, and Russians in the northwest and Alaska. The tone of the writing, however, is exquisitely balanced and clean. In fact, the clear and efficient style is a pleasure to read, and chapter after chapter flows smoothly through the complexities and nuances of the latest and finest scholarship on the colonial era. American historians have truly brought their craft to a golden age of deep research, critical analysis and sound--yet astonishing--interpretation: Taylor's bibliography is a treasure chest of books I can't wait to read. He expertly weaves the most recent foci of American historiography--Atlantic studies, epidemiology, environmental history, pre-Columbian (and post-Columbian) archaeology, analyses of trade, demographics, gender roles, race, etc.--into the more familiar stories of explorers, empires, wars and migration. The whole story (or galaxy of stories) is thus given a structure and pattern that places what might have seemed to be arbitrary events into a tractable context. Perfect for the beginning pupil, this book is nonetheless eminently valuable for even the most well-read student of American history. It is perhaps too much to hope that the next volume in this series is as brilliantly done 
      My husband and I both read Bryson's "A Short History of Nearly Everything" and we loved it, referred it to everyone we know (a friend originally referred it to us!)and purchased a copy for our grandson.  If one has been out of school for a number of years, well, science has changed alot since then!  Bryson not only brings his readers up to date on current theories but also give the story of how each discipline evolved to it current understandings.  Some of the best money we ever spent on a book 
 This show was a lot of fun. I had a great time, singing along most of the songs with them.  Best of all, GS seemed to have a lot of fun playing to the crowd.  I've been to many Gaelic Storm concerts and always find them full of spirit and fun.  I can't wait to buy this 
 An all-around great album filled with energy, zest, and beauty at every turn.  In my opinion, Altan's finest album 
 This book is excellent for someone who is practicing without a teacher.  I found the discussion of how to deal with a "dry spot" in your practice especially helpful.  It's difficult for a solo practioner to step outside the self thing and see what's sabotaging your practice.  I am thankful to Mr. Bayda for his ability to articulate so well what's going on 
 This book arrived today, and I am so thrilled, it is better than I imagined. There are 11 treasure hunts with the clues provided, suitable for all ages. I will keep the book hidden and use one for the Easter Egg Hunt. We'll do another for my daughters 8th birthday party with her friends, and the best thing is, we can use them again and again. I know this is going to be one of those books that is borrowed often 
 Hi its me again after when me and my friends watched a NightMare on Elm Street 4 we decided to watch a NightMare on Elm Street 3 so we did the same thing as always we made popcorn and got candy thin i put in the movie and we started to watch it Homer took a bite of one of his Reesis well Henrey was smooking one of his cigarets thin there was smook everyware and Henrey started koofing well Eddie was drinking some beer thin when we saw the very scary part in the movie that showed Freddy killing someone and thin eating the heart we got so scared that we began to panic and evin worse we started to go crazy and we started to wreck my house we began to throw furniture out the windows thin when the people saw what we were doing they called the police thin they came and broke into the house and we all said crap its the cops and when we said it thir was no time to run the cops jumped on us and wrestled us to the froor and we got handcuffed thin we got in to the back of the police and we were takein to the fairfax county police station and we stayed in thir for 10 days and that is the stor 
 the tracks are harmonious, you're never bored to play it. Is not a revelation in the music, no new kind of music but really pretty 
 This book encourages those of us who want to return to our farming roots and obtain the freshest dairy products possible from our own cow(s).  He takes the fear out of stepping into caring for a cow for us first-timers.  I can't wait to apply what I'm learning 
 Viewed this exhibit last summer at the new MOMANYC. Thought provoking photo's worth the mone 
 Again, I was amazed that the writers could improve upon season 1 and 2. While so many other shows feature repetitive story lines, one tree hill continues to create drama that is refreshingly original. I particauarly enjoyed watching the relationships between Nathan and Haley and Brooke and Lucas redevelop. The school shooting was painfully real and an accurate depiction of the emotion involved in times of tragedy. I also like that the writers balance the drama with a bit of light comedy- it makes it far more enjoyable. The music and quotations are fantastic! Myone criticism however would have to be the lack of interesting bonus features.. definately something that could be improved for next season. THIS IS A MUST BUY DVD 
 I read this along with Plantagenet Somerset Fry's book "The Kings and Queens of England and Scotland" prior to a visit to London.  Both were excellent resources.  This one lacked some of the visual appeal of Fry's book, but it made up for that with more information.  I am very happy to have this book as part of my library now. 
 I know this record catches a lot of heat from fans, but this album is not bad at all. There are some real gems here, and I think that fans sometimes don't take this album for what it really is, a thrown together record, that wasen't mean to be some big time commercial hit. You can't go into this album expecting a "Sign 'O' The Times", or a "Purple Rain", because you'll be dissapointed.  Most of the tracks on here are rock, and Prince puts his guitar skills to use. The best songs on this album are "Right The Wrong", "I Like It There", and the title track. I suggest you buy this if you're a diehard fan and don't already have it 
 I got this coffee pot at about 25% of the original price. It's programmable and works great! Hope I find more deals like this on Amazon 
 This is an outstanding live album.  They do a great job of faithfully reproducing the feel and key elements of the highly produced studio albums, while still having a fairly small band and all the intensity of a live album.  The amazing thing is that it appears to be from a single concert, rather than various tracks gathered from lots of different shows.  Seal sounds great, the musicians and production are great, and the result is quite entertaining.  My only disappointment is the drum solo is Crazy is just not as cool as the sequenced stuff on the album, but how could it be?  I also found the DVD to be only mildly entertaining, since it's just the visual performance of the songs on the CD, with little extra commentary or footage.  But the price is right, so this criticism is really minor (i.e., just the CD is worth the $16) 
 This cd is perfect, You feel as if its 1960 and you are sitting in the third row at the Copa with your lady and your beverage of choice listening to the next Frank Sinatra with some pop,rock and standards throw in for good measure. From "Come Home Bill Bailey to the live standards between. This CD is the closet live setting you can actually feel. This is a MUST FOR ALL DARIN FANS. 
 My companion for driving; this makes traffic a joy and delays a treat 
 this wa a great movie and held my intrest the whole time. ending was awsem 
 To say that Chasing the Rodeo is a mere primer on the rodeo circuit is like saying The Sun Also Rises is about bullfighting.  This is a great read, fully charged with emotion and old-fashioned shoe-leather reporting.  Kip Stratton tells us how the weather was and much, much more.  Bravo 
 Most foreign correspondents never get to write the real story. Deadlines, impatient editors, lack of space and so forth all get in the way. This book tells you what is going on in a way that you will never read in the daily press. Bennett-Jones knows Pakistan from the mountains to the desert, and it shows. It's well-written, incisive, informative. It belongs on the bookshelf--or on the desk--of anyone with a serious interest in south Asia.. 
 You can take any given number of Marty Robbins songs and call them his greatest hits as the man had talent and versatility to spare.  Certainly most of the songs on this package are exceptional but there are so many left out.  "A White Sport Coat (And a Pink Carnation)", perhaps his greatest crossover hit is missing in favor of Hank Williams, Sr.'s "Kaw-Liga" (done to death) and the so-so "Maria (If I Could").  And the hit doesn't even appear on the follow-up album of "more greatest hits". What were they thinking?  Early hits "I Couldn't Keep From Crying" and "The Story of My Life" are not here.  And on it goes.  You will probably enjoy most or all of the songs herein but if you can find it, it's better to go for "The Essential Marty Robbins 1951-1982" that covers some hokey early recordings before he hit his stride plus the ones named, other certified HITS and songs that were only mild hits or not hits at all but are a lot more rewarding to listen to than the less-than-blockbuster filler found here.  Shop around before you buy 
 I remember watching this movie in my teens and instantly loving the film. There are few films that I liked ten years ago that I still love today, but this is one of them. The music was top notch and the action sequences sit in with the flow of the movie, rather than what I usually see where fight scenes develop and you're left wondering "Wait, how did this fight start?".  For anyone wanting a good action movie to watch, I highly recommend this one! If only they would release it on DVD.. 
 I like  Bart D Ehrman he is real  author I like he Books  & lectures with  him is so great  he is teacher fun listen to him yes really this Book  I Give this Book  5 star  Good translation  Like this book fantastic  is very interesting 
 I liked this book because it reminds me of what i used to do. Yelling adn always wanting to fight. It was very funny because I was very little 
 This is a great next book after "The Goal".  While "The Goal" was pretty well centered on operations, anyone can use the tools presented in "Its not Luck".  I think that this book is can help most in forming strategy or analyzing market conditions.  An excellent read that for anyone 
 By applying his 7 principals of attitudinal healing you can retrain your  mind to replace negative attitudes one at a time with love. He explains  that we can be happy and at peace regardless of external circumstances. Dr.  Jampolsky has a center for healing in CA, and includes in the book some of  his patients' experiences with attitudinal healing 
 "As You Like It" is bar none, one of Shakespeare's VERY best works.  It is probably the most poetic of the comedies and contains perhaps as many famous quotations as any other of his plays.  Rosalind is perhaps his greatest female character and this work, along with the equally (or even more) brilliant "Midsummer Night's Dream," is the best example of Shakespeare's theme of the "dream world" vs. the "real" world.  This play, especially the scenes in the forest, is a celebration of language and the power of the freedom of the imagination.  It consequently can be read as a criticism of the "real world," here represented by Duke Ferdinand's court.  Like many of the other comedies, Shakespeare is mocking the "ideal" which many in his society would have praised.  Though this play deals with some pretty dark themes (which of his plays doesn't?) it is a light-hearted and fully enjoyable read 
 Even though described for 9-12 year olds (which surprised me), this is a terrific thought provoking book. Perfect for d'var Torahs and teaching. Lots of Talmudic wisdom and midrashim packed in a delightful edition. A  great gift idea as well. I really enjoyed reading and rereading the  different chapters 
 First, I love this book, and am very much looking forward to the release of Tyler's next cookbook.  With that said, a majority of the recipies in this book are quite advanced.    With the exception of a few recipies, most of these will require you to make a trip to your local grocery store, and a few specialty stores as well.    As a "hobby chef" I find myself waiting for the weekend to attempt most of these recipies, as it lets me spend a good amount  of time in the kitchen.    While the recipies require a bit of work, the results are usually spectacular.  I do agree with another reviewer that the idea of "eyeballing" certain ingredients is a bit of a pain.  I really have no clue what a "3-count" of something is.  So I find myself  guessing at a few ingredents.  I think this is a great cookbook for advanced cooks, and food-lovers alike.   
 We read this book as part of our medieval times studies, and it compliments your studies wonderfully, in that it surveys a very broad range of time, but it all focuses on the discovery of the AMericas, from the last Ice Age to the Europeans.  It should not be your only reading of the subject, but it helps put history in perspective for your 7-10 year old.  There is also a timeline of dates in the back.  This book went well with our Story of the World readings 
 I read this long before it was thought to be a movie - so sight unseen (the movie that is), a great read and seriously funny! MUST READ FIRST and hopefully, you and I won't be disappointed by the movie as I know it can't get the entire point across 
 I won't dissect the installment since many others have done excellent jobs of that here, but I will say that while I enjoyed this installment, it did feel a bit long.  Some have complained about the loose ends that were not tied up here but given the nature of this series, it should be clear that loose ends created in one book will probably be addressed in latter installments.  That said, I could have done without the addition of Fr. Callahan as I felt his back story and connection to Salem's Lot just didn't feel important. I've never been a fan of vampire stories and so that just accentuated my dislike for the long time spent on Callahan.  Taken as a part of the greater story arc, it was satisfying and it compelled me to carry on to the last book. 
   I purchased this can to replace a "Simple Human" round 8 gallon trash can.  The iTouchless had a slight problem upon arrival.  The lid would only open half way when used in "automatic" mode.  Went right to the returns section of Amazon.com and it was resolved with new can in hand by the NEXT day!!      This can works great, it holds a TON of stuff and it looks nice in a "country" kitchen.  I find that the sensor is not overly sensitive.  It is situated in a way that it faces up as opposed to down where it would pick up foot traffic and open.  With two dogs, they do not set it off (medium sized dogs that are about 3 ft. tall).      Had some family over yesterday and they all admired it and had to try it out!  Get one, you will not be sorry!    
 A thinking person's book.  Forget all the gung-ho nonsense about how the barrel of a gun will win the war on terror.  As someone who has experienced a terrorist attack first-hand, I fervently believe that the only way we're going to gain ground is if we put an end to the situations terrorists feed off of (the invisibility of entire peoples).  History has proven this time and time again, but unfortunately we keep reaching for the short-term satisfaction of offense and revenge at the expense of defense.  Both are important, but if we don't eliminate the causes of terrorim (defense) we'll be fighting these fires for eternity. For additional thought-provoking material on terrorism (and if you're serious about studying this subject you should peruse as much as you can), you should also read: 'Making Terrorism History' and the excellent 'Days Captive'.  The first is non-fiction the second is a novel.  Both (combined with 'America the Vulnerable') will elevate your intellect 
 I won't go into plot sypnosis, as it's been detailed in previous reviews of the film; instead, I'd like to address the message and meaning of the film.   In order to fully appreciate Au Hasard Balthazar one must understand the thematic construction of the film. By being literally a passive, dumb beast who is being passed from owner to owner and being mistreated and shown (little) love throughout his life, Bresson uses Balthazar as a witness and reflection -- or both a window and mirror, if you will -- of human nature in all its facets. There are also the clear parallels Bresson establishes between Balthazar and his owners, especially his first owner, Marie. The purpose of such a thematical tool is for the audience to regard Balthazar as another facet of the human condition, but only in the spiritual sense (Bresson takes extreme care in not anthromorphologize the donkey). So, with Balthazar and these group of characters, the film shows the entire spectrum of humanity: purity (Balthazar), good (Jacques), evil (Gérard), weakness (Arnold), selfishness (Merchant), arrogance (Marie's father) and self-pity (Marie). In one or several of these characters, we can see ourselves since they encapsulate the different ways human beings deal with their existence.   Now this is the most important thing to comprehend about the film: Balthazar is an ignorant, unknowing beast who has no choice but to accept everything that happens to him in his life due to his condition, that of being a donkey, a creature who has no intelligence and who has no free will. He simply lives life the way he knows: he is used as an animal of burden, and he does so. He is mistreated by his owners, he accepts the mistreatment. He is shown love and compassion by Marie, he accepts it. He even shares his state of being with other animals (in times of captivity during his stay in the circus and times of freedom during in his deathbed). If you think about it, within the oportunities (or lack thereof) he has been given, and the circumstances (good and bad) he's gone through, Balthazar has achieved to live life to the fullest (and die with utmost grace). Us human beings have a different condition to Balthazar. Human beings have intelligence, reasoning and have the free will to make choices. Yet with all those gifts and advantages, humans have no peace of mind and keep having an attitude towards life and making choices that more often than not, lead to a life of misery and suffering, destroying ourselves and the lives of others in the process.   The simple yet profound question the film basically begs us to ask to ourselves is: "if Balthazar could live life to the fullest, why can't we?". When we realize this reflection on Balthazar's life and reflect it on our own, a sudden feeling of enlightenment, trascendence and spirituality undeniably invades us. Throughout this meaningful revelation, we emerge with a moral clarity (especially concerning the characters in the film) and with a newfound sense of spirituality, hope and a strong will to transform ourselves.   I personally can't think of something more inspiring and life-affirming than that. Au Hasard Balthazar very well might change your life. This is one of the most noble, humane and beautiful works of art, of any medium. 
 Last Call isn't the kind of book that would usually jump out at me when browsing in my local bookstore. I don't have much interest in gambling and the noir genres associated with it, and I would probably set this book down after reading the dust jacket. But a good friend of mine, who has the uncanny ability to know exactly what would be to my taste in fiction, lent me the book assuring me that I would love it. And once again, she knows my taste better than I do. This book is a masterful tale that weaves elements from crime noir, fantasy, the Tarot and TS Eliot into a magical realist stew that is suspenseful and highly entertaining. Think Umberto Eco without the pretention and the obscure Latin phrases and you get an idea of what this book is.  Scott Crane is a marked man. Saved from a fate worse than death as a child he is rasied by an old superstitious gambler named Ozzie. Ozzie has irrational fears. He never plays cards on water and is always using the billowy patterns of smoke to sense the "feel" of the cards. He also takes unusual percautions to protect his anonymity and instill this in his fosterson. Scott and his sister think Ozzie crazy until one day when Scott dares to play in a mysterious poker game on Lake Mead that uses a real Tarot deck. Subsequent to that Scott finds himself locked in a deadly struggle with The Fisher King, who has the power of immortality through assuming new bodies from his gambling victims. It all comes to a head during one unholy Holy week in which Scott and his sister must outthink the King and many other potential rivals to the "Throne" of Las Vegas.  Powers writing is excellent in this novel. He is a master at mapping complex and interweaving plots and injecting them with the right amount of symbolism. Knowing a bit about the Tarot and the medieval Grail legends can help one to enjoy the rich symbolic texture of the novel, but Powers' gifts make the meanings clear even without a background in this material. He also has a gift for vivid characterization, even of the more peripheral characters. One character is destined to play the Fool card in the drama and manifests as a homeless man who lives in special "boxes" all throughout Vegas. Another peripheral character is a homicidal hit man with a pathological need to be friends with his victims first. These characters all have the veneer of reality over them but resonate deeply with the archetypes that Powers is using as the generating symbols of the novel.   This book is a fast read, but a thoroughly enjoyable one. It is rich, darkly comic in places and always suspenseful. Though considered by some to be a fantasy writer, or a science fiction writer, these categories are too small for a writer of Powers ambition. If you enjoy the novels of Eco and Kundera and are looking for something with a similar atmosphere but less burdened with "meaning" this is a wonderful book for you. It's engrossing, but not too heavy and wonderfully written.  Chris Forbes - RIP Bob  
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Owen King is definitely NOT resting on his father's laurels. The title story is complex, thought-provoking and humorous. The others are wonderful are well, very eclectic style. Written much more in the style of John Irving than Owen's father, Stephen King. Owen's future looks very bright indeed. Bravo 
 This is a great book, and makes an excellent gift for dog owners or for people that just like dogs or touching stories.  One especially good thing about it is that you can pick it up at any time and enjoy pieces of it.   What I like most is all the different ways that people discover to communicate their connection with dogs.  If you have had a dog, many of these stories will really resonate.  Highly recommended 
 Founding Brothers is an excellent read for anyone interested in a clear, concise review of our struggle for independence and the early days of our republic.  Ellis' explanations of the vastly different ideas that the founders had concerning what kind of government the new country should have and how to achieve it were captivating 
 This novel is a fast, fun, and thoroughly entertaining read. While not on the same level as the classic fantasy novels, Barron has found a way for the reader to connect to the young boy Merlin, and always want more at the novel's close 
 "The Hungry Ocean" written by Swordfish Captain Linda Greenlaw, details one of her 30 day swordfishing expeditions. Greenlaw describes the preparations she makes before leaving on the trip; the personalities of the men accompanying her on the trip; how she decides where they are going to do the actual fishing; the fishing itself and the equipment used; how she decides when the fishing trip is over; and finally, shows a receipt detailing the money spent on the trip and how much money each fisherman made. Interspersed with the details of this particular trip are chapters called "Mug-Up" with anecdotes of past fishing trips.  "The Hungry Ocean" is a fascinating read. Greenlaw doesn't dwell on the fact that she is a female working in a job dominated by men. She provides detailed explanations of what needs to be done on board to prepare for the fishing, although she sometimes lost me in describing some of the details. I wish pictures had been included of some of the equipment she used. Greenlaw also describes how she deals with the inevitable problems that come up when a number of sleep deprived people are working together in a cramped space for a long period of time.  One of the best parts of the book are the small details Greenlaw includes: how they cook and prepare food on a moving boat, eating off Pyrex pie plates to keep the food from falling off; the practical jokes they play on new fishermen to break the boredom; and the various superstitions fishermen have.  For the most part, Greenlaw comes across as likable, but I couldn't help but feel sorry for the fish as she describes their struggle once captured. Still, I don't begrudge the fishermen; it's a tough and dangerous way to make a living.  "The Hungry Ocean" is a very compelling read. 
 This is truly one of the most inspirational books I've ever read.  It really motivated me to re-engage myself with my family, community and career.  Not having the pressure to save up 100% of the money I need by the arbitrary "deadline" of 65, has allowed me to think more creatively, and passionately, about what I REALLY want to do with my life.  I'm all charged up to enjoy my power years!! 
 Anyone who wants to know more about weed. needs to get this. You will understand how much good comes from leagle hem 
 What you don't know about giving a PERSUASIVE presentation can kill you! This book lays out the inside secrets that the real pros know that most of us do not know. An amazing resource that I refer to over and over again. Frank   
 I purchased Disneymania, Vol 4 for my daugher's fifth birthday and she loves it.  She is a big fan of the Disney Channel and Radio Disney so most of the songs were very familiar to her.  But, heed this warning, be prepared to have the cd requested EVERY TIME you drive anywhere.  
 The new style of the T-macs. These are the best. They are very comfartable. I bought them the day they came out. If you are into black then buy them now. Because I know they are coming out in White and Blue so they will have the same pattern as last year. So if you like black buy now if you like white wait till mid December. Otherwise this show is very comfy and better than last year 
 The performances in this movie were excellent.  The music was above average but I don't think it compares well to earlier musicals done by Hollywood during the supposed "Golden Era" of the genre.  The subjects of the movie were most fascinating and the strongest part of the film; most people didn't get to see what happened behind the scenes of the music industry when music went from an interest to an obsession in the American collective conscious in the 60's and 70's.  It certainly deserved the Oscar nominations it recieved this year 
 My best friend and I were shopping at The Sharper Image when we fell in love with this CD. This is a must have for those who love acoustic guitar and/or Latin music.  Also for those who want to learn the Samba or Tango.  :)  You must venture to your local record store and pick it up 
 Fletcher Henderson led one of the hottest bands of the 1931-34 period.  While most of his competitors were playing society music or novelty songs, Henderson was putting out hotdance music, with jazz content and the music swung hard.  A great cd that features the early 30's sides, and features some fine sidemen such as Coleman Hawkins and Red Allen.  Icludes some jazz classics such as Hotter Then 'Ell, Radio Rhythm, and Wrappin it up.  Exellent introduction to Henderson's hot brand of early swing, mostly due to Benny Carter's innovating arrnagements 
 I have been a fan of Def Leppard since 1980. And every album offers something new to fans. Hysteria reached out and touched more of the Top 40 crowd with Pour Some Sugar on me. But songs like Gods of War and Run Riot rocked hard still. This tour was one of the most amazing concerts I had ever seen. Especially with the return of Rick Allen the THUNDER GOD. They are not a hair band, or a heavy metal band. They are a rock band changing with the time. ROCK O 
 I got this book for Christmas from my son the month before we went to Hawaii. I would never have purchased such a (very) thick stodgy looking guide if I saw it in the bookstore. I devoured it during the thirteen hour flight to Hawaii and must say it was by far the very best travel guide that  I have ever read and used to any destination. (And I have read them all.)  It is so comprehensive and the writing is so well done that reading all of  the information was almost like reading a page turner novel for me. I could  not get enough. Once we were in Hawaii (three islands) we found it totally  indispensible. We traveled with three other guides but with all of their  color photograpy and fancy maps eventually this heavy one was the only one  we eventually felt was worthwhile. After touring extensively on the islands  I read it with even more interest on the long flight home. We plan to  return to see more Hawaiian islands and this is the one we will bring. It  is not glitzy it is the real thing. Enjoy 
 Tom Brokaw was inspired to write this narrative as he attended the 40th anniversary of the D-Day Invasion.  He went as a reporter and came back as a man on a mission.  His mission was to honor a generation of men & women who responded bravely to their personal calls to duty. This book was written, not so much by Mr. Brokaw, as it was by the men & women who lived during this time.  As Captain Joe Foss, a Marine F-4 Wildcat fighter pilot, who participated in the fierce battle for Guadalcanal would say, "those of us who lived have to represent those of us who didn't make it".  Mr. Foss is himself, the recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor. THE GREATEST GENERATION bears witness to the young men & women who gave up their youth in order to sacrifice themselves & their own ambitions to the cause of a greater good.  In the course of serving the effort to win WWII, their everyday acts of bravery & heroism changed the course of the society & the world.  This is not to say, that everyone involved in the war effort acted honorably towards one another;  Mr. Brokaw shines a light on little known acts of hatred & prejudice that continued on despite the premise that we were fighting a war against an enemy that had destructive racial policies of it's own in place.  So, in some places & times, as always, the cream did not rise to the top, and the better nature of people did not appear to show blacks, the Japanese, Hispanics, American Indians & women the way to a new world unfettered by racism & crushing prejudice.  They fought for the country they loved, nontheless.  These men & women forged on in the only system that was known to them and in the process, made life better for all of us.  They gave birth to ideas that would serve as instuments for change in society, some of which we would not see come to the fullness of fruition even in our own lifetimes. Mr. Brokaw invites you to get to know them and realize how the world we live in today came to be shaped by everyday, ordinary young people.  They were children during the Great Depression and youths in their teens and twenties when they answered the call, in a wave of unparalled patriotism brought on by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the banded together and fought a battle to victory against an enemy bent on destroying the world as we know it.  They were loved & revered by those in the countries they liberated.  They were baptized by blood & fire, they were forged into steel, then they returned home, to their families and resumed their lives.  They changed the world in their own indelible yet unassuming ways.  Meet THE GREATEST GENERATION 
 This book is the book you want to read for the best handling of all topics relating to photography.  Here I found great descriptions of terminology that I have puzzled about for months, but could not get answers to.  This  book will improve your photography whether you are just starting or have  been shooting for years 
 To fully understand what this film entails it does help to know a little cultural background to the piece. If someone dies a violent tragic death, it leaves a mark. In the house where this act took place, the opening scenes show a very distraught man and what appears to be his mutilated wife lying the tub. The story centres around this house and the people that have been there, either living there or visiting.  When they leave this mark is on them, they take it with them.  The boy who lived there previously, Toshio appears in both dead and living ghost form, washed out and drawn to healthy and covered in plasters.  It appears he also likes to join in the torment. The boy had never been found after the horrific slaying of his mother, whats touching is his pet cat also seems to have suffered the same fate as this is with him too. Follow the paths of very different people who go about their business until it becomes clear there has been a blight on their lives. Heart breaking, gripping.  The CCTV footage of the carpark showing the security guard being 'engulfed' by the darkness and its progress up and then through the screen. Honestly, it was offensive to the eyes, I mean that the visual impact of the shadowy figure was so well done that it was so real it was horrific, in the same way that people who have seen the deleted scenes from the original Exorcist are horrifed when they see the girl crab walk backwards down the stairs. I have the utmost respect for this movie, I have not watched the remakes - to me, you can't beat the best and thats what this film is 
 In 'Friday Foster' Grier is getting even closer to 'Cleopatra Jones' territory, but without the fun and style of that movie or its sequel. I was slightly disappointed when I saw it because it didn't deliver the typical kick a** madness you normally get from a Pam Grier movie! The storyline is tame, the forced political correctness is only pesky and the whole stuff lacks in violence and sex, so prepare for blaxploitation in its mildest form!   In here we have Pam Grier, as Friday- a magazine photographer, who is given the assignment of covering the airport arrival of the richest black man in America. But Friday gets more than she bargained for as this routine assignment turns into an assassination attempt. Because Friday was able to get some shots of the would be killers, her life is in danger. Soon, everywhere she goes, people end up dead. Friday's investigations lead her to corrupt government officials, a renowned preacher with an eye for more than the Bible, and something called The Black Widow.  Pam Grier is convincing in the lead, but not as tough as "Coffy" or "Foxy Brown"! This movie actually has one of the best supporting casts of any blaxploitation film, but fails to hold up on its end. If you want to be entertained somehow watch out for the performances of genre greats like Yaphet Kotto plays Grier's detective buddy, and Julius Harris is her boss. Plus there's Scatman Crothers ('Black Belt Jones'), Thalmus Rasulala ('Blacula'), Godfrey Cambridge ('Cotton Comes To Harlem'), Paul Benjamin ('Across 110th Street') and Carl Weathers ('Rocky'), as well as Eartha Kitt who is a hoot as a flamboyant fashion designer, Isaac the bartender from 'The Love Boat' (Ted Lange) and even inexplicably 'Gilligan's Island's Thurston Howell III (Jim Backus)!   This film does have some lighthearted tone in comparison to her other films. That's not to say there aren't plenty of killings, but it never feels as depressing, downbeat, or serious as something like "Coffy." It's a nice change of pace to see Grier laughing and joking with Kotto in many of the film's scenes. The action scenes are good and funny at the same time. One of my personal favorites is the rooftop chase with Kotto and Weathers and the second being the fashion show. The fashion line up was just as crazy because the models showed no form of expression going down the runway while doing a form a vogue-dance that sort of scared me a bit while maintaining a zombie like expression across their face, you have to see it in order to understand it.  I'm a fan of 70s Blaxplotation because it reminds me of my parents era and fashion sense, gotta love them. As I stated before "Friday Foster" may not be a spectacular film but it's still welcome in my movie collection. 
 "Graham's experienced, original, honest approach in helping business unit leaders improve themselves, which in turn improves the companies they run, is powerful and full of real work and world wisdom.  Tales From the Top is a must read for managers and business leaders 
 This movie is a Christian Classic for all believers. Francis of Assisi inspires us to put our hope and trust in God. 
 As I have two older teens, this book helped me a lot with them, and it helped them a lot with themselves and each other.   Our family is working hard at being aware of each others feelings, and as a father, I'm committed to raising the best teens possible into adults that are a positive example.   The information given in this book is extremely helpful, and it also goes along with another book that has made a tremendous difference in the life of my teens called Stop Being the String Along.   Each book brought my family and my teens information that has significantly altered their views, and behaviors into positive ones.   If you have teens, or work with teens, I feel that both books would be excellent required reading. They have made a world of difference.  
 I'm glad that we've had the Cartoon Network for the past decade or so to intorduce new cartoons with a quality previous TV cartoons never came clsoe to.  "Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends" has wonderful animation and great characters.  I was a little hesitant at first when I saw this advertised, thinking it may be a treacly, feel-good show.  I should have known better.  This is one of my all-time favorite cartoons.  As other reviewers have pointed out, "Foster's" is gut bustingly funny and appeals to both adults and kids without being crude.  I have nothing against crude humor, but it's great to see a cartoon that's so funny on its own merits.  My favorite character is Eduardo (I can't help but like a character with the same first name as I), but all the characters are well conceived and able voiced.  This is a great collection and I'm hoping we won't have to wait long for the second season. 
 Great for a broad overview.  Could use more details and restaurants 
 When I was reading this book, I was recognizing myself on every page. Every motion, smell, and sound was coming out of my life. I was running together with the Long-Distance Runner and feeling all his sorrows. I know what the nails in guts feel like and how hard it is to win a real victory that gives you real success. One against everyone. This is how one man fights one hundred thousand men and wins. Everything can happen during the race but fools don't understand it. The best men are beasts and human beings, lions and foxes, machines and cellular structures. I would bow to that man twenty thousand times if I was to have an honor to meet him. This is a book about me 
 Every song rocks. One of the best Queen albums I have ever heard.   
 This is the quintessential Rauhofer club experience.  Close your eyes and it is instantly 5am on the Roxy floor, and you are surrounded by sweaty, half naked bodies moving as one in ecstasy.  This cd is packed with sexy beats.  This cd is f*cking your ears and body from start to finish 
 Same HP burner/player that is $30 or more in the local stores.  Installation was fast and easy.  Nero software installed fast, very little info on the Nero products, to play dvd you need to install the Cyber DVD player on the Nero disk.  
 Quammen is a delight to read. His writing is lively, clear, workmanlike (in the very best sense of the word), with that spring in the literary step that a writer has or doesn't have, but has to be born with -- and I speak  both as a fellow writer and as a professional editor. There is no  in-between: Quammen is a real writer. His work is always infused with  delight and usually makes me laugh out loud at least once per essay.  His  books teach without being obnoxiously didactic. These essays are full of  wonder, information, and delight, and they are a pleasure to read -- and it  doesn't get better than that 
 Brandon Lee was able to weave a strange little tapestry of vengeance, love, hate and sorrow as the title character, The Crow and as Eric Draven leaving me with the impression that, had he lived, this would likely have been his ticket to stardom.  Instead it served as the epitaph for a great man from a revered family.  Another movie taken from the pages of a comic book series, this one written and drawn by James O'Barr, it carried with it all the sorrow that James put onto the page.  The movie contained little of the self inflicted pain the Crow suffered but still got across the horror that lived in his heart.    The characterizations of each of the players in this little drama were right on, meaning the casting director did one hell of a job.  Alex Proyas directions were amazing, and though the body double for Brandon left a little to be desired, it had to be done to complete the movie.  A cult classic?  Truly.  But to be honest, I think this movie carries with it so much by way of being a love story, a ghost story, an action movie and a horror movie that it should go beyond cult status and be recognized as simply what it is, a classic 
 My personal interest is in building a new home within the next 2 years.  A home that is more friendly to the environment--that is smaller, and utilizing the sun in my home design.  The information alone in this book is invaluable and the designs by the architect are amazing.  What an awesome utilization of space and design she has created 
 I read this book for my book club.  It was a very interesting read and an enlightening look into life in Africa as well as into the male psyche and into human nature. I think one reason I found it slightly lacking was that it is on Time's 100 Best Novels; I don't know if it warranted that and that made me expect more. I would still highly recommend it if you want something different and interesting to read that is also a fairly easy read. 
 This is a lot better quality than I thought it would be.  It is really thick and quite large.  I'm buying another one right now for my other car seat to replace the protector that came with the car seat 
 With this book Claire McNab returns to the excellent form of her earlier Carol Ashton mysteries. A highly enjoyable well written book which gives the flavour of Australia without dropping into cliches. Both the main plot  and the usual romantic sub plot are excellent. The book is full of suspense  and the intrigue is maintained until the very end. Highly recommend this  book for all who enjoy detective mysteries 
 For fans of alternative history, the stories of Harry Turtledove have always promised enjoyable presentations of intriguing possibilities. This book is the second in his "tetralogy" examining a world in which the South won the Civil War. American Front picks up the story in 1914 with the start of a world war between the U.S. and its ally Germany on the one hand, and the Confederate states, Britain, and France on the other. Turtledove knows his history and it shows, as the novel's events ring true enough to their real-life counterparts while developing in new and intriguing ways.    Yet this is a different novel from its predecessor. Though a sequel to "How Few Remain", Turtledove examines the war from a different perspective here, following events through original characters rather than historical ones. This gives him greater flexibility in his depiction of them, yet it is the characters that are the weakest part of the book. While the plotting in most of the story arcs is quite good at sustaining interest, the characters have a sameness about them, using many of the same phrases and slang when expressing themselves. This stands in stark contrast to his previous novel, in which each of the main characters he uses is vividly and distinctly realized, and makes for a weaker work than the excellent inaugural work. Nonetheless, readers interested in an engrossing work of alternative history will find much to enjoy in this story about a divided America plunging into the hell of a "Great War.&quot 
 My son loves Roald Dahl books and I know that some of the content is inappropriate for a 6 year old but he seems to really connect with Roald Dahl's writing.  He read Matilda tonight before going to bed and around 10:00pm came into the living room balling his eyes out.  He couldn't understand how Matilda would want to leave her parents or why her parents would not even look back as they were leaving forever.  It took over an hour to console our child and I regret not reading the book myself first.  I understand that great books do exactly what Matilda did to my child but use caution with younger kids, I only wish someone would have posted a review similar to mine and I would have never bought Matilda for my son.  While I'm here, he read Holes and was very upset by the child abuse portrayed in that book as well, again, just a warning 
 A lot of adopted children search out their birth parents, but not as many adoptive parents seek them out instead. Roisin McAuley's debut "Singing Bird" starts as a family drama, evolving into a look at children, fidelity, marital love, religion and most importantly, the story of adoption and family.   Twenty-seven years ago, successful businessman Jack and his wife Lena had no children... until they went on vacation in Ireland. There, a local nun asked if they wanted to adopt a baby, and because they were desperate for a child, they accepted. Now, their daughter Mary is beautiful, accomplished, and a rapidly ascending opera star.   Then one day, Lena receives a phone call from the nun. She's about to retire, and is checking up on her "babies," but Lena is strangely uneasy. She decides to travel to Ireland to find out more, and ends up searching for Mary's birth parents... and her own. But as she searches through the cold trails, Lena finds out disturbing truths about the past... and a dark secret in her own marriage.   This is apparently Roisin McAuley's first book. That comes as something of a pleasant surprise, since her writing is so polished. "Singing Bird" is a pretty simple story that tackles a variety of topics, and delivers a gut-punch as well. Not many authors can do that on their first attempt.   McAuley's writing style is very plain and mostly lacking in detail. But it does have quite an impact -- she uses quiet language to communicate issues without being preachy. There's an ominous undertone from the first page onward, hinting at the intensity that builds up in a climax in the last chapters. Saying any more would give away the secrets that Lena uncovers.   Lena herself is an unusual heroine, forging ahead through all the nasty little secrets buried in Ireland. The things she finds challenge her Catholic faith, and her belief in family, but in the end she ends up stronger than ever. Her husband Jack is something of a dark horse, although that is necessary to the plot; her rambunctious pal Alma is a lot more interesting.   "Singing Bird" is an unusual, intense book, and is an unusually polished debut for Ms. McAuley. A dramatic novel that is definitely worth reading 
 We are pleased with our recent purchase.  We were surprised that it came through the US mail service. It did have a broken part that we believe is used on the cord to open the umbrella.  
 This book is incredibly informative.  It is a resource guide and explains technical information in a clear understandable way.  If you are building a home or renovating and don't want to rely on the contractor for all the explanations, this book will be very useful! 
 Don Marquis, a still mysterious figure in American Literature, created these stories/poems for his column in a newspaper in the early twentieth century. They are "written" by Archy, a cockroach, who types them out by jumping from key to key on Mr. Marquis' typewriter. Of course, he can't use the shift key so these pieces are without capitals and (mostly) without punctuation. Marquis imaginatively conjures a view of the world from an insect's perspective, humourously commenting on then-current events and the human condition in general. The topical nature of this material will probably make it uninteresting for all but the most mature juvenile readers, but adults will surely respond to Marquis' gentle and insightful humor 
 Most pure badger hair brushes on the market sell for at least $50, so this is a bargain compared to most.  For the first week, my brush shed a little; however, this stopped after the first week.  I have been happy with the brush, especially considering the price.  I would recommend this brush for anyone who thinks they want to start using a shaving brush.  This is a good, inexpensive way to "test the waters".  Then, if you find that you will continue using a shaving brush, I would recommend buying a higher-end brush.  
 Though it may seem a little dated, the issues and questions Martin raises are still relevant today. This thoughtful book speaks to the alienation and detachment many women feel at the hands of modern Western medicine and should  be of interest to anyone studying medical anthropology, cultural andthropology, sociology, or women's studies. Some people may have problems with the methodology or feel that the book is pushing a feminist agenda (personally, I thought the chapter on PMS was a little muddy) but most people I know who've read it have found something in it that they can relate to even if they don't agree with Martin 100% 
 This book was pretty weighty - real live scholarly work, rather than simple sectarian gloss.  I particularly enjoyed the way Professor Stone placed the religious leaders of the time into their proper historical context and showed the way the traditions cross-pollenated with each other.  The part on Nichiren was most informative, and gave an objective perspective on the events which occurred after Nichiren's death.  Cool pictures of lots of mandalas, too 
 I have read many books in this genre.  Many are too hard to read for those who do not have an economic background.  Some water it down so much that one wonders if it's just hype.  This book has easy-to-understand examples, and it offers practical ideas on how to protect our financial future.  I think it should be required reading for high school students 
 I select classic children's books. If there are several available, I always select the one with the best illustrations. This had the best illustrations of all the "Doctor Dolittle" books offered by Amazon 
 The book was in great condition and the response time was quick. I appreciate that as every day that goes by was significant in my relationship that needs rescuing!! 
 Terry Date has done it again!  This album is a masterpiece, right down to the artwork.  I found a review saying that this was one of the best albums released in england in '05 and thats an understatement.  Not only was this was top 5 in best albums of '05, but maybe the decade.  The vocals are vibrant, the drums are nasty, the bass lines are sick, and the guitars are absolutely incredible, and the best riffs ive heard in years.  I love this album so much I made the mistake of buying "casually dressed and deep in conversation", what a mistake.  Its almost as if two different bands have the same name.  Casually dressed is a joke.  The production is terrible, there is no energy, vocals are terrible, and the overall theme and feel of the album is uninspired.  FFOF is on the right track, and if they stay the course I will absolutely buy the next album if it sounds anything like this.  Nice job on the progress guys!  Keep it up 
 When entering the competitive, cut-throat professional world, where stories abound of the dorm-mate who just landed the six figure job at Goldman Sachs, "The Bonfire of the Vanities" just may help you maintain the precious altruism that you grew up with.  This book is honest.  It's a story of how people become when they allow their ego to be defined by their over-compensation, and it's not pretty.  'Bonfire' is witty and human.  Mr. Wolfe does a fantastic job of developing his characters into people you'll care about, and builds their stories until you'll just cringe over the situations they put themselves into.  In the end you'll thank God you're not them. 
 Epstein could have written a very skeptical biography of this powerful woman:  her rollercoaster life certainly gave him enough ambiguous material.  Instead, he's written a balanced and engaging account, describing both the power and attraction of her spiritual talents and the engulfing loneliness of her personal life.  A fascinating and very readable book 
 David Grisman, according to no less than Stephane Grappelli, is a mandolin deity.  He has fused blues, bluegrass, classical, jazz, reggae, salsa, flamenco, rock and nearly every other musical style in the acoustic vein.   In his career he has performed with a "who's who" of pretty much  all the musical styles listed above.  Acclaimed instrumental virtuosos such  as Mark O'Connor, Mike Marshall, John Carlini, Darol Anger and Tony Rice  rose to prominence in his bands.  Acclaimed masters such as Grappelli, Doc  Watson, Martin Taylor and Earl Scruggs have recorded with him. This  "Dawg-gone Good" collection walks you through the various Grisman  bands.... and some blisteringly good music rises from these grooves.. 
 This movie will send chills down your spine.... the music... especially the hauntingly superb ballad "questions in a world of blue" ... will both terrify and delight you simultaneously... there will be numerous scenes that actually haunt you.. though you will  crave to see them again and again... a movie to watch with someone beside you.... a movie that will frighten you and make you unbelievably grief stricken at the same time...I cannot recall a movie that stays with you like this ... satisfy your curiosity... though there are a couple of negative reviews,,,.. the overwhelming number of comments are pretty much exactly like this one.... the soundtracks from FWWM and the series are also hauntingly beautiful.... if you are a DJ by chance..... play "questions in a world of blue" as a ballad at your club.... I guarantee you will be questioned as to "what was that" more than any other song you have recently played....enjoy......I think.. 
 I grew up with this film, now i bought it for my 3 and 5 yo nephews and they watch it over and over. Classic Disney 
 I got this cottage for my 14 month old daughter and she LOVES it.  We keep it in the house and our daughter is in it every chance she gets.  She likes to sit on the pre-made chairs and eats snacks on the little table, she also loves to talk on the included telephone which is too cute!!!  For the price, this house is a great buy and she will be able to use if for a few more years.    I was a little nervous about buying something so large on-line because I was afraid it would arrive broken but it arrived fast and in perfect condition and the free shipping from Amazon is such a great deal!!!    The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because the flooring inside has deep grooves and if your little one is bare footed and playing in it for long periods, it can be painful on the feet.  I resolved this issue by going to the home store and buying a small grey bathroom rug to match and pad the flooring.  Now its more than perfect and we LOVE it!!!      
 My Australian exchange student introduced these magnificant chocolate bars to me in January, and have loved them ever since!!! I don't know why they aren't sold in the USA, I've looked everywhere and have yet to find them! I bought some recently in Canada, and before that, relied on my Aussie exchange student to send them over. Crunchies are the BEST thing that has ever happened to the chocolate industry!!! The taste is undescribable, they melt in your mouth and are just SUPER SUPER GOOD! TRY ONE! < 
 I fell in love with this album the second I heard it.  This album captures the essence of two friends just sitting around and playing old time tunes.  This album also affirmed by admiration for jerry garcia showing his true talent outside of the grateful dead 
 Panties all across the gay ghettos of America are rapidly forming into wads over Larry Kramer's newest diatribe, The Tragedy of Today's Gays.  Kramer, famous for not holding back even a microscopic amount of vitriol, is doing what I have long been wanting to see - he's takin' the gays to task for their behavior, both past and present, and the lack of leadership in the gay community.  My favorite anti-Kramer argument has already surfaced - that he should shut up because he's giving right-wingers ammunition in their fight against us.  Right. They certainly couldn't go into any gay bar, log on to any gay website or even talk to Joe Gay and figure out for themselves that the gay 'community' is adrift in a sea of narcissistic, hedonistic and ultimately self-destructive behavior.  We do such a good job of keeping that all under wraps, right?  If it weren't for him tellin' tales out of school, we'd look like angels to the rest of the world, right?  Right.  Larry Kramer may not have oodles of tact or the best ability to persuade without beating people over the head while screaming at them, but his argument is based largely upon his belief that there is no more time left to be polite.  He argues (correctly, in my opinion) that gay men are too immature to police themselves.  Drug abuse is skyrocketing, apathy about AIDS has led to a spike in unsafe sex and rampant transmission of STD's - and not just HIV - and politically we are weaker now than we ever were before the dawn of Will & Grace and Ellen.  What's the disconnect?  I would think it's probably that there is a large portion of the gay community that feels like we've already 'arrived' from a civil rights perspective.  Gay bashing is down, most people haven't gotten fired or been kicked out of a home because of their sexuality.  It's exacerbated by the fact that the emotional maturity of the average gay man is in the toilet.  We loathe ourselves, and we loathe each other.    Perhaps my experience in life is unique, but I've never seen a straight person be as inherently evil or ostracizing as the gays are to each other.  We judge each other based on completely irrelevant and superficial criteria, we alienate based on looks, age, genitalia, income and a host of other things that have absolutely nothing to do with who we are as people.  But when criticized from the outside, we lash out and tell those who disagree with us that they had damn well better love us unconditionally and not judge.  Hypocrisy?  I applaud Mr. Kramer - not necessarily because of the things he has to say, but because he has the courage to say them.  He is essentially holding up a mirror and forcing the gay men of today to look into it - it's not his fault we don't like what we see.  I hope that once the collective masses stop whining about being judged, they'll actually sit back and think, realizing that as a community we are actually moving backwards in our quest for equality, and we're hurting ourselves and each other in the process at unprecedented levels. 
 This is a full-color rendition of classic comics in the 20th century. These comics include : - Air Wave I  - The All-Star Squadron - The Perisphere 1939 World's Fair - Beast Boy who emulates animals - Busmaster who replicates reptilian abilities - Captain Marvel who is the world's mightiest boy - The Wizard Sorcerer amongst many others  This work is a curiosity for comic enthusiasts everywhere 
 After living with this film for 15 years, it seems to me that the best description of its theme comes in the words of the character Liz (Jane Birkin), who in context is speaking of the work of her husband, the painter Frenhofer.  According to her, it concerns something "shameful--it's not the body that is shameful, not the nudity, but something else . . ."  That "something else" is a violation, existentially speaking, of the enigma of the painter's model.  Such a violation cannot be seen without the mediation of art.  In a cinematic context, it is the risk the direction takes whenever it approaches its subject frontally, and we can see Rivette's tendency to retreat to wide shots, to place events off-screen, or to circle behind his players. Is this a critique of Bresson, who insisted on calling his players "models" rather than "actors?"  (It is impossible not to recall the storied psychological scars Bresson's methods allegedly left on his players. )  It is clearly not that simple, for there are close-ups in NOISEUSE that seem to be as cruel to the actors as Frenhofer is to his model.  This goes beyond Bresson in other ways: Rivette, always the reader, has patched together a thumping good story from literary sources ranging from Poe to Balzac to James, and in the process has created a true mystery thriller.  That the mystery hinges on four-minute shots of a hand scratching out a drawing makes it no less thrilling.  It tumbles forward toward a profoundly ironic ending worthy of the best James novels.  The initial critical take on this film was that it was the most thorough document of the artistic process ever committed to film.  Well, yes and no.  It seems to be about the artistic process of a painter, but I think there may be a playful game of "bait-and-switch" afoot.  Watch Béart.  Watch, especially, Piccoli, who is a veritable encyclopedia of the actor's art, as mesmerizing in his scudding, absent-minded movements as he is in his sudden precision, always surprising.  Rivette's devotion to actors is clear in all his films: think of his sets, so resembling stages with their creaky boards, a sound "effect" in Rivette that more often than not takes the place of score.  It may be that the artist of canvas, plaster, stone, or screen may reveal something secret, even  shameful, in his models.  It may even be that the unscrupulous artist is a thief of the soul.  But Rivette, for one, shows in LA BELLE NOISEUSE that he has given these things some serious thought.  And he is always generous to his actors.  The result is that the trust between artist and model demonstrated in this film amounts to a strong rebuke to the idea that film cannot show thought.  It can; it comes at a price, but in the hands of a master it can be as great a gift to the players as it is to the audience 
 So often we stereotype autistics as being very limited in their ability to do basic functions of daily life. While this is true of some autistics, this book reveals that autism is not a single,universal condition, but a spectrum with a wide range of abilities as well as disabilities (the book's editor, who is autistic, is a college instructor). This book opens both the mind and the heart, enlightening readers about the variety of people who fall under the umbrella "autistic". 
 Yes, there are some flaws, but this is an amazing, important work that should be read, then embraced by all of us who do the people's work.  As a librarian and libraries are the most middle class of institutions, I see so clearly what we do (and don't do) to build bridges out of poverty.  Essential reading 
 I love the feel and they washed up great. I usually dry my sheets on low temp in the dryer and never had a wrinkle problem. The sheets look great on the bed.They have more than enough room for thick double pillow-top beds. I would buy again. A real steal at $14.99 
 It's a little bit distressing in the result. The woman Miss Lily Bart  is the hero in her own world of social prejudices about her role in society. It is well written and reminds one at the end of Crane's Maggie. We get an anthropological study of woman in New York society in the very early 20th century. The flapper of the 20's was a reaction to this sort of moral decay 
 I really liked the first half of this book.  What happens to humanity and the motivations for leaving earth are haunting.  The fact that the ending leaves you hanging on what is real and whats not, including maybe even the first half was somewhat disappointing but it wasn't quite the typical ending either so I give it 4 stars instead of 3 
 How do I begin describing this book? this marvelous novel penned by an Austrian writer who was not indebted to the Armenian people and owed them nothing. How do I describe and compress this eight-hundred page long book into a miniscule summary?  The truth of the matter is, is that words alone cannot describe Franz Werfel's "The Forty Days of Musa Dagh". It is too grand a story that should, rather, be read by everyone and experienced to the greatest extent possible in the human spirit. The novel revolves around the life and culture of the Armenian people in a Western region of Syria in 1915. The Ottoman Empire, lead by the  Young Turkish leadership have enacted the state-wide policy of genocide against the Armenians. Sensing the impending the danger, the 4,000 people of this region are forced to take shelter on the towering and biblical mountain of Musa Dagh. With a Turkish military force encircling the mountain, it is up to the Armenians to defend their way of life or die and vanish into history.   I do not wish to impede on others' reviews and assert my position on whether or not they are correct, it is their opinions after all; however, those who gave this book a one star rating did it out of malice and contempt over what they see as a misrepresentation of their country's history. Rather they looked at what the book was professing about and instead of placing what they thought of a well-written novel, they placed their version of the events of 1915.   It is of no matter, it is up to the reader to gain an understanding from what the reviewer provides. Werfel composes a beaufiful note which instills the reader's spirt with much more than words, it gives them hope, it gives them proof that perhaps there are happy and positive stories that stem from tragedies. Werfel couldn't have done it any better 
 Of all the classic Lee "Scratch" Perry produced albums of the '70s (i.e., Junior Murvins' "Police and Thieves," Max Romeo's "War Inna Babylon"), this is hands down the best.  Believe all the hype you're reading in all the reviews on this site.  Cedric Myton's angelic falsetto, Roy Johnson's vibrant tenor, and Scratch's insane, towering production (is that the "Reggae Cow" I hear?) join together to produce an epic work.  Are you skeptical when you hear me use the term "epic" when describing a reggae CD?  Listen and you will understand.  This CD is 100% essential.  As an addendum, if this whets your appetite for more Scratch Perry, it would pay for you to track down a copy of Perry's close-second best title, the Upsetter's "Super Ape" which is, inexpicably, out of print at the time of this writing 
 Writing from what is clearly a Freudian perspective, he nevertheless acknowledges two forms of commodity fetishism: the first he describes as the passive Marxist view--commodities appear to have value all their own which operates as a blind to the real social labor process by which that value is created; and, second, the active Freudian view: rendered powerless by the watchful eyes of others, but especially the state, first female, then male, consumers invest commodities with a phallic significance, hoping to become powerful through the act of their consumption (surely the Romans did something similar.) While Stratton artfully describes the way consumerism has become sadomasochistically fetishized, culminating in, for example, a celebration of man-made women, such as those found in Pygmalion to Fritz Lang's Metropolis (should we count Madonna among their number?); and there are certainly analogies which can be made between the worker-capitalist relations and the sadomasochistic scene; and doubtless purchases are made on advertizers' promises of sexual prowess; nevertheless casting feelings of psychosexual powerlessness as the engine of consumerism, not only fails to consider who has the means to consume, but utterly fails to answer whether wealthy men do in fact consider themselves powerless?      
 Microsoft has created an extraordinary machine. Crisp graphics and so far the library of games available are impressive. The only problem I have is that Microsoft produced a defective product. For the first few months it played fine with only aa couple of moments where the games would freeze. No biggie. Then it died. No problem, sent it in for repairs under warranty. Free of charge. Cool. Got it back and it played well with me actually beating Ghost Recon with no problems. I stopped playing for a while but when I tried playing again BAM! Ring of Death. Warranty over. $130-140 dollars to fix. Yay. I think I'm going to throw it against the wall and buy a new one. Hopefully Microsoft has found all the solutions to the defects. 
 This book deals with two of the greatest transformations in natural history.  The first part deals with how fish developed their body to live on land and the second explains how some mammals changed to go back and live in the water.  The author explains how evolution, both micro and macro, works and gives us a tiny history of how Darwin's idea of natural selection changed how we thought about life on Earth. The book not only tosses in a few new ideas, like early fish might of had both gills AND lungs, but but also shows how paletontolgy, ecology, genetics and embryology are being used to solve the secrets of macroevilution that biologists have been trying to uncover for centuries. Carl Zimmer knows his stuff and knows how to explain it without confusing the readers 
 As far as content goes, the book is certainly a treasure house of information. However, on certain sensitive socio-political topics, some of the contributors clearly show their bias. Thus, one should approach such entries with the proverbial grain of salt. I feel that an encyclopedia's contributors should be as factual and objective as possible, and make a point to avoid any appearance of personal bias.. 
 Paulo Coelho will go down in history as one of the greatest authors of all times.  I read 'The Alchemist' first and have become a huge fan of Paulo Coelho since.  He makes you feel that you personally know all of the characters in his stories.  He also writes in a style like no other author.  He makes a reference about a character and then explains it right away instead of making you wait sixty to seventy pages to find out what is going on with the character.  I love 'Eleven Minutes'! 
 My mother bought this book for me when I was a young girl-tomorrow I'll be 66 yrs old..I remember reading it over and over and even though I knew the ending, I'll could sabor the whole story like the first time--Now I'm buying for my grandchildren and hoping that they will enjoy it as much as I did 
 I have been playing guitar for a year and a half now. I discovered Steve Vai off of this album last summer. I was curious when i heard the beginning of it. And intrigued when i heard the intro to "The Audience is Listening", and when Vai began to play on "The Audience is Listening" i was thoroughly blown away by his insane whammy bar antics and incredible use of the wah pedal. I have never heard the wah pedal been used so effectively and put toward such a devastating effect. This album is full of moments of complete guitar domination. If you are interested in playing guitar, pick up this album. If you are a guitar player and are in a creative rut, pick up this album and get inspired brother 
 I had the opportunity to listen to BTS over the internet. The LP shines brighter than the northern lights and fills my soul like blubber on Christmas morning. I hope that one day I will be able to see them live. Until then they will remain in my visions 
 I've read quite a few of Nora Roberts's books and this was the only one on which I had the complete 'wowzer' reaction.  I mean, seriously: wow.  This is a book full of content, with enough dimensions to the story to keep me busy for weeks and weeks, reading and rereading it to get it all.  Ms Roberts brings you into the gold and glamour of Hollywood with the same talented ease as she brings you into the green and whispers of the Olympic Rain Forest.  The characters are likable, and believable, and most certainly not your average Roberts book.  Livvy could be a pain in the butt as much as Noah could be a persistent annoyance.  And readers will find themselves grieving for Julie MacBride along with Jamie, Rob, Val, David and Livvy herself.  And there's a surprising twist at the end that will leave you reeling . .  
 I thought I was maybe going to say this is the best book I've ever read, but how do you even go about even forming an opinion like that? So I'll simply say instead that so far as I can tell, this book has done more for my feeling of personal well-being than anything else that I can recall reading, for reasons that aren't completely clear to me. The title and the cover are so bad, I'm glad for once I was able to brush those concerns aside and just start reading.  This book is kind of hard to write about, possibly just because I'm unfamiliar with gender studies and possibly because its scope is so ambitious and broad. I didn't really know what I was getting into when I started reading it, I think I just suspected that it would help me with my own private problems with the American "Dream". It has to do with what Ehrenreich calls "male revolt," which (without being aware of it) is something I'm interested in, both historically and in my own life. I think it's one thread that ties together a lot of my seemingly disparate interests: Playboy, the Beat generation writers, 1960s counterculture, etc. Or I guess I liked these things without understanding what the appeal of them was, and I think Ehrenreich nails it here, that these various subcultures are more than anything else arguments against and alternatives to the supposedly traditional and natural "breadwinner" role, and reading this book dissolved this pressure I didn't even know was there, really: To settle down, to marry, to reproduce, to be "masculine," to conform. And I think this book is sort of a starting place for other options.  And plus a lot of these things I liked are considered to be sexist, and while Ehrenreich doesn't go so far as to for example say Playboy in the 1950s was a feminist magazine, she does show how its primary message (which, according to her, has very little to do with photographs of naked women) was in large part in line with the message of the feminist movement of the following decade. And maybe part of this book's agenda is as a sort of feminist appeal to men, but it is the sort of appeal I'd never heard before, that under the breadwinner/housewife system, things are bad for men, too, and possibly worse than for women, although Ehrenreich doesn't go so far as to say that. More than anything else she seems to want men and women to stop blaming one another on an individual level for their problems and look instead at a bigger picture. She seems very careful in what she says, and I'm sure I'm putting my own twist (and wishful thinking) into this and making it seem so confusing, too, but the book itself is well-researched and easy to read.    And then I guess I just felt a thrill going over all this still fairly recent history, things my parents lived through, what was happening in this world just before I entered into it, and this was the good stuff, the stuff I was really interested in, not the tedious details of various conflicts we had to memorize in high school. I'd like to read more elsewhere to find out what has been happening from the early 80s up until the present time 
 I must say that the whole reason I ordered this book was because of an English class I am taking. I really enjoyed the book and I also appreciated the expediant delievery. Originally I had ordered the book from a site that my professor recommended. When the book was over a month late I decided to do what I should have done in the first place--order from Amazon. The book ended up being fantastic and I will ALWAYS order from Amazon.  As far as the book, the author is very talented. She creates a world for the reader that we as humans may miss on a daily basis. I cannot wait for Ms. Gilchrist to come out with a sequel to it. The book was great plain and simple 
 This book is great. Hard to believe from a nutrition book, but this one becomes a pager turner. Once I started reading about all the great benefits of flax, I just wanted to find out about everything it has to offer. This book is full of great research, but you don't have to be a doctor to read it. The best part is, once you decide to started using flax, there are a bunch of great recipes right at your fingertips. I've tried several of the salad dressings and so far I love them all 
 King Lear is an intensive study of human nature. It tells a story of a king who is driven by his folly, divides the kingdom between his daughters Gonril and Regan , and disinherits Cordelia his youngest loving daughter and banishes her. he soon discovers his mistake when his two daughters conspire against him when he tried to go back to his loving banished daughter it was too late . he was loosing his mind and he died soon after he heard of the death of his youngest daughter . along the story of the king runs a another parallel story of Gloucester who's bastard son convinces him the his other legitimate son Edgar is planning to kill him . so he tries to lay hand on Edgar to punish him .. when Gloucester informed king lear that his daughters are planning to kill him . Cornwall his daughter's husband plucks out his eyes his son Edgar disguised helps his father and stays beside him until he discovers that it was his son and discovers his mistake towards him. I enjoyed reading it very much, specially that it's language is simple .. much more simpler than Romeo and Juliet . Macbeth , and Hamlet for example. this is the fourth play for me to read for Shakespeare and every time I adore this genius writer more and more. You shouldn't miss it, I hope you enjoy reading it .  
 This is a classic movie and must have for anyone who has ever worked in an office of any kind.  You definitely will recognize some of your "friends" in the movie.  
 I gave Fair Weather five stars.  They get a letter from  their anut and she wants them to come to the fair .Then they go to the fair. I gave it five stars because at the end it got really exciting. I recommend it because it was very good It was very cool and fun to read 
 Let's face it--there really isn't very much to process mapping.  I've searched for books on it, and none of them seem to be more than 100 pages.  The reason is that there isn't much to mapping out a process.  So, for the limited subject material, this book does an excellent job.  It was a fast read.  I think I read it in about 2 hours, going pretty slowly through it.  This book talks about three types of process maps, and from the book it says:  "Since most readers may already have experience with flowcharts, the main emphasis of this book will be on relationship and process maps.  The steps you should follow to create both types of maps are included."  However, I think it focused equally on all three of the types of process maps.  I mention this so you don't think that this will jut be a book on flowcharting.  I thought it was good, and helpful.  It gave me some new stuff to think about, and it's a basic look at process mapping.  And, like I said, there really isn't a much more complex way of looking at it

 Rod Stewart calls this disc "one of my favorite live recordings of all time".  Critics have been raving about it for years. And so when RCA released a completely redesigned and remastered version of this performance in the Fall of 2005 I simply could not resist.  "One Night Stand!: Sam Cooke Live At The Harlam Square Club" delivers one of the most memorable "live" performances I have ever heard. When a good friend of my introduced to me to the earlier 1990 RCA release of this concert I was simply blown away.  It was not at all what I expected.  I had only seen a couple of black and white clips of Sam Cooke performing on network TV shows in the late 50's and early 1960's.  As I recall he appeared to be rather stiff and altogether forgettable. "Live At The Harlem Square Club" totally changed my perception of Sam Cooke as a performer.  When this concert was recorded in 1963, Sam was in the midst of a tour with the legendary and dynamic saxophone player King Curtis.  In fact, you can hear King Curtis' handiwork throughout this performance.  And Oh Boy!!! Sam Cooke gives one of the most memorable vocal performances you will ever hear!  Although this performance was relatively short (just 38 minutes)you will marvel at his vocal prowess on tunes like "For Sentimental Reasons", "Bring It On Home To Me" and his 1962 hit "Nothing Can Change This Love".  For me the highlight of this disc is Sam's incredibly energetic rendition of "Twistin' The Night Away".  And he wraps it all up with an all-time favorite "Having A Party".  Listen for the remarkable interaction between artist and audience that is readily apparent throughout this disc.  That sort of intimacy has been lost in this era of arena and stadium concerts. "One Night Stand!: Sam Cooke Live at the Harlem Square Club" comes in a beautifully designed package that includes a generous 14 pages of liner notes by Peter Guralnick who is a noted authority on Sam Cooke.  In fact, Peter has recently written a biography of Sam entitled "Dream Boogie: The Biography of Sam Cooke."  The fact that the disc is a mere 38 minutes long is a bit of a drawback as fans lament the fact that so many of Sam's great hits were not included in the performance.  Very frustrating!  Also, I have noted that a few of the other reviewers are critical of the remastering job.  I must admit that I was not overly impressed with the remastering but since I do not own the earlier incarnation of this one I have nothing to compare it to.  In any event it appears that the 1990 version is no longer available.  Suffice to say you will certainly not be dissappointed with the music offered here.  It is a glimpse of a major talent who died all too soon under mysterious circumstances from a gunshot wound in 1964.   An essential disc.  Highly recommended! 
 I did not bought yet this cd (I will do), but I'm writing this to tell the responsable to release on dvd the extraordinary show that Ringo Starr made on television a few years ago on the Storytellers series.There is an excellent rendition of OCTOPUS GARDEN that is exclusif to this show. Don't wait....we are getting....older..and...older... 
 Terri Blackstock's BREAKER'S REEF is book four of the CAPE REFUGE series and another bestseller quality narrative. Each book in the series will stand on its own but reading each book in the series increases the intensity of each plot driven tale. I am always proud to recommend any Blackstock novel. This author is a master at weaving GOD and his unconditional love through out the twists and tunnels of her action packed mysteries. Blackstocks books are difficult to put down to do life's daily chores. Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge, Ruth Fever and Jena's Choic 
 More a work of history than biography, this excellent book brings a significant part of America's musical journey alive. The writing is so good we can almost see the mountain shacks, hear the holiness of the singing and taste the moonshine. Meet the Carter Family, you'll be glad you did 
   I loved this book as did the other two that I purchased it for.  This sounds so like a child.  Kids make these kind of dares all the time.  My two were intrested in this book after I told them about the earthworm cookies that were served during a survival class.  I had to promise never to serve worms to the children.  It is still tempting after reading this book 
 Mark Taylor and Steve Fidyk's new live disc is inspired and hard swinging.  The highlight of the cd is big band specialist Steve Fidyk's both mean driving and dynamic playing.  The band is certainly in league with the great bands of this era, and Steve kicks in a fashion reminiscent of Mel Lewis' command and Buddy's incendiery temperment.  The biggest surprise is Brush Taps; a hip and delicate expression of brush mastery.  If you dig the Clayton/Hamilton Orchestra, VO, or any of the great bands (Kenton, Basie, you get the idea), then you'll like this....ALOT.  Enjoy 
 I have not purchased Riturals and Celebrations, yet.  However, I plan to purchase it TODAY.  B.'s books are hot in bookstores and running low on the shelves.  I have no doubt that it is five star because she is a five star  lady. I am an aspiring fan of B. and truly enjoy her TV program.  It's all  that and more. She definately has STYLE and CLASS.  You go Ms. B.!                P.S. I WANT HER MAGAZINE and can't find it. Can someone help me out? P  L E A S E 
 We loved this DVD!  It is great for kids of ALL ages!  This DVD is a MUST HAVE for all who love Disney 
 In Greek legend, the minotaur is a bull-like monster who dwells in the midst of a vast labyrinth. In Ms. Rendell's novel, the title appears to be referring to John Cosway, an autistic man who lives with his mother and four sisters in a run-down, ramshackle estate.  As the story develops, however, it seems that this is an entire family of monsters, with the son being,in actuality, the most human of them all.  The mother and four sisters are almost completely selfish and self-motivated, often at the expense of their children or siblings, although one sister is perhaps a little better than the rest.  This is not my favorite work by Ruth Rendell writing as Barbara Vine but I think it is one of the most memorable.  Whether writing as Ms. Rendell or Ms. Vine, Ms. Rendell is such an expert at developing character, motivations, and interesting situations, that her books under either name are highly enjoyable and a true pleasure to read.    
 I love this protein.  compared to others it's the best tasteing, mixes well with milk and water (trust me use milk) and I've gotten better results than with any other brands  It has 23grams of Whey per serving  ( if I remeber correctly), and these are quality Whey Protein and amino acids. I've been lifting and taking protein for well over a year and have tried many brands but got hooked on this one pretty quick.  It's got a decent price compared to most other high end proteins. I like the Choc, never tried the other flavors 
 One of his first, and so glad to be able to get it!!! A delightful comedy! 
 This thorough and well researched book is immensely useful. It covers everything you need to know and consider in order to open up your own shop, right from the planning stages through to how to price items, hire staff, layout your store and products, effective sales techniques and most importantly how to attract customers.  The authors have garnered information not only from their own experiences but also from nearly a dozen other boutique owners. The insight they share is practical and informative.  The questionnaires, for example the one on considering potential neighborhoods, reminded me to consider many things I hadn't even thought of and the sample start up budget likewise ensured I took all things into account.  This book offers really good and sound advice for such a reasonable price 
 Marvin Gaye left this world far too soon, but we have his music that will live on forever. He cannot be touched by any blues, pop, or soul male artist, from yesterday or today. His voice burns on his masterpiece sexcapade Let's Get In On. The aching, timely lyrics of What's Goin' On, is as relevant when it was first released back in the early 1970's as it is today. Maybe even more so now, with the current world situation as it is. His duet with the  late Tammy Terrell on the gorgeous It Takes Two, is the best collaboration between two singers--ever. And what can you say about his Sexual Healing--the sexiest ballad by a male artist that will ever be heard. He was a one of a kind talent, and he broke all musical boundaries, crossing over into all cultures of music. He will be forever missed, but never forgotten 
 I recommend this book to new golfers all the time and have bought it for several people to get them started with the right fundamentals 
 Van Hensbergen's Guernica is a must-read masterpiece that covers art, history,passion and politics in equal measure.  From war time France, through Franco's Spain,and on through the trials of McCarthyism to Guernica's eventual repatriation the writer doesn't miss a beat.  I was stunned and excited by the new revelations about Picasso and extraordinary insights into the passions that underpin Picasso's astonishing and shocking work 
 This is another great book in the Sin City series.  Since much has already been said about this book I'll be brief.  This is another great work of Frank Miller.  His unique art and story-telling ability never seem to disappoint me.  There are many reasons why this is one of my favorites.  The main reason is because of Miho.   Every time she is on a page I am in a state of giddly bliss.  She is a both interesting and beautiful character.    Lastly, if anything, this book should be picked up just to admire how much heart, care, and authenticity was put into the motion picture by Rodriguez and Miller 
 I must admit this was my first Maugham novel, and that his style is not my forte. That being said, I could not set this book down. I dug an old copy out of a chest of books that belonged to my grandmother and was immediately enraptured with the narrator as well as the other characters. Unfortunately my memories have begun to fade as to all the beautifully crafted exploits. Fortunately, that just means I can anticipate reading this phenonemenal coming of age tale again, and again, and again 
 Roy Glenn has crafted an excellent tale of suspense and street drama interwoven with a love story. Will love conquer all or will the motto of the crew ( Money over Bi***es) be the law of the day ?  You must read MOB to find out.   If you read Mr. Glenn's previous novel , Is It A Crime, you can see his growth as a writer. I am anxiously awaiting his next release in April. 
 One thing i have to say, is that this movie is completely stupid.  Everything about it is just insane, and uncomprehendable, but you know what?  Thats why i LOVE IT.  I can always rely on this movie when i want to watch something that has a complete taste for stupidity.   But anyways, the movie revolves around a video clip from Pootie Tang's upcoming movie called Sign Your Pittie on the Runny Kine.  If you pay attention, you'll notice that his hit album was also called Sign Your Pittie on the Runny Kine.  lol But the story is of Pootie Tang and his belt and i suppose you already know the rest. Wa da Tah!  I find this movie highly entertaining, thanks to the uncomprehendable Pootie talk, the belt whippings, and the rediculous plot.  So if you're in the mood for a braindead Laugh-Fest, pick up a copy of POOTIE TANG!!! 
 This book is full packed with information. It is a great 1st book for anyone serious about the restaurant/ bar industry. It has lots of useful tips, and is broken up into logical chapters for easy reference. 
 This book was very enlightening without being too like a catechism, giving all the answers.  Spong makes no pretense that he has all the answers; many of his conclusions are unpretentiously hypothetical.  One should read the entire book with an open mind before judging it.  The subject matter is certainly challenging, not to mention his verbose style, but it is refreshing to read the opinions and conclusions of a true intellectual, an all too uncommon thing in this day and age 
 This review is being restored after it was deleted by someone at Amazon several months ago- at that time, it had more "helpful" votes than either of the two "Spotlight Reviews." As stated by Amazon on the "Unfit for Command" page, (particularly) during an election year, it is inappropriate for them to engage in book-review burning.  Attempts to suppress free speech are particularly misguided in the Internet age; (literally) at Amazon's expense, I simply used my considerable presence on the 'net to publish a longer essay that ultimately was read by far more people than will ever read this.  That online essay may be read by clicking on my name, then "see more," which gives the link. It also has links to additional information (indicated by the ^'s in the text below)... AND it's more fun 'cause it doesn't suffer from Amazon's restriction of making fun of imbeciles by name!  Frankly, I wrote my "Telling the Truth" review after a long day of computer programming, and 2 or 3 beers, and I was having a bit of self-indulgent fun by being exaggeratedly arrogant- hopefully at the expense of "reviewers" who obviously never read the book (usually, their non-reviews merely comment on the book's title, then launch into an anti-administration diatribe about subjects that Dr. Cheney's book doesn't address).  Paul Simon once wrote a cute song, 50 Ways to Leave Your Lover:   She said, "It grieves me so to see you in such pain- I wish there were something I could do, to make you smile again!" I said, "I appreciate that,  and would you please explain about the fifty ways?"  She said, "Why don't we both just sleep on it tonight? And I believe in the morning, you'll begin to see the light..." And then she kissed me, and I realized she probably was right- There must be fifty ways to leave your lover! Fifty ways to leave your lover!  And it seems there must be at least fifty ways to be a liar.  Without further ado:  Well let's see, my cousin Mike is also Lynne's cousin Mike, which is neither here nor there. Mike used to work at Bethesda Naval Hospital, where he did surgery on Reagan, Bush #1, etc., and I was the first person from SC^ to make the top 10 in the Science Talent Search^ (I had as many 800s on my college boards as I'm ranking this book). Bad genes SOMEWHERE... or so my fellow alum Leroy Hood^ would say.   Caltech- U.S. News & World Reports decided to Tell the Truth for once, a few years back, and rank it #1^- used to have the motto "The Truth Shall Make You Free", but that had religious connotations, so they got rid of it.  But back in 1986, a Caltech professor warned- in a Challenger Commission appendix that was granted as a concession to him by the lawyer that headed it (in order to prevent Dr. Feynman's resignation from the commission)- that "In any successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled."  It's because the failure of engineers and scientists to deal adequately with reality (i.e., "the truth") often produces such spectacular and undeniable results (e.g., Columbia, February 2003) that someone having such a background cannot afford the same level of flippancy in this regard (e.g., "I did not have sex with that woman" ... or- at the very least- "It depends upon what your definition of 'is' is." ... an actual Bill Clinton quote! ;-) as those whose careers depend upon their ability to:  1) absorb some tiny grain of truth,   2) relieve the ensuing irritation by embellishing this particulate with layer upon layer of diseased nacre, then   3) gild the resulting twisted-lump-of-garbage with the thinnest coat of dark and malignant grease,   4) so that when they finally regurgitate it, it can readily be swallowed by those they wish to deceive, who otherwise would recognize it as unfit for consumption.  My father- who spent most of his career as an honest cop- referred to a subset of such persons as "lieyers."  And as one who has been a genuine victim of the kind of "diseased minds" alluded to in a previous^ review (can you Google, "when he lies, he speaks in his native tongue, for he is a liar, and the father of all lies"?), I particularly identify with Dr. Feynman's sentiment, which is generalized in Dr. Cheney's book.  Some say the dEvil be a mystical thing... I say the dEvil be a walking person! S/he a fool, a liar, conjurer and a thief! Try to tell you what you want-  try to tell you what you need!  All you folks think you run my life! Say I should be willing to compromise... I say all you demons go back to Hell! I'll save my Soul, I'll save myself!  -Tracy Chapman  The criticism that I would make is that Dr. Cheney does not acknowledge the significantly positive aspects of the 1960s; notably, the opposition to the war in Vietnam that would not have been possible had the United States been anything like the Soviet Union, and generally alluded to by Timbuk3's Big Shot in the Dark: "you used to believe in the power of music, and all that revolutionary stuff... now you're just a big shot in the dark... well, you got it right the first time."  In other words- as echoes the essential message of her book- in a solar system whose sun^ will eventually burn out- or else be swallowed by a supermassive black hole, when in 3.5 billion years the Andromeda galaxy collides^ with the Milky Way- and in a universe^ that will expand forever into a freezing nothingness, philosophy is all that matters.  Unfortunately Dr. Cheney's book is only a book; it's not a magic wand you can hit people over the head with, and instantly raise their IQs by 100 points.  If that were the case, then in a few years, there could be far fewer liars in the world, and all universities (with the exception of any associated lie school) could have an Honor System^ like that of Caltech, where virtually all exams are "take-home" exams, and- despite the intense academic pressure- one can feel confident that any limits on time, and access to reference materials, specified for the exam will be observed by 99+% of one's classmates...  though unfortunately, the correlation between intelligence and lying & cheating is far from absolute (Teddy Kennedy nearly got booted from Harvard after being caught in a cheating scandal, but he got into Harvard thanks to his family's political and financial pull, rather than his brains).  Some wits recommend "The Bride of Frankenstein" in addition to, or instead of, "Telling the Truth."  I recommend:  "400 Hours of Counseling with Bill & Hillary's Shrink" in addition to "Telling The Truth" or "Voting for John Kerry" instead of "Telling The Truth"  Here are a couple more tunes- in celebration of the re-election of Bush/Cheney (yeah... 4 more years ;-) that may help explain Dr. Cheney's book to a few left-brain challenged Kerry Kids, and Soviet Union nostalgists living in western Europe. (Just as a little right-brain IQ test, see if you can identify the references.)   I have legalized robbery- and called it a belief... I have run with the money, and hid like a thief! I have re-written history, with my armies and my crooks... Invented memories- and I burned all the books.  And I can still hear his laughter; and I can still hear his song... The man's too big, the man's too strong!  ---  Just as every cop is a criminal, and all the sinners are Saints... As I end this tale, just call me Lucifer, for I'm in need of some restraint! So if you meet me have some courtesy, have some sympathy, and some taste. Use all your well-learned politesse, or I'll lay your soul to waste!  Now if all y'all Barbra Streisand-type folks would just hold your breath & wait for President Bush to take away my Mama's Social Security check, reinstate the draft, etc., like John Kerry (the lawyer) told you over-and-over Bush is gonna do... (I have the INSIDE SCOOP; it won't be long now- I PROMISE! ;-) 
 NASCAR champion Sam Hooker's race day spotter is his girlfriend, Alexandra "Barney" Barnaby. A spotter is usually a guy who stands on top of the grandstand with binoculars and a wireless connection to a driver's headgear to keep him out of trouble on the track. In this case, Barney is a girl and she was Hooker's girlfriend until things went south in the romance department after Hooker strayed off course with a waitress. Without his spotter around to keep him in the relationship center lane, he's paying the penalty. Barney still keeps him on track while the race is on, though it's nothing but a cold shoulder when the engines cool.  Barney and Hooker have bigger problems to solve in the second installment of Janet Evanovich's new series (following METRO GIRL). During a major race at the Homestead-Miami Speedway, a racer spins out of control and crashes. Another is so far in the lead that Barney figures something is fishy, and she mentions this to a fellow spotter, Goggle. After the race is over, Goggle goes missing. Barney gets a frantic cell phone call from him from inside the 18-wheeler race car transport carrying the winning cars. He whispers that he stumbled onto a dangerous secret worth a billion dollars and hid inside the transport when someone nearly caught him snooping. Now the transport is headed for Mexico with him crunched between two race cars and no way to escape.  Barney and Hooker tail the transport, hijack it at a truck stop and break in to free Goggle. They find more than they bargained for when a shrink-wrapped body rolls out of a closet. A mad chase ensues that involves body snatching, kidnapping, dognapping, grand theft auto, breaking and entering, multiple murders and a few other potentially life-term felonies. And the evidence keeps pointing straight at our heroes.  At stake is a high-tech miniaturized communications chip developed by race car magnates Ray and Oscar Huevo. The device gives an illegal edge to any driver who uses it, but Barney and Hooker soon discover that NASCAR isn't the only industry that can benefit from the Huevo Corporation invention. When multinational arms dealers turn up looking to deal, the game gets serious and they find themselves in way over their heads.  Evanovich has created all-new characters in new places for her vast numbers of Stephanie Plum fans. In Miami Beach it's wash-and-wear beach hair, bare midriffs and flip flops instead Jersey big hair, spandex and sneakers. Rock star race car drivers and cigar-rolling Cuban ladies with AK47s complicate our heroine's life instead of sexy cops and pistol-packing grannies, and the bad guys sail yachts and drive Beemers. Bail bond skipping is way below their radar. Of course there's a dog --- what would an Evanovich novel be without a big, doofy, slurpy dog?  Evanovich is a masterful storyteller and should score big with MOTOR MOUTH. She harkens back to the romance genre, which should please fans from her old days, and the colorful and action-packed descriptions of NASCAR racing should make the fans in the stands send her a big wave of appreciation at the bookstores.     --- Reviewed by Roz She 
 At last, a book that looks at black men and feminism from a wide variety of perspectives. Carbado has assembled one of the most provocative and intelligent collections on race theory, particularly where issues of gender  and sexual orientation are involved. A must read for everyone who thinks  they've seen it all before. Highly recommended 
 This is a great (and relatively cheap) way to expand your Brio starter set.  A nice selection of straights, curves, and a few switch tracks that really add to the interaction / fun.    While Brio in general is expensive, this track pack represents a pretty good value (v. buying switches, curves, straights, etc on their own.... although you'll "need" to do that eventually too!).  The finish, fit, and quality is great.  Worth the money considering the play it'll get & it's durability 
 This book is truly inspiring.  It is honest and forthright about the problems of black women the world over.  It should be a recommended text for women's studies and certainly for young women today who have never experienced the pain of abuse. I found the experience of reading this book very inspiring, at times painful but always hopeful 
 I was expecting an exhaustive encyclopedia of baseball trivia. This book is not that!  Instead, it's a meandering, enjoyable chat with a knowledgeable friend about baseball on a summer afternoon on the porch. Vince Staten frames his entire book around a big league game he attended with his grown son, but somehow every facet of that experience leads off on a tangent to a fascinating exploration of baseball stadium and game trivia from the ticket buying experience (which leads to essays on ticket printing and turnstiles), to telling his son about the time a shortstop lost a ball because it bounced off a pebble (which leads to an in-depth interview of a groundskeeper), to a certain snugness in the stadium seat (which leads to a well researched essay on studies through the decades of the width of the typical American backside).  These essays have certainly made my baseball game experiences more enjoyable and given me a store of trivia to trot out at parties 
 This is one of my all time favorites in the acton adventure category.  It really is a must see about submarines.  It is just really a stimulating movie.  It is so much better than a bond movie and I love bond 
 This book made me laugh and cry.  It's simple story of a man hitting bottom, reaching out for help, and struggling to accept that help was a joy to read.  The insights and spiritual tools helped me to realize/remember  that it is not the specifics of religious or spiritual dogma but the  practice of a spiritual quest that brings grace 
 I really enjoyed this wonderful book about a wonderfully delightful artist. I would recommend reading it if you are a Cezanne admirer, absolutely a wonderful book 
 I really like this camera! It is fairly simple to use, takes great pictures and is packed with features. It fits nicely in the hand and is compact enough to slip in a coat pocket or purse.  We bought this camera for our daughter's birthday. She is using it with ease & especially loves the movie with sound option. In my opinion, the camera is a winner for any adult or kid wanting a good all around digital camera.  My only negative is that it is a battery hog. As with most digital cameras, you will want to make sure you get rechargeable batteries and large memory card 
 I found this book to be invaluable as a comprehensive source of information about telecommunications networks and related subjects. Unlike many other texts, this book does not assume that the reader is a consultant in the industry or has a strong engineering background. Even the choice of each chapter subject is carefully thought out so as to save the time and effort required of the businessperson who needs focused knowledge quickly. Pecar and Garbin do a great service by providing an outline, or basis for research of the expansive technologies and practical and historical approaches to the challenge of telecommunications. This book will see a lot of use in my office.. if I can keep it there.. It usually ends up in somebody elses! 
 Agreeing with the previous review, I would add that Simon's perceptions, reactions, and actions are realistic for an 8 to 10 year old boy. Also admirable are the low-key presentation of Simon's determination and persistence--just as in the best folk tales he does what he has to do without any self-consciousness of heroism. The illustrations are very expressive but the perspective is a bit shallow--but this won't bother children 
 This book was required reading as part of a Master's course on Personal Financial Planning. The book is an excellent beginners guide to financial planning. The format of the book can either be pleasing and interesting or wordy and rather boring, depending on the background of the reader.      Unlike many financial planning books, this book has a plot. The plot revolves around 3 people, the main character (Dave, a teacher), his self-employed, wealthy sister (Cathy, Landscape Business owner), and their friend (Tom, a plant worker). Dave goes looking for financial advice and after asking his father, he is pointed to Roy, the town barber. The 4 of them have monthly meetings as they get their hair cut, where Roy teaches them a tidbit on financial planning at each meeting. The topics covered include The Ten Percent Solution (fun money for retirement), Wills and Life Insurance, Planning for Retirement, Real Estate Investment, Saving, and Taxes.  The book is somewhat like giving an appetizer to a person who has not eaten in a week, it helps, but it is not enough. The book does cover many excellent points, such as compound interest, one of the most important concepts in saving. The idea of a Ten Percent Fund is outstanding and is something I would not have thought of. The book then does an admirable job explaining why a person should have a will. The book begins to trail off with the life insurance section. This is the first point in the book where the reader should be calculating numbers. However, there are no worksheets, poor and insufficient examples, several suggestions, and no equations to make your own calculations; in short, if I was not aware of how to calculate how much life insurance to get, I think I would have still been clueless after this chapter. The planning for retirement section does an admirable job explaining various retirement savings vehicles, but there is little or no mention on figuring out how much a person should save. Once again, there are no worksheets or equations to walk a person though calculating or estimating how much they should be saving for retirement. The chapters on real estate and taxes were informative and were definitely worth reading. The chapter on saving was ho hum; it covered some points, but was mostly common sense.  I think the book could have benefited from a chapter dedicated to changing your investment types as the date of a goal approaches, such as retirement. The information on asset allocation is spread throughout the entire book. I also think the book could also greatly benefit from some detailed examples, especially on the life insurance sections and retirement sections.  The book starts out making it sound like life could be good if a person could save 10% and invest is wisely. By the end of the book, the ten percent fund is separate from retirement savings and saving for your children's education. Though no numbers are used after introducing the ten percent fund, I estimate a person needs to save and invest 20% of their income to save for play money, retirement, and children's college education. I think most people would have difficulties saving that much.   The book is an excellent beginning point in the world of financial planning. I feel the book discusses the items most people would be interested in; however, I think the book could benefit from more detail. The plot makes the reading interesting, but slow and inconvenient to locate information in past chapters. I think the book is definitely worth reading for people who are inexperienced in planning their finances for the future, especially young people just getting out into the world. The earlier saving starts, the less painful it is.  
 As a young White boy growing up on the Navajo reservation was very wonderful, this movie brought back many wonderful memories.  The Navajo friends I had, all rode mustangs so therefore our weekends were spent riding through the bueatiful high deserts of Northern Arizona.  This movie is a great movie, it has all the emotions a person may feel in the 1880's.  Some what, as I felt when we moved to Northern Arizona in 1960.  The people were wonderful to grow up with.  This movie is a great movie, the only problem I had with the DVD is that to see the Bonus Features you have to have a special computer.  I would have been happy to spend the extra money on the movie, if they could have just put it on the DVD.  I would very much like to see the extra parts that have been left out, unless you have a computer that will read these extra parts.  Other wise I would have given this movie a 5 star rating 
 This is a really great CD for those who appreciate the old timey country-western.............it is primarily swing and toe-tappin!  If you enjoy Hank Williams, you will love this CD.  I highly recommend it!  I am very pleased with the CD....the fast service and the continued excellence of Amazon.................... 
 I love this thing!  I couldn't imagine life without it.  I originally bought it over a year ago, because I was pregnant and already having children with allergies wanted to do what ever I could to eliminate these issues.  First, let me say.....I wondered if it was working at all.  The blue light was on, but no sound at all.  After a week it started "hissing", thus telling me to clean it.  I could not believe the stuff this thing sucked out of the air.  I was totally embarassed!  I never want to go without it again.  There is one complaint that I have, the little blue light.  It is so bright it actually lights up the living room, so if you need total darkness to sleep don't use this in the bedroom.  I would definately recommend this to anyone, and have recommended it to my mother 
 Very Cool!  The book is a great collection of science experiments for kids, written in a witty and imaginative manner.  "Mad Professor", like all of Frauenfelder's work, is worth purchasing for the exquisite graphic design alone 
 Drawing on sources like Paul Tillich, May writes ably about the psychology of creativity--but not in hugs-and-rainbows fashion, for as Stephen Diamond  has emphasized in his own writings, creativity always carries what I think  of as a dangerous edge to it, the breath of the daimonic.  Read this book  to see why creativity is so central to the human experience.  (Dunno if I'm  allowed to do this in a review, but (see below) what's the deal with  letting people post reviews in which they admit they haven't even read the  book?  
 The three tracks I came to know via heavy radio airplay in the early-90s were "Dreamlover," "Hero," and "Music Box," but it wasn't until now that I finally got my hands on this gem of a CD, and I'm sorry it's taken me so much time to catch up on some great pop music.  I still can't get enough of the rhythm of "Dreamlover," and "Anytime You Need A Friend" is right up there with Dionne Warwick's (et al) "That's What Friends Are For."  The title track itself is a very pretty ballad.  This is Mariah Carey at the top of her game.  She would do it one more time with "DayDream," but then sink into doing more covers and duets as the 90s went on (and I'll never figure out why because she sure didn't need help in the singing department!).  The CD is 42 minutes exactly, and it's time well spent.  - Donna Di Giacom 
 I first found this rare CD in the UK years ago with its original artwork and all. But when I saw that it was being released again with a bonus disc of dubs, I just had to purchase it again. The dubs are not the dub versions of Humanity but a totally different set that I wish I will one day find the vocal set. Prince Lincoln possessed one of the smoothest and most delecate falsesetto in the history of reggae. His music is very hard to find but I truly hope that this label re-release his whole catalog. This disc demonstrates Crisp musicianship, well crafted roots songs sung with deep conviction which makes it a must for any roots fan. Buy this disc, you won't be disappointed 
 I just wish he had written these prequels before the Left Behind series.  Having the background of the characters is great. This book is as well written as the others 
 To begin, let me say that COB is my favorite recent metal band, and in my opinion, probably THE BEST metal band on the face of the planet.  Second, I cannot even properly verbalize the amount of respect and appreciation I have for this band.  The music is incredible.  For a bunch of guys in their mid-20s, they know exactly what they are doing, and they do it better than most of the more recent Scandinavian Black Metal Bands, and metal bands in general.  The only reason I am giving this CD 4 stars is because it only contains two new original songs, and the other two are covers.  The Alice Cooper cover is pretty cool, but I don't care for Andrew WK or any of his songs (they all sound the same to me), and it is rather humorous hearing Alexi Laiho saying "She is Beautiful" when I am use to hearing angry and depressed lyrics on Bodom albums.  But Alexi does put an interesting twist on both of these songs.  In addition, the riffs, melodies and solos on the two new songs, "Trash, Lost and Strungout," and "Knuckleduster" are amazing.  I like the way Alexi and company always start a song nice and heavy with classic metal riffing, then they get very melodic as the song progresses.  Alexi's lead work is a marvel in itself.  Full of pentatonic minor scales (I can hear the Zakk Wylde influence there), melodic minor scales and sweep arpeggios (Yngwie all the way there).  Just awesome guitar work all the way around with Alexi, awesome drum work from Jaska, and great keyboard melodies by Janne.  This short EP has definitely got me anticipating their next full-length LP 
 If you have never read one of the #1 Ladies Detective Agency books, I highly encourage you to read them in order before you get to this one.  They are all outstanding, and introduce a variety of interesting characters who are all well known by the time this book starts.    This book starts with a new character, Aunty Emang, the African version of Dear Abby.  Precious Ramotswe takes an instant dislike to Aunty Emang due to the curt advice she dishes out.  A variety of interesting side stories develop, but you know Aunty Emang will come back before the end of the book.  And it is a humdinger of a conclusion.  Enjoy it with a cup of bush tea.  I don't know why Mr McCall-Smith cannot bring the same charm he draws out of Africa to his other series... but anyway, you gotta cherish the #1 Ladies Detective Agency and hopefully we will get many more books in the series 
 As I write this, the early polls in New Hampshire show that state's Republicans (and Independents) at abou 28% for McCain and 27% for Giuliani--which probably is more indicative of a certain falloff of McCain's support than a surge for New York's lamest mayor.  I'm really hoping that the coming paperback edition of Grand Illusion will spread the real story of Giuliani, "America's Mayor" over the pastel stains of a fawning TV media horde.  And then, perhaps some other pair of journalists--if they're as good as Barrett and Collins--can give us a bit of reality check relating to McCain, as well.  Giuliani was not a good mayor--not even close--if being "good" in an enormously complex and diverse city means holding it together, not taking sides, and uniting rather than dividing.  No one could challenge LaGuardia as the best mayor, and a fair accounting--and Grand Illusion IS a fair accounting--of Giuliani as leader will show that any further government service on his part would be an unmitigated disaster.  Why can't we judge our "presidentiables" in terms of their real world achievements or lack of them, rather than be besotted by media hype. Thanks to Barrett and Collins for fairly evaluating rather than adding the incense, and here's hoping that the paperback brings home reality to more uncertain Americans.  Good book, fair and balanced. 
 I like soft ice in my drinks. Yes it is noisy and messy but it gives me the ice I want in less than a couple of minutes and beats the heck out of buying sonic ice. It reminds me of snow cone ice 
 My experience with other phrase books has been less than stellar, so I was unsure about the Berlitz version but a friend loaned it to me, saying it worked quite well, so I figured why not give it a try. To my delight, I found it very useful -- and relevant, too! For its size, it wastes no space on frivolous or obscure phrases. And the dictionary came in handy more than once. I highly recommend this (unlike the Italian one I had by another publisher. It was so bad I tossed it about halfway through my trip.) I haven't seen any better 
 In deed it's a "good" second records, but seems to me that the flame of Funeral has vanished, and I'm not the only one sain' this, the only great songs on this one are No Cars go, wich came on the EP, Black mirror and I can't recall the others, but it's 5 out of 11 
 Given a choice, food columnist Faith Geary would rather be undergoing a root canal than be back home in Lindbrook, Minnesota. You see, ten years ago, Faith did a stupid thing. When her first and only true love proposed, Faith panicked and fled for California with another guy -- who actually ended up dumping her, but that's beside the point. Now, thanks to her sister Skye's convoluted love life and failing business (a bar in which Faith has invested all of her life's savings, thank you very much), big sister Faith is back in Lindbrook to fix the mess. Unfortunately, there's one little glitch in Faith's master plan. It seems Skye has a partner at the bar and his name is Patrick Flynn. The same Patrick Flynn Faith had unceremoniously dumped a decade ago. Welcome back, Faith.  It's immediately apparent that Flynn has not forgotten nor forgiven Faith for their break-up. But, interestingly enough, it's also obvious that he can't stay away from her, which is a good thing since they have to work together to save the bar and keep Skye out of trouble. Soon the sizzle is back and its time for Faith to stop running and face their past. Can she go home again?  Beth Kendrick's debut is a realistic look at the trials and tribulations of a modern day heroine, flaws and all. An intriguing blend of guilt complexes and wry humor, Faith is a career girl who once screwed over her prince charming, but is now determined to make things right and try for another shot at a happily ever after. While not as vividly brought to life as Faith, Flynn comes across as a wary man still hurting from his first love's rejection but not closed off to the idea of a reunion. The secondary characters are a riot and are lovingly detailed, including the irrepressibly flighty Skye, her laconic would-be swain Lars, Faith's former high school rival, Sally, and the various personalities in this quirky town. Charming and laugh out loud funny, MY FAVORITE MISTAKE will have you wishing to go home again too.  TheScheme 
 Looks like the 3rd edition will be released very soon.  Probably worth waiting for, since the 2nd edition was released 17 years ago, and the state of the art in electronics is a moving target 
 Soft Dangerous Shores would be the last album that Chris Whitley would release during his brief lifetime. A true visionary, Chris challenged himself musically throughout his career, releasing albums that experimented in rock, grunge, jazz, folk, electronica, and especially the blues. Like his 2001 release, Rocket House, Soft Dangerous Shores mixes Whitley's stellar guitar work with elements of electronica. However, while Rocket House would dabble with various genres throughout the disc, Soft Dangerous Shores is more of a mood piece. The haunting keyboards and electronic drums are designed to provide a backdrop rather than be an equal part of the songs. Listening to this now, you can hear that Chris was suffering as his voice had lost most of its range. However, his voice still retained its soul and that's very apparent on Soft Dangerous Shores. Tracks like "Fireroad (For Two)", "City of Women", and especially the title track show Chris at his most sensual and the mood for each track fits perfectly. "As Day Is Long" and "Last Million Miles" return to the passionate fury of his previous work in both the guitar work and arrangements while "Medicine Wheel" gives the vision of how most of us go through the motions throughout our lives, just hoping to move a little further ahead. Well, that's what I get out of it. The version of "Her Furious Angels" recalls the track originally recorded on War Crime Blues, only with sparse guitar work and the drums and keyboards providing color. In retrospect, the last two tracks "End Game Holiday" and "Breath of Shadows" as well as the unlisted brief reprise of "End Game Holiday" at the album's closing sound as though Chris was saying goodbye. Hearing Chris sing 'too late to find a way' during "End Game Holiday" can't help but bring strong emotions after learning what he was going through. All told, Soft Dangerous Shores is a piece to be listened as a whole on several occasions to be appreciated. New fans may want to pick up Living With the Law, Dirt Floor, and Din of Ecstasy before diving into this. 
 I read the review from the reviewer who had "figured out who did it" halfway through the book.  Yes, I suspected who did it also.  But, there was still the element of surprise as to how everything would turn out, etc.  It seemed like a hopeless situation when I realized the perpetrator.  I listened to the audio version of this book.  I usually only listen to audio books as I walk.  However, when I got to the point of finding our who the hit and run driver was, I couldn't stop listening.  I listened to the last two cassettes non-stop all morning long.  If I had been reading it, it would have been a true page turner until I reached the end.  I recommend this story highly.  It is different than The Notebook and The Wedding, and I applaud Nicholas Sparks as a writer 
 While the premise of ghosts as major characters took a little bit to adjust to, I found that Williams developed supernatural characters and a supernatural world that seemed as solid and "real" as the natural world.  It is a wonderful novel that explores so many deep concepts - heaven and hell, the reality of the supernatural, the nature of evil and its limitations, body and soul,...  In fact, the main difficulty with the novel is the fact that it explores so many deep questions, and dwells so much on the inner thoughts of the characters.  These aspects make the novel a difficult (yet rewarding) read.  I found that I needed several hours of completely uninterrupted time to really get into the novel.  Then, I couldn't put it down 
 Absolutely astonishing. Whether you are a collector of classical movie or not, this move is a must to see and have  
 the jont song, along with a few others from the movie are being sold on a disc that comes with the movie.  i found it at walmart and sam's.  they also have an edition of the movie that comes without the cd.  it has songs by the sounds, sum41, gavin degraw, robbers on high street, jont, damone , and michael tolcher.  it's a good cd so if you haven't bought the wedding crashers you should get this version 
 Even though this is about 4 years old, it is extremely halarious.  I've been waiting to see a good stand up comedy. The first 15 min is just one hilarious hit after another. I love this guy 
 ...but a decent sequel. (But hey? It's not often that the sequel is better than the prequel.) I was mad because alot of questions were not answered and the plot was not all that good. I wanted Craig (Ice Cube) to hook up with that girl next door. All she does is have a short convo with her and at the end she blows a kiss and thats the end. I believe thats pointless for Craig's Pops (Jon Witherspoon)drops him off in Rancho Cucamonga (I don't think I spelled it right) then turns around and picks him up. Its a funny movie, but not as good as the first though 
 It's not really easy to produce a positive, almost utopic bunch of songs of joy and love without sounding boring and repetitive. But much more difficult than that is to make such a record that doesn't make ME fall asleep. What must be done to avoid this is to put a visionary genious behind the pen, the michophone and most of the instruments, and the magic occurs: a beautiful, solid, legendary record appears. The genius behind this is Stevie Wonder, probably the best singer, the best songwriter and one of the best drum, harmonica and bass players of soul (and pop music in general). Stevie's compositions reflect his accurate instinct to produce beautiful, surprising melodies; his centered lyrics reflect and irradiate his joy of living and his emotional use of his powerfull voice completes the scenario of a true masterpiece. On `'Talking Book'', besides some lovely piano-driven ballads, Wonder produces a sound that at the same time encompasses typical 70's soul arrangement pattern and takes many steps ahead, thanks to his ability to create innovative melodies and make a different, new trends-defining usage of elemnts from current soul tendencies. Highest points are funky `'Superstition'', `'I believe (When I Fall In Love It Will Be Forever)'', `'Blame It On The Sun'' and clever easy-listening hit `'You Are The Sunshine Of My Life''. Genre and decade-defining, this is a true masterpiece and a musical gem for lovers of all kinds of music 
 Thank you a thousand times, Ms. Walker, for the gift of your new poems.  They literally danced off the pages and into my soul as I read them.  I enjoyed the preface and especially being introduced to the shaman/priestess/healer, Maria Sabina.  My favorite poem is "Thanks for the Garlic".  You are a beautiful, amazing Apprentice Elder and someone I definitely will emulate in my own journey to become..... 
 Mary-Kate has a star-role in a play. (Bye, Bye Birdie) Ashley is proud of her sister. But not when she finds out that she has to kiss Ashley's big time crush Ross Lambert. Every time Ross and Mary-Kate have to rehearse the kissing part Ashley tries to stop it! Mary-Kate isn't going to kiss Ross. Not if Ashley can help it! 
 Unlike the first book produced on Nisargadatta, "I AM THAT" which was stripped bare of all religious trappings, the discussions recorded in "The Ultimate Medicine" between Nisargadatta and his visitors have many more references to Hindu terminology and concepts. I would therefore recommend that anyone new to Nisragadatta's teachings begin with "I AM THAT".   Something I found very interesting in this book were the discussions that centered around one understanding one's birth, which is not really discussed in "I AM THAT". Nisargadatta says several times that alöl will be clear when one can, underrstand, experientially, (through meditation), how this consciousness came about, how birth came about.  The book was written shortly before Nisargadatta died from cancer, and he was suffering from the illness at during these recordings. His comments concerning this illness are also something to ponder over.  This is really a unique and important book, and anyone who seeks enlightenment through *knowledge* should look at this and Nisargadatta's other books. You won't find these ideas more clearly expressed anywhere else.   Nisargadatta was a unique teacher, and we're fortunate indeed to have his teachings available in book form like this 
 I finally got to see this film after many years of reading about it (and the other Coffin Joe films). Loved it! The black and white photography captures many great moments of surrealistic horror. Some shots would be suitable for framing. Brazilian bogey-man Coffin Joe makes a wonderfully existential villain, provoking would-be gods every chance he gets. Bless his little atheistic heart! The scenes of cruelty are not always the most realistic, but are hard to watch anyway. As an added bonus, this also contains one of the most horrific eye-gouging scenes ever (shades of Bunuel, as the box claims - indeed!).  The DVD is nicely packaged, including a small, nifty reproduction of a Coffin Joe comic book. There are trailers for other Coffin Joe films, and an interesting - if not overlong - recent interview with director/star Marins himself, discussing details of the film. The soundtrack could have used some cleaning up - there's some hiss and crackle, but at least the film is strong enough that this wasn't too distracting. The widescreen video transfer is really nice. Add this to your collection now!! 
 Admittedly I've few favorite writers who're women. Sue Hubble is an exception. I'm facinated by the person she emotes through her writing. This is not just a book of bees. It is instead a narrative of life in tune with the natural world. Sue Hubble is accurate in her observations and true in her depictions. And, I am a beekeeper 
 I am very picky with movies, especially thrillers and recently I have had a hard time finding a decent thriller. Once I heard about this movie and had a chance to view it I immediatly fell in love with it. This is very smart and fast-paced thriller that entertains the hell out of a viewer. Highly recommended 
 James Loriega is a master at the arts of fighting with a steel blade. His translation from the original Spanish of the Manual Of The Baratero Or The Art Of Handling The Navaja, The Knife, And The Scissors Of The Gypsies is an instruction book for the non-specialist general reader in the basic techniques of fighting with knives which was originally published in Madrid, Spain, in 1849. There are occasional woodblock illustrations but they are decorative, not instructional. It is the text itself that provides an informed and informative "how to" manual for defending against attackers or robbers with a blade in your hand. A long recognized and appreciated contribution to Spain's historic martial arts culture, Manual Of The Baratero has never before been available to English readers. Here is an invaluable and enduringly impressive addition to personal and professional reference collections for historians, edged-weapons enthusiasts, and students of diverse martial arts legacies from around the world. 
 This movie is completely sick , a total gross out no holds barred film about heroin addiction, the way it should be. Heroin is not chic nor glamorous as is neither drug addiction, but the movie is sharp, fast and funny.  The cast is great and the SOundtrack as well. Drugstore Cowboy with techno 
  This is an I-didn't-know-how-much-I-needed-it-until-I-bought-it review. For heaven knows how long I've been distributing conditioner throughout my hair with my fingers, massaging it in, thinking I was doing a thorough job. Not so! After using this Fekkai Detangling Comb the difference was amazing. Obviously, the mere use of fingers had not been able to release the conditioner as it should have been.   The comb is handcrafted in France with wide teeth, smoothly rounded to protect hair. It's a beauty on its own, as you can see. It allows easy distribution of the product whether it's a conditioner or a treatment mask. It's a breeze to use in the shower and also ideal for comb-outs.   Frederic recommends applying a conditioning treatment 1-2 times a week to maintain healthy hair. To date, I've been very well pleased with all of Frederic's products and his advice. This is a man who knows hair and how to care for it.   - Gail Cook 
 Whether or not one truly "believes" in what Allison writes in her book, the hope she brings to the reader is valuable.  One can probably relate to some of the things she mentions that involve spirits of deceased loved ones.  I have experienced similar incidents, although nothing even close to "bringing someone through."  The book is one that is hard to put down - a quick read.    
 As a first in this kind of academic attempt, this book is very successfull. The articles especially took my attention are ones from Elisabeth Ozdalga, Ahmet T. Kuru, and Zeki Saritoprak. Elisabeth Ozdalga's research subject is an interesting one which should be expanded in the future. Ahmet T. Kuru's article is compact and very well organized. I liked the conclusion part clever. 4 points explained in detail needs further detailing -which might be a subject for a whole new book 
 Dr. Gunn Allen opens our eyes to the roots of modern American culture that are too often obscured, whether intentionally or not. A reader who approaches this work "in good faith" will be regaled with the astonishingly open, clear, and unique viewpoint she cultivates and communicates.  She chooses to stand between two cultures and knowledgeably observe them interpenetrate--rather than take the customary political or religious stances of taking one "side" or another. Only a woman with a solid grounding in both cultures (and a tremendous ability to write beautifully), as Dr. Allen has, can accomplish in her work what she is also showing her readers historically.  A discerning reader who is willing to admit--and agree to suspend--culturally-programmed judgment can come away from this book with a much richer, smarter, more beautiful and especially more genuinely compassionate sense of REAL purpose this country's citizens might choose to see in their ancestors' having come here, as well as in the direction they would really like this country to take NOW.  In addition, I find that it is an honor (still and despite the rude and terrible behavior the English showed towards the interesting and knowledgeable people already living here) to be so respectfully invited into sharing indigenous views of this world, this land, and the Western Europeans who came here. On top of all of this, the book is a truly great read for most anyone who has an intellect that enjoys exercise, and a love of exploring and rediscovering the past in new ways.  
 This is the easiest to read out of all the several books on Crowley's Thoth Tarot because of its small size at a fitting 66 pages. I found this at Barnes & Noble in a mall, so it isn't that hard to find, nor are a lot of Crowley's books. This is short interpretations on each card of the Thoth Tarot with some tables thrown in for good measure. A lot of others I've seen when reading Crowley seem to think this is hard to read. While I admit I struggled with Crowley early on I understood it all. I started with novels Moonchild and Diary of a Drug Fiend. Once you get use to his poetic cadence and manner of speech, this is not very difficult to read. If you can understand Shakspear(?- spelling) you should be able to understand Crowley. Not a very big investment at all if you are interested in Crowley and especially his wonderful Tarot. I would recommend The Book of Thoth and Tarot Mirror of the Soul in addition to this. I finished this is 3 sessions over a two day period. At the price, you can't go wrong. 
 I found this book very helpful in understanding what my body was and is going through 
 This was a very good movie that I watched in my "Horror Classics Collection: 50 Pack" (ASIN: B0001HAGTM) that I got from Amazon (for under $20.00!).  So first off, I would recommend buying the 50 pack where you get 2 other Vincent Price movies (The Bat and The Last Man On Earth) and 47 other good movies for almost the same price as buying this movie by itself.  As far as this movie goes, there are a few suspenseful parts and you wonder what is going to happen.  Mainly, the movie will give you some memorable quotes, as Vincent Price will always deliver with that great voice of his.  All of the characters do a good job acting (and the typist has a great scream!).  Some parts seem to be a bit unbelievable and some questions don't seem to get answered, but who really cares?  At only 75 minutes long, this movie is better than most of the horror movies that come out today that are unoriginal and go for shock value.  So while this might be more of a murder mystery than a "horror" movie, it is worth a watch and you'll be satisfied at the end...unless of course, you do not like black and white movies, and if that is the case, then you probably wouldn't be reading this review.  P.S. I love in Gary F. Taylor's review when he says: "Price plays it in a slightly prissy, very high-camp manner with a tremendous dose of the black humor for which he was so famous."  That's so true 
 The great turkey walk is a book about a 15 year old boy who is only in fourth grade because he keeps failing.  He buy 1,000 bronze turkeys by borrowing the money from his uncle.  He wants to bring them all the way to Denver because he can sell them for five dollars a turkey and he bought them for less than that. His partner was Mr. Peece.  This story takes place when there were slaves so there wasn't any cars or airplanes to get there.  He has to go by foot and on his journey he encounters 2 people:  Jabeth and Lizzie.  This story is a little violent so I wouldn't recommend it for  anyone younger than 6.  I liked the story because it was very exciting since there were turkey theives trying to steal the turkeys.  There were also some puzzles to figure out like how to get the turkeys over the river and the secret of being safe from locusts.  This is a great adventure story 
 Author Howard Schilit writes in surprisingly plain English, and provides the reader with a toolkit to determine what's so rotten in Denmark - or on Wall Street. You don't have to be an experienced reader of financial reports to learn a lot from this book. Schilit offers more than theory; he provides specific examples and case studies. Learn about the manager who reduced future expenses by purchasing $12 million worth of advance postage metering at the end of the year. Find out how "Chainsaw Al" Dunlop drove up the price of Sunbeam stock by creating a $35 million reserve, all while laying off 11,000 employees. Learn the inside story of how Enron became the poster child for corporate wrongdoing. We highly recommends this book to independent investors, and anyone else who needs to understand how unethical execs cook the books. It may not save you from losing a bundle, but at least you won't feel like you're in a battle of wits and devoid of weaponry 
  This is a history book of the "trail of tears." This book has a very good lesson: a lesson of hope and courage. This book also had three interesting facts. Sequoya invented an alphabet for the Cherokee language and his daughter was the first to use it. The Cherokees had to give up their land to the whites, and had to make a 1200 mile trip. It took them many months and over 4000 people died. The Whites wouldn't let them search for gold, either, even though there was gold in the water.   I liked the book. The pictures were specific and detailed and helped me understand the text better. I would recommend this book to other Cherokees who want to know more about their ancestors, and to anyone interested in learning more about Cherokee, especially I they are 8 and older. 
 This book is a good starting point for the confused would-be entrepreneur...  My business partner and I have taken numerous entrepreneurship classes and have mulled over a business opportunity for quite some time, however, we had a hard time putting our thoughts in writing.  The book helped us create structure around our ideas and prompted us to research further certain areas.  I have to admit - we did not read everything cover to cover... We skimmed through the finance-related chapters as we already had our own models (but I could see how these sections could be helpful to others).  I wish the author had covered the following topics: (1.) drawbacks and advantages of partnerships versus LLCs, (2.) intellectual property law (i.e., registering a trade mark) and (3.) funding options for socially responsible ventures. 
 A DVD with a message that pulls at the heart, and presents sadness and then joy to the viewer. Strong singing cast with excellent voices. A must see 
 For fans of Poppy Z. Brite's early works in gothic horror, this collection of short stories is a killer starting point. As Dan Simmons describes in his tongue-in-cheek intro here, Brite excels in creating deadly scenes through a very "sensual" writing style - that is, she creates moods by deftly describing sights, sounds, and smells with a furiously exotic and descriptive use of language. Like the best of horror, Brite's stories are not necessarily scary in a slasher sort of way, but instill a sense of creeping dread that stays with you long after your reading experience is over. Even better, most of the stories in this volume were written by Brite at quite a young age, giving the world a preview of an emerging talent that has now delivered the goods for close to two decades. These stories show Brite laying waste to overused horror archetypes and taking them in surprising new directions, including a creepy update of the weird twins device in "Angels," a new look at the desires of ghosts in "The Sixth Sentinel," and a very disturbing take on zombies in "Calcutta, Lord of Nerves" which repositions the undead as society's disadvantaged rejects and outcasts. At a young age, Brite also displayed raw talent in the art of character development, the most notable example here being "Optional Music for Voice and Piano," a tale of a singer with a talent that becomes bigger than himself, with tragic results. Poppy Z. Brite has had an important influence on modern horror writing, and instead of reading imitations, you should get it from the source. [~doomsdayer520~ 
 I initially heard about this book via the New York Radio Message Board & its webmaster Allan Sniffen-Based on what he had to say,I decided to go out & buy a copy for myself-I'm glad I did-This is a terrific book-Richard Neer chronicles his career from the late 1960's when he worked for a Long Island,NY station called WLIR to the heritage rock station WNEW-FM in NYC,where he stayed from 1971-1999-Neer recounts the events that led to WNEW's demise as a rock station in 1999-Apparently,he wasn't thrilled that it changed formats to talk-In the two & a half years since NEW-FM became a talk station,their ratings have been abysmal,to say the least-Anyway,Neer has done a thorough job here-This is a book,which should not only be read by those in the industry,but for people like myself,who love listening to the radio 
 Lyons's first book on the fabrication of the Whitewater hoax by the New York Times is even more compelling reading now than it was when it was  published.  In 2000, it is easy to see how the impeachment became  inevitable; it will soon enough become evident why it failed (because the  President is a sinner, but not a lawbreaker); and Lyons, almost alone among  the country's journalists, demolished Whitewater as a credible scandal in  1996. Lyons demonstrates that Governor Clinton was not guilty of any abuse  of power, because no such abuse took place. The Times did not make a  mountain out of a molehill, it made it out of nothing at all.  After Lyons  briskly explains the banking law and practice that governed the decline and  takeover of Madison Guaranty, the facts of Beverly Bassett Schaffer's  appointment and actions regarding the supervision of this bank, there is  simply no case left at all for believing the Clintons violated any standard  of ethics or broke any law.  And it doesn't take long for Lyons to  demonstrate this--what he moves on to is an explication of how the Times,  the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post soon began to make their  own news.  They could not, after all, report show trials in the U.S.  Senate, or throw up their hands in shocked amazement at the findings of the  Pillsbury Report without raising questions in their readers' minds as to  why these trusted newspspers had been mongering this scandal for so long.   Rather than admit their error, they simply hammered home, day after day,  ever more nebulous accusations of the Clintons' character flaws and raised  new "questions" about their behavior.  In this climate, there was  no voice of reason or justice to oppose Kenneth Starr's ever more desperate  prosecutorial tactics in finding something to impeach the President for.  	 Lyons also takes up the lesser "scandals" variously  "reported" by the Times and others, including Mrs. Clinton's  commodities trades,  Governor Clinton's treatment of Tyson Foods and  Stephens, Inc., and James B. Stewart's accusation of financial dishonesty  on Mrs. Clinton's part in filling out a loan application (Stewart had  neglected to check the back of a two-page form, on which Mrs. Clinton had  given the information he accused her of hiding).  	Mr. Lyons got an  awful lot of significant facts, and he got them first. He laid them out in  damning order, and told the story in a tone of dry irony just this side of  scathing. After reading this book, you will want to give it to any of your  friends who are capable of distinguishing fact from propaganda.  And your  level of trust in the New York Times will drop precipitously. It is  required reading for citizens with a sense of decency 
 The Official Story is an excellent example of how to mix political cinema with human drama, avoiding agitprop or crude sloganeering to put a human face on the issue of Argentina's disappeared - in particular the children taken away from undesirables and given to well-connected families who won't ask any questions. When one well-heeled adopted mother learns of this and begins to suspect that her adopted daughter may be one of those children, rather than turn into a sermon the film focuses on her own fears as she tries to disprove the possibility until ultimately she is in the same uncertain hell as the families of the disappeared - she can suspect, but she can never truly know.   Although some of the devices may seem a little too schematic - she's a history teacher who depends solely on the `verifiable' official version of her country's history - it wears them lightly and is often extremely powerful. The Best Foreign Film Oscar has a rather dubious history, but this is definitely one of the more deserving winners 
 I would give this a six out of five.  This joint got my spirits up for pure hip hop.  Man, I remember a buddy of mine talked me into getting this when we were in a cd shop and I was skeptical about this because I saw Busta Rhymes in this. I was already buying the Arsonists As the World Burns cd, and didn't want to spend more money.  But because of the hype and because Mos had come correct in the early nineties with the Bush Babies, and with UTD, I was like what the hell.  Now, years later, I wonder why I ever doubted.  This brought back the soul in hip hop that had been missing ever since Master P and Puff Daddy corrupted hip hop in the mid nineties.  Mos brought in producers who could produce magic.  Premo and 88 keys.  Wow every track was good.  Even the sing songy tracks.  Man, Mos tackled concious hip hop, conquered the soulfull, yet hype beats, and made magic. Even Busta came on point, sounding like his days when he was with the Leaders of the New School.  This is a must have.  In the top ten albums of all time in hip hop history.  Don't believe, buy it and listen to it for yourself.  
 I received this book with the compliments of Cardsmith publishing.  I am in Iraq and was looking for some good poker books.  I read the book in two days!  This book was very interesting and sparked my interest in several other poker personalities like Amarillo Slim, Unger, Moss, etc.  Very entertaining.  In addition, Dana Smith's interviews with the final table participants were very well done.  I would recommend this book to anyone who would like a light read about some of the great poker players 
 Rebecca Laird has turned Dr. Weatherhead's masterpiece into a user-friendly work.  Though the original book (The Will of God)was certainly easy to read, Laird's working process helps the reader to personally apply the concepts of the Intentional, Circumstantial, and Ultimate Will.  I used this as a personal, individual study book.  But, after experience in many religious study groups, I believe this well thought-out, understandable, and thought-provoking workbook would be an effective group tool.  It lends itself to both quick applications and in-depth growth.  I appreciated the growth potential and the non-preachy attitude.  Guidance to finding my own answers and positions was much preferable to being molded into a preconceived format. Yes! I recommend it 
 What a fun album, full of great tunes from a much better time in the TV world and music world. I play my copy often. The lounge format is adhered to loosely by a couple of the selections. However, there is a cool "lounge" version of the My Three Sons theme. I'm hooked on the Spies theme. My kids like the Batman and Munsters themes a lot 
 I wanted a glass hummingbird feeder and decided to try this one on my window before springing for some of the more glamorous-looking blown glass ones. I mounted it on my kitchen window, under an awning on the northeast side of the house, not at all expecting anything to happen. A ruby-throated hummingbird found it the very first day!  It took some force at first to separate the mounting bracket thing from the feeder itself. In fact, I had to drop it first for it to break loose and detach! Fortunately, nothing broke. I probably could have just soaked it in some hot soapy water and it would have come apart easily.  You can't beat glass. I'm just totally getting away from plastic these days... 
 As suggested by its title, Benjamin Franklin: An American Life portrays the life of one of America's greatest Founding Fathers, Dr. Benjamin Franklin.  Walter Isaacson meticulously illustrates Franklin's academic, social, business, and personal affairs which played a role in shaping America.  Benjamin Franklin is still regarded to this day, more than 300 years after his death, as one of the most impressive scientists, writers, and diplomats known to presence the earth.  This biography depicts Franklin's flaws as well, making his story all the more believable.   Born in Boston in 1706, Franklin was raised by his hard-working English family.  He was very academically inclined and read many books throughout his youth.  He had little formal schooling and was self-educated for the most part.  He became a published writer during his teenage years. Benjamin Franklin apprenticed under his brother during his teenage years and initiated his lifelong career as a published writer.  After a series of events including travel and self-reflection/improvement, he opened his own publishing company at the age of 22 and eventually became postmaster of the 13 colonies.  Many of his maxims in Poor Richard's Almanac are still referred to today.  Much of Franklin's upbringing formed him into an industrious and frugal person.  Not only was he a hard worker, but he also strived to do good for others, as he believed that was what God wanted.  In that effort, he created many organizations to benefit the common man and always kept themes of equality, opportunity, and patriotism near and dear to his heart.  He joined several men together to form the Junto, a businessmen's public service organization.  Franklin understood the importance of education and believed it should not be a privilege only for the elite.  He founded an academy that was the first nonsectarian college in American, which later became the University of Pennsylvania (Isaacson, 2003).  He also established a library, hospital, and police force in Pennsylvania.  A true believer in serving one's country and mankind, he did not patent his inventions, as he wanted them to be practical and beneficial.  During his career as a publicist, he raised his illegitimate son, William, and, although flirtatious with many women, married Deborah Read with whom he had another son (who died at age 4) and a daughter, Sally.  Franklin was close to his children but had a major falling out with William later in life due to political conflict.  In his 30's, William was appointed by Britain to be governor of New Jersey and became a loyalist.  Franklin, who wanted independence for the colonies more than anything, never forgave him although he always remained close to William's illegitimate son, Temple, who Franklin helped raise.   Franklin's political career took place mostly during his retirement.  He traveled extensively to England and France as a confederate diplomat.  Like the smoothing effects of oil on turbulent water, with which Benjamin Franklin experimented, he skillfully smoothed underlying turmoil.  Franklin played a large role, if not the largest, in negotiating independence for America and helped define its values that lie in the Constitution.  He also effectively recruited the help of France in the quest.  Isaacson mentions that Franklin is the only person who signed all four documents that established the government of America (the Declaration of Independence, the French/American treaty, the peace agreement with Britain, and the Constitution) (2003).   Throughout his life, Dr. Franklin accumulated many friends.  His enemies, although strong, were few in number.  He only seemed to grow wiser as he aged and used it to our country's benefit.   Franklin had many health problems during the last decade of his life.  His death at the age of 84 came only a few years after he signed the Constitution.  It was as if he held on to life until he accomplished his goals and our country was complete.   Expecting to skim over much of Benjamin Franklin: An American Life, I instead found myself reading in grave detail every page and sometimes re-reading portions of it.  I wish this book could have been available in my high school American History course.  What this book lent to my understanding of the formation of the United States of America is incredible 
 This is a very engaging set of books for any middle-school reader.  Boys especially might enjoy it.  I have loved it ever since I first read it about 16 years ago 
 I really liked this story. It's great to read a story where someone's been there, done that and questioned their sanity in the process. Although, the writer was in the paratrouper's, he still has our Marine Corps attitude of 'do or die'. I could feel the anxiety when he was preparing to take that first long step out of the plane and the sense of accomplishment when he did. Good writing. Made me feel like I was right there with the writer 
 "Don't the Moon Look Lonesome" is an astonishing tour de force.   The heroine is unique in American literature. Carla isn't an earth-mother,  a sentimental fool, a quivering neurotic, a control freak, a femme fatale,  or a bloodless nonentity.  A feisty blond blues singer in love with a moody  black musician, Carla is as capable of examining her soul as she is of  questioning society's assumptions about color, shape, attitude, style, and  hierarchy. She convinces us that she's got a right to sing the blues the  way she sings the blues, and she always stops singing when the music stops.   Madame Bovary, meet Carla.  You could learn a lot from her 
 This volume collects six issues instead of the five of Books 1 and 2.  Yorick, Agent 355, Dr. Mann and Ampersand continue across the Midwestern US, ultimately toward a radical Arizona group that is blocking the interstate and crippling the fragile national supply chain.  These issues offer several surprises that rejuvenate a storyline that had stalled by the end of the last collection.  I enjoyed this more than Book 3 and will continue reading the series.  
 While I've enjoyed all of the Boyle novels I've read, this one is a real gem.  Fans of T.C. Boyle know he loves to juxtapose the clash of cultures between characters from radically different backgrounds in most of his work, but nowhere does he do it better than in this work.  This is how Dickens would have written had he been into psychodelic mushrooms.  You'll have to put this book down several times just to bring your laughing under control.  The dialog with the drunk who brags about hitting the pub owner on the pillory with six rotten turnips and a dead cat is worth the read alone and put me right on the floor in hysterics 
 We listened to this while driving cross country.  It was great and really made the drive go quickly.  It is funny and witty.  I wished it had been long enough to last the whole 3 day trip 
 I bought this CD storybook in Beijing. It's much more expensive than my anticipation. But the cover of this book is very beautiful, it's good-designed. It's very easy to attract children's eyes, and easier to attract the eyes of teenagers who have a kid's heart just like me! When I started this book, I felt the stories were familiar to me. The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast were my favourite stories. The pictures in this book were so beautiful, the words and phrase were easy to read, this was fit for little kids and English beginners. There was a read-along CD with this book, it was very useful to me. To little kids, this CD with read-along stories and dramatic music can give them the feeling that they are one of the characters in the stories. But to me, it's a good material of learning English. I read this book and other English books every morning from the day I bought this book. When I saw a new word, I wrote it down on my note book, and read it as many times as possible. Then I listen to the CD and read-along with the voice in my book. I loved English when I was a child, but the English books I used were tedious. Now I can improve my English with a Disney Princess CD Storybook, my spoken-English and reading-English have been improve much now! If there are little kids and English beginners in your family, this book will be the best present to them, and they will love it and feel it very interesting and useful 
 This was an enjoyable book.  Great for the holidays.  Not exactly the normal scenario for Stephanie Plum, but still a good read 
 this is definitely the best christmas cd my family owns. we listen to it maannny many times each christmas season and it is a staple in our stereos! it has become part of our family's tradition to listen to it as we decorate the tree!  the musicianship is just gorgeous and each song really displays the artist's fantastic talents. now that i am older, i can fully appreciate how wonderful the musicians on this disc are- each song is so complex and beautifully crafted and its great to listen to and find parts of each song that you might have missed in previous listens. as a musician myself, i admire these jazz virtuouso's and believe it is an amazing christmas cd to be owned by anyone who can appreciate true musicianship 
 This book is excellent for a sports minded person that is interested in womens basketball at the college level.  I have personal connections with someone mentioned in the book so I might be a bit predjudiced 
 Not only are the paintings themselves almost better than the original (just kidding, kinda) due to the luminosity imposed by the screen, the lovely score is transporting. This set places the Impressionists in a historical framework (though I didn't hear mention of Monet's studio being usurped as military storage during the war and his paintings used as linoleum-don't know if this is true or not, but had heard it before.) I was rather shocked that Monet got his friend and benefactor's wife pregnant and had the audacity to move her and the baby in with himself and his wife. Monet's wife got ill and died several years later, no doubt stressed out by the situation. Then Monet paints her dead.  This dvd really hits home how you may appreciate someone's work, but not necessarily who they are as human beings 
 The entire line is fabulous, but the rose zircon lip gloss is by far the best. I have never been one to wear lipstick, but since I first tried this lip plumping gloss, I rearly leave home without it.  It doesn't feel like you are wearing anything, yet it stays on while eating and drinking. The rose zircon matches my lips and that of all my friends who have borrowed it and not returned it because they love it so. It just makes me feel glamorous 
 If the proof is in the pudding, the value of this recipe is that I have faced three concrete 'CEO moments' since finishing Lencioni's fable two days ago that have proven to be the turf for implementation of his well-told counsel to CEOs who live or die by clarity and courage.  Courage. The author understands that life at the top of an organization calls for extraordinary bravery as one faces the limitations of oneself and then of others. He does not let his reader off the hook, but presses into him the need for firm resolve and courageous action in resisting the temptations that come-one at a time or in fearsome mobs-into the life of the CEO.  This is my second Lencioni fable (after Four Obsessions) and the best of the two.  If you, like me, find your finite reservoir of courage in ample demand as you attempt to lead human beings to succeed in a group, success begins with our will to summon up that quality yet one more time. Reading this book will help you find the moral courage to do so 
 Interesting book, you will find in it something new about six sigma. I have a book from Pyzdek and one from Brayfogle, but also this one gave me new insite 
 I first read Brooks's only novel in a graduate seminar--because I was forced to read it. I had never read anything quite like it. The artistry is amazing, and the story is one that had to be told. Of course, those familiar with Brooks's wonderful poetry, particularly the Pulitzer Prize winning ANNIE ALLEN (1949), will see the strong parallels between her poetry and MAUD MARTHA. I've taught the novel in my American literature and African American literature courses. Students love it! It's a classic tale about self-discovery that makes it an enjoyable read for anyone who enjoys well-crafted poetic prose

  "Black Cross" takes us to the darkest hours of the Nazi regime. It is an action/adventure novel, but very detailed and realistic. The story builds up and the last 100 pages are a rollercoaster.   I don't want to give details of the plot, just to say that if you like action, adventure and II World War era stories, "Black Cross" stands out as one of the best.   
 Hello flyers! Greetings from student pilot from Teterboro Aiport. After reading this book from cover to cover, I feel that I have acquired sufficient knowledge to continue in my flying lessons without a cloud in my head. It filled in the blanks and I wish it went furtehr than 300 or so pages. The book's anecdotal style makes general aviation easier to understand. Certainly, in my case at least, it was more enjoyable to read than a manual on flight with test questions after every chapter. This is not that kind of book, to its benefit. I learned a lot from this book, and I feel that I will have an easier time in my flying lessons because of it 
 Obviously this machine doesn't have a speed dial, so you control the speed. You have to direct your own workout and really have the drive to make your own workout. Other than that - it's easy to set up, fun to use, and does the job for the price. If you want something cheap because you can't afford the "real thing", this is a perfect buy 
 I am a big Johanna Lindsey fan, but I have to say that I enjoyed this first in the MacCarrick Brother's book series as well as anything I've read by Lindsey with Scots in it.  This romance is 'historical' in the same sense as Lindsey's books.  But Kresley Cole goes to greater lengths on the details that make you feel like you are there - including language elements and other details that make it a sophisticated read.  But besides that, the sex is hot!    And the Scottsmen are those rugged, brawney, plainspoken types we all love!  (Which MacCarrick Brother is your favorite? - I have to say I liked Hugh even better than Court, and he gets his own book in the next one of the series.) ;-)  In this book, Annalia speaks four or five languages, and there is Gaellic thrown in there for good measure.  Annalia (refreshingly) is Castilian.  The story is about (in part) the two cultures, hardworking Scottsman and fiery Castilian of royal blood.  The story crosses into three different countries, with changing modes of dress to go with.  We go from the Pyrhennes, to Toulouse, to London - three very different places.  I loved that Court's 'crew' could help him to see past his nose and deal with Annalia.  I loved the genuine political mess that Annalia and her brother were involved in.  There was an authentic flavor to this story that was refreshing.  I also loved the familial relationships between not only the MacCarrick brothers, but also the Llorente's (Annalia and her brother) as well.  I also loved the way Court's tender love for Annalia just explodes.  One minute he refuses to help her win her brother back because of her arrogance, the next he is negotiating his way through a minefield of vases being thrown at him, then tending her when she gets shot.  He totally becomes smitten, and it is charming.  Sort of like D'Artagnan in The Three Musketeers - having a lady to fight for does that to you.  The only thing that didn't add up with the Brother's superstitious belief in the prophecy.  But the quality of the writing more than made up for this particular stretch - which is more than I can say for the plot gymnastics I've endured on a Johanna Lindsey book 
 A super production of 1994 that tried to recapture the magic of Kipling's novel. The emphasis is on the love Mowgli feels for Kitty, though we could not understand Kitty if she did not love Mowgli's beautiful body that he lets everyone contemplate and admire and his deep consciousness of the relationship between nature and man, between human fate and the law of nature the way it exists in the deep jungle of India. In other words she can only love this man who can speak to all animals and order them to speak or keep silent, especially when she looks at the officers of Her Majesty's army around her, human animals who only like killing, dominating, stealing and robbing. Vain, criminal and greedy as opposed to free, strong and generous. But by concentrating the film on this only love affair, the director and producers miss so many aspects of the book that are just as fascinating, like the detailed observation of human nature, of Indian society, of wild animals, of English men when their masculinity is at stake, and in those days their masculinity was always at stake which made them cruel in order to prove they were strong and human. It was a time when cruelty was part of a gentleman's education. This is mostly pushed aside in the film. And I must admit the elephants seem to be quite small in a way and the tiger should have been a lot  more ferocious. But you can't really shoot a film like that with wild animals. Too bad. And quite many small animals of the jungle are just absent, like snakes, bees, flies and all the other flying, crawling or jumping insects. The film is then only entertaining, but after all it is intended for kids, and even if we are grown-up kids, we are no longer wearing short pants in the office and going to kindergarten.

 Never has such a movie with so much talking and so little action has given me such a rush like this movie. Quentin Tarantino's Resevoir Dogs is an example of the way movies should be these days. This movie doesn't get by with over the top action sequences and bloody fist fights like most other crime based movies do( don't get me wrong, there are quite a few gun fights in this movie) but instead gives us a well structured movie showing the aftermath of an almost failed diamond heist.  The plot of the movie is pretty basic: A group of guys team up together under a crime boss and plan to rob a bank to get their hands on some priceless diamonds. the way this plot is shown, however is what makes this movie so different from other crime movies. the movie starts off with the color code named theives sitting at a restaurant casually talking amongst  themselves before the heist and then switches suddenly to the aftermath of the heist. Like most other Tarantino movies events don't always happen in the correct order for example showing things that happen before the heist directly after scenes taking place after the heist and its this kind of unique pacing that puts Resevoir Dogs apart from other movies in the same genre.  And of course we can't overlook the great acting for this movie. Harvey Kietel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, and other big name actors enter this movie and each one in my opinion is a great actor. These actors are so well in this movie that you can feel the emotion that their onscreen counterparts are potraying and it's very refreshing to see such good actors in this movie.  So if you're a fan of other Tarantino movies then by all means pick this one up. I promise you won't regret it.  
 The Complete systems Administrator lives up to the "complete" part of it's name. This book covers nearly every area I could possibly think I'd ever need t look up in a network administration/system administration role.  Unfortunately despite the fact this book is only four years at this point, I believe it already is beginning to show it's age. There is a lot of attention given to HP/UX, and AIX in this book with suprisingly minor attention given to Linux. I think it's safe to say that a typical sysadmin-type employee would be encountering many more Linux systems that HP/UX or AIX these days.   Information on devices and buses such as SATA is also lacking due to the technology being newer then the date on the book.  That said, this book is still great and recommended but with the caveats mentioned above. I would look forward to an updated version of this book with more emphasis on Linux, updated info on Vista, Server 2003, and newer versions of OS X. 
 This book was sent to me extremely quickly and was in perfect condition.  I'd order from them again 
 This book was in my car for several weeks after someone gave it to me before I picked it up.  When I finally did sit down to read it, I couldn't put it down.  I could relate to just about every page in it.  I felt, here  was someone else who had experienced all that I had, but like me, wanted to  find the silver-linings, not just all the pain of experiencing cancer. Once  I became comfortable with me, I tossed my wigs and hats and made the world  deal with me as I am.  It was a good feeling to be able to laugh about all  that I have experienced.  Although I read it late in my treatment, it was  good therapy 
 This was a very unexpected book from a very practical teacher like Thich Nhat Hanh, whose books on mindful living continued to inspire me for the past more than ten years. Why, indeed, would he delve into complexities of one of the most elaborate and, dare I say, abstruse philosophies that Buddhism has produced - Yogacara, or the Mind Only school? Having an undue penchant for philosophical discourse, however, I readily grasped at the book, looking in it for an excuse for my passion for abstractions. And I found so much more than what I was looking for. The key phrase for this book is given in the introduction: "When we understand how our mind works, the practice becomes easier". I was always fascinated by the way the mind works, especially after having read Schopenhauer's "On the fourfould foundation of the law of sufficient reason" (sorry, that's how terrible it sounds), which first revealed to me to what a great extent that which we consider to be 'objective reality' is actually shaped by our mind. Later on, I became interested in Zen/Chan, which doesn't really emphasize philosophical discourse on surface (although some of the most profound philosophical works have also been produced by Chan masters - for instance, Dongshan Liangjie). In this book by Thich Nhat Hanh, Chan meets philosophy again for me (philosophy in the Kantian sense - not as a metaphysical discourse, but as an investigation of the nature and limits of our perception and knowledge). For me, unfortunately, Zen practice continuously has to be supported by intellectual conviction that it is the right thing to do, or after some time I lose it. For those as unfortunate as I am, this is the right book. Even a few lines from it every day, like a medicine, will be a great help if you don't want to veer into the foggy-groggy existence that most of us lead. After all, isn't it cautioning us against this way of life what Thich Nhat Hanh devoted his lifetime to? This book is as dense as any philosophical treatise may be, except for the fact that each sentence seems to be so incredibly well thought out as to have a practical application to one's life. The number of Sanskrit terms is incredible for Thich Nhat Hanh (there are a couple of pages where there are 50+ of them). But the difference between this work and some PhD dissertation on the Mind Only school is as vast as between heaven and earth, for this man lives what he's talking about, whereas most professors seem to be just churning words.  I agree with the above reviewer that this may be a life changing book. It has to be read very slowly, than probably read over and over again. Then you may go to the original works (which is what I intend to do), and I bet you'll read them with different eyes. But of course the key thing here is to view your life with different eyes. 
 Tesla is the greatest rock band to come out of the 80's. This album is a must for anyone who likes straight up rock 
 If you think the Arts don't matter anymore, I'm here to tell you to THINK again.    As a second grade teacher I find Jensen's work a must-read for every parent and educator.  The Arts really do play an important part in education; whether the Arts fall under musical, visual, or in kinesthetic.  The Arts will enhances the neurobiological system (Jensen, 2001, p. 116) or the brain, increasing a healthy responsive learning environment to other disciplines/subjects that are outside of the Arts.     Jenson discussed in-depth how each of the three Arts are important and why they should be part of every school's curriculum.    Simply a great book!     
 If you've read other books by Barbara Seaman (and you should take a look, if you haven't), you know that she is a crusader for the health of women.  She will tell you the truth about what birth control and other hormones are doing to your health - and about the side effects of the pill that your doctor isn't likely to mention.  Please, if you're going to take hormones, inform yourself as fully as possible about what you're really signing up to do.  I came close to losing my life from side effects of the birth control pill and "natural" progesterone cream.  Don't let it happen to you - Barbara Seaman is a great resource 
 I first learned of acupressure while doing a yoga/pilates workout. So I wanted to find an "instructional" type of book so that I could learn the basics. This book is exactly what I was looking for! By providing a list of ailments, and the proper techniques and terminology, I was able to directly target problem areas. Illustrations especially zone in on fail-proof learning! And I am truly amazed at the results! Stomache-aches, headaches, asthma, anxiety/relaxation, even hiccups have literally disappeared! With each deep breath, you too can overcome common ailments so that not only your body will benefit, but also your mind and spirit!! 
 ...and I'm not easy to please.  It's strange when you realize just how sexy George Segal was.  But the movie is wonderfully written, sharp, smart and incredibly funny.  I saw another reviewer liked The Goodbye Girl better.  I prefered this...Sharper, more biting, less sentimental.  That doesn't mean it's heartless or even cynical, just that it's lacking in syrup.  George Segal and Glenda Jackson have the all the chemistry and the comedic chops (and then some) needed to make this movie work.  This movie made me laugh a lot, was sexy enough to warm any cold night and smart enough to make me feel like the people who made it figured I had at least a high school education.  How come comedic movies this smart don't get made by the major studios anymore 
 this movie is one of the funniest movies i've seen,leguizamo played a role of a pest a really annoying person who puts himself in a very strange situation when a nazy german wants to hunt him on an island..a nice movie that you can watch when u really dont have anything to do..the thing i liked the most is the song..it's really cool 
 There are 2 types of pregnancy books out there: the ones by doctors, scientists, and professionals from the medical side of pregnancy, and those from those who "have been there" and are sharing their battle stories with you.  Kimes book is one of those "I've been there" books and one of the best I've read.  If you are looking for an EXTREMELY funny book that also covers the bases of what you can expect to go through, Kimes hits a home run with this one.  The book isn't whiny, though the title may make you think it will be.  If you like whining and degradation, you'd better buy 'The Girlfriend's Guide'.  This book won't leave you thinking your life is over.  Instead, you will feel understood, relieved, and left with a lighthearted feeling about pregnancy instead of being left with a sense of dread.  This is one that will have you giggling and passing it to your significant other to share.  I'm shocked to read some people recommending 'The Girlfriend's Guide' over this book.  This has been one of my most treasured pregnancy books and 'The Girlfriend's Guide' doesn't touch it!!!  If you don't believe me, buy the two and compare, but don't miss this laugh-out-loud funny, telling-it-like-it-is book 
 I will start by saying that this book may not be for everyone. Some readers with short patience will loose interest before the book climaxes. But if you are a true fan of reading, I cannot see you loosing interest in this book. The descriptions of buses and Jack's day to day occupation are occasionally over the top and what some would say excessive... but it all serves a distinct purpose to bring you as the reader, into Jack's life. If you don't let yourself become Jack in this book, don't bother reading it, because it will mean nothing to you. But if you give it a chance, you will see a beautiful tragedy unfold right before you. This book truly is a proving ground for the saying that, "you don't know what you have till it's gone." You may also find it difficult to remove yourself from Jack's life once you've put yourselves in it. I would recommend this book to anyone who truly enjoys reading, but especially men, who in my opinion can truly relate to what a white widow is, and how we can really loose our minds after getting one in our head.  awsome book 
 This is an outstanding edition of Milton's classic work.  Kastan provides references for words that have fallen out of modern day usage, making the text easier for today's reader to understand.  The text is full of extensive footnotes, providing clarification, background data, and, for further study, references to Milton's original sources. The font size and paper quality of this paperback text make it a pleasure to read and transport.  
 Allright, I admit that as a Yank writer who has taught writing myself, I did at first find William Trevor's constant use of the passive voice somewhat disturbing! That was upon reading "Felicia's Journey," my first, unforgettable exposure to this genius. Since then, I have come to believe that one grand reason to remain alive is to read the rest of his novels: they are that brilliant and awe-inspiring. I do not believe that his 'Big House' novels, this one and "The Story of Lucy Gault," can be excelled for the strength of their immortal tragedy. His use of irony in human endeavor and fate creates masterpieces that illuminate man's virtue and folly as inseparable. Since the loss of Hubert Selby, Jr. last year, Trevor may very well stand alone now as the foremost tragedian in the Western world. Do read these two novels for the sense of finality, futility and hopelessness that Trevor is so masterful at extracting from the  both the the barest and the most complicated lives, while spinning stories that carry more momentum than a beach-trash thriller. 
 We absolutely love the companion History book, and this workbook compliments the reading perfectly!  The workbook pages are so easy to use and help the kids to really work with and learn the stories.  My children particularly like the map worksheets and coloring pages, but the activities they suggest are amazing.  I never would have thought of all of this on my own!  We just love the whole Well-Trained Mind series 
 First of all, for all the reviews that say it sounds like Creed...IT IS Creed! - But, with a much better singer, Myles Kennedy, who blows Stapp's range out of the water. Mark Tremonti is a pioneer in guitar riffs and anthemic post-grunge rock he makes and I will continue to follow him wherever he goes.  Scott Phillips, who is one of the best drummers (as one myself), of any band out there.  Brian Marshall (bass) - who I think is the most underrated bassists in rock today, this guy really doesn't get enough credit.  On to the album review...  I have listened to this album day after day, for a year... As you listen, Alter Bridge immerses you in its throaty and hard rock with somewhat of a pop feel, then it eases to wholesome, peaceful music on the lighter tracks such as 4. Burn It Down, 7. In Loving Memory & 10. Shed My Skin. Track #9 is a Metallica influenced song, Watch Your Words written by Tremonti (as, in fact, all the tracks are)  My favorites: 100/10 (no typo)!!! - 5. Metalingus: THE BEST song to come out in ages, if you talk about and all out 'ROCK OUT'. 10/10 - 6. Broken Wings: Put this track on repeat and find yourself singing along! Great song, enough said. 10/10 - 8. Down to My Last: "My personal favorite" Creed fans will adore. An anthemic tribute to the fans who have supported them through Creed until present. Myles blows the roof off with his range and Tremonti solos for all to see that he is the most advanced guitarist of his generation. 10/10 - 11. The End Is Here: In my opinion, the best pick for an outro jam, its catchy guitar melody and impacting lyrics show off this amazing band.  Wind-Up Records: Alter Bridge's now "former" label SUCKS!!! And this is why AB split it off. WHERE WAS THE PROMO FOR THESE GUYS?!?!?!?! Wind-Up does (and always has done) a sucka** job of promoting their bands. They stick their money in just one headliner and hope for the best...Examples: They pulled out a greatest hits album for Creed when there wasn't a Creed. Evanscence, !NO NAMES! who popped out of nowhere, but became mainstream because Wind-Up promoted them so well.  Alter Bridge: wish the best for continued success 
 My two-year old likes the pictures of the adorable bunny as it bathes in the paint, showers, etc. I'm sure as she gets older she'll begin to understand the mixing of colors, which is presented so simply and delightfully here. I wish this were available as a board book, so adventurous painters don't have to worry about staining the pages if they read this while experimenting 
 Forget the obvious feminist stance of the book, and focus on the quite lucid commentary and collation of hard to find material on great Buddhist women 
 I have read half this book in a single day, it was hard to put it down. While I was aware of many of the items in this book from reading other books about cats, the author provides a lot of information, and especially comparisons between dogs and cats, and other domesticated animals, all of which is very interesting.  The author has a very good introduction to genetics. He also mentions research about how breeding for color has a side effect of changing the personality of the cats. He repeatedly gives examples of how the adaption of cats to living in proximity to humans is caused by a genetic changes that lead to changes in behaviour, and ultimately in how the mind of the cat works. He also touchs on concerns about how heavy inbreeding to select for various odd traits that we find pleasing may be creating animals that are actually mentally less suited to being pets and surviving on their own.  Another great book that goes over a lot of the same issues, but is more current, and discusses a lot of these same things as their concern farm animals, and other pets is  "Thinking In Pictures - and Other Reports from My Life with Autism" by Temple Grandin. I highly recommend this book also.  
 I devote about 30 hours a week working on my genelogy.  This book is invaluable to me 
 I'm not a big Gloria Estefan fan. She has some good songs and makes, at best, average albums. Gloria was always a singles artist to me, but this is pure delight from beginning to end. Great production and you feel Gloria Estefan put 100% into this. Great latin songs and the liner notes are great for interpretation and explanation.   If you get any Gloria Estefan album this is it. 
 The Rick Steves guides are more update to date than other guides. It's clear in  using the 2003 and 2004 editions  that Rick has recently updated the books . Other guides seem like fact checked revisions. Rick's books give me  info that only someone that has "been there" and "done that" RECENTLY could provide. Besides all of this, Rick is one heck of money manager.  I was sometimes thrifty and sometimes not, but I always felt I got my money's worth thanks to Rick 's advice about what's worth it and what's not 
 I admit at first viewing this movie, I saw Betty, Naomi Watts initial character, to be a literal character and not someone in a dream Diane was having. In other reviews here, that is realized. It's a little disturbing to see it that way, but we are all dreamers, and sometimes the way we would like to be or think we are isn't the way others see it. Our internal world is vast and much more relavent than our outer selves, though I agree there should be balance between the two with a certain level head to reality. Mulholland Drive is purely a dream and then a disturbing "reality". It's beautifully done. Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring were the right image and voice. They are another way to see the way we are sometimes, whether we are male or female, our internal world is both, and this really displays another side of us for us to understand. I really care about Betty in this movie. I admit there is a side of me that has come to understand that my way is sometimes the same as hers. It goes with trying to understand ourselves. She has all this energy to give to others, and an honest trust in anyone. We never grow up, it seems. Laura Elena Harring's character is that side of us that goes on, clueless to the past and stuck to present circumstances. It's devastating to be brought to wonder "who am I?" after all we've known and been through. If you can understand this much, you'll take a lot from this movie. I looked up Roy Orbison's lyrics to Crying. A good touch to the story. Overall, this will leave you wondering why God made us so desperate for heaven, or clueless to it. I believe it is true that David Lynch put his heart into this. It's so much to care about. And the soundtrack is excellent. Pay attention to the music to see when you watch 
 I own many books about flash and this one is the most complete. Maybe you'll have to go more into certain topicson other books but this is the best end more comprehensive guide I ever read. Very simple and direct, never confusing, good tutorials, covers pocket pc, sound edting and sound design, and is good also if ,like me you want to focus on new features of the 2000 editions. Perfect  
 With the psuedo naive eyes of Persian tourists,  Montesquieu depicts the French society of the  beginning of the 18th century through a  correspondance with relatives and relations   who stayed in Persia. As a modern Socrates,   he plays the innocent to challenge nobles  and courtisans of the French court.     The most   surprising element of this book is the accuracy   of the underneath analysis of the French society.   Those "letters", written about two hundred years   ago, always seem to be up to date 
 It is almost unbelievable, how this book could ever have raised a scandal, whereas it deals with love in a most human and indeed loving way. This tells us more about earlier readers than about the author. Everybody who is able to abandon the carthesian beliefs that ruined pleasure in enjoying life in the flesh as well as in the spirit will enjoy this masterpiece of literature. 
 This book was very informative.  It explained a lot of things going on in this world that I didn't or couldn't understand before.  A must read for everyone! 
 The book arrived fast & in great shape.  My nephew loves it! He loves it so much that he had to have the Scarne book on magic. 
 This book was published just in time for my second winemaking season and is remarkable in its helpful clarity, having the correct answers to mystifying challenges. I had one crazy challenge in my first season of winemaking which resulted in several answers being given by experts. This book correctly identified the problem, the fix, and how to prevent the problem. It somehow provides a more straightforward and simple walk through of the process, taking away any notion that wine making is a challenge. It also discusses in depth and allows consideration for those of us who would like to minimize the inclusion of sulfites. Just being aware of that as a concern of the home winemaker is a huge win. I couldn't recommend this book more - it is the perfect tome of essential information to those wanting to get going with their own winemaking. I keep saying, I wish I had started years ago. Get this book without hesitation - it will get you on your way to stunning wine produced by your own efforts. Great satisfaction is guaranteed 
 We first borrowed this book from the library and just had to get our own copy. My son (9) cooks from this almost every weekend and is becoming quite an independent cook. All recipes are delicious (we've tried at least 20 recipes from the book and all have been very tasty) and can be made by young children. We love the granola, tea biscuits, guacamole, baked tofu, and many other dishes. Many of the recipes can easily be adapted for a vegan diet also 
 William H. McNeill's book "Plagues and Peoples" provides a thorough and original look at how epidemic diseases have shaped the course of human history. McNeill begins by describing the basic patterns of disease spread and how epidemics generally affect human population and activity, including war, religion, colonization, trade, politics, economics, etc. In a community previously unexposed to a particular disease, the effects can be devastating, killing off vast numbers. In communities where a disease has been encountered before, however, individuals who have been exposed usually have developed some level of resistance and either do not contract the disease again or, if they do, the symptoms tend to be far less severe.  In a community where a particular disease has established itself and attained endemic status (i.e. it is constantly present in the population, to some degree, as opposed to an epidemic that strikes and then disappears after a time), it becomes primarily a childhood disease, due to the fact that young children are usually the only ones in the population who have not been exposed and have therefore not had a chance to build any resistance. Examples of diseases that have attained such an endemic status include chicken pox, measles, and mumps, among others. McNeill also makes an interesting point that, for a disease to become endemic in a community, the population thereof must remain above a certain threshold number, below which there would not be a large enough body of unexposed, susceptible individuals to allow the continual perpetuation of the disease. For example, "the critical threshold below which [measles] cannot survive falls between 300,000 and 400,000 persons" (pg. 78).  One of the themes McNeill addresses throughout the book is the balance between what he calls "microparasitism" and "macroparasitism." The former refers to the parasitism of humans by infectious organisms such as bacteria, viruses, worms, etc. The latter is a term the author has applied to the way in which humans "parasitize" other humans via war, colonization, tax systems, etc. The book draws many parallels between the two, making it apparent that humans can have much the same effect on their own kind as do microscopic invaders.  McNeill works in chronological order from ancient times to modern day, describing different outbreaks of various diseases and the impacts they have had. There is little information on most of the older epidemics, simply due to the fact that few, if any, clearly written records exist from times long ago. In addition, it is often impossible to identify an ancient disease with a modern one based on available records. Though the term "plague" is assigned to many of the epidemics described in the Bible, it is unlikely that these outbreaks were instances of the bubonic plague that popularized the term centuries later. Once record-keeping became standard procedure, however, information was much easier to obtain.  A large section of the book is devoted to discussion of the infamous Black Death that first ravaged Europe from 1346-1350, and continued to return for repeat epidemics for several centuries afterward. McNeill explores the origins of this plague in other parts of the world and means by which the causal bacillus was transferred to European countries. Other diseases discussed include smallpox, chicken pox / shingles, measles, mumps, cholera, typhus, malaria, yellow fever, sleeping sickness, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis, leprosy, yaws, syphilis, poliomyelitis, and various parasites such as blood flukes. "Plagues and Peoples" was originally published in 1976, so the main body of the text does not include information on AIDS, but the updated 1998 edition has an added preface that briefly discusses the recent impact of this disease.  The last section of the book is devoted to the impacts modern medicine, since 1700, has had on the age-old patterns of epidemic infection. The two practices which seem to have had the greatest impact are quarantine and inoculation. Once people began to understand the nature of contagion between human beings (opposed to the previous "miasma" theory that bad vapors from dead bodies caused infection), quarantine measures became at least partially effective in stemming the spread of diseases such as tuberculosis, sufferers of which were often sent off to sanatoriums. Inoculation, first put into widespread use to combat smallpox, allowed individuals to build up immunity by exposure to a small, non-lethal dose of a particular antigen.  Many of the conclusions McNeill draws from his examination of epidemic diseases are based largely on circumstantial evidence, due to the aforementioned lack of detailed documentation of early outbreaks, but they are all very logical and plausible, despite sometimes going against long-established ideas. All the hypotheses offered here are backed up by thorough research and clear cause-and-effect analysis based on the standard patterns epidemic infections tend to take. McNeill does not delve too deeply into the specific symptoms of each individual disease he covers, but rather spends his time discussing the broader, large-scale effects these epidemics had on human history. The book is fascinating, and is also very readable. Highly recommended to anyone interested in the history of disease

This book has great value and could help any student taking the AP English exam 
 Set in an economically depressed Maine mill town, "Empire Falls" demostrates Richard Russo's ("Nobody's Fool," "The Whore's Child") talent for creating truly memorable characters out of ordinary people. Upon his mother's death, Miles Roby is forced to abandon his college aspirations to return home to manage the Empire Grill.  Over the course of the novel, Miles struggles not only to come to terms with his failed marriage to his estranged wife, Janine, but also to overcome his own psychological issues, exposed most painfully by the strong-willed widow, Francine Whiting, who dominates the town with her power and wealth.  Other memorable characters include Miles's troubled teenaged daughter, Tick; his brother, Walt, a recovering-alcoholic; and their cantankerous father, Max (played by Paul Newman in the HBO movie).  In "Empire Falls," Russo insightfully examines the human nature of ordinary, blue-collar people and their "impossible desires" at odds with economics, "logic, plausibility, and even the passage of time." The result is not-so-ordinary, epic literature.  G. Merrit 
 Notes From Underground is a highly unusual story and therefore difficult to summarize.  Part I is a dense, rambling, but incredibly insightful exploration of human freedom in the face of modern concepts that question the possibility of meaningful choice.  Dostoevsky argues that, more than anything else, it is our ability to make choices (even irrational and destructive choices) that defines us as human beings and allows us to express our freedom from rational egoism and scientific determinism.  People don't always choose what is rational; in fact, sometimes we choose pain and suffering simply to show that we are free to do as we please.  As the underground man says, what fun is it to want something if what you want is already predetermined by either reason or science?  However, while human freedom makes choice meaningful, it is also disconcerting.  The realization that we are completely free to make choices opens up such a wide range of possibilities that action becomes difficult and even terrifying at times, and the underground man suffers a sort of paralysis as a result.  Although Dostoevsky certainly does not view the underground man's response to freedom as the right one, he does seem to think that such a person is a possible and perhaps even necessary product of the alienating, bureaucratic, unnaturally "rational" society in which he finds himself.  Under such conditions, making destructive choices is perhaps the only means left for a person on the fringes of society to express her freedom and humanity.  Thus, while The Brothers Karamazov could perhaps be read as Dostoevsky's solution to the problems presented in Notes From Underground, the underground man himself serves an example of someone who fails to carry the burden of human freedom in a way that makes happiness possible.  Part I, then, is a difficult but powerful exploration of possible responses to the problem of human freedom, and for this reason it is widely regarded as an important precursor to the existential philosophy of later thinkers like Sartre and Camus.  Part II takes a more traditional "story" format, and shows how the Underground Man interacts with the world around him.  An important aspect of Part II is its emphasis on the contradictory and paradoxical makeup of human nature.  According to Dostoevsky, human beings are not at all rational; instead, we are capable of feeling the pull of highly contradictory motivations and desires.  For instance, the underground man desperately wants love and acceptance, but whenever he seeks out human contact he is suddenly seized by an equally strong desire to sabotage his relationships with others and destroy any possibility of meaningful connection.  He is filled with noble desires and appreciates the beautiful and lofty, but at the same time delights in humiliating himself and engaging in debaucheries for the pure enjoyment of it.  In other words, the underground man feels the pull of contradiction and is aware of his freedom to express divergent aspects of his personality, but he is unable to do so in the right sort of way.  (Again, read The Brothers Karamazov for Dostoevsky's solution to the problem.)  Basically, I felt that Notes From Underground was incredibly worthwhile:  read it for its influence on the development of existentialism, or for its exploration of human nature, or for the insight it offers into Dostoevsky's later works, or as an amazing character sketch, or just because (after Part I, at least) it's an enthralling story that builds up speed like a locomotive.  In the end I enjoyed Notes From Underground for each of the above reasons.  Good book 
 Now, first, I want to say that this is the FIRST Star Wars novel I'd ever read when I read it [I've read nearly all of them, now].  I picked it up, because it looked like an older version of Luke on the front, what with the greeen saber, astromech, similar dress, and the image of young Luke in the back.  ANYWAY...  This book, to me, captured the very essance of any type of training that one could equate to Jedi training.  Yes, Corran was full of himself early on.  Heck, he stayed that way through most of the book.  But, he saw that his ego made him weak, and as the book went on, he saw that ego keep getting in the way.  He learned to let go of it, and learned to touch the Force.  This indepth look into the human nature, and its reaction to Jedi training, is by far, the most accurate book I have EVER read on the subject.  I've re-read this book so many times after the years, I had to buy a second one, cause the first fell apart 
 This is my first John MacDonald book and I was impressed by the great character development. This is not your standard murder mystery - instead it reminds me of Larry McMurtry's "life is full of tragedy" theme. The greed of two men causes a chain reaction of events that end up with one of them being killed and life forever changed for a whole host of people.  Is it a mystery? No - the reader knows exactly what happens and no one is looking for the real murderers. What it is is well-written and interesting and, ultimately it struck me as realistic.  From what I've read of the other reviews, this was not MacDonald's standard fare - but I am still intrigued enough to look for some more.  One thing I was terrible disappointed in - and this is not a reflection of MacDonald, but rather Fawcett Books, the publisher - there were massive amounts of typos in the book - sometimes at least one on every page for 15-20 pages at a stretch - misspellings, quotation marks left off, names not capitalized. It got to be distracting and then a big joke. How unprofessional of Fawcett to send such a fine book to press with so many mistakes 
 This movie was fantastic despite what naysayers would have you believe.  While the old Planet of the Apes is a classic this is just as good if not better.  Why because it is closer to the novel than the original! people dont get that, the Old one was way off from the novel. ANyway its good and Tim Burton did a credible job, but its Rick Bakers special effcts and make up that make this a masterpiece. 
 Francis Fukuyama, professor at Johns Hopkins University's School for Advanced International Studies, will always be remembered as the one who proclaimed in a book with the same title "The End of History," when liberal democracy and market economics triumphed after the fall of the Berlin Wall.  After being roundly criticized by the critics and by history itself, he has since then qualified his thesis.  He now believes that even though politically and economically we have reached the final destination, so to speak, science will continue to progress and pose new problems.  "Our Posthuman Future" is divided into three parts: the first deals with the latest developments in biotechnology, the second part is a philosophical examination of what it means to be human, and the third part sets forth some policy recommendations for controling some of the potentially dangerous consequences of biotechnology.  Fukuyama looks at the main areas of the biotech revolution that will have an enormous impact on life as we know it.  Neuropharmacologists have created drugs such as Prozac and Ritlin that are being used to control behavioural problems that in the past were solved by self-discipline and concentrated effort.  When human beings are using psychotropic drugs to correct or enhance their behaviours, they are missing out, according to Fukuyama, on critical experiences that make them human.  Genetic engineering also poses some of the most complex and troublesome questions.  Gene alteration could prolong life, create "designer babies," determine sex, physique, and IQ.  On the downside, genetic manipulation could "embed one generation's social preferences," or it could increase inequality if only the rich could afford it.  Imagine a future in which there are rich countries with many people living well over a hundred and poor countries with exploding populations of people whose median age is in the twenties.  The potential for global instability becomes ever greater.  The second part of the book centers on the philosophical problems of human nature and human rights.  Fukuyama argues that in order to oppose these dangerous developments we must return the universal notion of naturalism or natural rights.  Naturalism claims that there is an intrinsic universal human nature and that ethics, and therefore human rights can be derived from it.  Those opposing this view call it the naturalistic fallacy.  (Hume said that we cannot derive an "ought" from an "is.")  Opponents claim that human nature can only be expressed in the context of historically contingent societies.  This is the old nature vs nurture debate, and Fukuyama falls squarely on the side of nature.  If nurture or culture is the defining aspect of human nature then biothech expands unfettered.  Fukuyama claims that human nature is a universal essence - which he conveniently fails to define - from which it is possible not only to understand human dignity, but also to develop a doctrine of human rights.  But how does one defend human nature if it is malleable and alterable?  Science has its own imperatives, business has its own imperatives, and the consumer has his or her own imperatives.  Biotechnology will continue to advance and a static notion of human nature will continue to be tested.  In the final part of the book, Fukuyama recommends a governmental regulatory board that on the one hand must ensure the advancement of science and on the other hand must preserve human dignity.  Societies that are on the verge of a posthuman future need to start debating more seriously what will be allowed and what will be forbidden.  A microcosm of this debate would be the debate on abortion, one side arguing the fetus' right to life and the other side the right of the mother to control her own body.  The debate on future biotech issues will no doubt be equally acrimonious and divisive.  I highly recommend this book as a primer for this debate. 
 I've read some of the negative comments coming from those who purchased the Rich Dad books or audio cd's.  I think many of them come from no real basis at all.  To the one person who commented that it is hard to find a bank that will give you 95% LTV; many if not most banks are in fact doing that. I Got one from GMAC for a property I purchased last year.  In fact I purchased several with 100% financing in the last couple years; so they are out there my friend if you look for them.  For starters get into a good R.E investment club, and if they are worth they're weight they will point you in the right direction.  They aren't expensive, at about 250 to 500/yr average (Don't fall for the scams that will take you for thousands of dollars..), and they generally do a good job of getting you real information you need to take the next step.    For the person who blasted the RD Success Stories, but then went on to say that after reading R.D.P.D he bought 110 properties; well, I guess Kiyosaki's book did help after all now didn't it....  Guys bottom line, Take the books or audio cds for what they are worth, for inspiration and motivation, but your going to have to really get out there and put the work into it which means becoming more "financially literate.." which will help ensure your financial R.E goals.  R.D. is just the start.  Follow up on other educational material that gives you more nuts and bolts of investing. And of course, I cannot stress this enough, if you not involved in a "GOOD" R.E. Investment Club, then get up and find one in your area and start going regularly.  Thats your next starting point on your way to making good R.E. Investments...  Sorry for being longwinded but sometimes it takes detailed words to get the message across.    Good luck, God Bles 
 I am in no way disappointed with Dr. Goudsmit's account of the Alsos project, especially after reading the truly tedious account written by Boris Pash.  For those who do not know the story, Dr. Goudsmit was the foremost nuclear physicist that was not attached to one of the three Manhattan Project labs.  He was sent into Nazi Germany with what amounted to a small special forces team to seek  out the German atomic bomb project and to achieve three goals - report on the progress of the German scientists, bring as many of their physicists and their materials into Allied hands as possible, and discourage the remainder from going over to the Soviets.  There is a mix of humor (radioactive wine!) and deep tragedy (Dr. Goudsmit's parent's house) that make for enthralling reading.  This book, along with "Assault in Norway" and "The Farm Hall Reports" give a first hand account of the threat of atomic energy had it been achieved by the Nazis.  Highly recommended 
 I find Mr. Zacharias work to be very passionate and on the point.  If you look at his background you will see that he was raised in a multi-religous and multi-cultural enviroment.  I think he offers a very unique perspective to western thinkers and has in fact helped me address some questions of my own 
 The quintessential book on the US Central Bank. Mullins has written the most comprehensive book on the Fed extant. As usual he's referred to as an anti-semite. His words must be making someone uneasy. Eustace is a true patriot.  
 This is a lovely book, with breathtaking photos that accompany equally powerful daily written words of "wisdom."  The book is great as a gift for a special person because it is smart, priced well, and very pretty, but it functions on a more meaningful level for those ready to receive its message.  Personally, I think the writings are strong selections of some of the best ideas of the humanities, and I find the book inspiring each and every day 
 This is a series of very readable short papers by a world expert on the history of the Middle East, though there is a certain amount of overlap or repetition in them.  They are divided into three parts: "Past History" (some 250 pages), "Current History" (about 200 pages), and a part about History as a subject and about Islamic historiography (about 70 pages).  One or two of the papers in the first part are perhaps rather specialized for the general reader. Others are  summaries of histories that will not provide much new information to the general public (e.g. on the emergence of Modern Israel).  Newspaper readers will have formed some idea of the differences between the Sunni and the Shi'ites;  the article on the latter gives an exceptionally good account of them.  Some chapters may give information even to people who are rather well informed about the Middle East: I, for instance, found the excellent chapter on Pan-Arabism telling me many things I did not know, among them that, although Egyptians speak Arabic, Pan-Arabists did not initially consider Egypt an Arab country, nor that, until the time of Nasser, did the Egyptians themselves describe themselves as Arabs.  And how many  of even assiduous newspaper readers know anything of the 19th century history of Lebanon, sketched out here in a short article?   The last section has a fascinating paper showing how originally `Turkey' was a western term: the Ottomans used the word `Turk' only as a word denoting an ignorant peasant (and in the West, too, it frequently carried the connotation of 'barbarian'), but not to identify the nature of their empire or of its ruling ethnic group.  Here the Ottomans followed the traditions of Islamic history which never concerned itself with national or ethnic differences.  It is only with the advent of nationalism in the 19th century that the idea of the Turks as a nation  developed in response, first, to the nationalism in the Balkans, then  (rather later) in the Arabic lands, and finally of course, when Turkey proper was all that was left of the Ottoman Empire.     In several of the papers Lewis refers to the almost total lack of interest shown by Islamic countries in the West until the decline of the Ottoman Empire  in the 18th century and the expansion of Western power into the Middle East in the 19th century.  Thereafter patchy efforts to modernize the Islamic world by copying western models, often slowed up by the rejection of western values by conservatives, were only partially successful and failed to stem the advance of western power in the Middle East.  This has greatly contributed to fuelling  the Islamic resentment of the West, which the main theme of the second part of the book.   However, Lewis points out that even the most anti-western regimes have adopted not only western technology, but in many Islamic countries also such institutions as parliaments.  From the western point of view, the role of women in most Islamic countries is still very restricted;  but seen against earlier periods of Islam, women have seen noticeable advances in emancipation and education.   Lewis' analysis of the past is often masterly; but it would have served his reputation as an analyst of future trends better if some of his papers had not been reprinted.  In 1991, after the liberation of Kuwait and Bush Senior's unwillingness to follow this up with the overthrow of Saddam Hussein,  Lewis believed that, since Russia was unable and the USA unwilling to play an imperial role in the Middle East, the governments there `will be able to make their own decisions'.  An article first published in 1996, still before the second Gulf War, describes as a `most telling indication of the new era' the fact that the West was no longer interested in bringing about regime change in the Middle East.  In 1991 Lewis did not foresee the oil-thirst of China and India and opined that `the West will more easily find other sources of energy than the oil-producing states can find other cash customers.'   On the other hand, some older papers anticipate much that has become common currency later: in a 1957 paper, Lewis several times uses the phrase and the concept of `A Clash of Civilizations' to explain the tensions between Islam and the West, a full forty years before the publication of Samuel Huntingdon's famous book of the same title.  Astonishingly accurate, too, is the forecast in 1969, when Nasser was still President, that his successor might very well make peace with Israel - which Sadat did ten years later.  In one fascinating lecture Lewis asks (and answers) the question why the Arab-Israeli conflict attracts so much more world interest than the many inter-Arab and inter-Muslim conflicts, some of which have involved oppression, casualties and suffering on a far greater scale than in all the Arab-Israeli disputes put together.  The book is pervaded by Lewis' empathetic understanding of all sides  in the Middle East.  That does not mean that he cannot be very forthright in his judgments, as in his attitude to fanaticism, in his regret at a number of features of Islamic history and society,  or in his description of the double standards that have become habitual at the United Nations, exemplified by the 1975 condemnation of Zionism as a form of racism, a resolution supported by a number of nations and groups who use anti-Zionism as a cloak for their own racist antisemitism.  The official Arab media, after all,  then as now, propagated the Protocols of the Elders of Zion and published cartoons that could have come straight out of the pages of the Stï¿½rmer.    Such criticisms has in recent years made Lewis the subject of some obloquy  in the world of Islam, but the Arabic translator of one of his books described him as either a candid friend or an honourable enemy; and Lewis writes, 'I am content to abide by that judgment.'

 Absolutely one of the best books I've ever read to my children.  There is nothing "cookie cutter" about Tacky - and his individuality makes him stand out in the most endearing way.  My sons asked for this one over and over again, and it was often the one they'd choose for me to read to their class on our reading day.  I think they related to Tacky!  Every child should hear this one -- they'll just love Tacky, too 
 Nussbaum's persuasive arguments altered my position on human rights in that I was able to see new possibilities for all men and women. Her many perspectives on human rights were so well-documented that I have used her books, "Sex and Social Justice" and "Women and Human Development," as textbooks and sources to support my thoughts when writing papers and having conversations on subjects that have ranged from early child development to global poverty. Her capabilities approach to issues of gender equality are supremely encouraging. If you are looking for a scholarly text that encompasses multi-faceted, intelligent viewpoints, I recommend Martha C. Nussbaum's books 
 I am a jazz guitarist who once had the mind-jolting experience of jamming with Pearl Django's guitarist Neil Anderson. The beautifully-constructed and angular solos were astonishing and I could hear the tell-tale influence of Django on his playing. Years later, one of my students showed me this recording - New Metroplotitan Swing - and I was anxious to hear Neil's band (I'd not even realized they had recorded). The music on this disc is infectious and swinging throughout. I played it over and over again. The original compositions were strong and the choice of covers fitting. The surprise here is that the other guitarist in the band is a strong soloist as well, and his Charlie Christian-inspired solos compliment Neil's work. I recommend this recording to others whole-heartedly! A particular favorite of mine is the band's treatment of "Stardust", where they manage to reinvent swing music with a passion 
 This is one of the most comprehensive collection of womenrockers known to the planet.  Nothing like this exists for the womenpunkers and the artists on the fringe.  If you think your undergroundbecause you can understand HOLE or L7, well you've got some research to do.  I know i speak for all of us who have read the book when i say "Hurry...up and publish vol. 2!" (scheduled for fall 2001 
 This album is a priceless gem that you will treasure forever! Sam Cooke metaphorically rolls up his sleeves and really works up a sweat in this amazing live concert at the Harlem Square Club, giving an earthy, gritty performance that is spellbinding.  Sam's delivery crackles with raw energy! He belts out the songs with an emotional intensity and sense of urgency that whips his audience into euphoric frenzy.   Some favourite, well-loved songs (such as "Cupid," "Chain Gang," "Bring it on Home to Me," etc.) have been thumpingly and effectively re-worked to give them an edginess which causes the temperature to soar in that highly charged, festive atmosphere.   You can feel the electricity in the air! Sam teases and cajoles an attentive and adoring audience who eagerly comply with the call to party. The tempo intensifies and reaches a crescendo at the end of a totally exhilarating and riveting musical experience!     
 Even if you don't know who he is(YOU SHOULD !!!) This is a great read from start to finish. If you do and are a fan like me. You will have a great smile on your mug from the very 1st page to the last. Impossible to put down. I cried a few tears when it was over because I didn't want it to be over. Thank you Mr.Campbell for been so open and caring in the way you wrote this book. Warts and all. I've followed your career since Evil Dead and always watched that CHIN in any movie it was shown. I always knew I would be entertained. Hail to the King  BABY 
 This book saved me when I has having chemotherapy and ended up with constant insomnia. I had not read about that as a side effect of breast cancer treatments until this book which has a good discussion of drugs usually used to treat breast cancer. I had read LOTS of books prior to my treatment and only this one mentioned drugs used to treat insomnia. If hadn't of known, I probably would still be staring at the ceiling ALL NIGHT wondering what the heck was going on!!! 
 Maybe I shouldn't admit this, but I first heard the Subways on the O.C. on Fox.  I wasn't quite sure what to make of them and since I can't stand the radio, the only way I could really find out if I liked the album was to buy it (I don't P2P and samples don't always give me enough information).  What I discovered was that the Subways are not original, but they are very entertaining.  They fit very well into a playlist with bands like the Vines (who are one of my favorite bands) and The Von Bonies (certain songs on Pawn Shoppe Heart). Good pop mentality from the band without the trappings of a specific style like garage, punk, or alternative. They skirt the line well and I enjoy it 
 I am taking it that the previous reviewer did not ascertain the function and meaning of this work.  This is an advanced magical grimoire that explores the realms of the Qlippotic.  It is a post-Babalon, post-Choronzon, post-HGA interjection of the Left Hand Path.  Ford's work, in many ways, is perhaps the best example of a generated antinomian current I have come across.  It is meant to bolster the individual and quicken the powers of the self in preparation for darker "outer" experience.  This work is the spiritual scion of the Sinister Tradition and A.O. Spare's Zos Kia Cultus.  The hardback edition is due to release on 6/6, FYI.  Fra:.Du'al-Karnain  
 I had picked up "Atlas Shrugged" for a bookclub discussion but was afraid that I wouldn't be able to finish it in time for it, so I bought "Anthem" on the recommendation of my friend who will be moderating the discussion. Like everyone in here said, it's a very short read. It is also a compelling and interesting read. It reminded me so much of "1984" and "The Handmaid's Tale" by Margaret Atwood ~~ that one is probably my favorite horror story (I am talking about realistic futuristic novels that "could happen" if things keep up the way they're going ... not the traditional horror stories that Stephen King is the master of!). "Anthem" is just as scary to me as the "Handmaid's Tale" is.   The main character is a street sweeper when he longs to be one of the intellectuals. He discovers something underneath the earth and started on a passage in life where he explores not only the discovery that he had found, but also a discovery in his soul, that the leaders of his world claims that he doesn't have. It is a "We" society ~~ there is no "I" among them. If there is, they're usually executed in order not to spread the contagion to the rest of the population. It is a dark book. It is a fearful book. It is a book that tells a story of what can happen if you start denying people's individualities. It is a thought-provoking book and one that is also a keeper in my library.   This one ranks right up there with Orwell's book, Atwood's and Ray Bradbury's books as well. It's a challenge for people to keep thinking and reading and exploring new philosophies and thoughts ... and this book definitely gained my respect for Ayn Rand and her philosophy.   3-1-0 
 Down and Out in Paris & London is a very vivid read. I found it funny and heartbreaking at the same time.  I walked the streets and felt the hunger and cold with the charaters.   
 After forty some odd years, I finally see the light thanks to this eye-opener!  Whereas I used to believe that prisons were places of punishment for people that chose to victimize others, and therefore were not only useful but also morally justifiable, I see now that prisons are merely places designed by society to clip the wings of those free-spirited individuals who simply do not wish to be bound by the laws of man!   I once saw an individual beat an elderly tourist, rip her purse from her shoulder, and flee....and I did what is now inconceivable to me: I called the police!  Now, this poor guy is probably suffering in prison somewhere right now, maybe even without cable TV!!  Oh, but that I could turn back the hands of time!  If I could go back, I would gladly furnish an exculpatory  statement for this poor guy!  People, left to their own devices, are NEVER evil!  Any thinking person knows that if prisons were abolished today crime would probably disappear anyway, because the only reasons that people commit crimes is because of mean prison guards.  Let's say that someone happened to be a pedophile, and they came to kidnap your child.... you should realize that just because this person may succeed in taking your child, removing him/her to a secluded place and torturing them for days before killing them in the most horrible manner imaginable, that putting the perpetrator in prison is not right!  I mean, people nowadays are so stupid as to believe that putting these people in prison to be picked at by mean correctional officers is somehow warranted just because a child was tortured and killed mercilessly!  Come on, people, WAKE UP!  If we could only be more understanding, the world could be a Utopia beyond our imagination.  What we REALLY need to do is start putting crime victims in jail and see how THEY like it!   
 Great Band at the top of their game.  Great Set, one of the better live sets of the Allman Brothers Band.  But I have a bone to pick with the producers of the CD. The opening two cuts, I Don't Want You No More and Its Not My Cross to Bear are one song.  The Brothers blended them into each other in a seamless wonder that was inspirational.  What did the producers do?  They chopped up these two songs.  I had to buy the original album and record them on the computer to preserve the artists original recording.  This was irritating and shows that the producers were more interested in conformity than artistic intent.  Grrrrrrr.  End of rant. 
 I had never got around to reading any P.G. Wodehouse until I read this volume, and now I regret the delay.   My first exposure to Wodehouse, at least the first I can remember, was the great Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie (better known from "Black Adder" and "House") TV series "Jeeves and Wooster". That series, plus a few artsy articles on Wodehouse (for example this one by Christopher Hitchens [...] ), turned my Wodehouse radar on.  Even though the world of butlers and aristocratic drones in the 1920s may as well be life of the Siberian Steppes to us web connected suburbanites, the human comedy never really changes. It was the Jeeves and Wooster stories, not "Seinfeld", that was the original "show about nothing."   Every story starts from a minor mishap that turns into major mayhem, requiring the sagacious Jeeves to slide in and rescue his well meaning but social accident prone patron from the self induced quagmire.   This is humour that is sympathetic to all the parties involved. As such it is a pleasant change from the rude brood of "cruder than thou" comedies that has dominated mainstream TV / movie comedy from both England and America for most of the last dozen years. My guess is that generation of young media consumers has grown up that know no humour other than the stick it someone else variety. Not to say there is anything wrong with that, it's just the monotony of it all that I am tired of.  Bring back Wodehouse 
 this book is execellent. i used during my first year of architecture in 2003 and was able to help me perfectly. i still use the book today as a reference. on thing about dr. ching is that he draws everything in the book. everything except the text is done by hand. seen...... 
 If your a first timer looking for great tips, tricks & wisdom, take a look at this book offered in Apple computers small business edition 6500/250 Power PC. They threw this book in for first timers, it's a  godsend. I love it 
 It can only be described as miraculous that Ballard survived what he wrote about in this thinly-disguised autobiography. At least twice he nearly starved to death. One of the ways he did survive was to detach himself from all of the horrors he witnessed--disease, starvation, murder, executions. And he was all of 11 years old. Yet, watching an interview with Ballard on TV once, he said, for all of what he went through, he rather still enjoyed himself, saying that he thrived on change. This book is simply amazing. It is relentingly horrifying, though

 That this book is a classic should come as a surprise to no one, so my reveiw is strictly based on the audio version. I first read this novel years ago but recently listened to the tapes on a long car ride with my children. The reader did an excellent job and the story kept us all interested. I recommend this as a great way for a family to share a classic. 
 My nine year old daughter received this keyboard from "Santa", and was very happy with her present. The illuminating lights on the keyboard make it easy to see the proper keys to press with the songs, it is lightweight and easy for her to carry around,and it has nice sound quality for the relatively inexpensive price. My only complaint is that it doesn't come with a stand, but I would still recommend it for beginners. Brandon Faircloth Rio Rico, Az 
 I have to say I am a fan of Chris Elliott and have watched him in many different shows and movies and always liked his kind of down-trodden sarcastic wit, and I think Get A Life was a great example of his odd talents in the later episodes. The earlier episodes that are available on DVD (all 8) are not really the best examples of his work. They are funny but the later episodes with "Gus", "Larry", and "Sharon" crack me up. I am tired of seeing this limited run of only a few select early episodes available through DVD, it's time to release the rest or at least a few more...I mean if shows like "Saved by the Bell" can be a box set on DVD then I think the flood gates have been opened. Release the rest of the Episodes Rhino, what are you waiting for? 
 I liked her last book (Murder Uncorked), but this book was great.  I couldn't put this one down till I finished reading it.  The comedy in it is pretty much directed towards gay men or women, but I think that everyone can enjoy this book.    One of the things that I enjoy most about this one is that the pacing is better and it makes it much more suspenseful.  Get it, read it, and tell a friend(oh and it doesnt hurt to have a glass of wine 
 I have read all of Deborah Crombies series of Kincaid and Gemma.  Again, I like the British Mystery's and although Crobie is an American, her writing is excellent and her grasp of the English style is great.  Look forward to each book 
 A Kind Of Magic is similar to The Works (84) and The Game (80) where there are a number of great tracks and several good tracks without ever rising to the unique greatness of some of their earlier efforts from the 70's. It keeps the rock that was rediscovered on The Works and turns it up a notch for most of the tracks.  1. One Vision is a great song released as a stand alone single after Live Aid in 85. It appears here as somewhat of a bonus track. 2. A Kind Of Magic is one of Queen's best. Written by Roger, Brian's guitar work is awesome. He got an award from the Queen for it. 3. One Year Of Love is a nice ballad written by John. A single in some countries. 4. Pain Is So Close To Pleasure is a good solid track without being a great one. 5. Friends Will Be Friends is also a good track. Nothing new on offer here, just an inoffensive run of the mill pop songs. 6. Who Wants To Live Forever is a great track. Good orchestral work and a nice Brian vocal intro. Freddie sings all the vocals in the Highlander version. I would love to hear the full version of that. 7. Gimme The Prize is a heavy rocker (one of Queen's heaviest). Would be better if it didn't have exerts from the movie though. 8. Don't Lose Your Head is probably the weakest track on the album. Run of the mill stuff, sounds a bit like a B Side track. 9. Princes Of The Universe is one of Queen's all time best. Hard rocking and unique. The opening is brilliant.  A solid album, but with all their 80's albums it seems like they were writing for radio, not for breaking new ground like in their early days. I guess it was a sign of the times.  Ranking wise it sits in the middle below Queen 2, above A Night At The Opera. 
 great book, i've read all ten they never get old. (can't wait till her next one comes out!) This is a really great book for anyone who believes in rebirth. katharine kerr portrays it wonderfully as well as giving magic a more realistic look. Over all a great adventure and a very touching story of love. She really gives the term "sole mates" a new spin

 Cornelius Tacitus was born ca. A.D. 56 and died around 115. He had a senatorial career and became consul in 97 and governor of Asia from 112-113. In 77, Tacitus married the daughter of Agricola, governor of Roman Britain. Tacitus wrote The Agricola as a sort of eulogy for his father-in-law, and in it he recounts Agricola's career. Tacitus also wrote The Germania, in which he provides a colorful description of the indigenous tribes of Germany during the time of the Roman Empire.There is something to be said of the style with which Tacitus writes, and that is to say that his accounts of Agricola and Germania are full of wit. However, there are some problems when analyzing Tacitus as a factual source. For one, he is constantly making social commentaries about the declining role of the Senate in the affairs of the Roman Empire. In addition, Tacitus makes claims about territories that it is difficult to determine if he would actually have been able to visit and study. Therefore, one must think of his analysis of these areas as being hearsay. For instance, in The Germania, he discusses tribes of northern Germany where there was not much communication or contact. However, one cannot look past the value of this work, for although biased, it does offer insight into the way the Romans viewed the frontier and the frontier peoples. Up until archaeological discoveries, the works of Tacitus and toehr Roman historians was all the world knew of the indigenous "barbaric" peoples of Europe. However, as excavations reveal more flourishing pre-Roman cultures in Europe, Tacitus' claims may be validated or viewed as being culturally biased, uninformed and imaginative. However, as a primary source, his view of Roman Britain remains an essential part of the study of Classical Rome 
 I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it, but I am a birdwatcher.  The history of birdwatching and birding were very interesting for a novice birder such as myself. The author's descriptions of each of the competitors were right on.  You could almost see Greg Miller sweating and the look of disgust on Kimoto's peers' faces when he was sitting be the fire in Autu and letting everyone else do all the work.  This is definetely one for the bookshelf 
 This is an excellent, excellent text. Techniques and principles for building high performance distributed systems are hard to come by except through experience and talking to experts. There's a lot of knowledge in the community but this book is the first time to my knowledge that someone has collected it and presented it in a coherent framework. Even if you don't work with low level stuff, this book will help you learn to think in a "systemsy" way about high-performance designs 
 These knives are amazing!  The storage case is even pretty handy and you can just put in a drawer and not have to worry about the knives poking around.  They are fun to use!  THe gusto grip is great for those "messy" choppers (like me), no more knife slipping incidents and no more cutting myself for that same reason

 This covers the science of beauty, and explains why we say "that's hot!" to someone. Great statistics presented in an exciting way.  I used this book for a college paper on attraction and mating  --  and have given it to several girlfriends since then for flattery!!  
 All puns aside, this book almost had me winking myself to see if I could create coincidences in my life, or the lives of those around me.  I couldn't.  But I never knew that when such things occur, it is simply God winking.  Now I also stand stalwart in the belief that thunder is simply God moving his furniture, that rain is God crying, that lightning is God trying to strike dead all the blasphemers and that...well, I haven't yet found a purpose for God's sneezes or other bodily functions yet.  But, give me time.  What a wonderful book.  Thank you 
 This book and Joseph Alleine's "An alarm to the unconverted" are must read books for all those who seek to be faithful witnesses for Christ in this day and age. The puritan's preached a pure gospel-not the modern gospel.  This book is top shelf!  Paul Greenwood (... 
 all college students should watch st. elmos fire and all 80's babies should get the soundtrack to remind them the good ol days 
 There's not much to explain with this kind of movie.  Japanese horror films don't just limit to real actors, but also towards animation.  I'm sure many of you would relate this (if you are an anime fan) to a series called Paranoia Agent or (if you are a gaming fan) to the hospital levels on various "Silent Hill" video games produced by Konami.  The scenery, the character development, and even the storyline fazed all of my senses into a horror that I haven't felt since I was seven years old watching "Are you Afraid of the Dark?" on Nickelodeon.  This is a scarefest YOU HAVE to see.  The relationship between this movie and (from what I can tell) Silent Hill and Paranoia agent is definetely the unsettling environment.  Whoever did the music is just as much a genious as Akira Yamaoka.  Unlike Silent Hill, however, there are no demonic creatures or deep storylines of death and agony.  Instead, this movie is more like Paranoia Agent (by Geneon Entertainment).  The series involves a more mental aspect of unsettling environments especially in the character development department.  These are stressed out people who have a suicide victim on their hands.    As for the movie's scare factor... DEFINETELY DO NOT WATCH THIS IN THE DARK!!!  The creator of The Grudge and The Ring definetely put a lot of hard work into the creation of this film.  If this film would EVER be adapted to an American film, it had better stick to the original storyline and original plot theme.  Christopher Gans almost had it with Silent Hill, but Roger Avery's "Witch" ending didn't make sense, and most of the questions answered on the first game are not in the movie.  Infection's twisted story plot and engrossing plot theme made the movie a 4 star, but it didn't have good enough acting... leaving a star out.  However, it's Japanese acting, so it doesn't surprise me too much.  I was satisfied with all of the suicidal anguish that puts Requiem of a Dream to shame.  If you want a frightfest and don't mind Japanese subs (like anime, it's better with subs), then TOTALLY get this movie and ENJOY IT.  Don't be frustrated with subtitles.  If you can't read, it's probably because you're to scared of the chick using herself as a pincushion practicing stabbing herself with needle.  
 +++++  This easy-to-read book by philosophy lecturer, editor, and author Dr. Stephen Law presents to the reader "25 short adventures in thinking."  In other words, this book is a short course in "thinking philosophically."  Each of the twenty-five chapters or essays addresses a different philosophical question, "explaining key positions and arguments along the way."  What are the philosophical questions and topics discussed?  Below, I will divide the essays into categories and give the question or topic addressed.  (Note the order of the essays presented here is different from that in the book):  (1) Logic  (i) Eight everyday reasoning errors. (An error in reasoning is called a fallacy.) (ii) Seven paradoxes in reasoning. (Presented are plausible arguments leading to seemingly implausible conclusions.)  (2) Morality  (i) Is gay sex morally permissible? (ii) Can we have morality without God and religion? (iii) Is it morally acceptable to design children genetically? (iv) Is it right to sacrifice the life of one conjoined twin to save the other? (v) Is it morally acceptable to eat meat? (vi) Is the rightness or wrongness of an act based on our emotional reactions to the act?  (3) God  (i) Does God exist? (ii) Is creationism scientific? (iii) Miracles and the supernatural. (iv) Where did the universe come from?  (4) Consciousness  (i) Could a machine think? (ii) Are you just a brain in a vat? (iii) Is consciousness something impossible for science to explain? (iv) What's essential as far as being you is concerned? (v) How do you know that there are other minds?  (5) Expectations  (i) Why expect the sun to rise tomorrow? (ii) Should we ever expect to be punished?  (6) Truth  (i) Is there such a thing as the absolute truth to any question? (ii) Are mathematics and its truths ultimately made by us?  (7) Puzzles  (i) What is meaning, exactly? (ii) What is knowledge? (iii) Is time travel possible? (iv) What is art, exactly?  These essays can be read in any order desired.  In other words, you don't have to read the essays in the order indicated in the table of contents.  Their level of difficulty is indicated at the beginning of each essay.  Suggestions for further reading (including internet sites) can be found at the end of each essay.  This book also incorporates a variety of styles.  There are dialogues, philosophical stories and thought experiments, illustrations (many of which I felt were not necessary), and sections called "thinking tools" to explain key philosophical ideas.  (These thinking tool sections, are, in my opinion, a major highlight of this book.)  Be aware that these essays are not the definitive answers to the questions posed above but only reflect Law's views.  If you find yourself disagreeing with the author's views in any essay (as I did), then that's good and is a "healthy sign."  It means that Law has done his job of stimulating your thinking.  Remember this is not an "answer" book but is a "thinking" book.  I also felt that the brief introduction that has the sections "What is Philosophy," "Applying Philosophy to Life," and "Other Reasons to Think Philosophically" was excellent.  Be sure to read these sections first.  I felt an absolute beginner to philosophy might have trouble with this book.  This is because major argumentative terms like premise, conclusion, counterargument, etc. are not defined at the beginning but are defined as you get further into the book.  A brief glossary would have alleviated this problem.  As well, the logic essay on "Eight everyday reasoning errors" should, I feel, be the first essay in this book.  (Instead it is essay number 24).  In this way, the reader can get practice in trying to determine whether any of the essays presented have these errors.  My recommendation is to read this essay first after reading the above introductory sections.  In one essay, Law's conclusion is that "what creationists practise isn't good science-it's bunk."  I felt this conclusion as stated was too harsh and may offend some.  Law uses some knowledge gained from science in some of his essays.  Yet he does not reference his sources.  I thought this was a major oversight.  Finally, this book is not just an introductory text.  It can be effectively read by those who have some prior philosophy background (like myself).  In conclusion, for a good and stimulating intellectual workout, this is the book to read!!

 If the world weren't what it is today, I wouldn't have believed that this movie describes a scenario that could happen. But at a time when everything that it means to be American has been tossed in the trash can in the name of the "war on terror," this movie is much more plausible now than when it was made 
 A fascinating review of an often overlooked subject that is long overdue.  I knew the Italian Air Force fought with bravery and tenacity during the war, but had no idea they had produced over 50 pilots who scored five or more victories!  Not only do the authors, Giorgio Apostolo and Giovanni Massimello, give the reader an overview of the war, but also organization of the air force by wings (Stormos).  A Stormo analysis consists of breakdowns by Gruppos (Groups) and Squadriglie (Squadrons).  Also a Squadriglie by Squadriglie review of types flown, the Fiat G.50 and G.55, also the Fiat G.32 and G.42 series, the last biplanes flown in the war!  And fighter types produced by Macchi and Reggiane.  Tragically, we learn of the executions of pilots who flew "up north" for the Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana, or ANR, by their fellow Italian citizens as reprisals after the war had ended because they had sided with Mussolini.  The color profiles are superb, as we have come to expect from this series, 40 different fighters flown by the aces.  My only complaint is the lack of color profiles concerning pilot uniforms and flying garb, but judging by the photos,(many never before seen), the Italian pilots wore whatever was comfortable for the theater of operations at the time.  In closing, a "must have" for any modeller or historian 
 Lost in the Funhouse can be a very bewildering and irritating collection if you aren't in the right mood for it.  If you aren't well-versed in post-modern fiction (barthelme, calvino, etc are good reference points) you might want to start somewhere else first.  Even Barth's novels are more immediately digestible.  With that said, though, this collection doesn't really operate on one consistent level.  Perhaps this is because many of these stories were written by Barth much earlier in his career.  The three stories concerning Ambrose's birth and development are very straightforward and enjoyable on a surface level until the whole series goes flying into left-field with the titular "Lost in the Funhouse" story (which Barth is probably most known for).  From that point on, most of the stories are more about the process of writing and the relationship between the reader, writer, and the characters.  Stories like "Title" and "Life-Story" work more as essays on the nature of fiction than actual works of fiction, and were (for me at least) a little tedious.  The best moments occur when Barth combines his thoughful analysis on the nature of writing and art with a really good ground-situation, typically based on Greek mythology.  The best of these are the utterly raunchy "Petitition" and the labyrinthine "Menelaiad".  Taken as a whole, though, Lost in the Funhouse is greatly satisfying, even if (like me) you really only understood about 20% of what Barth was talking about on your first read-through.  It's the sort of book I'll go back to again and again to try and delve deeper into the mystery of the funhouse while appreciating all over the hilarious bawdy humor.  Oh, and make sure to read Barth's seven additional notes at the front of the book (though maybe only after you've read the story that is being discussed in each note, so as not to ruin the initial experience)-- they really help to clarify some of Barth's intentions.  I can't even imagine appreciating a story like "Glossolalia" without having read the note concerning it 
 This is one of the few books my son still loves after reading for almost a year.  I first showed it to my child when he was about 6 months and he liked it right away, now he's 18 months and he likes it even better whereas many other books have fallen to the wayside. The drawings are enjoyable to both the infant and toddler group.  When he was young we focused on the animals and their noises, now we are focusing on the tractors and engines, and explaining where food comes from etc.  It's a great book 
 I was lucky enough to get both this book and Getting Things Done by Dave Allen. Together they helped me t boost my productivity by 200% and do it stress free!   You won't regret the investment in yourself 
 Although a little on the introductory side, I really enjoyed this book. I am a researcher in botany areas and I can say that the author does a great job at describing and aiding to identify and separate useful plants from obnoxious look-alikes. Somebody here suggested that the book could be organized in some hierarchical form. That is equivalent of a botanical taxonomy key. It would be great but there are keys for the purpose of organizing the info and helping to pick plants apart. I don't think it is essential here. Somebody else said that the pretty drawings are only on the cover... is there a more literal analog of "judging the book by its cover"? While the drawings inside are black and white they serve the purpose. They are very well drawn and they are useful in identifying the plant in question. Tha author is also very conscientious and will not hesitate to say he doesn't know something and advices caution when pertinent. Excellent job. The bottom line: it is very interesting, well organized and it sparks your curiosity. And if you wish to have a deeper treaty on any particular topic or plant you can always refer to a more specialized publication. $15? You can't go wrong 
 This is an excellent collection of essays on various aspects and interpretations of Tolkein's Lord of the Rings.   I would first like to highlight some of the high points of specific essays and then highlight some of the overarching conceptualization of Tolkein's themes.   C.S. Lewis offers an excellent essay on the Dethronement of Power which explains in as clear a manner as I have ever read, the Christian philosophical underpinning and explanation as to the corrupting nature of power. Why does power corrupt? Lewis asserts that all earthly power is illusion and frail in comparison to the source of all true power, which he sees as God. Thus, when given access to this force, even when intentions are good, the power corrupts because it is not in the hands of its rightful owner, God in Heaven. Whether one believes or does not believe this concept, it does correspond with Tolkein's world view expressed in the Lord of the Rings.  W. H. Auden's essay on the Quest Hero resonates with the works of Joseph Campbell especially when he analyzes the concept of the heroic friendship, using Frodo and Sam as the example. Auden links the heroic quest to the quest of all human beings for transcendence. He sees human nature as a nature continually in quest of itself, 'obliged at every moment to transcend what it was a moment before'.   Two essays, written separetely by Rose Zimbardo and Patricia Meyer Spacks deal with the relationship between moral vision, meaning in existence, and the embedded existence in a moral universe. A moral universe is one that reveals God's signature and unveils the infinite good news that GOd plays an active role in the universe and the conditions of men. Thus a pre-Christian universe in Tolkein's vision, would be one in which God plays a major role upon the universal stage, much like the conception of the Universe established in the Old Testament as conceptualized by religious Jews. This world, expressed by St. Augustus, is one in which nothing is created evil, in fact evil is good that has been perverted. This world view also then brings up the issue of individual reponsibility which is thus seen not only as to one's own individual integrity but is a cosmic integrity. This responsibility is justified by the existence of some vast unnamed power for good.  Marion Bradley writes a compelling essay on the relationships embedded in the text, focusing on Merry and Pippin; Eowyn and Arwen; and ending with a superb analysis of the friendship between Frodo and Sam.  Verlyn Fleiger writes of the vast differences in heroic behavior between Aragorn and Frodo. Read this essay after reading the Auden essay since they deal with similar themes.  Patrick Grant does a superb job of interpreting Lord of the Rings from a Jungian perspective, acknowleding that the work can not be totally rendered or reduced into Jungian terms and concepts. Grant demonstrated both mastery of Jung and Tolkein and I felt Grant actually had enough concepts packed into one essay that he could have written a book. I especially liked the point that Frodo was on an inner quest of individuation and that certain characters were excellent examples of Jungian archtypes, such as Gollum as the Shadow; Galdriel as the Anima; Gandlaf as the Wise Old Man; Aragorn as the Heroic King; and Shelob as the dark Anima. Grant however also integrates Milton into the analysis and points out the theme of the Christian epic in which the true hero is on a spiritual quest, growing in faith and hope which is based on charity.  Grant also points out the realm of fairie is the realm of dream and myth where interior journeys through the psyche occur, stabilized by archetypal structures. Jung used the term 'enantidromia' to mean that evil leads to good. Grant points out that this concept resonates in Tolkein's work.  Jung saw man's quest as individuation, the realization of the whole man. Jung also realized that great darkness could arise from the psyche and that numinous, impressive, dangerous archetypes rise from the unconscious. Thus archtypical characters of good have a corresponding archetypal character of darkness; an example being the fellowship of the ring balanced by the Ringwraiths; or Gandalf by Saruman.  Tom Shippey is the final essay with a wonderful defense of the film trilogy with which I agree 100%.   Some themes flowed throughout the essays. These included the quest of the hero, the moral universe, and linking Lord of the Rings to historic facts and forces.  Whereas all the authors related that Tolkein hated allegory, there were certainly linkages bwteeen Mordor and the blight of the industrial revolution as well as Tolkein's experiences in World War I and the gloom of Nazism and Communism.  Several essayist quoted the wonderful timeless lines when Frodo says: I wish it need not have happened in my time, to which Gandalf says "So do I...and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide."   Very well written and clear, these essays offered comprehensive interpretations of Tolkein's great work 
 I have no problem with the review presented by "A Reader" but the paperback version of the book presents some physical problems. First, the illustrations are not in color and would, in fact, be considered poorly done if they were printed on newsprint. This detracts significantly from the pleasure of reading the book. Secondly, a number of pages display small areas of missing ink. The resulting dropped characters are quite annoying. There apparently is a cloth edition (at least the ISBN is shown) and that may be the source of the previous review 
 As part of the Dover Thrift Editions, this is a very affordable look into Stoic philosophy and insight into one of the emperors of the Roman Empire.  As with most books from this collection, there is around 100 pages of text and no more.  Rather than reading like a story, these are aphorisms, which are more or less grouped into similar subject matter, but if you want to get the most out of it, you should aim for reading, at most, a couple at a time to really reflect on what Aurelius is saying.  An example would be number 15 from Book VII, "Whatever any one does or says, I must be good, just as if the emerald (or the gold or the purple) were always saying "Whatever any one does or says, I must be emerald and keep my color."  This is a very profound and pithy saying.  To get the full effect, think about what this is saying and how it applies to us and our doings.  Reading many of these in a row would just blur them together.  I would recommend this as a reference for helping to reflect on our lives 
 March, and Spring is whispering thoughts of renaissance in gardens whether blanketed by snow or refreshed by showers in milder climates.  And one of the gentlest harbingers of the end of sleep is the beauty in observing the slow budding of leaves on the many varieties of Japanese Maples.  This very informative book, lavish with superb color photography, is not only indispensable to those for whom the Japanese Maple is a hallowed member of the garden, but also for those whose eyes have appreciated their beauty in neighbors' environments and have been bewildered by the many species from which to choose.  Japanese Maples are lovely trees at all points of the year: even in winter there are those that leafless bear a blood red bark and those whose bark is chartreuse, as though change of season will not deny their importance as trees of color.  But the various species with their spectrum of leaves from pink through burgundy to variegated to pale or dark green hues have specific requirements and demands and affinities for shade or light and this book outlines these differences and, further, illustrates the placement of the varying species in gardens that appear global.  Whether the reader is interested in simply magnificent photography of unique trees or in need of some guidance as to their placement and care, this is as fine a book as is available on the subject. Recommended.  Grady Harp, March 0 
 I had to read this book when I was in 7th grade and I really didn't care for it  and after I read through it I forgot all about it. Luckily I accidentally kept it and didn't return it because years later I came across it and I decided to give it another chance. I'm glad I did because it's a good adventure book that will keep you interested the whole time. This book has everything from buried treasure, pirates, fighting, sailing on the open seas and  drinking rum. This is a book for both children and adults looking for adventure and a way to escape their everyday life.  
 With all the countless references and easy-to-read diagrams illustrating key dimensions for almost any type or category of use, this book is an architect's Bible. It's not only a useful reference, but this one is a joy to read at one's own leisurely time! Must buy 
 I just finished reading this brilliant work. I was in Eastern Europe in 1991-1993 and saw the refugees coming out of Bosnia. I followed the story as close as I could, even visting a refugee camp. But Sacco's illustrations put me on the ground in the supposed safe zones. The brutality of the supposedly Christian Serbs to Muslim Bosnians is so overwheliming it makes any beheadings in Iraq look like a birthday party in comparison.  The book also does a nice job giving the history of the war, including the role Clinton played, for those who don't remember the 1990s. Please rread this book. You can do it in a day 
 The intricacy of the cut-outs is stunning; the artistry of the whole book is amazing. My son loved this book when he received it as an Xmas gift.  We will enjoy it every year for years to come, I am certain 
 I remember when Troop's first album had 3 hits, especially the ultra funky Mamacita, My Heart and the gorgeous, smooth ballad Still In Love. But this was the setting point for their better selling second effort.  The rest of the songs are just as strong and the group has some strong vocals and harmonies. While Gerald Levert and his handlers produced this effort, Steve Russell would later produce the group's songs on later albums, giving Troop some more creativity.  Troop's album came when New Edition's Heartbreak was a huge hit, but they gave NE some stiff competition musically with this effort. One of 1988's overlooked albums, but worth listening to again.  
 Elizabeth Barrett Browning's poems are heartfelt and sincere. The devotion and loyalty she showed her husband was extraordinary, and this compilation  of her poems are just a mere example of how much she loved him. Mushy or  not, this book moved me to tears 
 Although Charles Samuels wrote the book up while Keaton told him stories from his life, Keaton's voice really holds true to Keaton's voice which can be heard in other documentary films and interviews.  I initially read this book while I was at film school working on my practicum film and I could really relate to the producer and studio interference that he talks about in the book as I was facing the same things from professors.  I really felt like I got a glimpse into his psyche! It is an enjoyable and interesting read that comes off well. I wish that Stan Laurel had come out with his autobiography.  You have to remember that Keaton wasn't always truthful in the book. He fudges some of the details about his marriages and out and out lies about how his father died. He claims he was run down by a street car or something when it's been proven that he died after suffering from a brain disease. But hey, people lie in their autobiographies all the time right 
 I am going to give Mr. White a Mulligan on this one.  As mentioned in the author's notes, Mr. White spent a lot of his time writing this book while in public libraries, around the country. He was also dealing with the endless paperwork that goes with insurance companies, reconstruction and FEMA.  The damage done to his area of Florida is evident in the novel, through Doc's eyes.  This novel does give Doc Ford a new dimension.  He is thumped in a dock fight early in the novel.  Later in the novel Doc gives in to Tomlinson's "Seven Mile Bridge" weed in an attempt to ease the headaches he is suffering from as a result of a concussion suffered during the hurricane.  Also there is the introduction of ghosts or supernatural into this novel.  I found this to be an interesting diversion from the usual plots of Mr. White's Ford novels.  Reminded me of some of the works of James Lee Burke.  All in all, if you are looking for your first Doc Ford novel, this is not the one I would recommend with which to begin.  But, if you are a Doc Ford fan, this one cannot be passed by, either 
 Dostoevsky is one of the best. Some people get a little lost with his philosophy but I find him very insightful. Often I see his ideas in todays movies and TV shows. He has had a bigger impact with his writing then many people realise. I would rate this his second best surpased only by "The Brothers Karamazov". I read this book twice. 
 Yes, Belle Ruin is a sequel. That means you have to read the books that came before it or it can be rather confusing. And, like most books, you can't skim through it and expect to get the point. Besides, Martha Grimes' prose is worth reading every word. The characters are multi-dimensional--you'll find things to like, love, and dislike in all of them. And the story is like real life; sometimes there's no neat, tidy ending. I loved the bravery of the open-ended ending in Hotel Paradise and that theme continues in Belle Ruin. If you're looking for a tidy, happily-ever-after ending, read a fairy tale. If you're looking for a beautifully written, quirky, slice-of-life mystery, read anything by Martha Grimes 
 This Mel Brooks comedy aimed right at the 14-28 year-old market I was in when this movie came out, so I wasn't sure how I'd feel about seeing this again after many years.  It is still hilarious.  And, forget about politcal correctness but the little racist jokes that seemed harmless to this naive teenager now seem to this grown-up to perpetuate unnecessary hurt.  If I could edit this, I'd do it 
 The Aspern Papers is a brilliant story that concentrates everything great about Henry James in one brisk addictive read. James had such a deep feeling for the ornate social niceties of his day that he was able to poke fun of them while still respecting their essential decency--he seemed to understand the greed and brutality they kept in check.  Our unnamed narrator's quest to outfox a great poet's elderly mistress and lay ahold of her onetime lover's papers unfolds in a languid world of gondolas, decaying Venetian palazzos, hot evenings in overgrown gardens, and above all a comfortable leisure that allows the smallest social gestures to take on earth-shaking significance.   James had an uncanny ability to make that world come alive, bringing you into its subtleties and rites, while at the same time taking you behind the elegant faade to expose the aggression, cupidity, and naked power politics that lurk just beneath the impeccable manners. Our narrator wants the papers; the mistress wants money for her niece, and the niece ... well, order this book and read on to find out. You won't be disappointed--it's one of James's best.    
 This book has helped me better than any other diet books I've read.  I am now at my right body weight and feel great!  
 As a Marine recently returned from his second combat tour in Iraq, I have found this book to be immensely helpful in understanding the changes that have taken place in my life as a result of traumatic experience.  While the vietnam war may be 30 years gone, the lessons of those who have experienced war first hand are as timeless and relevant today as they ever were 
     During a time of conflict and upheavel, a wandering story teller is arrested by a perfidious bureaucrat for the crime of appearing suspicious and being in the wrong place at the wrong time (and possible violations of the Patriot Act). Imprisoned, Kai Lung does not languish. Although his enemy has the ear of the local mandarin, Kai Lung is aided by a beautiful woman who possesses the mandarin's other ear. In the tradition of "The Arabian Nights" our hero intrigues the mandarin's interest, spinning tales by turn ironic, poignant and pointed. With each tale told, the sympathy of the mandarin, the frustration of the bureaucrat and the love between Kai Lung and his ally grow accordingly and Kai Lung survives another day.   This story is set in the China of long ago and related through the filter of an early twentieth century english writer. The courtly, overly flowery language is deliciously funny and displays a sly satiricism which reminds me of "Gulliver's Travels". A truly timeless gem which may be read on different levels by different ages.   Will Kai Lung survive? Yes, but you really should see how...  
 This book is great - very readable and engaging, yet factual. In fact, this is one book to use when deciding how true to actual events other books and DVDs are. Alison Weir is a first-rate writer - and historian. I like her even better than David Starkey, whom I've heard she counts as a mentor 
 An intelligent, enjoyable work on the development of the Chinatown district in Vancouver, focusing on how the dominant European class worked to shape and control the Chinese community through political, legal, social, and cultural means.  Anderson's writing is thoroughly readable, academically rigorous but free from the dry, heavy dialogue that plagues so many other scholarly works.  My only criticism is her decision to exclude the Chinese immigrants' perspective on the development of their district, instead opting to focus only on how the Europeans perceived the Asian 'intruders'.  Providing the opposing view would have given the work better balance and a greater level of depth.  Nevertheless, an excellent book for those interested in Canadian history or ethnic/urban politics 
 A release is a collaboration between an artist and a label.  The artist hopes to connect with an audience and make valuable musical statements in the process.  The label hopes to connect with your pocketbook and make valuable money, and agrees to bear some of the more tedious business responsibilities along the way.  Harvey Mason, as the artist, delivers the goods here with finely crafted acoustic trio performances.  RCA Bluebird, as the label, drops the ball somewhat on the other hand, with no formal track-by-track composer credits shown and no publishing rights information given either. Rather odd for a major. Some further mis-information lies within Mason's own self-penned liner notes.  Each track title is shown, along with the name of the pianist and the bassist who perform on the track, right where you would more typically see parenthetical composer credits.  This can lead to confusion - take All Music Guide's entry for example, which does not hesitate to assert that the pianist and bassist for each track *ARE* the composers.  But let's not get started on AMG entries.  Mason then offers his illuminating discussion of the story behind each track.  Sometimes he identifies who he thinks the composer is and sometimes he is correct, but more often he is not.  (See below for my choices.)  The one place where we have to take his word for it is on the final track "Tess", where Mason credits his production assistant  John Beasley. RCA shouldn't make us work this hard to fully appreciate these fine performances. Mason should be forgiven for his incidental oversights, and praised for his outstanding musicianship, which many of us have admired over the years despite his associations with GRP's Dave Grusin For A Brusin, and the Bob James smooth-as-laxative stupor-group Foreskin.  Bravo, Harvey!  Linger here musically for as long as you can, but maybe get a new label.  1. Bernie's Tune  (Bernie Miller - Jerry Leiber - Mike Stoller) 2.

 Fans of John Howard's 1975 cult album, "Kid In A Big World", will not hesitate to pick this up. Except for the bonus tracks, every song here is accompanied by voice & piano alone. The end result is something far more darker & focused than "Kid". If "Kid" were the sound of hitting the big city all wide eyed & wet behind the ears, "Technicolour Biography" is all dashed hopes & broken promises. Or as Howard writes in the liner notes, the sound of "being overwhlemed by fame that seemed to be just around the corner".  The jaded,"Take Up Your Partners" opens the album & is sort of a black tie dinner party for the damned. The romantically doomed opera continues with the title cut, which Howard describes as a sort of more debauched "Goodbye Suzie 2" aimed at himself. If "Technicolour" were given the big production Howard obviously had in mind, alot of this may actually not have been as powerful. Hate to say it, but it's the stark sound of Howard's crumbling ambitions that makes this song & the entire album sound so moving.   "Blink In The Darkness" with it's "trees scratching the backdoor" is another standout, showcasing Howard's gift for Pop melody. The Gospel tinged,"Deal" continues in this melancholic vein. Here our lonely man at the piano agrees to wake up alone for the rest of his life "for one night of good good loving". The fine art of self-pity comes to a cynical fore with "Don't It Just Hurt". An anthem for a rainy day if I ever heard one. Now if you ever felt like, "Loneliness has never been a very faithful lover" or that "darkness has never been very much of a mother" then "Hall Of Mirrors" is the song for you.  All this is capped off at the end by a wonderfully lavish orchestral version of "Kid In a Big World". Not to mention, a single edit of "Goodbye Suzie". A song that deserved to have been a big a hit & is a classic in every sense of the word. Also included is the song Howard composed for the film "Open Season", which brings Scott Walker to mind. So if you found "Kid" a bit too naive, this one casts more than a few shadows around it. Glam Rock devotees of early Bowie & Elton John will certainly get more than a few spins out of this & I might add, fans of Rufus Wainwright. It's Howard's unique brand of dandyfied After Hours decadance---unplugged.          
  Suzanne E. Estler, with Laurie J. Nelson, delivers something appealingly different, a scholarly monograph without monotone. "Who Calls The Shots? Sports and University Leadership, Culture, and Decision Making" spotlights how higher education officials rationalize ornate and costly intercollegiate athletic programs, and the resulting challenges to consistency with the core missions of their institutions.    Estler's extensive research finds answers in a net of social, cultural, legal and economic history, 19th century to almost yesterday, revealing the mix of motives evolved among  celebrants of intercampus sports. Stakeholders these days include student athletes, faculty, alumni, administrators, spectators, also the National Collegiate Athletic Association and a host of other agencies, conferences and pseudo-regulatory outfits, plus a nasty assortment of  profit-sucking entrepreneurs (this reviewer's characterization, not Estler's), all of them flexing muscles in this sweat-sock corner of the entertainment industry. Alma mater aims for a basketful of prizes (everyone gets something): enhanced enrollments, money, strengthened endowments, pumped-up campus loyalty, money, national attention, money, political clout, and money, to name a few.   Estler examines the hard-hitting influences of football, in its various domains, on standards applied to all collegiate sports, and enlightens about player, coach and athletics administrator issues of gender and racial equality in higher education settings. She details plenty of wise recommendations to refocus perceptions of college sports opportunities, currently viewed, as she says, "...through a window in the gym rather than one in the campus library."  An Associate Professor of Higher Educational Leadership (U. Maine), Estler scores big, making convincing points with elegance. The book is an easy read. This reviewer would love to set her loose on many other vexing issues of intercollegiate athletics.

 When Hannah was a young girl, she watched the inferno destroy her family barn with the pure virgin snow making quite an eerie panoramic backdrop to the yellow orange.  When the blaze was finally put out and the area cooled enough to investigate, the police find numerous corpses including that of Hannah's mother whose pink halo in the snow will be inside Hannah forever  The arsonist-murderer was never caught and eventually the case went as cold as the wintry night that it occurred on.  Her mother's homicide was the impetus that led to Hannah becoming a crime scene investigator though she has never worked on trying to uncover who the killer is.  Now two decades later in Southern California, Hannah is married to Ethan Griffin and raising their daughter Amber together as she hides what happened that fatal day from even her loved ones.  Her current assignment involves a child abuse case when a message from the grave reaches out to her forcing Hannah to begin an investigation before history repeats itself with her and perhaps even Amber being the target.  The vivid use of contrasting colors provides a powerful background to a deep psychological suspense investigative thriller.  The story line is action-packed as the audience wonders whether the heroine has gone over the edge after receiving the dramatic note of "Your mom called" when she had buried that day deep inside her mind.  Gregg Olsen writes a terrific tense thriller that grips the audience once Hannah realizes she must become the predator before the culprit targets her loved ones to get at her.  Harriet Klausner 
 Very easy to read and highly interesting content on the lives of a few of the greats. Most of the works mentioned in the book I have been lucky enough to see first hand and the photos are very true to color. The only thing I wish this book had more of are photos of more of the works mentioned. If you love art and want to know more about lives of a few men who dramatically changed the world of art and the value of works this is a good book for you 
 Together is a beautifully realized coming-of-age tale that explores the contradictory tugs of talent, home, and family.  Thirteen year old Xiaochun (Tang Yun) is a violin prodigy from the countryside who gets invited to compete in Beijing.  His naïve but ambitious father moves the two of them to the big city, where they quickly realize it's as much about who you know as how good you are.  Xiaochun is a beguiling mix of wised up street kid and romantic artist.  He berates his violin teacher for his sloppiness and indifference, but stays loyal to him even after his father forces him to transfer to a better connected teacher.  He finds a friend in Lili (Chen Hong), a young woman on the make who turns out to be more big-hearted than shrewd.  Determined to demonstrate his devotion to Lili, Xiaochun makes a generous but personally disastrous gesture.  All of the main characters end up dealing with the consequences of choosing between their rational self interest and the prompting of their hearts.  Their actions have a larger resonance because the story plays out against the backdrop of the cultural upheaval caused by China's move towards capitalism.    Director Chen Kaige, who scored big with Farewell My Concubine, elicts marvelous, emotionally honest performances from his actors.  In particular, some of the scenes between Xiaochun and his father will have you groping for the Kleenex box.  Together manages to be both clear-eyed and warm-hearted, and is filled with small moments that reveal big truths about the choices people have to make.  Highly recommended.      
 This band produced alot of good songs back in the 60's. Their most well known song and a huge hit was House Of The Rising Sun.Thats got a tune that just seems to stick in you head.Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood is another one of my favorites here.Eric Burdon and the band had a special sound.We Gotta Get Out Of This Place is another big hit i love that tune.It's My Life is another well known song from the Animals. Bands like this were around for a shore time,but made some of the best songs 
 I do not receive yet this item, I will appreciate you let me know when do you  estimate I am going to receive it. By the way, if it is needed please envoy the item via courrier with the extra charge to my AMEX.  Thank you 
 There isn't a song on this 40-track collection that hasn't already been permanently etched on my brain.  When I was a teen in the Sixties, these songs were a part of the soundtrack of my life.  [Only the final four tracks charted after 1970.]   Motown was already a proven hit-making label four years before the British Invasion when Barrett Strong charted with "Money" in 1960.  The label also was a huge influence on at least one British group. The Beatles recorded their own versions of "Money" and "Please Mr. Postman" and others in the early Sixties. With artists like Smokey Robinson, the Supremes, Marvin Gaye, the Temptations and countless others; Motown didn't merely survive the British Invasion--they thrived.  Motown would continue to have hits into the Seventies and Eighties, but this compilation covers their golden age.  Motown has released numerous collections over the years, including the definitive HITSVILLE USA box set. But this collection is one of the best.  [It should be noted that MOTOWN GOLD was first released in 2000 under the title MOTOWN THE CLASSIC YEARS. But if you didn't make that purchase, GOLD is selling at a midline price and is clearly the better buy.] VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDE 
 The Cobra Event is fiction, but as other reviewers have said, entirely plausible.  Richard Preston writes with great authority on the topic of bioterrorism, yet he also knows how to tell a good story, and that's always important to me because I read for pleasure as much as for information.    The reason that this novel is entirely believable is that Preston is able to inbue his characters with genuine humanity and likability.  From the first page, when lovely young Kate is infected, the characters and the plot line grabbed me.  After that, I read like a demon, and found myself trying to steal time from other activities just to get to "a good stopping place."  And, of course, there is no really good stopping place because with a plot this captivating all you want to do is read until the end.  And then, when the end is reached, you feel let down because there is no more to read!  [One word to the squeamish -- the autopsy scenes are grisly and occur more than once, so if you can't take CSI-style blood and guts, this book may not be for you.]    But for me, this novel is 5 stars all the way.  Great for airplane or vacation reading too, and much better than the usual, ho-hum paperback about serial killers.  Now I've got to go out and pick up The Hot Zone 
  This is definitely the purest, most genre defining album ever released in hip hop. The MC work of Nas is unbelievable. His songs are well written and his clever flow and rhyming skill as well as the superb content of the songs make you emotionally connect to the tunes. Every song is ridiculously good. One of the greatest albums ever released in music bar none 
 Brilliant artist......that about covers it!  He just keeps getting better and better!!  I highly recommend this CD to smooth jazz lovers 
 Churchill's excellently written magnum opus on WW2 is definitely worth while reading, and I recommend the box for all who want a detailed and insightful description of one of the most traumatic events in the history of man. His literary style is beautiful, sometimes even poetic and it is a long wonderful journey for the reader. Churchill must have been in his best mood when he wrote it, not least because of the many humourous anecdotes and comments. He is surely an outstanding scholar and for me, being an amateur historian, the books gave me all the necessary background for further explorations in the subjects 
 This movie is too funny, the scene at the abc store and the "sisters". That's all I'm going to say this is a must have in your personal collection it's well worth the money 
 A great book which instantly reminded me of a short story by Frank Herbert ("Dune" series), called "Ceasefire". Both stories share a similar premise, contemplating the inevitable paradigmatic shift that will come with this (un)earth-shattering  development. From Ceasefire: "War will never be eliminated, battles instead being fought with horse cavalry, swords, crossbows & lances...augmented with modern innovations; poison gases, curarae-tipped crossbow bolts, bacteria...espionage, poison gas, germ warfare - all of these become a necessity! Violence is a part of human life. The lust for power is a part of human life. As long as people want power badly enough, they'll use any means to get it-fair or foul! Peaceful or otherwise!" At the conclusion of Herbert's story, a general hands to the inventor of the new technology a book: "The next generation will need to understand this", it being a copy of the works of Niccolo Machiavelli!  The Clarke collaboration is a heated, thrilling tale well worth the money I spent on it. Thought-provoking, intelligent, the only downside for me was its excessive length. Give it a go 
 In 1967 when Hal Holbrook portrayed Mark Twain in the CBS TV special, "Mark Twain Tonight" I thought Samuel Clemens' death had again been mistaken. Holbrook's impersonation of Twain was so real I couldn't help but think he was still amongst us. Naturally when I discovered the telecast was captured on DVD I knew I just had to see it again. And guess what? Mark Twain hasn't aged a day over 70. He still looks and sounds just as good as he did then.   Holbrook segues one passage after another from Twain's writings ("Roughing It", "Huckleberry Finn", "The Golden Arm" and others) as though telling us the story of his life.   Of course, if you want to play specific sections from the show, the DVD is indexed for your personal preference. Whether you listen to Holbrook's 90-minute monologue uninterrupted or exerts from the show, you'll easily be charmed by Twain's humour and wit until you almost swear it is Twain himself on stage 
 Although I think the secondary characters could use a little more attention, the primary ones are well drawn and believable. It's a well-turned plot, though I wish everyoine involved: author, editor, and whoever wrote the jacket blurb, would have been a little more circumspect with clues. One reviewer complained of southern stereotyping; I say: barely. I lived in the area for a couple of years, and the description sounds eerily familiar to me. I had an owner of an extensive marina complex tell me once, "I AM the law on Magnolia Point!" (geographical name changed.) just like Taylor in the book. Out in the country the way "things work" is accurately described. And sorry, but people DO use "Y'all" in the singular. Perhaps they shouldn't, but they do.  In any case, since there is now a sequel, we know DeMarco survived. I'm looking forward to the next one. 
 `Brutal Journey' retells one of the most incredible (and least know) chapters of the early European exploration of the Americas - the spectacular failure of  Panfilo de Narvaez in his attempt to conquer the Gulf Coast of North America, and the ordeal of the four men (out of an original four hundred) who survived. Though the story had already been told in a first hand account by survivor Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca in his `Adventures in the Unknown Interior of America', there was amble reason for Schneider to revisit and expand upon this fascinating story.  Cabeza de Vaca's Adventures in the Unknown Interior relates the failure of the Narvaez expedition, the fate of the nearly 400 men who perished, and the incredible experiences of the four who survived to walk out of the North American wilderness eight years later. It is as thrilling a non fiction tale as you will find, but has certain drawbacks. Cabeza de Vaca was not primarily a writer, and his narrative was written as a report to impress his king, not for a wide audience. Though it covers eight years, it is a slim volume - less than two hundred pages, and it offers little background information, plus often skips details and scrambles chronology.   Paul Schneider addresses all of these shortcomings in `Brutal Journey'. While using Adventures in the Unknown Interior as his starting point, he fills it out both with background and details. He tells the history of Panfilo de Narvaez's earlier exploits in Mexico and Cuba, and gives insight into his personality and character. This not only helps to explain his failed expedition to Florida and the Gulf Coast and the personality conflict that he had with Cabeza de Vaca, but also sheds some light on the way in which Spain went about conquering and colonizing in America. Schneider also draws on details that were not available to Cabeza de Vaca, using both the modern archeological record and the accounts of the de Soto expedition to fill in details about Native tribes and actual locations of the tale's action. He attempts to sort out the chronology where de Vaca scrambled it. Finally, and most importantly, Schneider is a better writer than was Cabeza de Vaca, and his excellent prose helps to make this amazing story more accessible to modern readers.   Whether or not you have already read `Cabeza de Vaca's Adventures in the Unknown Interior', you should find Schneider's `Brutal Journey' an outstanding reading experience. If you have read de Vaca's narrative, it will expand your knowledge and understanding of its events. If you have not, it will be an excellent introduction to this fascinating and exciting chapter of early American history - I recommend it highly.  Theo Logos  
 I really loved this book because of it's historical back round and it's story.  I'm kind I read this version than the other one 
 This is a long overdue documentary. It's phenomenal in that it covers almost every aspect of addiction there is including the ER perspective and the challenges with health insurance.   As a healthcare professional, I am frequently astounded by the response I receive when I ask patients what they have lost as a result of their addiction. While the responses range from jobs to cars and money, the room often becomes a lot quieter when the responses include children, families and identity. - This documentary hits on those difficult issues and several others which are present today and continue to present challenges for patients, families and healthcare providers. There is a long way to go - this documentary is a nice step forward 
 Not exactly what I was looking for.  Aside from the 43-page introduction, this book is a primary source of documentation (letters to and from Galileo) surrounding Galileo and his two trials, and devoid of commentary or narrative 
 The book has the most fabulous pictures. They're not only of high-quality but also big in size showing details. The articles are of great assistance to the Catholics as well as the non-Catholics 
 It's incredible that this book is a debut novel; it's that good.  Richly developed characters and intriguing mystery make this a speedy read.  The gang at Monkeewrench, a software gaming company, are hiding from a former tragedy, all rallying around their leader, Grace.  She is deeply wounded and so closed off that it's amazing she's brave enough to venture from her home.  That she does makes her the character that steals every scene she's in.  While the majority of the book follows the homicide detectives (both likable), it's the passages with the Monkeewrench gang that make this mystery engaging.  Grace is like no other heroine in current mysteries.  Give it a try.  If you like strong female characters, you won't be disappointe 
 I thought this movie was great, as did the people who watched it with me.   Yes, it is pretty stereo-typical "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus" kind of flick but some of the scenes (especially with Ryan Reynolds) are HILARIOUS!!! If you're not one of those people who reads way too much into movie plots and you're just looking for a good flick to sit down & laugh at, check this one out!   
 Publius Ovidius Naso was born in 43 B.C. and died in 18 A.D. Augustus banished him for unknown reasons to Tomi, a barren place near the coast of the Black Sea. Another famous work. Scholars agree that it's his best achievement. Ovid is a master in describing feminin emotions ( see also 'Heroides'). It would be wrong to see 'The Art of Love' as some sort of a manual. It's a parody of the poetical manuals that existed in his time 
 He's the one and only poet of modern man's soul. All modern literature owes to him. Not only this, but he had great imagination and a wry sense of humour. Among his "minor" works sonnets like "The hippopotamus" is worth a poem of some modern writer. Read him to inspire your mind 
 I've heard no complaints from either one, it's a hit 
 Having spent 12 days in St. Petersburg. The information given in this series is very good. The video footage places such as Peterhoff or of one of Caterines Palaces was nice, but they could have done more. Peterhoff is a very large place. But in a historical context the information is good and accurate as far as I can tell 
 This has to be my favorite DVD of Sesame Street and my 6 month old grandson.  Great songs and fun in between 
 This is one of my favorite all time television shows.  Now I can watch it anytim 
 It's been a longtime since Hollywood has delivered a true Christmas classic the likes of 'It's A Wonderful Life' ('47), 'Miracle On 34th Street' ('47) and 'A Christma Carol' ('51). Finally, thanks to Disney, we have a new one to add to that list, 'The Santa Clause' ('94).  When Santa dies after falling off Scott Calvin's (Tim Allen) roof Scott follows the directions in Santa's coat pocket and inadverently becomes subject to "the Santa clause." Now only Scott and his son Charlie (Eric Lloyd) know who the new Santa is. Troubles soon follow as those around Scott think he's "lost it," especially his ex-wife Laura (Wendy Crewson) and her new husband Neal (Judge Reinhold).   Can Scott, I mean Santa, convince an unbelieving world that he's the new bearded fat guy in the red suit, or will he be deemed a crackpot and lose parental visitation rights to his son?  This is a great movie that should become a Christmas viewing tradition in every family. I consider this to be Tim Allen's signature role and little Eric Lloyd is adorable as Chalie Calvin. The chemistry between Father and son is sure to bring tears to your eyes.  There are also excellent performances provided by David Krumholtz as Bernard the head elf and the enchanting Paige Tamada as elf Judy 
 Borrow this book from a friend in class and photocopy the pages, thats my advice.  Good book, just over priced 
 This book provides some helpful advice on how to control the drinking habit. Alcoholics Anonymous admits that there is no cure for alcoholism. The authors suggest that drinkers dwell on the reasons for drinking as a condition precedent for reducing and eliminating the habit. Drinkers respond more positively to arguments which indicate that the habit results in reduced life span (10 years). In addition, drinking impacts the brain chemistry, it leads to impotence and costs up to $100T over a lifetime.   Ultimately, all drinkers must come to understand the benefits of eliminating alcohol before they can develop the requisite discipline to stop without ever returning to the habit.  The work has some positive themes for alcohol users. It is not a cure-all; however, the contents may help individuals having particular difficulty with alcoholism 
 I'm at the University of Cambridge and I knew several of the scientists who feature in this book, as well as being familiar with the colleges and laboratories described. Cathcart has written a gripping tale of scientific discovery. He has been meticulous in his use of archives and other primary sources. On one level this is amost scholarly history. On a different level it is accessible to any reader with a college education in any discipline. The physics necessary to understand the book is given in crystal clear terms.  This is a brilliant example of outstanding science writing. The many characters come to life. The period it covers was a golden age for physics in Cambridge, a time when a Nobel prize or two was a routine occurence. 
 Superbly enhanced with full color photographs from Yasuo Konishi, Cool Tools: Cooking Utensils From The Japanese Kitchen by Kate Klippensteen is an impressively informative introductory exploration of the kitchen cookware and tools employed in the culinary aspects of Japanese culture. Presenting readers with a stunning collection of photographs and knowledgeable explanations for Japanese utensils ranging from the oni oroshi or "devil grater" (which is a useful grating tool for the daikon radish), the saibashi or cooking chopsticks, and the yanagi-ba (which is a long sashimi knife), to the yukihira-nabe (which is a hand made and highly crafted aluminum cooking pot), Cool Tools deftly details a complete selection of the beautifully shaped and functional tools of the Japanese kitchen. A welcome addition to any personal or community library reference collection, Cool Tools is enthusiastically recommended as a simply beautiful compilation of photographs and informative briefings for the many decorative particulars of the Japanese kitchen 
 As a lifelong book junkie, I approached audio books with a hefty amount of reluctance - not because I would prefer to listen to the same 50 or so "classic rock" songs over and over again on the radio, but because the whole audio thing seemed to violate the sanctity of the book. Listening to a book seemed like a pale imitation of actually reading a book. Well, I tried out my first one a few years ago, and since then have listened to numerous audio books. Household chores and the daily commute to work are radically transformed when there's a good book to listen to. There are still some books that I simply must enjoy in their good old printed form, but some books make the transition to audio so well, I don't even think twice about listening as opposed to reading. I love Alexander McCall Smith's No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series and have never "read" a single one of these books. A Spot of Bother, the second novel from Mark Haddon of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time fame is one of those books that makes for a wonderful listen. Once again Haddon excels at telling the story of a slightly out of whack family in a way that makes the mundane events of everyday life simultaneously dramatic and hilarious. This time rather than an autistic narrator, Haddon tells the story, by way of third person narration, of the recently retired George Hall, his cheating wife, his daughter and her impending marriage to the despised Ray and the romantic misadventures of his homosexual son. The title refers to a spot found on George's leg, which, though his doctor diagnoses as eczema, George decides is definitely cancer. At several points in the story, I found myself laughing out loud, a sight which must have made fellow motorists think I was as mad as George. The scene in which George's botched home surgery is described had me squirming at the gory description and laughing like a loon at the same time. The audio is narrated by Simon Vance, who does an excellent job capturing the voices of the various characters and whose timing and delivery for the comic scenes made an already funny book that much more of a delight. A Spot of Bother is a fun, light read. Anyone who has a slightly nutty family (and who doesn't?) will certainly take some comfort in the misadventures of the Halls 
 Between the fall of the Athenian Empire and the rise of Alexander, many Greeks sought adventure and fortune as mercenaries. Cyrus of Persia attempted to usurp the throne with an army stiffened by 10,000 Greek mercenaries. The author found himself among that number. Cyrus went down to defeat and death at the Battle of Cunaxa, but one contingent of his army emerged victorious--The Ten Thousand. Alone and unsponsored, surrounded by enemies, and deep in the heart of Persia, The Ten Thousand began their fighting retreat to the sea and freedom. Along the way they met with battle, treachery, hardship, and death. Xenophon became one of their leaders, and eventually lived to write this stirring account of their exploits. The successful retreat of the Ten Thousand served as proof to Phillip of Macedon that a Greek army could conquer Persia, and he made his preparations for the invasion. Phillip's death forestalled his plans, but Alexander took up his father's project and the rest, as they say, is history. If there had been no Westward march by the Ten Thousand, there may have been no Eastward march by Alexander 
 This is definately my favorite of all of Orczy's books that I've read- I  think that I've read most (8) of the Scarlet Pimpernel series, and this is  the one that I keep coming back to reread.  It is one of the most amusing  and gives more information on Chauvelin than all of the other books  combined.  Yes, I'll admit it, I'm a Chauvelin fan!  I love learning more  about him 
 I picked this up in a remainder bin (!) - to me, always the ultimate insult to an artist - and it has become my favourite Eric Johnson cd. It seems to be a continuing tale, spun musically throughout the disc, and other than my perennial quibble with Eric (I can't understand you!), vocally and instrumentally it is a virtual gem. I am presently labouring under the delusion that, someday, I will be able to play a recognizable cover of "Manhattan" (I've said in the past that I'm not a fan of covers, but this is only for my own consumption), a smooth, jazzy piece halfway into the cd. Eric exercises his pipes on three memorable, melodic songs; "Battles We Have Won", "All About You", and "Lonely In The Night", the last in which he exhibits nice range. In "Song For Lynette", he breaks away from his lightning-fast guitar and spins a soft-as-a-flowing-creek piano turn, a nice surprise. "S.R.V.", "Camel's Night Out", and "Venus Isle" - "Venus Reprise" take care of the fast licks.  All in all, really my best choice of Eric Johnson's work 
 I found out my mother (who was my best friend) had terminal cancer on Friday, Oct. 13, 2006.  We were told she probably wouldn't see Christmas--I said Thanksgiving.  She passed away on Nov 9, 2006 (two weeks ago today).  A friend of mine had this book and told me to read it (she wasn't fortunate enough to read it until after her mother's death).  It was a God Send!!!!!  My mom's best friend, my sister and I took care of mom (hospice too).  The three of us girls read Final Gifts.  I can't begin to praise it enough.  I've never experienced anyone dying before.  This book explained EVERYTHING my mother went thru.  THANK GOD!!!!!  Again, I can't praise it enough 
 It is interesting to find that those who didn't like the book, were in fact criticizing the author--with whom I'm sure they do not have a personal relationship.  Those who disagree with the teachings of the church Hinckley belongs to will stop at nothing convince others of their own feelings--even review a harmless book by the church's leader.  I find it petty and even arrogant.    The book itself is an easy read.  I find it refreshing to read a book that espouses "old-fashioned" values that society seems to so casually discard.  Indeed, if more people were to "Stand For Something"--anything at all, instead of blowing wherever the wind takes them, we would enjoy a much more responsible and respectful society.  I applaud the author for sharing his stories and ideas with mainstream America.  
 I was very impressed by the objective treatment of the illegal immigrant situation on the Arizona Border.  As a Southern Arizona resident, I've seen both sides of the issue first hand.  If you are concerned about the border, you will likely find this movie to be informative.  It portrays both sides, pro and con of stricter enforcement vs. amnesty.    Most importantly, it portrays the human element.  Everyone along the border is affected by the debate.  Debate if you will, humans (families, children, business owners) and the environment (range land, recreation areas) are being affected.  Long time residents of border towns are fearful because of the limited support they have for security and the damage to property of litter that the constant people trafficing causes.  Many individuals and groups are concerned about the health and safety of those crossing into the US.  Either way, safety, health problems and, of course, money are all issues presented in the forefront in this film.    Cries from the Border portrays these concerns in sympathy (and objectively) for both sides.  I recommend this movie for anyone who wishes to present an informed debate about the critical issues of border security.  It informs realistically and gives insight into how critical this issue is to all of us.  
 Ice Time is the best book that i have read i a very long while.  Once i started reading it, i couldn't put it down.  After i finished it, i read it twice more, and sill did not get tired f it.  I recommend this book to any and everyone 
 This book was so good I could not put it down. Patterson brings to this book some unexpected twists to the story. Just when Cross thinks Gary Soneji is gone, he reappears. With another killer on the loose the pressure is on! If you are reading the Alex Cross Series, this book fits perfectly in the series.. I highly recommend this book. It was a quick read. So have another book ready 
 America (The Book) will never be mistaken for the dry textbooks many of us used in high school. The book focuses on "the past, present and future of American democracy." This concept is covered in nine chapters:  1: Democracy Before America 2: The Founding of America 3: The President: King of Democracy 4: Congress: Quagmire of Freedom 5: The Judicial Branch: It Rules 6: Campaigns and Elections: America Changes the Sheets 7: The Media: Democracy's Valiant Vulgarians 8: The Future of Democracy: Four Score and Seven Years from Now 9: The Rest of the World: International House of Horrors  All of The Daily Show correspondents make contributions, ranging from what it's like in Canada, to photo expressions of TV journalists. Each chapter ends with Discussion Questions ("Which would you rather see being made: sausages or laws?") and Classroom Activities ("Take construction paper, trace you hand, and make a Turkey of Congress").   America is also a visual treat because of all the colorful graphics. You can play the Game of the Presidency, which is similar to another well-known board game. You can also dress the Supreme Court Judges who are unfortunately anatomically correct and in living color. (There is nudity and it is not pretty).   In response to criticism that the previous edition was filled with misinformation, Professor Schultz has corrected this edition. In the beginning, I found the red ink distracting but eventually my eyes adjusted. I would definitely recommend reading the comments because they are written in the same spirit as the book.  Unlike The Daily Show where the swearing is bleeped out, here it is left in. It didn't bother me but it may offend other readers.  America is witty, intelligent and irreverent as it examines the highlights and failures of our political system. If you are a fan of The Daily Show, this is a must read. It will have you laughing out loud and more importantly, have you stop, question and think.  Armchair Interviews says: This is one textbook that will not cause drowsiness!     
 I could not put this book down!  The author incorporated two stories into one with a parallel (sp?)thread connecting the two. The hysterical blindness was an interesting element. Characters unfolded in layers to keep the reader guessing.  I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this novel.  Read it 
 This famous adaptation of Ben Johnson is terrific and still modern in its whole conception, this is a characteristic seal of the masterpieces. Aided by his loyal server Mosca. Volpone makes his friend to believe is dying and convinces to every one of his greedy friends is his heir.  As you can guess, the macabre spell and incisive charm of this play still makes laugh and think to a great audience.   In 1939 Maurice Tourneur decided to make a film about it. The tragic new is this film was released after WW2, but Harry Baur, the most complete actor f the French Cinema by then, wouldn't be present, his mysterious death was attributed to Nazis.  If you are looking for one of the best and most genuine jewel of the Universal literature, go for this one. 
 I have it from an inside source that ROBIN AND THE SEVEN HOODS will soon be a bonafide stage musical opening in the West End, and starring Christian Slater in the Sinatra role. Should work well on stage. I for one, can't wait, as I have always loved the score 
 Here is a simple yet exciting story about running a dog team in the Iditarod dogsled race -- about the dogs, the trail, the weather, and the delightful musher.  Lisa Frederic, the author of this autobiography, grew up in Kentucky, went to college in Montana, and spent 20 years fishing for salmon out of Kodiak, Alaska, before discovering sled dogs.    As a middle-aged tourist in 1997, Frederic visited Nome to see the end of the annual Iditarod race.  The next year she became a volunteer at checkpoints along the race trail, but that only whet her appetite for more.  She continued to volunteer at checkpoints for each race, and she took an unpaid job as a dog handler in the lot of a major musher, Jeff King.  In 2002 she ran King's puppy team in the Iditarod.  The dogs were young, this was a training run for them, and Frederic took them the entire 1,200 miles to Nome.   In her direct and modest style, Frederic recalls the humor and the danger of the situations she got into.  She describes the process of learning how to mush, the initial races to prepare dogs and musher for the big one, the frustrations, the injuries, the storms, and the joys.  This is Frederic's story, yet she weaves in the support of her husband David, as well as the support of friends, strangers, and other mushers.  Frederic finished in 47th place in a race that 64 mushers had started and 55 would complete.  Not bad for a 42-year rookie.   Fortunately, Frederic is also a talented storyteller and gifted writer.  This book is a fun read, an informative account of mushing and the Iditarod, and an adventure story.  I highly recommend it 
 This book is a transitional piece for Auster.  In this excellently written story about a man lost in the world after years of bohemian existence we find a wonderful work of internal psychological reasoning.  In this book, Auster makes the leap from the observer, narrator or protagonist, to the insertion of himself, as a writer/observer, into the story as a character.  The choice of the name "Peter Aaron" is a not so subtle clue that Auster means Aaron to be himself.  With both Auster and Aaron having the initials "P.A." it is difficult to ignore Auster's presence in the story.  The book takes us deeply into the activities of his good friend, Ben Sachs, another writer.  The book illustrates the development of the existential Sachs in a world which he is mostly powerless to control.  At some point, Sachs believes he has wrested control over his own life, and yet, just at that point, is the point that perhaps he has least control over his life; but does not realize it.  Auster, as usual, has surrealism meet reality.  It is a talent he has developed and only gets better with practice.  And he practices it to the fullest extent here.  Auster combines his talent for surrealism with a wonderful sense of human irony.  His use of that combination often leaves the reader with a feeling that `nothing really matters; but everything really matters.'  Yet he clearly shows also, that if nothing really matters, any road will get you there.  This book is recommended highly for all readers of Auster's work as the reader can see Auster's transition in this book.  In addition, it is recommended for all readers who wish to further examine the depth and breadth of human thought, once derailed from what we consider "reality." 
 Jamie Whyte struck just the right note with this little book about logic.  The writing is well done, the humor is used judiciously, and the examples are pertinent.  My complaint is that I wanted more.  I would have loved to see more examples of bogus logic from the media, especially in advertising.  On the plus side the slimness of the book makes it easy to read.  Do our culture a favor and read this book and then pass it on to others 
 Reissue of John's "With Bitter Herbs...", on how humans learned how to incorporate poisonous`or bad tasting plants into their diets.  Fascinating book, well worth reading 
 I played through the first Halo and really enjoyed the single-player campaign.  I never played the multiplayer game until I bought Halo 2.   Let's get this out of the way first: Halo 2's multiplayer is unparalleled.  With a multitude of multiplayer games (Capture the Flag, Juggernaut, Team vs. Team, etc.) and a dizzying variety of terrains, there's plenty to keep Halo fans busy blowing each other up.  The addition of the alien Elites as a playable character spice things up.  You can also wield two weapons at a time, one in each fist, providing another combat option for those gunslingers that like their battles John Woo-style.    Unfortunately, Halo 2's single-player campaign is not as impressive.  To whit, the alien Covenant's entire society is based on the idea that activating the giant rings throughout the universe (known as Halos) will put them on their journey of spiritual evolution.  The reality is that Halo is a weapon designed to destroy the Flood, an infestation of aliens who turn human and alien alike into vicious zombies.  And how do you keep the Flood from infecting every living thing?  Why, by utterly destroying every living thing in the universe of course!  Play alternates between Master Chief and the alien elite known as the Arbiter.  This gives the player both sides of the story, which is interesting...to a point.  Eventually, the plot converges enough so that the two characters should really end up fighting each other.  That would have been something, if the AI made you play through both battles from opposite sides by creating an enemy that uses your own moves.    But instead, about midway through the battle for the universe, a giant plant that looks like Audrey II from Little Shop of Horrors shows up. This planet, speaking in Jabba-esque guttural tones, rams the plot down our throats by grabbing the Arbiter and Master Chief and shoving them into opposite plot lines: the Arbiter ends up working with the humans, Master Chief ends up doing the alien dirty work.    Then things really get going, and just as Halo 2 hurtles towards the final battle on Earth...the game ends. I should have guessed something was up when, during E3 interviews about Halo 3, the CEO of Bungee only had this to say: "Are you ready to finish the war?" What he meant was, "Are you ready to finish the game you thought you were finishing in Halo 2?"  As you've probably noticed from my review of the second installment of Pirates of the Caribbean, I really, really, REALLY hate movies and games that fail to provide a whole story.  It doesn't matter that this is part two of a three-part series.  Writers and developers have an obligation to provide a full story; you CAN create a story with a beginning and end even though it's the middle of a series, as evidenced by The Two Towers.   Halo 2 is an improvement on the original, but it loses points for a weak campaign that forces you to play both sides, then throws in a talking plant to clean up the mess. 
  A searing, moody courtroom drama masterfully directed by Sidney Lumet, the film earned five Oscar nominations in 1982, including one for writer David Mamet. As Frank Galvin, Newman shows a rare vulnerability as a man struggling to redeem himself before it's too late. This film represents both courtroom and human drama at its finest, with veteran player Jack Warden superb as Galvin's only colleague and friend. 
 Aren't you sick of the phrase low-carb? I agree with Rebecca on her calorie information and the need for a reduction in most people's portion sizes. Two years ago I lost about 40 pounds eating pretty much whatever I wanted, but I ate very small portions several times a day while exercising. Best of luck to Rebecca on all her endeavors 
 Most of the reviews of this book seem to be reviews of Newton, not the book.  To be sure, Newton is one of the most influential scientists who ever lived, but that is not the point.  Rather, the point is how good is this book?  I liked the book, but not as much as I had hoped to.  I found the book to be somewhat flat and un-exciting, the same impression it gives of Newton's life.  There are areas of Newton's life that could have been presented more dramatically, most specifically his conflict with Robert Hooke.  The author paints Hooke as one of those people who claim to have done everything before anyone else.  In this book, he is depicted as a blowhard, but in other accounts his claims are given much more weight.  (For instance, see "The Scientists" by John Gribbin.)   Another point of contention is exactly how indispensable was Newton.  Had he not lived, how long would it have taken for others to discover what he did?  Being a biography of Newton, it is not surprising that he is painted as being indispensable.  Again, this is a point of contention, not hinted at in this book.  Much of what Newton did was also done by others (calculus was developed at the same time by Leibniz and it is his version that we use today, not Newton's).  Newton could not have formulated gravity without the work of Kepler, Galileo, and Descartes.   Gribbin believes that within a decade of Newton's death others could have used this same background to develop "Newton's laws".  The point is not whether Gleick or Gribbin is right, but that Gleick does not even acknowledge that this controversy exists.  All in all, the book lays out the scope of Newton's life (including the fact that he spent much of the latter part of his life as an alchemist), but in a rather unexciting manner.  The important areas of controversy, which aim to evaluate Newton's position in the pantheon of great scientists, are not even broached.  I think that such a discussion would have enriched the book and broadened the outlook of the reader, so that Newton would not be just "the man", but rather a man among many. 
 Dadrian's book is probably one of the most intensely researched works on the Armenian Genocide to date.  It gives an accurate big picture description of much of the international politics going on at the time,  which many other books on the subject do not.  I found it quite objective  with a scholarly tone.  I think it was actually a little weak on  descriptions of the horrors of the Genocide, yet this was not the author's  focus.  If an uninformed reader were to read one book on the Armenian  Genocide, then this may not be the best one, I think "Survivors:  An  Oral History of the Armenian Genocide" or "Black Dog of  Fate" are easier and more personal reads.  However, Dadrian's book is  a must for historians and experts on the subject, as it is probably the  best true historical account on the subject to date 
 My 9 month old loves this book.  He has a great time looking behind the flaps to play 'peek a boo.'  I highly recommend 
 Am happy with everything about this player except that for the money spent, I would have expected better support for DVD+R DVD-R media.  Granted, that feature isn't listed in the technical description, so the mistake is mine 
 This is an excellent book on linear algebra. Emphasis is made on linear spaces and operators, rather than on matrices and numerical computations. Proofs are clear, comments on the margins are very helpful, exercises are insightful. Perhaps the only minor problem is that, in following this approach, the author chose to introduce determinants only in the last chapter of the book. 
 This film was a classic the day it was made. Tongue in cheek humor all the way. Only a tiny bit off color here and there. But if you don't think it's funny that someone can actually explode from eating too much, you won't like it 
 John Banville takes his astonomical fiction "Doctor Copernicus" to the next stage in "Kepler." Both books are powerful feats of the imagination, in which Banville attempts to re-create that curious and pregnant stage in history when the medieval world was giving way to the first stirrings of modernity. Amid the tumult of the Thirty Years War, which would have have such a large impact on the future of Europe and indeed the entire world, an equally momentous change was taking place in the sciences. Alchemy and astrology still rule, but the natural sciences and astronomy are gradually coming into their own. Johannes Kepler builds on the insights of Copernicus and the observations of Tycho Brahe to create new theories of planetary motion that reinforce and are themselves strengthened by the work of Galileo. Banville has created a multi-dimensioned work, part picaresque, part epistolary novel, part flashback, in which Kepler struggles past politics, religious discord, family distractions and war to seek out the celestial harmonies that he is convinced are there for the discovering. "Kepler" is not the greatest of Banville's novels, but that still makes it a very good one indeed 
 I found this movie a long time ago on tape and later on tv.  i was glad it came out on dvd. It is a little known Judy movie,  but she looks wonderful in it. It is one her funniest movies,  she is wonderful of a midwestern girl wanting to be an actress, but has to go where it can happen,  New York to live in the "incubator" with her boughten hats.  it is a charming film that all Judy Garland fans must see.  The ending alone is worth it when she dances beautifully.  It was too bad that this and the Clock didn't have a commentary from John Fricke, who knows everything about Judy.  It would have a nice bonus.  
 Not your typical Baseball movie. Very realistic right up until you get to the owner letting a rookie start(but that is probably a realism if it was to actually happen). Anyone who is a fan of Olmos will not be disappointed and see another side of him. This man is a real talent and Lorraine Brocco is as attractive as ever, another real talent there 
 Informative and realistic - great book!  The thing I liked most about this book was the fact that it kept a consistent theme throughout (i.e., consistent references that did not require me to search previous pages for definitions). It is true that there are a lot of choices to be made each day and knowing what type of decision maker you are can help make those selections easier and more fulfilling.  I particularly liked the way he explained the correlation of the level of regret associated with a maximizer vs. a satisficer and his references related to risk aversion.  
 this is the funniest book i've ever read. i envy the way he can write so honestly about his feelings and his personal life events. i didn't want this book to end, i will definitely be reading it again and again 
 I own about twenty audio books on the Civil War and countless books and periodicals. I have already listened to this one twice and will probably listen a third time next week. Very enjoyable, very interesting, never boring. Thanks to the author, I'll be looking for more of his works.

   "Led Zeppelin"... You know the name & the song remains the same.......   This is one of Zeps best DVD and the music even sounds better if that's possible.   One of the best VIDEO & AUDIO edited concerts I have had the pleasure to view in some time.   If you are of discerning taste or on a tight budget, this is your best BANG for the Buck. 
 These slippers were a christmas present for my husband and I haven't seen him without them since. He often remarks that his feet almost get too warm! Beautiful slippers and extremely comfortable. Well made and worth every penny 
 Moving back to California was a great opportunity for me to finally pick up surfing.  But where would i begin?  I knew that just renting a board and getting out there wasnt going to be smart or a good way to learn, so I started doing research and found this wonderful book!  It is full of useful information that is both accurate and interesting.  I learned so much, and Surf Like A Girl is now one of my favorite books 
 Like others have mentioned this album explores some new territory while still remaining very much the BoC we all know. The addition of guitars and the type of beats on some of the tracks definitely give the album a more "folksey" touch, almost reminiscent of Beck in places, but the slightly off key melodies and amazing atmospheres are typical trademark BoC. The production is top-notch although I must say it's almost too clean and big in places, thus giving the album a more commercial sound...personally I liked the slight grittiness and sort of lo-fi feel of some of their past efforts more, but like I said the quality of the production here is very high and there are plenty of layers, shifts and general madness in all of the tracks to guarantee repeated listenings while trying to absorb it all in. Overall, an interesting album and an interesting evolution in BoC's sound that some might like more and some less. Probably a more accessible disc than some of the others so if you're not familiar with the band yet this might be a good place to start...then get Music Has the Right to Children and then Geogaddi 
 IT is so nice to have FORK ME, SPOON ME around the kitchen!!  I hate all my cookbooks from Culinary school...so heavy...so boring!  So nice to have such an easy to read, fun & ohhh so sensual cookbook now!  
 Terry Brooks never fails to amaze me...(which is probably why he's my favorite author); Armageddon's Children was fantastic!  And much like his other books, I couldn't put this one down!   I was totally drawn in with this story line and the characters.  One of the things I enjoyed while reading this, was how it made me think about how I would handle myself in this sort of situation, should it arise. And, if there is anything I can do to help prevent it from happening.  So not only was it thoroughly entertaining, it was also thought provoking.   When I reached the end, I was immediately wanting to read more of the story!  I can't wait until the next one comes out!  If you've read and loved any of Terry Brooks' other books, then you MUST read this one! 
 the book was well written and had all the info. i was looking for 
 This book is an excellent resource and presents many beautiful shoji lamp styles and accommpanying plans to make them.  Reading it has resulted in our having now completed 8 lamps, 6 for our own home and 2 for friends.  We recommend the book 
 For those diagnosed with fibro or who have a family member or friend with fibro, this is a good read.  Because contributions are made from women who have fibromyalgia, their suggestions and comments are real life, things we can put into practice.  It is a lot more applicable than others I have read 
 I am an elementary school principal.  I read this book at a faculty meeting and to parents at a PTO meeting.  Both groups loved it and several teachers have since shared it with their classes.  A great book to explain the complexities of learning to read 
 Reviewed by Joanne Benham for Reader Views (09/06)  The Camel Club is back in this new book by David Baldacci.  We first met the Camel Club in the book of the same name.  The Camel Club is a group of four men; the unlikeliest group of people you would ever think would be friends.  Their occupations range from cemetery caretaker to a conservator of rare books in the Library of Congress. While some people might call them conspiracy theorists, they prefer to think of themselves as observers of the government.    When the Speaker of the House is gunned down, the blame was laid at the door of terrorists.  But the Camel Club is not convinced of that, especially when the wealthy director of Rare Books and Special Collections Division of the Library of Congress dies in a strange manner.  The coroner rules death by natural causes, but the Camel Club is not convinced and sets out to get the answer.  And then to throw some more grease on the fire, the author brings in Annabelle Conroy, a scheming con artist who plans on walking off with $30 million dollars swindled from an Atlantic City casino.    A thoroughly fun read, I enjoyed it immensely.  Although a long book (432 pages) it only dragged in one place, a fact easily overlooked.   
 This book has plenty of pockets and forms for filling out information and forms for just forms.  I have had this book for a while now and it has saved me a lot of time and trouble.  I would definately recommend buying this book.  It's organized and absolutely beautiful which inspires my creativity.  The only thing I wish it had are deadline and time of arrival sheets for members of my wedding party and venues so that I can tear them out and make sure each person has one.  Other than that -- this book is awesome 
 I love this pot.  These items are a bit pricey but are worth it 
 I agree with Ariel, mother's should keep a sense of humor and remember not to neglect their own needs.  A happy mother is better for any child.  I think of the instructions for an emergency on an airplane, a parent needs to take care of herself first and then take care of the child. That is what's best for the child 
 Nyssa has few memories; dreams are the majority of her reality. Amnesia has hidden her importance in the struggle between humans and goblins, but when she begins to know that she has information critical to the war, she places herself in danger. To keep her safe, Jack Frost, the death fey/boss on the side of light dispatches Abrial, a dreamwalker of the Unseelie court. Her dreams made Abrial love her, but he believed that to be a doomed love. Even if she could defy his moira and love him, inside her is a dark secret that her own father would kill her to take.   **** With unerring surety, another Wildside romance enchants readers, daring them to love. The pace remains tense and fast through the climatic finale. Ms. Jackson deftly balances the elements of romance, magic, and adventure to complement each other. Sadly, we will have somewhat of a wait until she escorts us to through this dangerous world again. Whatever comes next, it will be good. ****   Amanda Killgore for Huntress Reviews

Amanda Richards, September 24, 2006 
 The author of this book starts out by saying, "As simple as familiar objects may seem at first glance, their conception, development, manufacturing and marketing may pose great difficulties". He goes on to prove that this is true by citing the histories of some very familiar items.   His first example is the ordinary paper clip. Literally hundreds of improvement patents have been issued, yet it is still not "perfected". The most common clip was given its present form by a company called Gem Ltd. in the last century and is still referred to in the industry as the "Gem" clip. Inventors are still trying to overcome its negative features. The author lists several shortcomings such as its tendency to tear paper, requiring its loops to be spread when clipping on, and its habit of slipping off thick stacks of paper.  Next he considers the common wood-cased pencil. When wax was added to the lead for smoother writing and added to the wood for easier sharpening, the lead often separated from the wood and would break when the pencil was used or even when dropped. Etching the lead surface and coating it with a suitable chemical solved this problem. However, overcoming the BOPP (Broken-Off Pencil Point) problem has not been as easy. Understanding why points fracture as they do is far from as simple as you might think.  His next case history is that of the zipper. In patent literature, they go back to 1851! The description of its evolution is fascinating. There is a great sketch of the tooling that applies the zipper teeth to the fabric.  The author notes how ideas often come unexpectedly -- but usually to individuals who can see the idea's potential. He relates how de Mestral, after walking his dog in the Alpine woodlands, saw cockleburs on his trousers and on his dog's fur -- and saw the potential for what became Velcro.   Yet another captivating case history is the section on plastic zippers. He details the story from an inventor in Denmark, to British investors, to refugees from Romania, to a Japanese inventor who extruded tubular film with grips -- which became the familiar Ziplock.  The author notes how the acronym, MAYA, has become the buzz term for designers. It stands for Most Advanced Yet Acceptable. In other words, if your invention is too different from present designs, it may not find acceptance.  The history of aluminum cans provides fodder for another exciting chapter. Here is a product that must use a very minimum of material and still safely resist 100 pounds per square inch of pressure. However, it must readily "fail" when the pop-top is actuated. Some 100 billion(!) beverage cans are made each year. Think what a design savings of a few percent of aluminum would be worth to the industry.  The sketch of Alexander Bain's facsimile machine of 1843 will shake up those who think the fax machine is the latest thing in technology. In this rundown on the evolution of the fax, the author notes how consumers often decide the winning technology. He cites the victory of the VHS video cassette over the technically better (picture quality) of the Beta cassette.  When inventing and engineering, the human factor must never be forgotten. A computer-controlled airplane crashed because a pilot mistook a rate-of-descent display reading of 33 for 3.3!   That an art is old and simple does not mean design caution is not required. A Roman aquaduct in 97 AD delivered 40 million gallons of water daily to Rome. Yet when New York's World Trade Center, 110 stories high, was completed in 1973, it was found that the water pressure was not high enough to properly flush toilets on the observation deck!   There are no equations or computations in this book -- it is an easy read. It beautifully conveys the lesson that there are no "simple" inventions -- and no such thing as "routine" designing 
 I am quickly becoming a fan of the Dover Thrift editions of classic literature. They are well-made, sturdy, and a great bargain. All of them that I have bought and assigned to my students have been $2.50. What can you buy for $2.50 anymore? Now you can have an entire library of unabridged classics at a more than reasonable rate.  Jonathan Swift's "Gullivers Travels" is no exception to the rule. This brilliant 18th century satire endures to our times. Swift, in turns, attacks (in his subversive way) makind's vanities, follies, cruelties, and morals. The floating island crushing the lower island is still, to my mind, the best attack on England's merciless domination of Ireland.   Some readers think: "I've heard so much about this book, but I didn't think it was so great." Certainly, our expectations about something that is considered a classic may outweigh the book itself. Please put aside whatever you might have heard and approach this book with an open mind. You will see it for the monument of English literature that it is.  Rocco Dormarunno College of New Rochell 
 As a certified yoga teacher, I have found this book to be a good, basic source of information. Perfect for passing on to beginning students who would like to know more about yoga, it's beginnings and how it can and will affect their bodies. Easy to navigate. I would use this as a supplement to practice with and instructor or video 
 Mr. Hitchens has another gem in this excellent book. As a reader of many books on Thomas Jefferson, I found this book to have tid bits I never knew.  Like on page 22 where on reads that it was because Mr. Jefferson was famed as a drafter of resolutions, writer of great explicatory force, and thoughtful compromiser, that he was called upon to draw up the Declaration of Independence.  Page 23 'There is no other example in history, apart from the composition of the King James version of the Bible, in which great words and concepts have been fused into poetic prose by the banal processes of a committee.'   Page 26 'Thomas Jefferson, indeed, is one of the small handful of people to have his very name associated with a form of democracy.'  Page 43 'Jefferson was not a man of the Enlightenment only in the ordinary sense that he believed in reason or perhaps rationality. He was very specifically one of those who believed that human redemption lay in education, discovery, innovation and experiment.'   Page 44 Jefferson, too, considered himself a scientist. He studied botany, fossils, crop cycles, and animals. He made copious notes on what he saw. He designed a new kind of plow, which would cut a deeper furrow in the soil exhausted by the false economy of tobacco farming. He was fascinated by the invention of air balloons, which he instantly saw might provide a new form of transport as well as a new form of warfare. He enjoyed surveying and prospecting and when whaling became an important matter in the negotiation of a commercial treaty, wrote a treatise on the subject himself.'  Have read some on Sally Heming, but the author writes some interesting aspects not focused on by other authors. 'Sally Hemings was the grandaughter of one while slaveholder and the daughter of another, John Wayles. Mr Wayles was also the father of Thomas Jeffersons wife, Martha, so that the wife and the later Mistress were in fact half sisters. To say that there was any taboo on 'inter-racial' sex or 'miscegenation' at Monticello would therefore be to exaggerate considerably.  And. although she was certainly a slave by virtue of being Jeffersons legal property, Sally as I shall now call her had not been subjected to the indignities and humiliations of fieldwork and the lash. ..... She had been in the room when Martha Jefferson died and had heard Jefferson promise his dying wife never to marry again.'  I would simply note that visually Ms. Heming was probably much lighter skinned than someone like Hallie Berry whose father was black. Thus Ms. Heming would have had the small amount of black blood that would legally have made her black, but would visually have made her white.   Page 171 Declining Years, one reads 'The establishment of the University of Virginia was one of only three of his achievements that Jefferson felt worthy of commemoration on his headstone.   But its page 180 onward that I don't think most lovers of Jefferson have heard about. Namely the fact that Jefferson believed that Indians (Native Americans) should be protected from Christian missionaries.  Or on page 182 where one learns that in 1904 it became the custom of the United States Senate to present new members with a copy of what is known as the Jefferson Bible, on the day of their swearing in.  This version of the Bible written by Jefferson, is small, because it is basically just the writings of what Jesus was supposed to have said, and not what Paul and others said and wrote, which many don't think had anything to do with Jesus at all.  On page we read 'In May 1824 an itinerant scholar and book peddler names Samuel Whitcomb paid a call at Monticello and found Jefferson himself answering the door'. They then had an intense visit and 'When the inescapable matter of religion was raised, Jefferson became irascible:  He remarked in reply to me that Paul was the first who had perverted the Doctrines of Christ. I made some remarks and concluded by saying that the Clergy in our County were investigating these subjects with considerable independence. He dissented and expressed himself warmly in a phrase which I suppose was not English but some other language 'The Clergy were all ....' It was evident to me that he held the Clergy in general in perfect contempt, and that he thought little of Theological investigation...'  Again I simply say that this book is a real gem and one I am proud to have in our extensive home library

 This is sea warfare at its most daring and prophetic best. Every scene sizzles and excites. Just as buddies in battle bond, so does the reader to every character, and no less to the whip-smart yet strangely patriotic villain pitted against the gambling U.S. president. My bungie test of a superb novel is if the author can hold my attention throughout the first read without my being aware of the writing techniques used. Jeff Edwards propelled me through the pages at supersonic speed, so I resented the stop-dead lurches back into the real world four times with chapter insertions of excerpts from an unpublished manuscript on the "Torpedo: The History and Evolution of a Killing Machine." These belonged under Author Notes at the end of the book. Then I would have been ready and fascinated with such a backgrounder, but not while I was so engaged in the story. Fiction is about entertainment. Education is only a by-product of a good tale that gets the facts straight. Mid-novel, readers don't expect to have lessons shoved in their face. Nevertheless, the story was so riveting that I have decided to forgive this first-time novelist for his over-enthusiastic treatment of the main subject. Instead, his editor needs to be hung upside down by his/her toenails for allowing the intrusions. Here is a techno-military thriller writer, who never overwhelms the reader with the technology of his subject, but rather spreads it like maple syrup over thick, mouth-melting pancakes. William Morrow, Berkley publishers--pay attention!!! This should be a best-selling winner on your shelves. I am giving TORPEDO the five-star rating it so obviously deserves.                                                                                                                     
 I gor these for Christmas.  Love them.  Great quality and great fit 
 This is a rich and wonderful book about life. This is one book that was so good that I bought multiple copies and gave them to all my children. I have read it again and still have great pleasure in it. Read it and you will see. It made me proud to be a human being 
 As a filmmaker researching a documentary about innovators and inventors, I bought this book after hearing the author speak on NPR. Having recently spent time with a famous inventor I was intrigued to learn more about what made people like him "tick", which seemed to be the subject "Juice" was attempting to tackle. Imagine my joy when I saw the name of the man I met listed in the inside cover as one of the people Evan Schwartz chose to study in this incredibly informative, inspiring and easy to read book.   Choosing to explain through example, Schwartz brings to the forefront the incredible stories of some of the most fascinating thinkers (and doers) living today, most of them completely unknown to the general public. In case after case the building blocks of innovation come to life in compelling fashion and it is not long before the reader concludes, as guided by the author, that behind the seeming randomness of invention is a systematic process that can be studied and emulated.   Through meticulous (and probably very fun) research, Schwartz has discovered a through-line in the lives of great inventors froma variety of disciplines that serves to explain or at least illuminate a process that has heretofor been largely ignored. At the very least, if similar research already existed, it has not been made nearly as accesible or compelling.   The book is also amazingly up to date and does a great job of leading you toward some pretty profound realizations about our potential future and the kind of people who will help guide us into it.   There are few stones left unturned, including obvuoius icons of our history like Bell, Edison, Goodyear, Ford, Farnsworth (whom the author has written another book about that I look forward to reading) and others.  Lastly, as someone who has always feared that the sparks of innovation firing within me are doomed to be stifled by the conventions of everyday life, this book (more than others I've read) allowed me to identify profoundly with many of the peculiar processes and tendancies identified by the author. This was an unexpected bonus that accompanied an otherwise fulfilling education and opened a door I look forward to diving through hence forth. Given that one of his key arguments is that many people can nurture the part of our brains that lead to innovative thinking and invention once they understand how and why it works, I imagine many other readers will be equally stimulated.  
 More my type than Tim McGraw...love the range and colors of his voice, strong and sweet.  Anybody know if he's single?  Anyhow, good songs, some more country than others 
 My children really enjoy the stories in this book. We use this book as part of our homeschooling. My children have no problem understanding what is read. I like the way in which the stories are told that makes them easy to understand 
 Lermontov's propensity to duel probably gave him the insight to create perhaps the most exciting duel scene in any book I've read.  However, it got him killed, leaving behind this lone work of prose.  One can only speculate as to what Lermontov would have written if he was not much like his hero Pechorin.    As for the book, it was an exhilerating read.  I read it for a Russian history class and I've never had a better discussion in any class than for "A Hero of Our Time".  The book touches on so many feelings of disatisfaction combined with apathy that so many feel today.  Along with the romantic tone of the story, one would hardly need to be a snobby reader to enjoy it.  Highly recommended is not strong enough language for, in my opinion, the best story Russian literature has to offer 
 This was an amazing book!MHC SERIOUSLY kept you guessing until the end. The side clues, forget those, but if your a regular MHC book reader, then the serial killer would have been on your list of suspects. I could describe this book in three adjectives: Freaky, scary, spine tingling! If your a fan you'll love it and I so recomend it 
 I've purchased this book for my daughter who is almost 9 years old, I end up reading it before her.  This book is great for growing up kids; how wonderful and variable it is to have a friend he/she can depend on and be with to share fun, sad and so so stories to one another.    Wonderful, educational and life experience can be experience in this boo 
 In "Shrub", columnist Molly Ivins offers amusing anecdotes paired with grim statistics that make it necessary to reread them to make sure they're really true. She delves into Bush's laissez-faire attitude toward education, health, law and prison reform among others. Even those well versed in Bush's misdeeds will likely find something new and/or surprising here. The book is not a no-holds-barred attack on Dubya, however; credit is giving to him for his accomplishments, however minor. There is, however, a definite liberal bent 
 My original copy (1977) of Maida Heatter's Book of Great Cookies was just about to fall apart from all of the use it gets from me.  I have yet to make a cookie from Maida's recipes that hasn't been delicious!  I am thrilled to be able to purchase a new book to take over from my old tired copy!  All my friends just love the cookies that come from this book and look forward to them every Christmas 
 I bought this album on a whim.  I've had it for about two months and it has become one of my favorites.  It is not passive ambient sounds. It is  engaging and moving.  About two weeks ago, I took the top off my car and  drive thru the desert and listened to this album. The experience was so  awesome that I cancelled all my appointments and turned around and drove  back thru the desert listening to this album.  It cost me some major  bucks-but hey, it was worth every penny and you only go around once, so  enjoy. Get this album 
 Dean Tonsing's book rings as true as anything I have seen concerning the pressures, challenges, and pitfalls of law school.  His practical and insightful advice should be required reading for every law student -- first, in the summer before law school begins and, second, throughout the first year.    My own experiences as a law student and my years as a law professor have convinced me that the first year of law school is one of the most difficult -- and sometimes most traumatic -- challenges students will ever face in their professional lives.  The learning curve for new students is vertical; the competition is unlike anything most have encountered before; the learning and teaching styles are unfamiliar; the material is dense and its logic difficult to master; and the assessments require preparation techniques foreign to most students' experiences.  To help students confront those difficulties, Dean Tonsing rightly begins by focusing the students on the goal:  becoming competent, in three years, to be trusted with their clients' interests in their property, their liberty, and sometimes even their lives.  The sooner a student grasps that the profession of the law begins on the first day of law school, the sooner that student will begin to develop into a competent lawyer.    Dean Tonsing presents invaluable advice on managing that shift from undergraduate to professional and on mastering the nuts and bolts of learning the law.  Law students who put his advice into practice will find this book to be one of the most valuable resources they will encounter in their three years of study 
 I read Desperation and enjoyed it immensely much like i did with The Regulators also. This book is filled with suspense from page one. The book never drags in my opinion. This book though is not for the faint of heart. If you don't enjoy high body counts and gore then you will not like this book and will most likely put it down by the second chapter. But if you don't mind it at all like me you will enjoy the suspense he gives you and the twists and turns this book takes. The ending is by far the most suspenseful part. I also recommend reading Desperation first because you will probably understand it better and get a better look on what Tak is all about. The journal entries and newspaper articles are a very nice touch to the story and it lets you understand what is going on alot better also. I wish there was a part three to this but sadly there isn't. I can't choose between Desperation and Regulators because their both great but The Regulators does have the more suspenseful end to it. Although it is alot bloodier and may you even get a brief lump in your throat like i did when a tragic thing happens in the end. Keep up the good work King 
 I HAD BEEN SEARCHING FOR THIS DVD FOR SOME TIME--  I WAS HAPPY TO FIND IT HERE AND I AM VERY PLEASED WITH IT.  THE SOUND IS GREAT AND THE VIDEO IS VERY SHARP. I WOULD RECCOMEND IT  
 This is a very passionate love story infused with traditional recipes, flavors and traditions from Mexico. I have read this book many times. It is a pretty quick read but a feast for the senses.  Through the eyes of Tita, we feel pain, longing and passion to the fullest extent. Romance and fairy tales. War and lost love.  Suffering and pleasure beyond mortal comprehension.  I highly recommend reading this. I enjoyed the movie as well, but the book is to treasure.  
 This is far and away the best book I've seen for people contemplating building or remodeling a home. Truly innovative designs that fall somewhere outside the traditional box of thinking in terms of floor plans and details create truly distinctive homes. A great place to start if you're considering major changes in your home 
 During my undergraduate school, I used this book extensively. It gave me a solid advantage over other students. Other students would still be struggling, after a week of a lab, to do its related simulations, while I used to finish my work on the same day we had the lab. If you want to learn how to use PSpice, this is the book. Its style to teach by example and all the examples are on the CD along with a student version of the PSpice which is good enough for learning purposes 
 This is a glorious movie....reminds you of the never-ending impact that the Church has and continues to have on western civilization.  The Jesuits are bad-a--....brave, devout, strong. What a shame that secular powers get in the way of the Church doing God's work. 
 This is not the sort of book I would normally be drawn to and what a wonderful suprise it was for me. The writing is truely extraordinary and the author has the ability to paint with words so that even a person who has never experienced this young girls experiences is able to feel the feelings and see the places. I was sorry when the book was over and am looking forward to reading her other book. 
 This review is for the Ballantine Books hardcover first edition, October 1999, 346 pages.  THE TWISTED ROOT was on the USA Today top 150 best seller list for seven weeks in September and October 2000, reaching a peak position of forty.  By the end of 2006, Ms. Perry had 23 novels on the USA Today list.  This is a splendid novel set in London in midsummer 1860.  It begins with the abrupt departure and disappearance of Miriam Gardiner, a commoner, from a garden party celebrating her betrothal to Lucius Stourbridge, a younger man of considerable means.  Lucius hires William Monk, an agent of inquiry, to find his fiancée.  With the particulars of this mystery launched, the story switches to Monk's recent bride, Hester, who is a volunteer nurse at the North London Hospital, which has a mystery of its own - medicines are disappearing.  These two plots will intertwine.  Within this historical setting, the author crystallizes progress in the past hundred and fifty years.  I cringed at the subservient role of women in general back then, and the pitiful concept of the nursing profession in particular.  Within this context, the author portrays determined efforts of strong minded women struggling without much wiggle room.  However, to do this, there is excessive narration of the character's internal thoughts, the nuances of them, sometimes convoluted.  If these were related through dialogue and body language, the read would be livelier.  Masterful plotting drives this story.  Around page 204, the culprit narrows to one of two characters; an experienced mystery reader would know which one.  But why?  Later, the author, instead of adding some implausible twist, explicitly eliminates cute surprises and gives the reader subtle clues, which keeps you turning pages, trying to figure the TWISTED relationships of secrets within secrets.  This is edge of your seat plausible complexity with historical subtext. 
 Jude  I've just read the book Jude, by Kate Morgenroth.  Jude is a fiction, and was about a kid name Jude who had a whole bunch of problems in his life.  He isn't such a happy kid and in the beginning of the book his father is murdered.    This book as I said is a fictional mystery.  Jude the main character's dad was killed for not paying money to certain people.  Jude was there and witnessed his dad's death, right in front of his eyes.  But the killer of his dad let Jude live, only if Jude wouldn't mention it to anyone, in that case Jude would have a couple more problems.  After the death of his father Jude thinks he has no where to live, but he is wrong.  He was always told by his dad that his mom left him at birth but that was a lie.  He met his mom who had to interrogate him for the first real time in his life at 15 years old.  His mom says that his dad kidnapped him when he was only 3 weeks old.  She than proved that by showing him newspapers about the incident.  So Jude was happy to move in with his mom and have a real life, maybe.  I personally really liked this book, but than again I like most mystery's that I read.  So I was "on the end of my seat".  I would recommend the book to all people who like the mystery genre and I think you will like it a lot.  So, all in all I think that Jude is a very good book to read, I am definitely not a big reader and this book was still very interesting to me.  I give it 4 stars for a reason if you give the book a try I'm pretty positive that you will be happy with it.  
 I like the head cover quality and appearance. The only slight negative is that the covers fit a little more snuggly than I would like (need to work them over the head a bit) and my fairway woods are the old Haig Ultra's that are quite small. This is not bad though, and I will get use to it and they will probably loosen up 
 I discovered this movie about 10 years ago in a college library and was thrilled to find it on DVD. It is a tremendous slice of life that opened my mind, a true story that I still enjoy, and a cultural eye-opener everyone should have.  Iron & Silk is not a glossy Hollywood production, which makes the experience much more visceral. There is no dramatic training montage, no series of Wushu fights leading to a climactic confrontation. There is plenty of heart and soul in the characters. The conflict/resolution is of the every-day style and reminds one that our world is small only when our minds aren't.  Remember the idealism we had in our early twenties, that we could make things right by sheer force of will, or becoming self-defined iconoclasts? Mark Salzman's story captures that spirit without indulging in vainglorious self-aware examinations. And it holds true to the dreams of being something more, for the sheer joy of it 
 As I write this review I can't help but remember when I loved the Rugrats.  It was once my favorite show in television as a kid.  And when the movie came out in theaters I was more excited than anyone would've imagined.  I was a huge fan.  The TV show has decreased in quality, but the movie still remains solid.  It introduced a new character to the series, and to this day still remains the greatest adventure that the rugrats have gone on.   Didi has recently found out she's pregnant, and that means Tommy is getting a baby brother.  When Tommy's new brother Dil is born, things around the house change.  Dil begins to receive a bit more attention than Tommy, and he's always loud and obnoxious... the way Tommy used to be when he was first born.  Phil, Lil, and Chuckie can't stand him and neither can Angelica.   In the meantime, Stewie has made a new invention.  A Reptar mobile (Reptar is the Rugrats version of "Godzilla" and the babies' hero).  When Stu and Didi head out for a while, they leave the kids home alone with Grandpa.  If you've watched the show you know Grandpa is not a good baby sitter... he always falls asleep, and that's what he does here.   The babies see this Reptar mobile and decide to hop inside and play around.  Angelica (the rambuncious three year old brat) is trying to watch her show and so she is very annoyed.  She gives the babies the boot (literally) and the Reptar wagon suddenly slides out the front door.  Tommy has little idea how to control it, and neither do his friends.  Phil and Lil, however, don't see it as such a bad thing.  To them it's a chance to take new-born baby Dil back to the hospital.  With the babies gone, Angelica can finally find peace... except there's a problem.  When she gave the babies the boot they took her favorite doll Cynthia with them!  Now Angelica decides she must find them, and so she saddles up the family dog, Spike.  And Spike ends up running out the front door... dragging Angelica along.    The result?  The babies getting lost in the forest far away from home.  When the parents find out, they go on a large search for the babies.    I suppose what got me to really like this movie was the adventure of it.  The little imagination of these babies is amazing!  The movie even begins with a little rendition of "Indiana Jones" as they're actually exploring thier house.  But when they really AREN'T in a place that's their home, you can see just how brave they get.    Never mind how stupid the parents are (they NEVER learn from leaving the babies with Grandpa), the adventure is exciting.  Especially when Phil and Lil manage to let a bunch of monkey's take Dil away.  Soon Tommy really IS the one responsible for his brother.  The movie is funny in many places, and it's songs are enlightening.  Any child will enjoy this movie to death.  Unlike it's sequel, the babies get into some trouble that isn't too far beyond their control.  By that I mean, the Reptar mobile is just a wagon, and not some HUGE GIGANTIC THING DESTROYING THE CITY!  This adventure is more REAL than in the sequel, "Rugrats in Paris".    And while Dil isn't the most likeable character, it's unrealistic to think he can do as much as the other babies can (he can't walk, mind you).  It would help if Dil was as adventureous as his brother, but considering he's only a few weeks old, we can get by.    The animation is top notch, and very vivid and vibrant.  Much better than the television show ever was.  It's just incredible.   If there were problems I'd say it's this: It is certainly not a movie for grown ups.  If you grew up with the Rugrats as I did, you will probably like this movie.  However, grown ups who didn't grow up with the Rugrats, will be annoyed by their kids loving to watch the film.  It is clearly aimed at the younger audience.    It's a great movie.  Especially for your kids, and especially for nostalgia.  This was an incredible movie eight years ago, and remains a good movie for your kids today.  
 I first read this book in middle school after reading Anne of Green Gables. When I first got to college, I was having a hard time adjusting and rediscovering this book made it so much more bearable to be away from home. L. M. Montgomery captures the feelings of homesickness and confusion so beautifully. Every time I need a pick me up, I just go back to the novel. 
 Many of us have dreamt about writing a hit song, right?  How many actually have?  Yip, I too, have tried my hand at penning song lyrics but found out that there's much more to it than writing a few rhyming lines.  Two-time Oscar winner ("The Morning After" from The Poseidon Adventure and "We May Never Love Like This Again" from The Towering Inferno) Joel Hirschhorn, gives us the necessary tools to write a song correctly.  He emphasizes the need to think visually, to find ideas, become a storyteller, and "how to analyze hit songs and song titles to see what works and why".  One's emotions are a huge well of inspiration if we learn to write about them.  This book is divided into five parts and covers all aspects from collecting song titles to hooks and from country to the stage and movie songs.  He also covers working as a collaborator and about royalties and payment and copyright.  Throughout this book you'll find references to some great songwriter or other as well as hints and tips, which I found very interesting.  There's a comprehensive glossary and appendix which is extremely helpful, with names and addresses of record companies, publishers, and competitions.  The best news is that you don't have to be musically inclined to write songs.  It helps but is not a requirement!  
 There are four character in this story.  They are Mole, Fox, raccoon and skunk.  Mole digging annoys fox, racoon and skunk. Fox says she has to stop digging and move when the maple leaves turn red and orange. Mole doesn't want to move and she gets an idea. So when raccoon and skunk come to check if she is getting ready to move they're in for a big surprise. I liked this because it has beautiful picture they look like they are made out of ribbons with little black dots on them. My favorite character is Mole because she has a smart mind and great ideas. 
 i new reader to this guys books. i just say that of what i have read i look forward to reading this guy next books

 I will skip the debate about which hikes are the world's greatest, and greatly admire this book as a current, concise and nicely illustrated presentation.  Potterfield lays it out as clearly as a trail guide and attractively as a travel agent.  But most of all, these are all hikes he has made. Very professional and personal.  This book has made me change my choices of which hikes to ad to my life list (Buckskin Gulch, Utah) and which to just read about in amazement (Kalalau Trail, Hawaii).  I was thrilled to see that I had been in the areas close to some trails that he describes: Grand Canyon, Mt Rainier, White Mountains of New Hampshire, Vancouver Island, and the North Cascades.  The book inspires me to revisit these places with better plan and preparation.  And he re-hikes one of the great survival hikes in history: the Shackleton Crossing of South Georgia Island.  Nice to read of Potterfield's crossing of the same route - even well equipped he labels it a moderate physical challenge, but a much greater psychological challenge - even for a modern trek, weather there is the biggest factor    I found some hikes that I should re-considered now - The John Muir Trail seems not to be the over-crowded trail I had thought it to be, and is back on the list.  I wasn't looking for a technical manual, nor a travel brochure, this hits just right - human impressions of some great hikes, clear suggestions for what I may find there, and discussions of logistics, strategy, hazards and seasons.  I got two copies of this excellent book, deciding that it would make a great gift for a well-traveled relative who is now an armchair trekker 
 I must admit Anne Tyler is not my favourite author, although I have read all her books.  Somehow, her humour does not shine through as it does with authors such as Dorothea Benton Franks and Lolly Winston. However, "Ladder of Years" is my favourite of Tyler's novels and it is easy to see why it once placed in Time's top ten books of the year.  The book is based around a woman in search of herself and life's purpose.  Many readers will ask, "How could she go to the beach with her family, take a walk down the shoreline and intentionally disappear?"  It might be something many woman have light-heartedly contemplated at least once in their lifetime, but most likely never followed through.  There are some very unique, well developed characters in this book and it becomes a real page turner.  As for the ending, some will say she did the right thing, others may disagree. She really does have "two separate lives" on the go - which one will she choose?  Although the book was most enjoyable, the plot did not seem realistic or plausible and, for this reason, lost a star in the rating.  Overall, it is still the best of Tyler.  
 If you follow any form of athletics/sports today, you have probably heard the phrase, "Training and Nutrition are much more scientific today than they were in the past, so that the athletes of today are bigger, stronger and faster...etc."   If you ever wondered what they meant by that, as I did, I believe this book will begin to show you what they mean.  I found the nutrition and supplement part of this book particularly interesting, because it shows the `science' of eating right.  In this section the authors not only do a great job in breaking down the basics, like what are the good fats and bad fats, the good carbs and bad carbs, etc., but they also go into easily understood detail about what the body needs, and when it needs it.  There are one or two paragraphs in this section about the post workout meal that they `guaranteed' would help increase your body sculpting results 10-fold, and after a few weeks of using it, I would have to agree that it is making a difference.  Again, it's eating the right foods at the right times.  They explain how and why.  Their explanation of proper form while exercising really struck home with me as well.  Even though I always knew it was important, the reasons were never explained to me as clearly as they were in this book.  Again, after reading their in depth descriptions of the various exercises and how to perform them correctly, I have begun seeing and feeling much better results from each of my workouts.  Correct form targets and isolates the preferred muscle group in ways that poor form and cheating never do.  As an example, I could never get a good `burn' in my chest workouts.  After reading their descriptions on the chest exercises, I realized I was using too much of my shoulders in the exercises.  They explained how to correct that and now I am getting the burn in my pecs that have avoided me for 20+ years of on again, off again, weight training.  Buy this book, and read it.  You won't be disappointed. 
 When I first started reading this book, the story seemed so outlandish that it all seemed too silly.  Soon, though, I realized that it was a satirical look at a serious subject (censorship) and that the humor was actually a very effective way of getting the point across.  The story is told in letters, predominantly between 19-yo cousins Tassie and Ella but occasionally in letters from or to their parents, neighbors and the Nazi-like town council that begins prohibiting the use of letters of the alphabet as they fall from their hero's statue (Nollop, inventor of the sentence "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."--of note because it contains every letter of the English alphabet).  The idea that a government, especially one in a society as literate and as committed to honoring the English language as this one, would strangle its citizens with such laws is ludicrous; it is not only interesting but amusing to see how the community deals with the laws and their effects.  First, like sheep being led to slaughter and, later, taking charge of their own destinies.  I found Ella Minnow Pea a very quick and enjoyable read.  It is light and funny but yet gives you something to think about.  If you are a fan of language, you will likely enjoy it.  It is rare that I come across a book that has a word in it with which I am not familiar; this book contained MANY words unfamiliar to me--a truly impressive level of vocabulary (though some words were, I think, coined by the islanders as a way of dealing with the prohibited letters).  I recommend this book--especially for those who, like I, are concerned about the direction OUR society is taking in terms of censorship 
 The track listing for the version I purchased is:  1. My Favorite Things 17:52  2. Mr. P.C.            8:10  3. Tranening In       11:40  The first song should be familiar to those of you who know Julie Andrews and The Sound of Music. It's basically three jazzy instrumentals heavily influenced with saxophones, piano and drums. I would recommend buying it if you're not  sure and are curious about Coltrane. This is supposed to be one of his essential albums. I didn't realize when I purchased this album that this was a condensed version of the original album. 
 Great-fitting, durable, figure-improving hose for taller women is hard to find.  Your product is beyond compare--no one else comes close to you in creating comfortable, beautiful, supportive, figure-enhancing panty hose that feel SECURE!  Please don't change a thing!!!! 
 From the beginning, with the dinosaurs and beavers to the lives of fictional characters one can immediately click with, Centennial is definitely a must read for anyone remotely interested in historical fiction and the Colorado area. Michener seamlessly displays the many angles and stories, intertwining them so that you aren't bored and you see the larger picture. When I was living in the newly named Centennial, formerly Englewood in CO, I was drawn to the coincidence and background of the area. The parts with the Native Americans being slaughtered was moving. 
 My daughter received this for her 1st birthday last summer and she loves it!  It is very durable and roomy.  Sometimes my daughter stands on the lid (she is now 2 and weighs 28 lbs.) but I can just pop it back into original shape.  I did read previous reviews regarding the lid but the lid on my sandbox is VERY sturdy and has not blown off (though the umbrella has numerous times).  Again, this was purchase last summer so I think the lid has changed.  The only problem is that the lid is slightly heavy and akward for me to put back on.  My daughter can get in and out of the picnic table without my help and it is a perfect size for her.  The table is roomy enough for her cousins (ages 2 and 4) to sit with her.     
 It is with gratitude and relief that  I study this translation of the Dhammapada. The simplicity and bareness  of  the language allows the truth beyond the words to slowly penetrate my body and spirit. I am carried by the rhythms and substance of the phrases to ever-deepening understandings. This is the most accessible translation of any sutta that I have been privileged to read 
 I was about to purchase a new boat that I really couldn't afford, when I came across Quick & Easy Boat Maintenance.  It helped me restore my boat with minimal pain and suffering.  Now I wouldn't sell it for the  world, but if I did, I also have the plus of knowing I can get top dollar  for my newly restored shining clean vessel.  Sandy's tips are clearly and  concisely written and VERY easy to use.  I keep this book on board with me  at all times in case of mechanical problem 
 I love this story.  It tells the story of the Dead Sea Scrolls and brings them to life for me.  I enjoyed the heroine, Dinah, because she seemed to be a real person.  This was my favorite Peters mystery that did not feature Amelia Peabody.  Peters love affair with Egypt is clear and this mystery did not disappoint me.

 This is a must have for Bond enthusiasts.  This movie put Bond over the top 
 Usually people don't complain about receiving money from an anonymous source, but Investigator Kinsey Millhone knows that she needs to report the $5000 which has mysteriously appeared in her bank account.  No one seems to know where the money has come from and soon it is all part of a problem that involves Kinsey as a suspect in an insurance fraud case.  As she delves into the investigation, she uncovers a prominent family's secrets and continues to get into trouble herself.  As usual, Kinsey's investigation causes physical danger to her, until she hunts down the perpetrator.  This is another good read from Sue Grafton 
 For a work of non-fiction, this book actually is pretty interesting.  Prose takes you through the history of gluttony and brings us to our present culture that is obsessed with weight, food, and body image.  Gluttony is the reason why people spend billions of dollars a year on weight loss drugs, supplements, and equipment.  She really does a wonderful job at pointing out the transition of the sin of gluttony through history and how today it is a complete contradiction as people adore a thin, lean body, but are always interested in the latest food craze, or what McDonalds next big thing will be.  Although Prose did not really tell me anything I did not already know, I was satisfied with this book as a way of putting a reality forth that most people ignore or purposely overlook 
 If you want to learn as a novice the tales of Shakespeare, then this is the book to read. A children's novel of his famous plays. Now to the English Shakespearean scholar this would seem like Shakespeare for dummies, but I would only partially agree. This is a great book to be introduced and gives a general framework before reading him. Even after reading this, its not an easy task trying to read Elizabethan English, which even the experts argue on some of the terms and expressions used. And so, this book lets you understand and I find its written rather well in Charles and Mary Lambs authorship.  After reading this book, which also make good for second, third and fourth readings, I found it much easier to absorb a recent bio on Shakespeare which was very enlightening, Will of the World by Stephen Greenblatt and also other books which attempt explanatory meanings of Elizabethan English to his plays and sonnets. Now you know what the plays are about and go from there. This is a great book, I treasure it 
 Right now I'm wondering why this book only has four stars. I personally found it one of Ms. Cabot's best works. It has everything that a good book needs: A little mystery, a main character who is likable and who has some faults, and romance.   Okay, and there's two really hot guys in here too. But give me a break. Guys are one of my few weaknesses. Along with chocolate.  Anyway, I really enjoyed this story. I usually read Christian based novels, but this one didn't have anything too bad in it.   Basically, if you want a quick summary of this book, its about a woman in her late twenties that used to be a singer but gained some weight and now works in a college dorm. She lives with her ex-fiances brother, Cooper, rent free, and has a doggie, whose name I have forgotten.   Some mysterious things start to happen around the dorm and two young girls die "elevator surfing." Our heroine does not for a second believe this and investigates things with the help of Cooper, who does that kind of thing for a living.   That's really about it. I don't want to give away what happens, so I won't. But I will say that in order to find out how everything ends, we will all have to read the sequel, which comes out sometime late this year.  I can hardly wait. I hope you enjoy this story. If anything, you will enjoy Cooper. You can't not enjoy Cooper. He's just too hot for words 
 This show is very exciting & another mark of Irwin Allen's brilliancy.Old school special effects & those ''Lost In space'' style machines make it fun! Youd wonder-what do Tony & Doug eat & drink? Thats not my concern I guess-they get sustanance somewhere in their vortex. I do like the first few episodes a bit better like ''Titanic'' or Hiroshima, but all of them are pretty awsome indeed.Thank you amazon for making these classic gems more easily available to us!A must for the sci-fi buff 
 I am 20 now, but I first read this book with my Grandmother at the age of 5.  It was after reading it, that I told her I wanted to live in heaven forever with Jesus. Right there I gave my life to Jesus Christ and have been walking in his light ever since. From time to time I look back at this book, and it's simple explanation of heaven, hell, and Jesus --- each time it reminds me of that day and the pure, simple facts of faith.   The book is very clearly and simply written to explain faith to children. Throughout it love, heaven, hell, and the free gift of Jesus are described. It is a great resource for younger kids and I would highly recommend it. 
 A "MUST",  If you don't read it, you will miss something in your life.  There is a lot to lear 
 Sure, its not that hard to boil a pot of water, but you still have to wait for the boil, time, etc. With the Oster you just put in a bit of water, eggs, press the button and walk away. The eggs come out better, faster, and I can do other things while they're cooking. 
 Good music.  I don't know much about the guy, but this is a pretty broad range of styles and quite interesting 
 Wild Logging: A Guide To Environmentally And Economically Sustainable Forestry by forestry expert Bryan Foster is a useful and "user friendly" guide designed especially for the owners and managers of private forest lands. Wild Logging will enable the reader to craft a charter for private and corporate land-based forestry management that balances both harvesting interests and long-term ecological stability. Wild Logging is confidently recommended as being an exceptionally thoughtful, balanced and practical guide which is deftly written to provide a viable commercial alternative to the evils of clear-cutting or forest habitat destruction 
 We purchased this in anticipation of our trip to Yellowstone next year. The pack is very comfortable when adjusted correctly. I find that if you adjust it right, most of the weight is placed on your hips. Our 9 month old girl loves to ride in it. She even fell asleep once. She seems to like the rhythm of our walk and even "sings" as she gets bounced around. We were worried that she wouldnt like it because she can be a pretty difficult baby (she was born with acid reflux). However, we have had it for several months now and she makes no complaint when we load her up. She doesnt even mind sitting in the pack when it is on the ground.  I have very short hair and the baby likes to try to grab it (too short to really grab). Interesting enough, she never tries to grab my wife's hair. I would suppose that you may want to invest in a hat if your baby likes to pull hair.  There are lots of pockets, although if you are wearing the pack, the pockets are very difficult to access, even the ones on the hip. The hip pockets seem too far back (I have a 38" waist). My wife has a smaller waist and doesnt seem to have the problem with the waist pockets that I do.  When taking off the pack, the baby seemed secure and getting her on and off was no problem.  We dont use the hood. Its not too difficult to put on. Just takes a little time to figure it out.  I am 5'10" and the waist belt at near the lowest setting is just right for me. My wife is 5'7" and she likes the waist belt setting near the middle-top.  At first, it felt awkward walking with the weight, but after a couple of walks, we got used to it. Now we fight for who gets to wear the pack when we walk.   Im glad we got the pack. We cant wait till we get to load her up at Yellowstone 
 Women are the most powerful consumer force in the U.S., but they do not approach buying decisions the way men do. That's intriguing, but it doesn't mean that exhaustive demographic and sales statistics make interesting reading. Authors and marketing consultants Lisa Johnson and Andrea Learned explain how to direct your marketing efforts to women. Each chapter deals with a different subset of women - old, young, black, white, Hispanic, married, single - but the groups are compared along similar lines and the information is sliced the same way in most chapters. The authors liven up their exposition with short illustrative case studies, but the cases often feature products for which marketers have made no concerted, specific effort to attract female buyers. For instance, the decision to sell single servings of food occurred because of other demographics (more people living alone) and was not intended just to attract women buyers. Still, the thesis here is important enough to carry the authors' occasional tendency to twist product features to fit the theme, as well as their branding jargon. Acknowledging the significance of marketing to women, we recommend this information-packed book 
 As a beginning writer I needed something to help me plan my scenes. I knew what I wanted to write, but just didn't know how to go about making it effective. This book does a good job outlining tips and suggestions which will definitely make your scenes better 
 I want to meet the Queen oneday . She is a powerful,strong black wome 
 I am a huge fan of the Let's Read and Find Out science series of books, and this one doesn't disappoint.  Clearly written information, great photographs, and wonderful illustrations educate the K-2 science student in an enjoyable way.  
 My title may not be a selling point.  Oh well.  I first read this around 1990, and revisit it fairly often, have lent it to several friends and generally gotten great reactions.  I did, and still do, find it to be a work drawn very much from a certain creative time and place, a bit akin to the kinds of things Laurie Anderson, Paul Auster, David Byrne, Barbara Krueger or Spalding Gray were doing at roughly the same time.  Which is to say - like those folks - DeLillo engages in a great deal of picking apart American society, to see how it ticks.  As both satire and as affection, the rather thinly drawn characters here (they're supposed to be...these characters are more symbol within the overall project of what DeLillo is doing here) speak and act in an unreal jargonese, which has pretty much evolved in the years since WHITE NOISE was published into the language of large parts of our everyday life:  listen to a newscast, or in a business meeting to the ways in which people speak without conveying any real information.  Along the way, DeLillo has great fun with personal hang-ups (Babette's ex-husband, who apparently has paid a woman to speak Swedish to him whist consummating a clandestine affair), disaster fascinations (the real reason for California's existance, and it's mythic hold on everyone else), and the assorted detritus of everyday life.  Nothing escapes dissection:  pillow talk turns into an examination of effective (versus non-effective) use of language in an erotic context.  Our ready acceptance of pills as panacea is thoroughly eviscerated.  But we need these things, and DeLillo knows it, and gives us people who - for all their linguistic strageness (this is a novel in which everyone basically talks like an anchorman), they'd be worse without their stuff.  This is the paradox of modern life.  Aside from this, DeLillo does a magnificent job of satirizing academia, which almost becomes rubes with pretenses in this glorious depiction, as the departments of Hitler Studies and Elvis Studies go head to head in a battle of historical value vs. cultural value, and a man dressed entirely in plaid engages in a study of the semiotics of cereal boxes, while grocery shoppers scurry around him.  -David Alsto 
 This is an example how should movie novelizations be written. They tend to be flat and screenplay-like, but this one makes me feel like the movie were an adaptation of the book, not vice versa. It provides lots of background information (some of them were actually in the movie but were cut out later), mostly on Saavik, Peter Preston and Carol's Deltan co-workers. The main characters, Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the others are the very same characters we all love, they talk and act just like they do in any Trek episode, they never do anything out of character. Vonda McIntyre knows how to write Star Trek. A novel can't be more Star Trek than this 
 Peter Drucker reveals 'Realities' and foresee a vision for future with his whiz skills of management. 40 years ago after World war II, Business was a dirty word for intellectuals. Even in US top flight uni graduates turned up their noses at business jobs and tried instead into government job service or uni teaching. Today grandmoms give latest business seller instead of Bible to their grand sons at high school graduation ceremony. The pastor who considers himself as anti business of evangelical church, is as conversant with cash flow analysis as any accountant and runs it off routinely on his personal computer. He even attends management seminars to learn how to maintain `spiritual entrepreneurship' as the chief executive officer of his fast growing congregation. 35 years ago Business was widely viewed as an anachronism to be engulfed everywhere in a rising socialist tide. An indepth study of the Author highlights the facts of past, present and future. In the chapter of Politics, the author reveals the fact that political changes has been drastic in American Politics since the period 1965-1973, as a decade passes to enter `the next century' He thinks that after 300 or more years in which weapons were productive and worked as instruments of policy, they have become counterproductive.He reminds of Mark Hanna's America, where farmers were half the population. The business interest which Mark Hanna mobilized for political power was not General Motors or Citibank, he says. The concept was total different.As regards Education,Peter Drucker feels that there should be serious discussion of the social purpose and responsibility of education in the new reality of the knowledge society. He details few requirements as Education fuels economy and shapes society which is a factor to be remembered. This Book has been a thorough read by me for a review for an MBA student and so,I definitely recommend a great read for anyone who is intrigued to know the 'New Realities' - understanding politics, government, the economy, information technology, and business with the waves of sweeping changes. A brief glance at the contents itself says all:  The contents of the Book are as follows: Part I : The Political Realities The Divide No more Salvation by Society The end of FDR's America When the Russian Empire is Gone  Now that Arms are Counterproductive  Part II : Government and Political Process The limits of Government The new Pluralisms Beware Charisma : The changing demands on Political Leadership  Part III : Economy, Ecology and Economics Transnational Economy : Transnational Ecology The Paradoxes of Economic Development Economics at the Crossroads  Part IV : The Knowledge Society The Post Business Society The Two countercultures The Information based Organization Management as Social Function and Liberal Art The Shifting Knowledge Base Conclusion : From Analysis to Perception: The World View 
 Blue Mitchell's first album as a leader, at the tender young age of 28, is a classic.  The band really was the "Big Six," with Curtis Fuller  on trombone, Johnny Griffin on tenor and the rhythm trio of Wynton Kelly,  Wilbur Ware and Philly Joe Jones.  The album begins with Benny Golson's  "Blues March," and while it is the first recorded version of the  tune, it doesn't quite measure up to the definitive version on Art Blakey  and the Jazz Messengers' "Moanin."  Continuing with the march  theme is the concluding funeral procession-like "Promenade."  In  between are some super swinging songs, notably the title track,  "Brother 'Ball" (for Cannonball Adderly) and Fuller's  "Jamph," that rival any sextet recordings of the period.  Blue  lets Fuller and Griffin sit out on "There Will Be Another You"  and handles things just fine by himself.  "Big Six" is the real  thing 
 I'm a fan of the whispers and have been since I was a kid. Now that I'am an adult I can buy all their music I couldn't get when I was a child. this CD is smooth,sexy and classy.This CD seems if they never left the studio, and they still sound as good as 20 years ago. VERY GOO 
 I had a recent perl+mysql project and flipped between the Cookbook and the author's other work, MySQL, mentioned in other reviews.  ( also referred to the O'Reilly Perl books _Programming Perl_ and _Perl for System Administration_.  I don't usually have time to master any topic or skillset; I need to get in, get it going, and move on.  This book is perfect for that.  "How do I get the date?"  There's a recipe for that.  "How do I get perl to connect to the database and insert stuff?" There's a recipe.  Also for PHP, python, etc.  It's really focused on problem solving, and the problems are really well chosen.  This book will save you hours of effort.  
 This book succeeds on three levels.  First, as others have noted, it is indeed a real page-turner.  (I actually read several chapters ALOUD to a friend on a long drive.)  Second, this is an excellent history of one of the most important controversies of 20th Century American culture.  History will not record this controversy as a turning point in science.  Wilson made no great discovery.  His distinguishing characteristic was the simple willingness to think and speak freely.    However, in a hundred years, what has been called the "Triumph of Sociobiology" will be seen as a crucial event in the intellectual history of the United States.  This book is the first draft of that history.   Those reviewers who believe that the author is biased should remember that the author is, above all, a sociologist of science -not a biologist.  She has far more in common with T.S. Kuhn than with any of the biologists she profiles.  I am not convinced that she takes the work of ANY of these scientists at face value.  If, at the end of the book, sociobiology appears ascendant, that may be because Wilson's camp has won the battle of public opinion.    Finally, this book succeeds as a case study in scientific epistemology.  The author -ever the social scientist- metaphorically divides scientists into two categories: "planters" and "weeders."    "Planters" are risk-tolerant.  They interpret evidence to support highly-speculative hypotheses -hypotheses that often turn out to be wrong.  They provide the building blocks of science.  The believe they are doing "good science."      "Weeders" are fundamentally skeptical.  They interpret evidence in the strictest possible manner, in search of certainty.  By eliminating the rotten wood, they keep the ediface of "science" standing.  They also believe they are doing "good science."  In my view, both of these viewpoints are helpful to the ecology of human knowledge.  Planters generate needed diversity; weeders enforce conformity.  Each should appreciate the systemic value of the others' function; the tragedy here -in my view- was that neither side did.    The author, however, would disagree with me.  She seems to suggest that such partisan zeal makes for good scientists, if not for good science.  Maybe, she suggests, objectivity in the process of science is an OBSTACLE to the production of knowledge.  Maybe we are doomed to (and blessed with) a perpetual sociobiology controversy, since fairminded people like myself can only muster the will to write book reviews.    This is perhaps the most interesting insight in this book, and alone worth the price of admission.         
 This is everything Aretha Franklin's autobiography should have been but wasn't. It is brutally frank, almost scary in its honesty. Nothing is glossed over, including her relationships with men ( and women ) her heroin addiction and her experiences with sexism and racism , both in and out of the music industry. I read this book  in one weekend, I just couldn't put it down.  
 In this second book of the prequel series to the "Left Behind" story, Nicolae Carpathia continues his ascendance in his home country of Romania, while in the United States, Rayford Steele and his wife Irene are having problems over religon and church.    Nicolae, now a young man in his mid to late twenties, has continued his rise in both the political and business world.  Nicolae's company is worth millions, and he has now set his sights on running for the lower house of the Romanian parliament.  But, the incumbent candidate is very popular among the voters.  To help him in the election, Nicolae has hired Leon Fortunato, an Italian businessman and former student of religion, to become his closest advisor.  But the solution he and Nicolae come up with for Nicolae to win the election is very shocking to say the least.  Irene Steele has become a Christian through the help and counsel of a friend from New Hope church, a family-oriented church which teaches straight from the Bible.  Rayford Steele much prefers to play golf on Sunday mornings, and the Steele's children, Raymie and Chloe, don't seem very interested in church, either.  Irene is left on an island by herself while her family drifts further and further away from the church.  To make matters worse, Irene and Rayford's marriage is suffering due to the difference in their beliefs. However, through some gentle counseling from Irene, Raymie eventually accepts Jesus. As for his job as a pilot, Rayford has risen quickly through the ranks, and is now at the top of his profession.  He is chosen by the CIA to fly to the middle east to meet a Jordanian fighter pilot who is to help Rayford develop defense tactics against rebel groups who may have acquired SAM missiles to shoot down airliners.  Cameron "Buck" Williams has continued his journalism career at Princeton and has won numerous awards.  However, he discovers through his brother Jeff that his mother is dying of cancer in Arizona.  He tries to make it out to see her, but he fails to arrive before she passes away.  Despite the loss of his mother, he lands a plum job at the Boston Globe, where he quickly ascends the ranks.  His dream job is to work for the magazine "Global Weekly".  He finally lands his job there and even gets to interview the President.  But is Buck's life really what he wants it to be, or is he missing something?  I've enjoyed reading both books of the prequel series, and I'm looking forward to the third installment.  It's been interesting to watch the development of the characters that brought the "Left Behind" series to life, especially Buck Williams.  As with all of the "Left Behind" books, this offering is loaded with action as well as biblical verses and teachings.  I highly recommend this book, as well as all of the others of this fine series.  If you haven't read any of them yet, you'll be in for a treat.  If you're a reader like myself who has read all of them, this book is just a fine continuation of the previous storyline.  Either way, you'll surely be drawn in to the "Left Behind" story 
 When I was 9 I was finally moved up to the advanced reading group in my class. In order to catch up, I had to read Harriet the Spy in its entirety over Thanksgiving break. I was extremely dismayed, I had never even seen a book so big, much less read one! But, I devoured it in two days. I didn't live in New York and I had never kept a journal, but everything that happened in the book was completely familiar. It was, I think, the first work of literature I had ever read on my own.  Skip ahead 14 years. I reread this book in my local library on a lazy Saturday afternoon. I loved it, but I can understand the qualms expressed by some parents about the book  The question is: What is the point of having children read - is it to present them with 2-dimensional models of correct behavior, or else to provoke their thinking, reasoning, and analytical skills? I think it's very telling that a reviewer who gave this book one star literally threw it into the fireplace - this is the type of book that people who hate books burn.  People criticize Harriet for being rude or mean, but I think they are a little off base there. Harriet is a smart 11 year old, but she is an 11 year old just the same. Assigning adult motives and value judgments to her behavior is flat-out unfair. She's just a kid, and this is how kids behave, not when you're around, but on the playground and in the classroom where they are discovering peer interaction.   In fact, this is a very moral story. Harriet learns that there are reasons for lying - it isn't being hypocritical (as adults often do seem to children) but rather to spare other peoples' feelings - sometimes it's better to be kind than to be truthful. Watch the way Harret interacts with her friend Sport: she learns for the first time to show consideration for other peoples' feelings - not because you will get punished, but because they will get hurt, and you do not want to hurt the people you care about, even though so often you inadvertently do. This is a complicated message that the target audience (kids 9-12) are learning IN REAL LIFE which is why the book resonates with so many readers of that age (and beyond).  
 I am a birthmother who read this book expecting to find more about the adoptee's experience...from an adoptees point of view. Instead, Joe speaks to the pain that most all of us experienced including birthmothers, in the closed Adoption system. Letting go of old myths, shame, embarrassment and denial about what was like a crazy experiment gone awry, is not easy. He has given us exercises ,wisdom and rituals that help us face our deepest sadness and take back our power. I knew while reading this book that this author gets it. He understands and validates the unique pain that a birthparent, especially birthmothers feel. This is one book that every collection of adoption books should include.. no matter how one is involved in the adoption experience 
 Easy to follow suggestions make this book a winner.  Highly recommended 
 Horror fans will find much to like in Bentley Little's savage novel of a luxury-resort with deep and dark secrets and its terrors unleashed.  Readers looking for a brisk read will be delighted by the brisk pacing and non-stop action and twists expertly laid out by Little.  But for the squeamish, be forwarned that at its core "The Resort" is a gruesome tale and Little pulls no punches when describing the many moments of bloody mayhem and terror found within.    Themeatically this book is very reminiscent of Stephen King's "Desperation," so if you were a fan of that book reading this one should be a no brainer. 
 I purchased this book when I learned that my Dad's brain tumor had grown significantly and he was moving into the final chapter of his life.  I found many of the stories to be inspirational and I learned a lot about people's real life experiences.  I also read David Kessler's "The Needs of the Dying" and this was an amazing book of comfort and truth.  I find knowledge to be comforting.  If you do also, these books will be very helpful 
 Rather confusingly, this brief and engaging true crime chronicle (it is NOT a novel) has appeared in English under three different titles over the years: The Heist of the Century, Under the Streets of Nice, and The Gentleman of 16 July. To make things even more confusing, although the book was largely the work of French journalists writing under the pseudonym Rene Maurice, some editions prominently bear the name of bestselling thriller-writer Ken Follett on the cover. As Follett explains on his web site, the original translated manuscript was a mess, and he was hired (before he was an established brand) to "fix" it. He spent about two weeks on it and since then has more or less disavowed it: " Not only was it not my best effort, it was well below what I could do.... It's still not a good book, but I turned a completely unpublishable manuscript into something more or less respectable."  More or less respectable is more or less accurate, the prose is far from great, but the story itself is absolutely fascinating. It tells of an astounding bank heist in Nice, France in the summer of 1976. A gang of twenty criminals, under the direction of a self-mythologizing right-wing dreamer named Albert Spaggiari spent two months digging a 25-foot tunnel from the city sewer system into a bank vault. Once in, they proceeded to spend the weekend breaking into safe deposit boxes before leaving with some $8 to $10 million in cash, gold, and jewelry and daubing the phrase "sans haine, sans violence et sans arme" on the wall! The book focuses on the heist and the small details that led to Spaggiari's eventual capture. He's a fascinating figure, an ex-paratrooper, OAS member who came within a phone call of assassinating President de Gaulle, but also a photographer who rubbed shoulders with the city elite and had connections with the underworld. The improbable end to the story includes his escape from imprisonment and subsequent flight to Paraguay, where he lived a life of high style and luxury.  The book speaks frequently about how Spaggiari heist and escape was received with general applause by the European public, and how he became a kind of folk hero. Much of this can be attributed to the general human affection for those who poke fun at the authorities (Spaggiari granted numerous magazine interviews until his death in 1989, always taunting the police) without causing any violence. But this obscures the rather darker question surrounding his connection to underground far-right organizations. The book is a little frustrating due to murkiness surrounding the affair. There are some disturbing mistakes made by the police and several indications that Spaggiari was well-connected to France's right-wind elite. In the following years, there were several similar heists elsewhere in France and Europe, including one executed only a month after the Nice job and thus could not possibly be a copycat. There's even an appearance by the CIA!  It would be interesting to know if any further details have come to light in subsequent years. Spaggiari has written at least one memoir of his own (Fric-frac: The Great Riviera Bank Robbery) but this is not likely to be very truthful. The entire affairs is perfectly suited to the movies, and indeed, a French film called Les égouts du paradis (The Sewers of Paradise) was released in 1979. More recently, there are some indications that Warner Bros. is developing a new version with the title "Under the Streets of Nice" 
 It's a real shame that Jeffrey Eugenides isn't a more prolific author, because he is truly one of the greatest writers I know of. His talent for getting inside people's heads and describing emotions, thoughts, and feelings is simply magnificent. The Virgin Suicides is not simply a book for girls aged 13+, not by any stretch at all. This is a book that nearly anyone can appreciate. After some of the reviews I saw before reading it, I had the impression that it was a modern version of "Are You There God, It's Me, Margaret," but it is nothing like that at all.  With as many reviews as this book already has here, there's no point in repeating what so many of them have said. I'll just add my 5 stars to the mix by saying that this is one of the most unique stories I have ever come across and that Jeffrey Eugenides' ability to convey emotion and atmosphere is unsurpassed. This isn't necessarily a sad story, but it is a very compelling and even haunting one. In short, I highly recommend it to anyone who loves reading good, well-written stories 
 Highly recommended - awesome Dolly with a mix of upbeat bluegrass and haunting ballads 
 When I picked up this book I knew that there were some elements that I liked. It hooked me in the first ten-minutes because it held my attention just like a movie. It kept things going in a readible, conflict-change methodology as if I were watching it unfold like a television drama. It had a taste for talent, gossip, relationships, oh yeah and management tools that I could use too. This was a phenom book and would recommend it to anyone who's meeting did the suck dance like mine did 
 The physical size of this book and its clear detail makes it an ideal reference for glove compartment or large pocket.  Pictures and text are well put together.  I found it lacking, however, for use in identifying the very rare or accidental occurence of some species.  I now use it in conjunction with National Geographic's "Field Guide to Birds of North America" 
 I loved this book!  I have always wanted to know about the role the French Resistance played in World War II and now I know about it in captivating detail!  Virginia Hall was an incredibly brave, compassionate and intuitive woman and I found myself having to take a break from the book occasionally because Ms. Hall often became entangled in some very tense situations.  This book was engaging from the first, well written, easy to read and hard to put down 
 I only discovered Edgar Rice Burroughs by accident a couple of years ago when I picked up a copy of this book "just because".  It turned out to be far better and far cooler than any expectations I might've had.  If you think you know Tarzan and haven't read this, I've got news for you.  YOU DON'T KNOW TARZAN.  He's a hundred times more savage and a thousand times more interesting than all those movie versions of the character.  He's also surprisingly complex and sympathetic even as he slaughters nearly everything that crosses his path.  I'm amazed this book was written nearly a hundred years ago.  It's so graphic and unapologetic for Tarzan's bestial nature.  That said, there are a few small flaws.  Elements of the plot can be a bit contrived, but since it usually serves to get to more action, I can forgive that.  Burroughs's writing, while still engaging, is a little stilted by today's standards.  And it doesn't end with Tarzan getting Jane.  That's the story of "The Return of Tarzan".  Not ending in a book ALWAYS bugs me.  I hate cliffhangers.  I don't need to be blackmailed to read the next one.  You can read this book and enjoy it without reading the others.  Still, even the great Edgar Rice Burroughs loses a star for this flaw because I REALLY HATE CLIFFHANGERS.  Sorry, Eddie.  Do yourself a favor and pick this up.  It might ruin you for other so-called adventure stories, but it's worth it 
 This book is wonderful.  An excellent resource for people whom suffer from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and their friends, family, and caregivers!  This workbook serves the individual best while under the direct care and supervision of a good Therapist, Psychologist, and/or Psychiatrist!  Highly recommended without reservation 
 If you enjoy cycling in any way, recreational or competitive, and enjoyed Hoosiers, then American Flyers is just what the doctor ordered.  While the acting isn't Oscar quality, and the music is dated, this is still a feel good movie that will make you smile, and maybe even cry.  The story is somewhat predictable, but that does not get in the way of the effectiveness of the movie or the emotion that it evokes.  The bottom line: if you like to see fast-paced cycling action and great Colorado scenery, then buy this movie 
 Growing up brothers John and David March detested one another; as adults their scorn for the other remains unabated.  Thus John is more than shocked when his snobbish business executive David turns to him for help. The married David used an Internet site to arrange a tryst.  The woman videotaped their performance, which if revealed would cost the older sibling his job and probably his wife; he wants his younger sibling, a private investigator to find out what is going on and how to prevent the personal disaster from occurring.  The only additional clue is a red cat tattoo on the hooker.  John learns the female is Wren, who is not blackmailing David per say, but considers herself an artist selling her tapes of married men cheating with her to the highest bidding collector.  The scenario takes a deadly spin when someone murders Wren.  John assumes that a sex client committed the homicide, but wonders if righteous David could have performed the deed even as he ponders whether blood is thick enough to propel him to protect David especially if he turns out to be the killer.  Besides the family dynamics, RED CAT is a fabulous modern day Noir that brings the Internet fully into the sub-genre.  John is terrific as he loathes his pompous "superior" older brother, but also resolves to do his best by him as he is family.  Peter Spiegelman provides a great whodunit starring one of the best sleuths to hit the information age (see BLACK MAPS and DEATH'S LITTLE HELPERS).  Harriet Klausner 
 This was an amazing book, I don't believe I've ever enjoyed reading as much as I did with this book. I'm not someone who pleasure reads a lot, but I truthfully enoyed reading this book, and heard from a friend it was good. It was on our school summer reading list so I picked it up. I read it all in one day, which isn't too much of a big deal since it's pretty short. However I felt, the book was great, and I don't agree with what a few other people are saying. One person said it wasn't realistic, that the main girl Coleen never suffered withdrawls are anything... but comon in the end she winds up being pretty much the way she started. And someone else said that there was to much cursing, however without the swearing would it have accurately portrayed the world i live in? I will admit that my review may be a little biased because I am 15, and I go through all the things these teens went through, but i actually think thats great. The writer did a great job of showing what a lot of teens go through, and anyone that thinks the book was over the top or overexagerated needs to go take a trip to their nearest highschool. The last thing i wanted to address, and what I felt was the best part of the book, the ending: someone said it was half-assed. Truth is it was perfect, the ending was sort of happy but at the same time it was sorta sad, but definitly very realistic. It kind of made me sad, because I have a friend that seems so much like Coleen, and truth is our relationship kinda did the same thing. Overall one of my favorite books ever 
 Sloan's work successfully embodied the essence of system thinking 
 Frank McKinney seems outrageous--but this guy is all heart. He is a real inspiration and phenominal motivator. He's got an audio version out too but I think it's only available from his website. Although the phrase about "judging a book by it's cover" is a cliche, it truly applies to this author since you would never expect anyone with this persona to be so kind and generous to those less fortunate.  
 Just got this product a week ago have used it every other night and can feel the difference already.  Mind you I am eating healthy and doing cardio (rollerblading).  You can feel it working when you use it.  The video, after the first couple times watching it gets pretty boring.  I just do the routine myself, adding a couple reps to each set, without the video.  Good buy 
  I really enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down.  In fact I read it in about 6 hours the day it came out.  This is not the type of thing I normally read, being a SF and fantasy fan myself, but I love Holly Lisle other titles and thought I'd give this a go.  It was brilliant.   It's filled with memorable characters and has a great twisty ending.  The level of paranormal involvement is just enough to keep you hooked without dropping you into any 'hey, wait a minute' moments.  I loved the tension that runs through this book, both the normal, 'got to catch the killer' kind with some delicious sexual tension added into the mix. I've ordered myself a copy of Holly's previous paranormal suspense novel Midnight Rain and if this is anything to go by it should be a great read. 
 I truly enjoyed this movie. I found it moving, funny, and above all, beautiful. This is one of those movies that leaves me feeling something amazing for hours after it has ended. Some of these scenes were absolutely breathtaking - in particular towards the end. LOVED IT 
 This is a story about 3 women, Willa, Lily and Tess who inherit a Montana Ranch from their deceased father who never laid claim to any of the 3 women. Willa was the only one left on the ranch and assumed she'd inherit until the will was read. In the will Jack Mercy, their father, stated that the only way any of them would get a piece of his pie was if they all lived on the ranch for a year together. They had never met before this day.  This is a story of family, love, trust, and murder. Ms Roberts has a way of wrapping your mind around one idea only to have you so convinced and then bam, the story changes. This story has quickly become one of my favorite Nora Roberts independent romantic suspense novels. She is a favorite in general, but his one had me anticipating what would happen next. 
 This was the first Michael Connelly novel I read.  I enjoyed it a great deal.  I read it on a beach vacation at it was perfect for that purpose.  Not too demanding of a read.  Connelly really kept the pages turning, right until the very end.  This is a good intro to Connelly as he uses Harry Bosch and Terry McAleb as the main protagonists of the novel.  One complaint, even from a first time reader, the notion that Bosch committed this murder was not very believable.  All in all I highly recommend this book as a great way to pass the time at the beach.  However, certainly not a great work of literature 
 The stories in A Multitude of Sins really focus on one central sin--adultery.  Infidelity and its various facets feature in all of the stories here, but the stories are in no way repetitive.  In one story, a man accidentally meets the ex-husband of his former lover in a crowded train station.  Another concerns a woman revealing her infidelities to her husband on the way to a dinner party at the ex-lover's house.  Each story focuses on different aspects of the effects of infidelity, so in that sense, there are "multitudes" of sins.  This is a well-written collection by a talented author 
    Pairing k.d. Lang and Tony Bennett was a stroke of musical genius.  The magical synergy between them, the combination of two such diametrically opposite vocalists, the obvious chemistry between them is wonderful to behold.  Tony has never been better, and k.d. displays the full range of her vocal talents effortlessly and perfectly in sync with Tony's flawless pop/jazz style.  It is a masterful collaboration on every  track, but "Exactly Like You" and "What A Wonderful World" are exceptionally good. This is an essential purchase if you collect either artist.  It has all the makings of a great classic album from two of the greatest vocalists around today.  Bennett proves conclusively with this gem that great vocal artistry is possible at any age and at any stage of one's career.  I only hope there's 'A Wonderful World Part Two. 
 I RECEIVED MY BOOK JUST DAYS BEFORE I HAD BACK SURGERY, AND IT REALLY KEPT ME OCCUPIED.  I AM NOT MUCH OF A READER OF BOOKS, BUT THIS WAS GREAT. AND I GOT TO MEET THE AUTHOR AND HAVE IT SIGNED.  ROLL TID 
 I bought and read this book during the last year of my PhD and it gave valuable hints and insight to the academic job search process.  I highly recommend it to all the ABD PhDs out there 
 Many reviewers have done a great job at eloquently promoting the principles of this book, I won't try again here.  Suffice it to say that if you are ready to become effective in the Lord's battle against Satan in the spiritual realm, this book may well change your life (Yes, The victory is assured, but the battle still rages.  Satan is serious about taking casulties.  Could there be any doubt?) It is no surprise this book elicited some negative reviews.  To even acknowledge there is a spirtitual battle in the world today in this age of enlightenment is not popular, including in many churches.  But denying we are at war does not change the fact that we are. I sure encourage you to read this book.  We need more warriors in the battle, and less commentators 
 When I saw that Jerry Porras, the author of BUILT TO LAST had written the forward, I was immediately curious.  I'm starting a new company and I've been reading a lot lately on how to create the proper corporate culture.  I'd always thought that once the culture was established, I would have created a machine that would perpetuate itself.  I was stunned by the idea, radical to me, that a good organization would be designed to encrouage and foster change from the outset.  The book outlines several strategies and concrete actions corporateleaders can take to make their organizations more accepting of change and felxible.  It's based on academic research, but there are a lot of examples from the field.  This wasn't the quick fix I was looking for, but it got me to thinking and made me realize that, unknowingly, I had already incorporated some of the book's thinking when I revised my business plan to better reflect current market conditions.  The book validated what I had done.  I immediately sent copies to my new business associates and other people I do business with.  A strong recommend 
 And I don't even normally read poetry. Gifford's poetry is totally accessible, a treasure for for the novice and poet laureate alike. His spare take on 9/11 will haunt you forever 
 I think this could have been a better movie with a deeper plot but what does keep it moving is...  Kevin Spacey. He is such a fabulous, fabulous actor!! Kevin Kline - though usually so good, is unfortunately  SOOO bland  in this movie. Very poor acting on his part.It was really disgusting. Kevin  Spacey is the only class act in this movie and makes it worth watching 
 I still rate it 4 stars because of the quality of the sound, the reliability of the cassette decks and the low price. Sony has been making this same product for several years with no changes, so that means it's great, right 
 Offers an evaluation of 14 Asian countries in terms of each one's potential role in the global strategies of multinational companies, from both a market and production or supply vantage point. The author examines  the extent that strategy must be adapted to each nation and how each is  strategically used by companies. It also provides a framework for  developing regional and country strategies. Filled with information and  insight.

 my favorite part of this book was laughing at all of the mistakes. anyway... my other favorite part was when she took a bullet for Knight. i thought that was so sweet even though it was kind of gruesome. i could picture Monk and Boy's faces, and they looked disgusting in my mind. i thought she made the details wonderfully and i will read it as much as i can. it is the best book in the whole world. i love this book!!!  it was WORTH IT! i recomend it to anyone over age 15. explicit material. great book 
 This is a jewel of a book!.. I found myself actually laughing out loud and nodding my head in agreement to Paston's insights.  It is the perfect gift for moms, grandmoms, and grandmoms-in-training. I loved it 
 This is the first book I have seen that encapsulates the entire history of the Beverly, as well as the fire itself.  As a kid in Cincinnati at the time,  I still remember reading the Cincinnati Enquirer in the days after the fire, reading the list of dead. The book is a must-read for anyone from Cincinnati and Northern KY; the fire was a pivotal moment in the area's histor 
 This was an astounding book about an even more astounding woman, Rachel Shilsky, a.k.a Ruth McBride Jordan.  Written by one of her 12 children, James, this book is both biography (mother) and autobiography (child).  A Polish Jew (white) who fled her oppressive surroundings in backwater Virginia, Ruth met and married two different black men and managed to raise 12 children in some extremely difficult circumstances in Harlem, New York.  Not only did she start a Baptist Church with her husband, she coped with a regular dose of racism, some significant poverty and still managed to send 12 children to school (all of whom became professionals, and productive citizens).  The book is written by the son, but the voice of the mother is registered throughout (in italic print).  She evades all queries about her background, her family, in fact any of her history, and it is not until much later that the son uncovers her history (abusive father, crippled mother) and the reader is even more impressed with the fortitude and will that it must have taken this woman to make her own life in a community that was not of her economic, racial, or religious experience.  Although the book is ostensibly about this man's childhood and his remarkable mother, it is also a fascinating glimpse of racism, religion and social exclusion in the black communities in New York in the 1960s. Each of Ruth's children experienced a certain unease about their racially `different' mother and yet each became aware of who they were and what they were about.  This book is just a marvelous read.  Full of funny and sad tales of a rather unique family life, McBride's work is a tribute to his extraordinary mother.  
 It's so comfy and much easier than you might expect.  I wear it all the time 
 Owning all of the Boxed sets of the LOTR's trilogy I found myself utterly fascinated with the various documentaries on the discs about the making of the film.  Especially with the art designs..the paintings, storyboards, miniatures...Here are men who are supremely talented artists whose paintings and drawings would never been seen by most people were it not for the DVDs and books like this.  This is high art...Gorgeous and breathtaking and on a par if not surpassing the works of people like the Hildebrandt Brothers who have been long known for their paintings of Middle Earth.  Next to people like Alan Lee, the Hildebrandts work seems child-like in its intent.  The painting of the Nazgul looking down like a vulture over the town of Bree, just waiting is marvelous.  The Nazgul, their wriath images revealed to a startled Frodo when he puts the ring on atop Weathertop, Treebeard, Shelob...the fantastic pencil drawings.  These films created literally thousands of masterpieces of fantasy art.  Just a fantastic book and at over 200 pages it's not some fluff marketing item, but a book for serious fans and collectors 
 This cd is a great alternative to watching a DVD or video.  My son loves Sesame Street characters but I hate having him sit in front of the tv all day.  So, I put on this music and he dances and listens and plays with other toys.  Not for the exclusive Elmo lover however, since it features lots of different Sesame Street characters not just Zoe and Elmo as shown on the cover 
 	In the atmosphere of so much music labled as particular genres like "rock" or "pop", here comes a very different sort of band that doesn't seem to care about such distinctions. The band was luckily able to gain recognition, due to some promotion on MTV's "Advance Warning" program and radio play on alternative stations. Though "The Funeral" was released in 2004, it could've very well been released in any other era. It carries with it a sort of timeless quality that's not modern, but not entirely antique either. This effect is achieved through the variety of musical instruments, use of lyrics of a poetic quality, and the sincere earnestness found in the vocals.  	I particularly appreciate albums such as this that sound good from start to finish; the kind where you don't feel the need to skip over any songs. A few of the stand-out songs include 'Neighborhood #2 (Laika)', 'Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)', and 'Rebellion (Lies)'. "The Funeral" is a rather different, well-produced effort that shows promise for The Arcade Fire's future music 
 Of all the books I've read, this is the best book on using natural therapies to manage sinusitis. It's a terrific book!! The program recommended is easy to use and it definitely works. This book motivated me to finally get in control of the constant congestion and drainage from years of sinusitis. I realized that conventional medication and antibiotics could not always relieve the symptoms of sinusitis. But the vitamins, herbs, and foods recommended in this book help to decrease inflammation. The other complementary therapies help the sinuses to drain, and the saline rinse keeps the sinuses flowing so they don't get all clogged and infected 
 i was so sick of making popcorn in a pot, and having it get soggy from the oil and steam.  this popcorn is delightful!  it's easy and healthier and delicious.  only problem, as some previous reviewers have noted, is that at the end popcorn can fly everywhere.  if that would make you anxious, then i would recomment a different model.  but, if it's not that big of a deal for you to pick up a few pieces from the counter and the floor, then go ahead!  i also really like the little melter on top 
 This is a wonderful album and it shows us some of this amazing band's diversity, but not everyone will apreciate it. If you only like Good news for people who love bad news and Moon and Antarctica, then this isn't for you. It is much more raw and a lot stranger. If you do like this, then you will probably also like Long drive and Lonesome crowded, which is their best album and my personal favorite album period

 This version of the "protein" diet brings the whole eating craze back to the center where it belongs.  It just doesn't make sense to eat dripping bacon and greasy cheeseburgers without any checks and balances.  The Paleo diet calls for a sensible approach to eating lean protein as did our distant ancestors, and reinstitutes the idea that fruit and vegetables should be a mainstay.  I do wish there was a more prominent place for whole grains, but who says you have to follow Paleo exactly? Good nutritional information included in this book

 I partly agree with the downstairs, but can not put it in 1 star. This book is OK for beginner, both on Win32 and Linux. And with detailed description (yes, it tells what is called NT Service and how to open a MMC to start a service :-) so IT JUST WORKS. On the other hand, there is a lot of setting with the config, this book contians a long list of explaination with the para, like a ref book. But it does gives you a few good example of CGI (C and Perl). Still think it is the top apache book on market  
 I watched "Mommie Dearest" a week or so before seeing this movie and that movie showed the pressure and tension Joan Crawford was under when this movie came around to her.  She was already considered a has-been and had been dumped by Mayer's studio and so it was quite a triumph when she won a best actress Oscar for this film.  And well deserved it was.  It's a great film about a powerful, but flawed woman/mother and what she does to keep her life and her daughters' lives bearable. One of the top 100 films ever, in my opinion, both for the performance and the story it tells 
 Author Bernard Malamud (1914-1986) won the 1967 Pulitzer Prize for this stunning portrayal of injustice, prejudice, and false imprisonment.  Yakov Bok is a poor Jewish handyman from Kiev falsely accused of blood libel - killing a Christian child in order to use his blood to make Passover Matzos.  Such false charges were not unheard of in Eastern Europe during periods of anti-Semitism.  Readers feel as if they are practically beside Bok as he sits in prison, isolated, frustrated, and clinging desperately to hope that his innocence will somehow be demonstrated.  Bok must also contend with his previously unhappy life, his lack of faith, a wife who left him, and anger from some inside prison who believe the charges.  Bok's sanity and sturdiness waiver under the stress of his predicament, and he struggles to retain his sanity and compassion.            This powerful tale was partly based on the case of Mendel Beilis, a Jew from Tsarist Russia who was acquitted of the same false charge in 1913 after having spent two years in prison.  This is a superb tale injustice, and the mental struggle of an individual to survive the ordeal of false imprisonment.

 I have never written a review before but feel compelled to share my story.  This monitor is one of the best things you can do for your child.  Early this morning at 5:30am the monitor went off for the first time.  We like everyone else have tested the alarm repeatedly and have never experienced a false alarm.  I raced to the crib and shook the baby and called her name.  I heard her gasp and start breathing again.  This was not a situation where she had moved off the monitor because without moving her I turned the monitor back on and she slept another 3 hours. This is my second child and I was driven to buy this for my little girl even though I already owned a sound monitor. I am not going to debate with myself about whether this was a false alarm.  I am just going to be forever grateful for the day I decided to purchase this monitor.  My daughter woke up this morning happy and smiling and I am thankful that such a product is available 
 This book has been with me now for three years.  During those three years it has saved me hours of corrections and prehaps a few bad grades.  This book is easy to follow, easy to use, and a real bargain for the price.  I have used many different books in the past and have not found one that has been as useful as Hacker's Handbook for Writers.  It is a clear and concise guide to MLA documentaion and writing.  This is the only book when it comes to a writing.  Great for all students and all ages.  My only regret with this book was that I did not find it sooner 
 Ehrman has done some quite interesting writings here. To bad that he didn't went "all the way". However, I presume the book would have been to heavy to ship abroad.

 One of the most moving novels I have ever read.  Petry's novel displays naturalism at its finest.  More than that, it is an enjoyable, easy read!  I highly recommend it 
 Wish one of my former bosses had read this book! After a couple of us had finished a nearly impossible project, someone suggested (in front of us) that he thank us personally.  His reply:  "We're all adults. We don't need to be thanked for doing our jobs." It wasn't the last straw, but it was one more thing that just added up. I eventually left the company.   The first couple of chapters are the most valuable. The book is important for corporations, but has even more significance for nonprofit or volunteer organizations where pay might be small or nonexistent, so appreciation or working for a cause is why people stick around.  You don't need to read it from start to finish - just the first chapters and then whichever of the concepts for appreciating employees strikes your fancy (or your employees'). It's clear and a breeze to read 
 Listening through I thought that this has got to be the best classic rock compilation that I have ever heard.  Just about every tune belongs except "Joy To the World", which seems a little out of place.  Why only 4 stars?  Because they shortened my favorite song, FREEBIRD.  If you listen, you'll notice that they took out a good chunk out of the guitar solos at the end.  They should have kept the length and cut out JOY TO THE WORLD.  If so, it would have been 5+++++++ 
 Schoolteacher Charles tried to speak with his fiancée Daphne Wells about buying his grandmother's house as she is moving to Florida.  However, he cannot compete with the TV show Supermodels so she only half hears him.  When it registers she thinks New Rochelle home of the Petries.  With her penchant for TV, Daphne has the perfect job as a curator at the Museum of Television and Radio in New York City.  Daphne realizes she has ignored her upcoming wedding so she needs to start planning as the commercials do not lend itself to set up a nuptial gala though they seem the ideal amount of time for sex with Charles.  She asks her older sister, international model Billie, to help her.  However, as the event comes closer she begins to think of it as a day of infamy rather than happiness.  Adding to her doubts is her meeting television producer Jonathan, who brings passion outside the boob tube into her life especially during a weekend romp in the Hamptons.  Daphne decides Jonathan is the man as he can get her away from the small screen for more than a minute or two.  YOU COULD DO BETTER is a fine lighthearted romantic romp that is fun to follow though Daphne is shallower than George in Seinfeld.  The story line is filled with amusing asides and entertaining TV trivia footnotes interwoven into the plot.  Fans of a blithe pleasant tale will enjoy this light summer read.  Harriet Klausner

 I am confused by some of the other reviews of this book. Not just by the low scores, but also with the comments therein. The majority of the complaints about the book seem to be directed at Heinlien's political views and his adamantness derived therefrom. Now this is all well and good, everybody is entitled to their opinion, but the weird this is... THERE ARE ALMOST NO POLITICS IN THIS BOOK! Okay, so what is the book about then? Well, it's exactly what you'd expect, it focuses mainly on Robert's writing career. Sure, there are a few political meanderings here and there, but they are extremely few and far between. Such off-target reviews are almost enough to make one wonder whether or not these people actually read the book. Instead, this book consists of a large body of letters that were written before and (usually) after the publication of a Heinlein opus. From his first published stories, to his juveniles, to his controversial adult novels, they're all covered here. The letters show a lot about what went into the making of his works, and also shows some other interesting things, such as the trouble that RAH seemingly always had with editors and getting his words out like he wanted to. There is also a picture and sypnosis of the original version of most of the stories and novels that RAH put out. There are also letters on various other topics (such as travel, house-building, domestic life, etc.), plus a short biography of Robert (written by his wife), and a highly convenient bibliography. My only complaint about the book is that there is almost no mention made of his books written after I Will Fear No Evil. True, this isn't his best work, but they are important, and do indeed contain some fine novels (JOB, Friday). Perhaps, due to the author's deteoriating health at this time, there weren't really any letters written. However, one wishes whatever there was was included so as to make this book complete. Thus, it's not perfect, but certainly not as bad as some other have apparently made it out to be

 As a cross-reference tool for determining the underlying causes of an ailments, I've found this book to be quite insightful, if not ahead of it's time. For example, I found it very interesting that many of Edgar Cayce's remedies included methods for dealing with digestion-related problems, elimination of accumulated toxins, and restoration of a person's acid/alkaline balance. These factors are increasingly being found to be connected to many of the same diseases that Cayce referenced in this book, from asthma and gallstones, to cancer. In my opinion, his readings went far beyond ordinary common sense, particularly for his day 
 For anyone interested in the philosophical underpinnings of the right, "Conservative Intellectual Movement in America since 1945" provides an astounding primer. Nash presents brief biographies of many of the major players in the conservative intellectual movement which trace their intellectual paths towards conservativism.  Focusing on many of the major players in conservative and liberatarian thought (i.e., Buckley, Kirk, Van Hayek, etc.), it also presents the opinions of many lesser known but equally important conservative and liberatrian thinkers such as Frank Chodorov, Albert Jay Nock, and Murray Rothbard. Nash also shows the opposing views of conservativism from intellectuals like Arthur Schelsinger, Jr. If anyone you know makes massive generalizations about the "myopic" views of conservatives and liberatarians then present them with this book as it shows the diversity of strands in conservative and libertarian thought. All in all, one of the best books looking at any intellectual movement I have ever read and I've read quite alot 
 You'd think that a guy who helped birth the ministries of people such as Matt Redman, Tim Hughes and Kevin Prosch would have something significant to say about worship.  Well, you'd be right.  In a very non-threatening, conversational style, Mike Pilavachi lays out a theology of worship that will likely stir the waters for many believers:  "How many times have you said something like `The worship didn't do anything for me today'? Hello! Whoever said it was for us in the first place?"  If you are one of the many that have become "worship junkies," looking for an increasingly self-indulgent excuse to get a "quick fix," this book will surely disappoint you. But if you've ever questioned the traditions-turned-doctrine that seem to have a strangle-hold on modern worship mentalities and methods, For the Audience of One will be a welcomed and insightful addition to your library

 This essay was Rousseaus's submission to the Academy of Dijon contest, entitled, "Has the progress of the arts and sciences contributed more to the corruption or purification of morals?".  This text is his story about Nature, and Society, and the scandal that happens when people come together, build, divide, dance, sing, and compare themselves with one another. In many ways, it is his answer to the problem of evil.  Natural man is, in many ways, good, because his needs are immediately felt and immediately fulfilled. Social man begins to compete, to hoard, and to use cunning to enslave his fellows, to gain their esteem, take their property, and sometimes their lives.  His picture of the natural man is half what we think of an "animal" and half the "human" that we recognize in ourselves. He shifts his description as the flow of arguement dictates. The habitual provocateur, Rousseau - watch him!  In a way, he is rewriting the Christian "Creation Myth". In his version, evil does not originate at that moment when man eats the fruit of the "Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil" --to "be like God"; it happens when Adam wants a better apple than Eve's got for herself. Before society develops as we know it, Adam would have been fine with just a pear 
 Big & Rich took the music industry by storm when this, their first album, hit #1 on the Billboard charts in 2004. Some people criticize their fusion of Country and Rock, but I must say that I think that they are fantastic. First of all, I must say that the combination of Big Kenny Alphin and John Rich's voices produces music that has a real feeling of power like I have never felt before. Also, while they are most know for their bouncy songs like Save A Horse (Ride A Cowboy), they do have a broad range of song style, with such songs as Drinkin' `Bout You, the touching Holy Water, and the inspirational Saved.  Overall, I really like Big & Rich, and think that they have a great career in front of them. I have yet to have heard a Big & Rich song that I didn't like, with this album being a really great one to listen to on my long car rides. So, if you want to hear a great album, with lots of genre-busting songs, then get this album. It is superb 
 She is 9 years old and we are "trying" to read one page per day.  I hope she learns how powerful it is to link new words to visually funny meaningful situation.  Holiday time makes it hard to stick to our schedule but I am not really worried since her SAT is some years away.  : 
 I found this book excellent!  It's a great way for children tolearn, not only about the world's most famous maritime disater, butfor them to also have an understanding of what life was like for the wealthy to have lived during this era.  I plan to be a teacher and have already acquired this book and have read it to several children. What a better way to promote history than through a true story, and with the perspective through a bear's eyes.  Highly Recommended!  If fact, I am doing a rhetorical criticism paper on this book 
 Being on a Beach in the days of George Hamilton's golden tan! Great movi 
 This is more of a supernatural thriller than a si-fi type book...one of the few that I have read by Ms. Norton (&Miller). The story of Susan and Kuydall house is a nifty tale and well worth the read if you can find it.  A novel addition to any Norton collection 
 I think this book is an essential first book on the theory and practical application of the positve appreciative process.It defines the terms, provides the research and background of the process and gives first hand stories of its application in the real world 
 This is a superb book and at 738 pages it is a long read and full of information and facts but if the reader can stick it out it is well worth it. Plenty of notes and an impressive bibliography ensure the reader it has been well researched.   The first chapter starts with the attack on the USA consulate by an angry mob in Pakistan in 1979, where the Pakistan military is slow to respond and eventually no one is held accountable leading to much bitterness in the consulate, as the USA Government bends over backwards to accommodate the Pakistan Govt. This trend happens often throughout the next couple of decades leading up to 2001.   This is essentially an excellent account of the history of the CIA in Afghanistan from 1978 until 09/11, with information about the Saudi and Pakistan Intelligence Services involvement in Afghanistan and the cooperation, double dealings and mistrust between the three agencies as each sought to impose their agenda on Afghanistan. However they all agreed that the Soviets had to be booted out of Afghanistan. As one CIA operative said in the early days of the Soviet Union occupation, we will supply weapons in Afghanistan to kill Soviet soldiers; a measure of revenge for Soviet Union involvement in Vietnam of course, of course!!. However this strategy eventually backfires somewhat years later as some USA supplied Stinger missiles end up with the Taliban and other anti USA groups! (including probably Iran of all countries, what kind of deadly game the USA played here). Ironically Gorbachev, before the Soviet withdrawl from Afghanistan tried to warn the USA of the clear danger of Islamic fundamentalist and sought USA co-operation, but was ignored.      Coll also provides an excellent account of the history of the Taliban, Bin Laden, Al Qaeda and the unsung hero of Afghanistan Ahmed Massoud, leader of the Northern Alliance. It is ironic that Massoud saw the threat of Islamic terrorism and Arab jihadists in Afghanistan many years before 09/11 and pleaded for USA help against the Taliban but was brushed off with little assistance as the CIA and the USA Government failed to grasp the significance of what was happening in Afghanistan. As the CIA allowed the Pakistan intelligence to distribute most of the money and weapons supplied by the USA, Massoud unfortunately obtained little of it as the Taliban was favored by Pakistan! Alas the USA rarely challenged Pakistan or Saudi policy in Afghanistan and missed the opportunity of working with Massoud who was a natural ally against Al Qaeda. Were the CIA and USA leaders asleep at the wheel in foreign policy on Afghanistan for too many years?  The author thinks so.  With so many competing interests in the world on USA foreign policy l can empathize with it on how difficult the situation in Afghanistan was to manage and make decisions about. Clinton finally saw the threat of Al Qaeda and Bin Laden and did his best to eliminate him but the book mentions several lost opportunities that went begging as the author implies that Clinton was not up the task of forcing the Pentagon to pursue military options, but it is easy to be critical after the event.  A few USA officials, notably from the State Dept did see the danger in the CIA policy and action in Afghanistan but their views did not prevail  Coll states that the bells were ringing loud and clear in the months before 09/11 that an attack on US citizens was imminent.   Australian troops over the last two months been involved in their most intense fierce battles since the Vietnam War in search and destroy missions of the Taliban in the Chora district of Southern Afghanistan, with USA airborne fire support. The battle still goes on 
 In 1733 Benjamin Franklin released the first Poor Richard's Almanac. He was by no means famous when it appeared. Another twenty years would pass before his electrical experiments brought him worldwide attention. But some Philadelphians knew Franklin as a dedicated printer and public servant. Regardless, Franklin needed a  marketing gimmick to gain a percentage of the crowded almanac market. This bold trick involved his main competitor, Titan Leeds. On the inside cover Franklin (writing as "Richard Saunders" or "Poor Richard") predicted Leed's death in October of that same year. It worked. The "scandal" spread throughout Philadelphia and sales of "Poor Richard's Almanack" skyrocketed. Leeds did not die, of course, as predicted but Franklin (Saunders) hilariously stood his ground in future issues.  This very slim volume, reproduced to scale, also contains some of Franklin's best known sayings. "Eat to live, and not live to eat" lies buried in the grid for the month of May. Dozens more phrases peek out from the text, including "He's a Fool that makes his Doctor his Heir", "Hunger never saw bad bread", "Beware of meat twice boil'd & an old foe reconcil'd", "He that lies down with dogs, shall rise up with fleas". Of course Franklin didn't pen many of these phrases, but he cleverly aligned them for his own purpose.  A lot of history sits in these fourteen pages. Vestiges of astronomy and 18th century thought fill up each page. This almanac served many purposes. Its pages list the year's eclipses, court schedules, Quaker meetings, planetary motions, and "A Chronology of Things Remarkable". Another page lists the distance between towns. Franklin also included a list of kings (listing Saunders as "an American Prince, without Subjects, his Wife being Viceroy over him"). Entertainment was also on the menu.  With this volume Franklin's true fame begins. Though Poor Richard didn't outsell all other almanacs at the time, it maintained a special status with its audience. Franklin retired Saunders in 1758. He had quit the printing business years before and, thanks to his illustrious reputation, dragged into politics. As Poor Richard faded Franklin entered the world stage. His life then followed the progression of the American Revolution.  This small pamphlet demonstrates Franklin's timelessness. His publicity stunts and pithy sayings still resonate today. Franklin helped create America, and Poor Richard marks just one phase of his fascinating life. Surprisingly, only a single copy of the original 1733 almanac survived (according to the incredible Franklin Tercentenary exhibit which displayed the rare specimen). This reproduction faithfully presents Franklin's first almanac as printed by him. Fans of Benjamin Franklin or American history buffs should definitely pick one up 
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It gave me a behind the scenes look at the lives of one of the greatest R & B groups of all times. I couldn't put it down 
 This book is amazing.  Now a seasoned professional, I've been writing Perl for 4 years and it all started with this book.  It is so well organized with succinct examples that I still pick it up almost every time I write a Perl program.  If you have no experience with programming, particularly if you are a Windows user, this book is light out on some important points, specifically, how to run Perl programs under Windows.  If you are a Linux or Mac user, however, you can easily dive right into this book by simply opening a text editor and terminal.  Despite the omission of Windows instructions, I would still highly recommend this book for Windows users wanting to learn Perl.  If you have done any other programming, or know how to use a search engine, you can figure out how to install and user Perl on Windows 
 Ronald Kessler has given us a book that is quite pleasant on several levels.  First, it is nice to get to know more about the First Lady.  While all of the wives of the Presidents are admired by Americans, Laura Bush is particularly admired and loved.  She projects a warmth and intelligence that draws admiration and affection.  Kessler gives us just enough about her origins to let us know that the calm and strength we see has been there from her beginnings and what her early life was like.  Her friends recall instances of her calming influence and strength that resonate with what we see in her public appearances.  Second, we get to see the truly loving and mutually supportive marriage of George and Laura.  The stories of how they came together, the struggle to have kids and the birth of the twins, their finding their way in life as part of the Bush clan, and much more is quite engaging.  The picture we get of them as people is quite different than the phony images the media paints of them (i.e. George likes to read).  We also learn a couple things about Laura that we might find a bit surprising (i.e. she is still a "stress smoker").  Third, just as we gain a more real image of their marriage, we also get corrective information about false stories about each of them that were touted so loudly during the election.  The fatal accident that Laura was involved in as a youth, her supposed drug dealing, George's supposed drug use at Camp David, and many more are all cleared up quite specifically.  It is great to get the real story from the people who actually know and go on record rather than the gossip and innuendo put forward by Kitty Kelly and her ilk.  Kessler has given us a book that reads easily, is not overly fussy in detail, and gives us a portrait that we feel good about and comfortable with.  There are several pages of interesting pictures for Laura's life.  We come away feeling comfortable with our admiration for her and realize that she is an even better person than we had suspected.  Good book and one that you should read in order to get a more accurate picture of our First Lady and the President 
 This book is fantastic. Just enough fantasy. Best thing is, the story of these kids' lives would be just as great without the fantasy, but adding it in just made it better. Absolutely one of the best S.K. books i've ever read, and i've read them all. The movie just doesn't do the book justice at all. 
 i bought this cookbook due to the introductory price I received and have loved every recipe I have tried.  Many of the recipies are heart healthy and I have found those to be tasty and easy to prepare.  Good luck and good cooking 
 Loving Annabelle is by Katherine Brooks, who i pour my heart out to. This film is truely outstanding, the warmth of the characters is what kept me hooked. The emotion the leading characters Annabelle and simone go through kept me gript. I really felt for Simone and did not even notice the age gap. Really good film, must be seen!!! 
 Great movie no smut no porno no swearing no crudity just great comedy from the old time comedians. Recommend it for family. Hollywood doesn't make them like this anymore 
 With the exception of the Hudson Brothers' McCartneyesque "So You Are a Star," all these tracks were monster hits.  Best of all, this CD gathers some difficult to locate songs, all in their original versions 
 Enhanced with the lush and beautiful photography of John Glover, Spiritual Gardening: Creating Sacred Space Outdoors by Peg Streep is a compendium of horticultural inspirations and contemplative wisdoms with respect to creating a garden that would function as a personal spiritual sanctuary from the cares, concerns, stresses and problems of our daily lives. Not merely a nice thing to look at, an effective spiritual garden would engage all of the senses and connect our minds and hearts to an inner balance of tranquility, aroma, and healing. Drawing upon ancient traditions (including those of Zen Buddhism and Native Americans), Spiritual Gardening will enable anyone to design a very special sanctuary combining earth, wind, light, water, and living plants 
 The lefty behind set of books is some of the most exciting and enjoyable books I have ever read.  As a very slow reader because I'm very dyslexic, I find my self just glued to the books and can not put them down.  The series is fiction but so credible and the authors keep you interested throughout the book with many twist and turns.   
 Not only the best C book I have ever read, but probably the best computer-related book I've ever read.  The explanations are clear, consise, and yet detailed enough for a complete understanding of the material.  The figures are simple and helpful, and there are a lot of short pieces of example code to help out.  The end of each chapter features a "FAQ" section where the author answers quite a few common questions you might have as you read through the chapter.  It's the one book that has never let me down...I have always been able to find the answer I was looking for.  I wish the author would write a book about every field of computer science 
 This 2-disc best of collection from the Eagles is a great success.  Often bands that have been around for a while and have already put out Greatest Hits collections release these 'best of' compilations that are either almost identical or are inferior to the old greatest hits packages.  Still other bands use them as an avenue to tack on some new material.  Not so with the Eagles.  Though they've attached their new single "Hole in the World," this 2 disc collection truly is the new definitive greatest hits for the band, replacing and far outpacing the band's previous 2 volumes of hits. The set also features a very well done booklet with stories of how these hits came to be.     These discs have all of the major hits and most of the minor ones.  The Eagles have always put an emphasis on quality releases, putting out relatively few studio albums that are surprisingly short on "fluff" and useless filler.  This collection is no different--very little to nothing is overlooked here.  This collection features everything from the smash hit "Hotel California" to the more country rock-style hits such as "Peaceful Easy Feeling," "Tequila Sunrise," and "Desperado."  The Eagles put out so much high quality material that it is absolutely necessary to have two discs to get a comprehensive review of the hits.  This set is the new standard, must have collection of hits, replacing the old "Greatest Hits" volumes 1 and 2. 
 What can I say about this that the other reviewers have not said?  1) Do not buy this book first. It is the third in a series, and the books are much more enjoyable read in order. It would do well, standalone, but much better in order. So go buy Master and Commander but be warned! If you saw the movie, the plot is different, so forget the movie, and enjoy!  2) It was with this book that I think O'Brian knew he was in  series. At the end of the previous book he gives the main characters unotld wealth which sort of means a lack of tension going forward, so at the beginning of this book he takes the money away.  3) It's a great book. I enjoyed it thoroughly 
 Using a popular novel by an actual attorney, director Otto Preminger pushed the bounds of 1959 American movie censorship by directing and producing one of the most frank, hard-hitting, and engrossing films of the 1950's.  It was certainly the most adult film that James Stewart had made up to that time and, given his preference for "family films" in later years, this may have been the most shocking film of his career.  Its honesty and innovations are such that it remains remarkably realstic and relevant today.  Filmed mostly on location in and around Marquette, Michigan (on the picturesque Upper Peninsula, near Lake Superior), "Anatomy of a Murder" has few dull moments, if any.  It is certainly one of the most accurate, authentic courtroom dramas ever filmed, especially since the judge is played by the legendary attorney Joseph Welch, who had presided over the Army-McCarthy Senate hearings of 1954.  Welch is absolutely delightful and fascinating to watch, a true natural in his portrayal of a "country judge."  James Stewart is the defense attorney in the story, defending Ben Gazzara's character, who is accused of murdering the man who allegedly raped his wife (played by the sexy and beautiful Lee Remick).  He matches wits with a prosecuting attorney played by George C. Scott in one his earliest major roles.  The legal sparring between the two attorneys, sometimes including a local prosecutor, makes for great drama.  Stewart is aided by a crusty, alcholic, older attorney played by veteran actor Arthur O'Connell, and his wise-cracking, sarcastic secretary, played by Eve Arden, who was then best known for her work on the long-running "Our Miss Brooks" television series.  As Stewart does some investigation of the case, he visits an inn that is run by Kathyrn Grant, who was actually Kathryn Crosby in real life.  He eventually learns an amazing secret from Miss Grant.  Adding to the delight of the film is an encounter with the one-and-only jazz musician Duke Ellington, who also composed the syncopated, magical music for the production.  Stewart was a gifted amateur musician and, when he sits down at the piano with Ellington, there is a special, quite enjoyable treat.  Otto Preminger continually strived for greater originality and innovation in his films.  Known for his autocratic direction, Preminger nevertheless sought to make more realstic films as he battled with those who wanted to keep Hollywood within strict moral bounds.  Preminger obviously recognized that Hollywood needed to tell the truth, even if it might be unpleasant or disturbing.  Perhaps the presence of James Stewart helped to make the mention of women's underwear and even rape more palatable during the trial in this rather controversial film.  It may be hard for younger viewers to imagine that this film was quite incredible for 1959, especially in America; only the French and Italian filmmakers were able to go farther during the 1950's.  Perhaps things have gone too far in recent years, but this film is clearly honest and realistic.  The stark black and white photography adds to the atmosphere of the Upper Peninsula location filming, particularly in the scenes in the woods, around the lake, and even the towns.  Overall, this remains a very entertaining and fascinating film 
 I have been using Zen V Plus for the past one month and have to say that I  am more than satisfied by the performance of this product. I did expect the product to be small but was really surprised by the size when I received this product.  Pros: - Small and yet easy to handle - Good extras: recording  Cons: After a month's use... I did not find any as such, but considering the size I would say that an arm-band should be included as a free accessory with this product.   P.S.: I have seen some reviews (for the 4GB version) where people have complained that the device hangs when the charging cord is pulled from the  PC. I did not notice any such issue. May be creative has improved on the firmware. I would suggest that people facing this issue should check the website for any firmware updates 
 This was an excellent experience.  My movies arrived very promptly and I have had the pleasure of watching them numerous times.  Everything went well; the DVD's were still in their original wrapping and excellent condition!  I will definitely order from here again 
 I just got this book for my 2 year old.  He and I have read it for 3 nights straight...he picks it out every time at bedtime.  He enjoys saying along with me..."no millk" as each page ends in that blurb.   Repetition is fun for little readers, and this book is cute and funny.  I  recommend it for city kids and farm kids alike. : 
 This book was recommended by the trainers at Think or Swim. It was a great in depth overview of option trading. 
 This broad is a pro with no moral sense. A manipulator with no heart or conscience. Except for the murder aspect I'd say I see her in action in my social settings every day. Good movie about a particular type of woman 
 I just got the Norman record today and I was pleased with it. It still is not as good as his work on the old MoJazz label to me, but its definitely some treats on here for the die hard Norman fans. My favs are: "You Keep Lifting Me", "It Aint Over BWB", "So In Love" (my favorite), and " A Quiet Place". Some great guests with Brian McKnight, Rick Braun, and Kirk Whalum. Norman will do well with this record as he never strays too far from what got him here. "After the Storm" is still my favorite Norman record, but I am pleased with this offering.. 
 This camera is fantastic.  I also own a $3500 Sony mini-dv and the picture quality of this camera is virtually identical.  Transfer what you've shot to DVD, or just play it right off the tape onto your TV and you will be blown away by the broadcast quality of the image.  It's very small, and has some great easy-to-use features for shooting in the sun, shade, action,etc., and even extreme darkness. A built in lens cover is also convenient. After owning this camera for only about 5 months though, I got an error reported with other Sony mini-dv's "dirty tape head."  Well, the tape head was actually fine but the damn message wouldn't go away no matter what I did, so I had to have it repaired. I had bought it at Sears but wanted to use Sony for the repair and after telling them the truth and that I was very disappointed, blah blah - the $212.00 to fix the camera I just bought for $450.00 was not fair - they agreed to take the camera and fix it for no charge.  (The point is that Sony is making an effort, I believe, to satisfy their customers.) Nonetheless, because of the problem I had, I feel compelled to recommend that a person purchasing this camera go ahead and buy the SONY warranty - directly through Sony before the 90 day manufacturers warranty is up.  (It's only $117 for 3 years and you'll have piece of mind.)  Should you have to buy a warranty? No. Do things break? Yes.  Hell, I've had plenty of stuff break that just became useless. The point is, this camera is really awesome and worth owning. You can charge it without using the dock however the dock is cool for transfering to your computer or any other source. The battery that comes with it lasts really long too. This camera also has analog capabilities which can be handy for transferring old VHS tapes to mini-DV 
 Brilliant, Spectacular, Amazing... What more can you say? The Green Room CD not only grabbed my attention but also my friends. As a younger listener I thought this CD was wonderful. The Song "Nothing Can Stop My Boys" was full of die hard laughing for not only minutes but hours. This act could be the next RENT as said in an above comment (and I am a RENT fan and so are so many others!). "All About Me" is another great song to listen to especially if you really know how it feels not to get the "Sandy" part or the "Danny" part. Brilliant music, Brilliant writers, and Amazing voices all infiltrated into one CD. Way to go to all of the team who put this CD together. 
 Love this TV.  Took me months to decide on something for my smallish kitchen.  So happy I bought this one.  Great picture quality; light as a feather if you have to move it; takes up minimal amount of space; and last, but not least, price was just amazing 
 The Modern Dance is one of the best releases from one of the greatest bands of all time. Ubu's next album, Dub Housing, matches its greatness, but very few other albums since have. These albums find perfect blend of abstract punk, perfectly angled noise and psychotic vocals.  "Non-Alignment Pact" kicks off with annoying feedback and then blasts into possibly the greatest garage punk song ever. My favorite song on the album is probably "Life Stinks" because Thomas sounds like a madman more than ever. Other perfect songs include "The Modern Dance", "Street Waves" and "Real World". Sure, a few songs' on the second side are kind of compromised (listenability-wise) by their artiness. But the closing "Humor Me" makes up for it ten fold. Get this album and be blown away.   I can understand that some people find David Thomas's voice an acquired taste. But don't stop listening to it because you don't get it at first...you will soon, and you will love it and realize that there is not a more fitting voice for the amazing music behind it. Listen to "Street Waves" and "Life Stinks" and you will undoubtedly see who inspired the Pixies. Thomas's psychotic, stream of conscious ramblings obviously influenced Black Francis.. 
 any leftish baffon who writes comments like yours proves that i need to read the book. i look forward to a terrific read. 
 Once I opened this book, I was hooked. The author's writing style grips you by the throat and drags you along with the survivors and the victims of this horrific yet history-making catastrophe! Every time you go into an office building and see a glowing exit sign, idly note that the doors have crash bars and open into the stairwell, or brush up against a fire extinguisher or hose cabinet, you'll remember why they're now mandated to be there. This disaster should never have happened, and this book explains why and how steps were taken to keep it from happening again. But it is also a book about people--those who made it out alive and those who didn't, and the little choices that made the difference 
 I'm adding this book to my list of gifts to give at Bridal Showers. If you're like me, you have days when you stare into the pantry wondering what to make for dinner.  There's food in there but does it make a meal?  With this helpful little book, I've been able to go to the cupboard and pull together a complete meal for my family without running to the store for missing ingredients.  My two favorite ideas in this book are the Master Skillet Meal and Master Soup recipes.  A bit of this, a dab of that, throw it all in the pot or skillet, cook for awhile, and dinner's served. I'll never buy those convenient pre-packaged boxed dinners for tuna or hamburger again 
 Insomnia is quite simply about a web of lies, and the consequnces they can produce. It is very well acted on both Pacino's and Williams part, and Swank was brilliant as well. Besides all that good stuff, I am also a fan of the director, "ever since I saw Batman Begins" and find his artistic vision to be incredible.  The only problem I had with this movie was the ending. Sure, it showed how lying could defeat a person, but I thought a little redemption would have been nice.  However, if you have a strong stomach, or a good editing company, I suggest you see this.  
 As a practicing clinical psychologist and parent of a 6 year old son, I would recommend this book highly.  Even with previous training in the field, the book helped me gain a fresh, creative, and positive  perspective  on common everyday behavior problems.   I even gave a copy to my son's teacher, who implemented several of the ideas with great success.  It was a really great gift.  The  ideas in the book are specific (charts and reward coupons included!!), effective and fun 
 I love this Book its true classic King. For me it was a quick read and I loved every minute of it. Malkes me wonder why he changed what made his books so great. I just am glad he is finaly back in form. (or atleast close 
 This book is a rare and HONEST look at Hollywood behind the scenes. Tatum O'Neal is one of the bravest actresses to come out of Hollywood in a long time. She has revealed sad and depressing tidbits about her life and her family and reveals what really goes on behind all the glitz and glamour of children brought up by some celebrities. Think what you will about her airing her dirty laundry but I feel she has taken huge risks in exposing some key issues in her life,her family and the overindulgence of famous people. Her children are blessed to have such a brave and courageous mother who has come through so much and lived to tell about it. She gives hope to those who struggle and wonder if there truly is a way out of addiction. Fame or no fame this beautiful woman has come through and survived alot. Go Tatum 
 Did you ever want to learn about "hedging", "options", and the like? This book teaches the essentials of financial talk. But beware of typing errors, especially in the first three chapters 
 The Ramones what can i say? Greatest band ever? Maybe not but pretty darn close.For all those to stuck up to like the ramones because the poor production and lack of fast guitar solos are really missing. The Ramones were born on 50's bubblegum and the new york dolls the stones and beatles. If you are new to The ramones i recommend not starting with this album because you might be turned off cause lack of audio quality. Try A greatest hits or Rocket to russia, road to ruin, End Of the Century, Brain drain, or pleasant dreams. The Ramones debut is a great great album really what rock n roll should be about not 30 minute drum solos 
 It stars Reese Witherspoon and Kiefer Sutherland, with a number of other notable actors pitching in their notable talents such as: Dan Hedaya, Brooke Shields, and Brittany Murphy, oh, and you can't forget the brief, but sincere performance by Bokeem Woodbine.  TO THE MOVIE!  It uses the story structure of little red riding hood and changes the wolf into a real man in this movie who just so happens to also be a rapist, murderer and pedophile.  As you can tell the story has now become quite adult in it's telling and is not for kids as the rating would let you know. TO THE TITLE OF MY REVIEW!  Yes, this is an artsploitation movie meaning that it actually has artistic goals and it obviously has some dirtier ones as well, but what makes most of the film compelling is the performance by Reese Witherspoon who makes the films highs and lows poignant even when they're outlandishly warped and humorous in a dark way.  There are times when the film fails at its attempts by going for too much, and at other times it hits hard and accurately.  This is not a perfect, or consistent film, but it is entertaining in a very askewed way.  When this film was supposed to be released in the United States the company that made it balked at putting it in theatres thinking that it wouldn't find an audience, which may be true because of its outlandishness, however, it wasn't given a chance.  It had a very short one or two week run at one theatre and was rushed to video.  Even Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times was surprised at the corporate decision since he felt Witherspoon's performance in this film was one of the breakout performances of that year. Well, you can't keep a good woman down and she broke through with another movie and continues to do good work, but I don't she'll be able to top this movie because the roles she's taking now are based on her star power and are mainstream vehicles.  She's supporting kids now and I don't think she has the latitude, or time to accept these roles that are far more marginal in appeal and risky, but I'm glad that she made this film and in a strange way I'm glad that the film didn't make money at the box office so I could purchase it for $5 at Best Buy and be surprised at how good it was.  If you are an easily offended person of good taste in film, don't watch the movie, if you're a mainstream person seeking out Reese films, don't watch it.  If you're a casual film watcher looking for a feel good film, don't watch it.   If you're a person who likes dark humor and doesn't mind a movie that takes big chances with its action  and/or you like to see every single movie of a movie star to see if they were always so...streamlined, than this is the film for you 
 In the last 2 yrs I have read all of Patricia Cornwell books, some Tess Gerritsen, Iris Johansen, and so on. So far Sandra Browns Chill Factor is the best book I have ever read. It has kept me interested and kept me thinking about it even after finishing. I would definately recommend this book and writer, I certainly plan on reading her other books. 
 ... one of the greatest poets ever. in my opinion. reading his poems as oposed to listning to them on a album is a vastly differnet experiences. his words touch me like no other. this book is absolutly amazing, especially reading the things the dead never played. "jack o roses" the seventh section of "terrapin station" is the most beautiful thing iever read ( you can hear hunter sing it by going to the hunter archive at dead.net".  everyone should read this, and for the few that really get it, it will be a transcendant experinece 
 Thanks to Dr. Burke that he'd reviewed amazing world of cycling to me.  But some chapter have too hard to understand data that lots of equation (maybe i'm to stupid to understand)    Good source for serious cycling. 
 This CD is very relaxing.  I can drive and not be stressed about the traffic during rush hour.  The voices of the singers are truly magical 
 While some might fault Mr. Carter for missing some of the deeper philosophical ambiguities of the integrity and ethics questions, at the same time, he also misses a large segment of elitist abstract and obstruse  arguments that make no impression on the normal people who are the American  democracy.  Mr. Carter does the nation a great service by stating the  obvious (which if it was really obvious, wouldn't need stating in book  length) in language that is sufficient but not difficult and using  examples, that, while some might decry the close historical distance, are  examples of things that are still close enough to be common knowledge, and  thus, readily understandable without long explanation 
 Great magazine for families with kids! My son loves all of the activities that can be done! Great price too 
 To say this novel was a mystery does it an injustice, it was so much more.  A fully realized literary treat for avid readers of Lehane's Angie/Patrick series, or for just a casual reader in general.  You do not have to have experience with the other novels in the series to appreciate this one, though it does help immensely if you have knowledge of the respective pasts of Angie and Patrick in establishing their character for this novel.  Lehane tackles a tough, disturbing subject in a manner that makes you think.  There are no easy answers here and for readers wanting a neat, tidy ending, you will not get one in this novel. In that way it is true to life often.  If he had ended the series here, it would have been alright because nothing will ever top this novel.  I read somewhere they were trying to make a movie of it, and I will see it, but the emotional intensity of the novel will be tough to match when condensed to two hours.  To sum up my feelings about this novel, I will say this, Michael Koryta (young mystery author of some acclaim) credits this novel for turning him into a writer and making him want to write.  For those of us without the talent, this novel makes us wish for more, that we could somehow have penned Lehane's words as they are heartbreakingly true and real 
 When I started reading this I only had the vaguest inclination of what the Beowulf story really was. It had everything I'd want in a story, strange characters, interesting plot, and it evoked such emotions as excitement, dread, and repulsion. I found this translation particularly interesting though because of the footnotes. The entire thing is riddled with footnotes explaining possible variations of words, different explanations and theories, etc.   I think the best part of the entire story was the most unintentional aspect of it, the fact the last sentence ends after three words leaving the reader to wonder. That all being said I'd only recommend it to people with the iron stomachs needed to deal with the brutality of the ancient world as well as an inquisitive mind.  
 I found this book to be quite remarkable and very timely.  The story moves back and forth between France and Algeria and tells an intricate story of a very complex family.  The relationships between the family members and their connection to their heritage is fascinating.  The language is superb and many of the descriptions literally raised goose bumps.  I only hope there will be more books to enjoy by this young author.  Her writing is exceptional and her story provides a valuable insight into what it is NOT to be an American.  I loved it and plan to buy it for several friends 
 This c.d. has more of the old-time bluegrass style than Alison's later releases.  She sings her heart out in this, and I love it. It's this pure approach that makes it my favorite of all her albums 
 Author Leslie Wainger provides a comprehensive guide to the romance genre and outlines in detailed steps how aspiring authors can navigate through the industry.  Her experience and knowledge make this a strong reference guide for anyone hoping to improve their craft.  "Writing a Romance Novel for Dummies" is a valuable tool that will remain on my bookshelf for years to come 
 I will keep this short and sweet as it seems my reviews tend to get lengthy. This book is a must if you and your famly, kids, significant other etc love "soulfood." I went from not knowing how to cook cereal to every holiday or function someone calls me to make Mrs Patti LaBelle famous Macaroni & Cheese. I kid you not everythng I've made came out delicious! I probably had one "trial & error" event but that is inevitable when cooking. So to the reviewer who complained about that must know nothing about cooking. Again fantastic cook everyone love love ove my food!! 
 A great, humorous, and moving autobiography that really isn't about acting, fame, and wealth, but about being human and trying to just figure out life. Alda's book is full of quest, not for fame and fortune, but for understanding of the world. In his evolution as an actor, he evoles as a human being. Acting, after all, is a great study of humanity and the world. An enjoyably readable book, as Alda's prose is humorous, poetic, symbolic, and real. The paperback as a touching and beautifully appropriate coda. Grade: A 
 A classic- I was referred to the book via Cantor's the "invention of the middle ages", and once again, I was not dissapointed.  I would imagine this is the standard work on the topic, judging from its continued popularity after being in print for half a century.  The histoiographical method- his use of various sources and willingness to give voice to many which "traditional" history ignored, is most impressive.    Considering that this book was first published in 1957,Cohn was ahead of his time in his presentation of a social history of the "Pursuit of the Millennium".  The cast of characters is colorful, to say the least: ranters, flaggelants,  the brotherhood of the free spirit, taborites, anabaptists.  You could almost call this a history of the "pre reformation".  Classic text 
 Bob Dylan once said: "I always believed one man, the lone balladeer with the guitar, could blow an entire army off stage if he knew what he was doing." Here, it's clear he does.  I have every Dylan album and I always seem to find myself back at Another Side Of. In my opinion, this is his best work. This is the last of his purely "folk" albums and by far the finest. I can play this from start to finish and never get bored. It's just Dylan, an acoustic guitar and his harmonica on every track (bar Black Crow Blues, which features piano). His lyrics are more personal and perhaps contain some of the most remarkable, poetic imagery (Chimes of Freedom, Ballad In Plain D especially) you may ever hear. There are hundreds of reasons to buy this album, but two points that struck me were:  * His voice is so rich and deep on every song, much like it was on Subterranean Homesick Blues. None of that husky, hoarse stuff ala Times They Are A-Changin'. It's gobsmackingly good and, rightly, has been placed at the top of the mix. It takes centre stage and really knocks you off your feet. * The remastering is spectacular. Sounds as though Dylan is sitting on the edge of your bed, singing just for you.  Legend has it that Dylan recorded this album in one drunken night. Perhaps this explains I Shall Be Free No. 10 and Motorpsycho Nightmare - two very humourous, lighthearted (but still excellent) songs. Yet he also recorded My Back Pages (In my opinion, perhaps his greatest song), Ballad In Plain D (You'll be hard pressed to find a more emotional, honest, tearful, graceful break-up song), It Ain't Me Babe (timeless classic), Chimes of Freedom (incredible lyrics), To Ramona and Spanish Harlem Incident - six of his most beautiful songs. Throw in I Don't Believe You and All I Really Want To Do and it's basically faultless.  Because the sound is purely guitar and harmonica, there is a great "feel" and "flow" from beginning to end. You never feel the urge to skip tracks. It also increases the emphasis on Dylan's words - all of which are sensational. He was apparently going through a phase where he wanted to write poetry, plays and novels as well as songs, and that creative surge is expressed here.  Overall, I cannot recommend this cd more highly. It is Dylan at his folk singing best. The remastered sound is absolutely stunning. For anyone who considers themself a fan of either Dylan or heartfelt folk music, this is essential 
 This is a very good film from director Anthony Mann starring James Stewart and June Allyson. The film focuses on the operations of post-war America's modern Airforce and the lives of the men and women who lived it. It is beautifully photographed by William Daniels and Tom Tutwiler. We slept much sounder at night knowing the Strategic Air Command was above us protecting our freedoms around the clock. James Stewart's performance is one of honor and conviction 
 I just want to add my voice to the other 5-star reviews.  I would say that David Copperfield is one of the three best novels of the 19th Century (the others being Moby-Dick and The Brothers Karamazov).  It has one of the most memorable collection of characters and situations between Don Quixote and Ulysses.  Even though neither of us has read the book in over 30 years, my wife and I often refer to it--to things like Littimer's imagined "But you are very young, sir," or the coachman warning young David about "the school near London," or the menacing sound of "Brooks of Sheffield," a character who is only a stock phrase, but a Murdstone stock phrase.  The one thing I do not agree with in the reviews here is the idea that one should read Great Expectations before reading this.  Although David Copperfield is twice the length, it is nonetheless the easier and more immediately engaging of the two masterpieces 
 Every time I hear this cd it takes me back in time of when I was a little kid.  Every song on here is his own and is the bes 
 As an independent filmmaker, I rely on investors who could choose to put their money into just about anything. "Get Them on Your Side" does an excellent job of demonstrating how to get across a radical idea in a way that can be palatteable to all walks of life.   No matter your profession, this book will hold at least a few useful tools that will make your professional experience more gratifying and your time more effective 
 Halfway through the book, I was worried.  Katie MacAlister is constantly in danger of letting her sense of comedy overwhelm her novels - losing the meat of characters, momentum, tension, etc., in her desire to punch out something irreverant, spunky, and lightly entertaining.  For a while, I was really worried that she was going to ruin Fire Me Up and Aisling Grey by turning it into a (not necessarily funny) sketch routine.  But she didn't!    What counterbalances the broad comedy so well in Fire Me Up is the sheer unfairness of Aisling's situation - you'd have to be quite a cynic to dream up all of the awful things that she experiences in this book.  She is blamed, suspected, betrayed, misjudged, and patronized at every turn.    This novel has a satisfying narrative arc, while also leaving room for the situation to change in later novels as Aisling and the other characters evolve.  The action centers around a conference of Otherworlders in Budapest, and a couple of murders committed there.  Once again Aisling is a suspect and scrambling to clear her name.    She's also looking for a mentor, adapting to her new role as a Guardian and hoping to learn enough to do the job right.  And Drake appears as well - for a not-so-coincidentally timed conference of dragon wyverns.  A lot of things happen on that front - Aisling finds herself embroiled in dragon politics, intra- and extra-sept, and back in a love/hate sort of relationship with Drake.  (I, too, had a love/hate relationship with him in this book).  By the end I was totally enthralled and happy with the book and I can't wait to read the next one 
 Nas continues to hold it down and drop that hot s***. No rapper, EVER elevates his game the way Nas do. This double CD delivers, maybe it doesn't stack up well against others who did it before him but that doesn't make him any less better. Nas did the unthinkable, he paid tribute to one of the greatest rhyme spitters in history and the dude is stll alive. The legendary Rakim. Nas also gets raw on tracks like Disciple and suicide bounce.What I admire the most is he didn't go lookin for the biggest names in the game to feat on his s***. Dude took it back and got Doug E. Fresh w/ Luda on Virgo. Really there's too much talk about. If you starvin for real hiphop and sick o this bulls*** thats bein forced on your ears. Cop this 
 this book is a treasure trove of information.  Details about politics, daily life, social mores, everything is in here somewhere, and even better  it's backed up by quotes from medival sources. Nicholas is a fine scholar  who presents a mountain of data in an intelligent and engaging manner 
 I first came across this book about ten years ago and when I did I instantly became a Jock Sturges fan.  But it wasn't until resonantly that I realized just how powerful and deep his art can be.  Visiting an art gallery I was stunned by the detail, contrast and the three dimensional quality of Jock's full sized prints.  The images you see in his books might have been taken with a medium format camera such as a Hasselblad.  Viewing his full sized images, with all their extraordinary detail, you become aware of just what an 8 by 10 view camera can achieve in the hands of a true master.  The models seem almost alive.  But this wasn't my only surprise.  Many of the images I saw at the art gallery had never been published and I thought that these were Jock's most profound and challenging work.  One such print, "Julien et Antoine, Montalivet, France; 2004", really knocked my socks off.  We see two beautiful young twin brothers, as naked as the day of their birth, in a bedroom.  We know this to be an adult's bedroom as there are no toys or other childish things about, only an adult sized backpack beside the bed.  The translucent canopy draped over the large bed and the house plant visible in the upper left corner gives the room a romantic, almost feminine feel.  Yet the boys, still a year or two from puberty, seem to own this very adult space.  Antoine is seated on the bed, very relaxed with his arms at his side.  Julien stands before him and with an almost sensuous sence of self-confidence he establishes a relationship with us by gazing directly into the camera.  His arms are crossed over his chest-perhaps for protection-but, like his brother, he makes no attempt to hide his exposed genitals.  His weight is resting on his left leg and his body is shifted sideways in a pose that suggests he is well aware of his beauty and emerging sexuality.  This little boy is no longer entirely innocent.  He knows that evil exists.  He is aware that there are those who would see his beauty as an obscenity and his trust as a come on.  We feel privileged that this beautiful boy has allowed us, the viewers, to examine every detail of his stunning body as he meets our gaze without fear or shame.  But at the same time we feel challenged.  The boy knows that if there is any indecency the fault lies not with him, or with his brother, but with us the viewers.  If there is evil then that evil is in us, not him.  This picture is worth much more than a thousand words.  If "Julien et Antoine, Montalivet, France; 2004" were to be compressed to the point where it was small enough to fit in a book-or be posted on the net-the stunning technical skill and detail of the photo would be lost and as a result it might well appear pornographic.  I felt as if Jock had lead us right up to the edge of the void and then, at the last possible moment, pulled us back to safety.  This is surly one of the most beautiful, powerful and potentially disturbing images of the twenty-first century 
 This is one of the best generational sagas about Japan that I have read.  All three women in the book represent a time of change, yet all three are multi-dimensional and understandable characters.  It is difficult to find  quality Japanese liturature in English by women.  This is worthy of the  name "classic&quot 
 Leila Rupp has done a competent job of examining same-sex relationships in American life, beginning with colonial attitudes, all the way through the "coming out of the closet"era of our own time. She has laid aside her historian's objectivity to tell us bits of her own life story. I hadn't realized that many same-sex involvements were looked upon more tolerantly in earlier times. The entrenched positions, pro and con, that are present today, are anomalies, considering the history she provides. One comes away from the book, also, with an appreciation for the confusions and mysteries that still cloud our view of same-sex attachments. No one has the answers, and no research thus far has explained why things happen this way. As a hetero wife and mother of four, I must admit that I have very little understanding of the feelings of gays and lesbians, especially since my own view of female sexuality is not limited to just the male-female attraction, and copulation. To me, female sexuality is that and much more---it is bound up also with maternity, with conceiving, bearing, and raising one's children, with breast-feeding one's babies, with nurturing a family, with holding grandchildren in your arms. Rupp makes one weak reference to "diffuse female sexuality." Yes, it is diffuse, compared to male behavior. I can understand "romantic friendships" as Rupp describes them. Most girls go through this stage as young adolescents, and throughout their lives, most women treasure their female friends, who often are able to provide more necessary emotional support than their husbands. Yet somehow it seems sad to me that lesbians live their lives outside the fulfillment of diffuse female sexuality, which involves a male partner, pregnancy, nursing---a rich, heterosexual family life 
 Thank you Daniel Tammet for this look into the life of autisum.  It helps me to understand my own autistic son 
 The Oresteia is a fantastic trilogy.  Although it is about 2500 years old, it is still relevant today (Why does Saddam Hussein deserve a trial?).  This edition is particularly good becuase of the fantastic essay, The Serpent and the Eagle, which makes up about half the length.  I found Agamemnon initially hard to read, but after I took my time, it all made sense.  Maybe this isn't the best introduction to the classics for a young person, but it is worth the effort.  And isn't that really the point 
 As a speaker Im interested in books on the topic and this is kind of that as it is for people before the public who want to get noticed and as the title says 'win the crowd'. The author details many of his techniques as a magician and he is obviously qualified to talk on the subject. I found the work pretty interesting, at time fascinating but for most of us not sure how relevent. If you're interested in the topic though it is worth taking the time to read. 
 In it's time, Everything everyone should know about Disney but are so infatuated with the mouse, they wouldn't think to ask. Hearty reading enjoyment for those who don't buy into the plastic fantastic unreality that is Disney    
  There's something I want to get out of the way immediately.  For a long time now, I have not subscribed to the mythology of the differences between the sexes.  Quality movies are quality movies and will be enjoyed by both sexes. (The following are examples of movies found in this movie guide that could quite easily be enjoyed by both guys and girls: Play Misty for Me, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, Sid and Nancy, Leaving Las Vegas, The Shining, A Streetcar Named Desire, Gaslight, The Big Easy, The Best Years of Our Lives, To Die For, His Girl Friday, Marty, What's Love Got to Do With It, An Officer and a Gentleman, Singin' in the Rain, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, The Remains of the Day, The Purple Rose of Cairo, and To Sir With Love.)    Also, movie critics of quality will not promote low quality movies, regardless of their gender.  Nancy Peske and Beverly West, the authors of this book, have very good taste in movies, and rarely allow a clunker to slip by uncriticized.  Their reviews are concise and go quickly to the heart of what is right and what is wrong with the movies that they scrutinize.  And they definitely know the difference between a story well told and a story poorly told, e.g., they champion Play Misty For Me and denigrate its remake, Fatal Attraction.  Their sense of humor is also top notch, as evidenced in the sections entitled "Phony Gal Films that Really Piss Us Off" and "Guy Films That Are Actually Gal Films."   And I am thrilled by their ability to describe a movie plot in one or two paragraphs and then cut directly to the analysis of the movie.  (ALL MOVIE CRITICS would be well advised to emulate this.)  This is easily one of the best movie guides around.  Be careful not to let the title fool you.  Both girls and guys should find this guide very useful.     
 I got this book a long time ago when I was heavily into HP Lovecraft.  Something about HPL's writing strikes a chord - even though it's cheesy, something about it feels TRUE, and that's scary ... so I started chasing down his sources, to read what he had read, in order to make sense of the feelings his writing evokes.  The Golden Bough was the first one I found, probably because it is still widely available and can be found in most bookstores.  HPL always put it on his doomed occultist characters' bookshelves alongside the Necronomicon, "The Witch Cult in Western Europe" (which does exist and can be bought here at Amazon!), and the "Unausprechlichen Kulten" of Von Juntz. In the "Golden Bough" Sir Frazer takes the basic premise of explaining the strange rite of succession of the priest at Nemi, and uses it as a launch-pad to go into a long, drawn-out discussion of the roots of magic and superstition, and how so-called "primitive" beliefs have been common to all cultures in a certain stage of their development, all over the world. The subject matter is fascinating, but Frazer's writing style is very dry, very British, very turn-of-the-(20th)century academic ... and he rambles.  Some chapters he seems to be lost on a sidetrack, distracted by the unending cascade of interesting facts and anecdotes, but ultimately he returns to the main idea just when you thought he had lost it forever.  The contrast between the "holy crap" amazement of what he's telling you and the soothing, hypnotic monotone of his written voice actually gives me a strangely pleasant tingling  sensation along my spine after about 15 minutes of reading. Of course I don't expect everyone (or anyone at all, for that matter) to have such a visceral reaction, but most readers with any interest in the shadowy depths of human thought and spirituality will enjoy this book immensely 
 As scary as this book is, I thank Derrick Jensen and George Draffin for writing the truth. Modern survalence is a threat to our freedom. Anybody who wants to know what those in power are doing to monitor us, or what they plan to do read this book. Not only is it full of facts, but Derrick helps you come to terms with what all of it means. People now-a-days dont have a huge problem with giving up some of their freedom for security. But what those in power are doing with this information is down right scary, and un-acceptable. It is a quick read too. It will bring up huge topics, define and break them apart, and open your eyes to modern technology; all in a days/weekends read. Overall great read. A++ 
 Hey I'm from Germany so please dont be angry about my english.  A lot of people wrote that this box set is not as good as the japanese.  OK... but then dont buy it !  This Episodes wich are newly remastered have a completely new feeling and IT IS a completely new experience, and in my Opinion it is a lot more fun to watch the remastered episodes ! And even the widescreen cropping is giving a new look to the Episodes, all is new !  Because the colors look more realistic and its just beautifull. AND YES the automatic noise reduction sometimes looks disturbing but it looks perfekt 99% of the time.  So do not grumble about funimation they did a good job !  And before you are angry about the set and write bad reviews.. dont buy it because nobody forced you watch it !!  For all the Dragonball Z fans worldwide i can just recommend the set for you it is a lot of fun watching it 
 This book is really great.  I've used a number of its recipes and processes and have not been disappointed.  Having lived for some time in Japan, cooking from this book has brought back memories.  It also helps decipher all those 'strange and abominable' products in the local Japanese market.  Rather than settling for instant noodles, I can now brew up an excellent broth and cook noodles just like the yakuza flunkies outside the subway stations.  Her explanation of sushi rice has also been very helpful. For a beginner (particularly a Westerner intimidated by salt-embalmed fish), I think this book is an absolute must-have.  Never in my life would I have imagined that I would have a use for dried sardines, and was pleasantly surprised to find what a flavorful broth they can be coaxed into producing with Ms. Booth's patient guidance 
 This may be the best Junie B. book yet, at least from a grown-up's perspective.  The rivalry between Junie B. and Tattletale May escalates in this book until it threatens to ruin the Christmas season for both of them, and the choices Junie B. has to make as a result of this are wonderful.  Without giving anything (or at least not too much) away to those who have not read this one yet, let me just say that, as a mother, I was so proud of Junie B. at the end of this book.  Hooray to Barbara Park for yet another great look inside the head of a spunky kid 
 While reading A Painted House, I had to keep reminding myself that this was a Grisham book!!  It honestly was not like anything else of his that I've read, and I was happily surprised.  The story of a farming family and the workers they take on that summer to help with picking cotton, is one that sweeps you up almost immediately.  The characters are so rich in description and the dialogue so compelling that before you know it you're thrown into the middle of the story that centers around a young boy who is trying his best to interpret the world around him.  In the meantime he's growing up a bit too fast.  The conclusion tied the perfect bow on this present of a story.  I'd definitely recommend this book to someone, especially Grisham fans who may have a bit of trepidation in reading something not centered around law.  
 I normally do not read mysteries, but the unique slant to this, and  previous titles in this wonderful series has me hooked. Owned by 6 cats, I  found this book, and its predicesors  a "can't put the book down"  kind of read.  Joe and  Dulcie are fabulously developed characters and  Dulcie is absolutely adorable. After this last, I wonder when these two  will have kittens, and if they will be as intelligent and vocal as their  parents.(Hint)  Thank you, Shirley R. Murphy, for such wonderful tales. My  kind of books they are. Keep them coming 
 'Word Wars' quite obviously has its genesis in Stefan Fatsis' outstanding book 'Word Freak,' a fascinating look at the Scrabble subculture.  That said, I wish the movie used more of Fatsis.  He appears here with some commentary, and the filmmakers note Fatsis' book and his immersion into the playing circuit.  His observations on the game and its personalities at the tournament circuit's upper echelons are the best part of the movie.  Additionally, Fatsis' book and this movie have resulted in ESPN now showing some of these tournaments.  Fatsis is the analyst on these telecasts.  His journalism background + his Scrabble cultural immersion make his commentary fascinating.  Fatsis does have his own Scrabble movie ('Scrabylon'), and that may have played a part.  In truth, Fatsis' smaller role is probably due to the filmmakers' treasure trove of material resulting from its coverage of four  of the nationally-ranked players.  Frankly - and these guys would be the first to admit it - these are four less-than-fully-formed human beings.  That's the fascination of the movie.  Only one of the four has anything nearly resembling a 'job' as the general public would see it.  These gentlemen have filled their lives with their Scrabble obsession.    It's of extremely good fortune for the filmmakers that one of the four featured individuals eventually triumphs that year - in front of the cameras - at the Nationals.   By the way, for viewers of the film, here's a neat kick: go to Stefan Fatsis' 'Word Freak' here on these pages and you'll see the spotlight review written by none other than G.I. Joel himself, Joel Sherman 
 This is the best book I have read so far on where and who the real enemy is and who is behind and against the U.S. supporting democracy and the liberation of the people of Iraq. Breaks down in detail who is Sunni and who is Shiite. How they work and how they are fighting U.S. Forces together. How the real enemy is Iran with many proxies to gain control of Iraq. How the U.S. must change to deal with fighting in Irregular Warfare now and for decades to come. How the enemy is capitalizing on U.S. democratically controlled Congress to gain victory.  Heading over to OIF II in a few months, active duty CDR O5 who will be working in support of the bravest of the brave (EOD Forces defeating IED's).  This book was instrumental in developing a understanding of what is really going on.    I would recommend this book for all Officers and enlisted personnel heading to fight this fight from E1 up.

 The entire Star Wars saga doesn't and never will have an equal. This book picks up on the things that you might not have in the movie. If you're a dedicated fan, you may be disturbed by the fact that the dialect isn't quite the same as the movie :) If you want to know what happened in the missing moments with Biggs, this is the best way to find out. A wonderful edition to your Star Wars collection, if you can manage to get your hands on it 
      Kenneth Deffeyes, a graduate of the Colorado School of Mines with a Phd from Princeton, started work in the Shell research lab in Houston in 1958. He makes the claim that global oil production is peaking and will decrease soon. He humbly lays out his credentials, he thoughtfully outlines his reasoning, and he provides a depth of background data and explanations.       While his basic premise is tremendously important for our economic and political future as humans addicted to cheap oil, Deffeyes makes his points with an easily readable combination of sound science and grandfatherly humor. He covers the mathematics of Hubbert's curve, the basics of mined energy sources (natural gas, coal, tar sand, oil shale, and uranium), and the basic physics of hydrogen as an energy carrier. These may seem like dauntingly complex issues, but Deffeyes covers them with clarity. Throughout the book, you get the impression that you are chatting amicably with a wise and friendly grandfather who has something very important to say 
 If it had a faint logo on the back like real photo paper no one would know the difference!  This paper and the Epson Stylus Photo 960 are an excellent combination 
 all I really wanted was some place where I could keep track of the books I read and my thoughts on them. This book is wondefully laid out but it is oriented more for people who belong to reding groups or book clubs etc. If you just want a little book diary for yourself then do not buy this book. Do yourself a favor and buy a regular notebook but if you do belong to a group or like to discuss your books then this is an excellent buy 
 This was a fantastic read! Very accessable to all ages, various art forms, and levels of experience. Most books that talk about acting and making it in the arts don't neccessarily focus on some of the most key areas: integrity, presence, artistic vision and inspiration, staying connected to the world, and confidence. This book did. I am sure I will refer back to these chapters time and time again throughout my career as a performer 
 I recently gave this book to my mother-in-law who is an avid tennis player.  She loved the tennis celebrity side and my 8 year old daughter will be eating lots of grilled vegetables, thanks to Mia Hamm's recipe.  Beautiful, fun reading cookbook for a cause that touches all the girls in our lives 
 Long one of the great independent American literary and cutlural critics, Leslie Fiedler has based his expository style on ironic audacity. In 1948, as a young academic, teaching in Missoula, Montana, he published an essay  suggesting that a principal recurring myth of American literature was the  interracial homoerotic romance, "as physical as a handshake,"  where white and colored males leave civilization for life together in open  territory. Since his examples included such familiar characters as Huck and  Jim, Queequg and Ahab, Natty Bumpo and Chingachgook , Fielder's thesis did  not suffer from a lack of sort-of persuasive evidence.   This essay,  "Come Back to the Raft Ag'in, Huck Honey!" was included in An End  of Innocence (1955), Fiedler's first collection, and has since been  reprinted many times, sometimes with disclaimers. For good reason. Like all  classic essays, it can be reread many times over for its subtleties and  witty turns. And it opens this book, which is the second Fiedler Reader.  The first appeared well over two decades ago.   One problem with this new  book, however, is that, given the invitation to produce a second selection  from his work, if not a reinterpretation, Fiedler missed the opportunity,  simply recycling the previous Reader book with the addition of a few more  recent pieces, inevitably disappointing those of us who expected something  more audacious, if not Fiedlerian.  Nonetheless, even in these more recent  writings are classic complicated sentences with a wealth of ideas amid  elegrant, original phrasings. Consider this about gun control: "But  anyone familiar with the long struggle of the rising bourgeoisie for  equality, which climaxed in the French and American Revolutions, cannot  doubt for a moment that this key passage in our Bill of Rights, like  earlier revolutionary manifestoes, unequivocally demanded that along with  such other privileges as the rights to vote and to learn to read, once  reserved  for the rling class, the formerly oppressed classes should be  granted the right to carry guns, which, appropriately enough, to this very  day are called in the vernacular, equalizers." From its opening  declaration of a subject through its asides to its punchline, this is  marvelous writing.   I've always ranked Fieldler among the great American  essayists in the late 20th Century, one of the few whose style can be  compared with H. L. Mencken's; but, though he is essentially an essayist,  his prose hasn't recently appeared often in American magazines, so many of  them devoid of irony and other subtle humor, not to mention contributor  independence. What A New Fieldler Reader suggests to me is a depressing  thought--given current editorial limitations, he may well be the last of a  kind 
 This book exposes the lack of serious biblical sholarship behind the Left Behind series and the whole pre-millenialist worldview. Rossing reminds us that this is NOT a biblical interpretation held by Roman Catholics, Lutherans, mainline protestant churches and even many evangelicals. This is a minority view held by fundamentalists and some evangelicals. This understanding of the Bible is so contrived that it can only be perpetuated by misinformed parents passing it on to their kids and through fictional action-packed books and bad movies. Besides illuminating the (short) history of dispensationalism, Rossing emphasizes the serious dangers it has on our planet. I recommend this book to everyone. Roger seminary studen 
 Vathek was Caliph in the area of approximately present-day Iraq, at some unknown time in the past. He was generally a fair person, but woe unto him who got Vathek angry. He lived in an immense castle, with the absolute finest of everything. One day, a very strange, and very ugly, man stood before his throne. He had a hideous laugh, but didn't speak. He showed Vathek all manner of rare and exotic items, including sabers inscribed in an unknown language, inscriptions which kept changing from day to day. The stranger was thrown in prison for his unwillingness to speak. The next morning, finding the stranger gone, Vathek totally blows his top.  Finding himself outside the castle, at the foot of the nearby mountains, Vathek hears a voice coming out of a huge crevasse. It is the stranger, called a giaour, who promises Vathek all the powers of heaven in exchange for the blood of fifty young boys. Vathek provides the boys, through the guise of a sporting competition, then the giaour reneges on its part of the deal. When the people, especially the parents, understand what's happened, Vathek has to get back to the castle and lock the doors, until the anger subsides.  Later, Vathek commands the creation of a great caravan to a place called Rocnabad, home of famous springs. For various reasons, he needs to get away from the castle for a while. This is going to be the biggest, and grandest, caravan ever. On the journey, the caravan is attacked by wild animals, with a number of casualties. Vathek, his wives and senior advisers, can no longer be carried the rest of the way, because of lack of personnel, but actually have to walk to Rocnabad.  At Rocnabad, there is a castle as big or bigger than the one that Vathek left behind. He meets a young woman named Nouronihar, who he wants as one of his wives (as Caliph, what Vathek wants, Vathek gets). She is promised to a man named Gulchenrouz. The lovers drink a potion that will make them look dead for several days, then, the idea is that they go and live somewhere else, away from Vathek.  This is one of the very few novels set in the world of the Arabian Nights, a world of eunuchs, slaves and harem girls. It was first published over 200 years ago (in the 1780s), so the style of writing is very different than what is normal for a modern reader. Therefore, it will take some patience on the part of the reader. If you can find a copy, it is time, and money, very well spent.  
 we absolutely love this book.  it has every drink you can imagine to make 
 Where should I start, Well it was 1997 when my older cousin said let me show you a game. It was of course FFVII, I was BLOWN AWAY by the game. At the time I was 7 years old. I immediatly bought the game and played it straight through.   I always loved the music, it was one of the many fine elements of the game. Nobuo Uematsu did an amazing job with the music he is truly an amazing person, If I saw him walking down the street I would bow before him and kiss his shoes (I bet I'm not the only one who would do that).  Here I am now 15 years old just listened through all 4 (YES FOUR!!!) CD's (which I put on my iPOD. I was blown away, with each song I remember exactly what took place in the game and where I was and what I was doing.   Any fan of FF would love this but even people who never played the series would appreciate it, but if you have played the game straight through you can get the full effect of it.  The price you say may be high but lets do a little math here. All four CD's cost $29.18 now there are 85 songs. Divide and each song will cost about 34 cents, yes 34 cents. You buy songs on iTUNES for 99 cents. It's a great deal, I would pay $100 for this.  If you played FFVII BUY IT!!!!!!!!!If you havn't played FFVII buy the game, it's the best game ever screw Halo 2 
 Once you've read the popular histories of the Crusades, and your appetite for the original source materials has been whetted by the excerpts in Payne, Runciman, etc., you will want this book.  It's  THE source reader for the Arab perspectives, better in many ways than The Crusades Through Arab Eyes (Maalouf).  You get the flavor of the culture as well as their particular slant on the events and personalities.  And the snarky footnotes can be delicious 
 From reading the 22 previous reviews of Ms. Rubin's PMFS to date, it appears that people either loved it or hated it.  To those who hated it, I would suggest that they are reacting to her words as if they were prescriptions, rather than the unjudgemental description of human behavior that I believe the book to be. Ms. Rubin is not advocating for anything here.  She is merely describing how people act with one another in modern society.  If someone finds what Ms. Rubin has written to be shocking, I'd suggest that this is only because she portrays human conduct so accurately.  I'm don't believe that Ms. Rubin is saying anything new.  What is new, is that she has compiled an extensive, well-organized catalog of human behavior as it relates to PMF and S.  Further, she provides the answer to the moral qualms on the last two pages.  I thought so much of her cold wisdom that I put the book in the mail to my son at college today, in the hope that Ms. Rubin's insights will help him weather life's storms a little better.  First Corinthians this is not, but neither should it be.  That kind of wisdom is available elsewhere.  Ms. Rubin's kind of wisdom is harder to come by.  Ms. Rubin's facts are astonishly abundant, and clearly illustrate her points ("true facts"...I think is how she puts it.)  It would be interesting if the book had been footnoted rather than just a selected bibliography, but perhaps that would be gilding the lily.  Maybe, I just want to know where she found all this out.  I am rapidly becoming an enormous fan of Ms. Rubin's works, and regret that she is not making a tour to promote her newest work about JFK.  I would pay good money to sit for an evening and listen to what Ms Rubin has to say 
 I found this book to be very readable.  I disagree with the reviewers who found it to be a "McBook."  It is true that, like most authors, Grisham doesn't always deliver -- but he certainly does in this one!  I couldn't put this book down once I had started.  It is the story of two boys, who see something terrible -- a suicide.  But before that, one of the boys is told something dreadful by the man -- a secret that the mob wants, the police want, the FBI wants.  How the eleven-year old boy deals with that, and the folks who help him, is what this book is about.  It would make a great movie (if iut hasn't already been made into one!).  I enjoyed every word of it 
 I sometimes wonder why a reviewer will trash a book in the presence of so many positive reviews.  Maybe there are readers out there who just like to be contrarians for the sake of being contrarians.  How dull.   This book is so good, I wrote my college thesis on it.  I cannot count the number of times I have read it over the years.  Why all the fuss? First, I suppose in 2001 this book might seem tame and trite.  Joyce, Proust, Mann, Faulkner, Woolf, Garcia Marquez, Cortazar, Pynchon, etc have already come and gone.  Now days, it might seem totally uninteresting for a dead person to narrate a book, or for the author to purposely lie and mislead the reader, and for those readers who like their books "Serious" it might be annoying for the narrator to crack jokes, make fun of everyone, and otherwise disrupt the whole solemnity of reading a "great book."  Bah humbug!   This book was published in 1881, when the continentals were all reading and imitating Zola and the English speakers were all reading and imitating Henry James.  This book amazingly snubs the whole "realist-naturalist" aesthetic.  Why can't the narrator be a liar?  Why does the narrator have to "show not tell?"  From a historical point of view, Machado de Assis is impressively original and independent in his style, obviously influenced by those innocent and flabby 18th century English novels by Fielding and Sterne. But for those who inspect closely, there is even an amazing amount of social criticism going on in this book: Roberto Schwartz, a Brazilian critic, has analyzed Machado de Assis's books as social criticism extensively.  For the interested, his writings might be worth a peak.   Finally, after having been forced to view "literature" as a serious, high-brow concern my whole life, this book was a refreshing read: finally a relaxed, funny, light read that didn't stoop to be base, shallow, are insulting at the same time.  At an age when I desperately needed to be reminded of it, this book reminded me that we read to be entertained.  And the best books are those that entertain over and over again without going stale.  The worst books are those that come across as stale on the first read.  Amazingly, a lot of books that I was trying to read because they were on my college professors' "great books" lists now strike me as amazingly stale.  This book continues to entertain, however 
 As with all the books in this series, you simply cannot go wrong. On a recent trip to central Texas, we took this guide with us and were able to follow along the drive and both visually and scientifically understand what the geology was all about. A truly great geology guide for Texas 
 This is the type of book I wish I had available growing up. It is a wonderful source of advice on golf and life. Butch blends the right amount of information on his background and famous students along with a touching tribute to his Dad.   His is very honest and his stories about Greg Norman and Tiger are fantastic.  I was halfway through the book when I had Amazon send a copy to my son away at college. 
  I have already done individual reviews of the two practices contained in this DVD but I wanted to give an overview of the combined practices found on this excellent DVD.    By way of background, I have been practicing Yoga daily for over 9 years, with a large library of yoga VHS/DVD/CD (around 100). I also have been studying for many years with an excellent Yoga teacher, but that's only once a week so the heart of my Yoga practice is at home w/ my collection of Various Yoga media.     This DVD contains two practices, led by Yoga teacher Sara Ivanhoe, and is an excellent pair of routines. The first, "Joy of Yoga" is more basic, a good introduction to Yoga. The second,"Fat Burning Yoga" has more of a Vinyasa flow style to it (more of a "Power Yoga" feel). It is a challenging but doable program that is around 40 or so minutes long.    I feel that Sara particularly shines as a teacher in the second ("Fat Burning") program, but of course that may just be personal preference because I tend to like those more challenging, flowing types of practice which really build heat in the body.   I want to say a bit more about the "Fat Burning" program.    The routine is extremely well put together. The poses build gradually starting with simpler movements that warm you up and gently take you into the more challenging versions of the poses from one series to the next.   She has a student who demonstrates modifications which is always quite important for a program like this where you may have a person who has never done yoga before or who may have physical limitations.   This is a very thorough routine which leads you through a wide range of motion and also incorporates a really wonderful flow.   My only miniscule complaint would be that I prefer a longer guided relaxation before the final seated pose, but of course one can always just shut off the program to extend their relaxation and then put it back on to finish it off in sitting. This in and of itself wasn't a big deal because there is still at least some semblence of relaxation (which is treated gratuitously in many programs).   Highly recommended!   Namast 
 REALLY LOVE ALABAMA BEEN LISTENING TO THEM SINCE THEY STARTED. THE CLOSER YOU GET IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES 
 If everyone in the world read this book just once, it would be such a more enjoyable place to live in.. 
 A reader's reaction to "Julie and Julia" will most likely depend on their taste for smart-aleck, bawdy, candid, and self deprecating women writers like Merill Markoe and Ayun Halliday. If you like volumes like "It's My F*&*^$ Birthday" or "Dirty Sugar Cookies"...or, for that matter, TV shows like "Ally McBeal" and "Sex In the City"... you will probably be able to get into the humor and witticisms herein. Readers with more reserved, conservative tastes...whose idea of good reading begins and ends with the "Life In These United States" columns in "Reader's Digest"... will probably not care for "Julie And Julia". But I think this is one of the funniest, most entertaining books I've read in several months.   I have great respect for culinary giant Julia Child, and I am rapidly developing into a decent cook, but I have no desire at all to tackel "MtAoFC", any more that I would try a Charlie Trotter collection - it's simply out of my league. But through this book, I can vicariously live out the experience through the eyes of a quirky, sympathetic author who doesn't try to hide or minimize her own ups and downs through married life, city living or the ebbs and flows or a year long project. I feel that the account Powell gives here is a truly honest representation of what it would be like to tackle a project such as this. However diligently you try to focus on a "life changing daily practice", your spouse, family, friends, coworkers and neighbors are still  the biggest influences on your daily life and they will always have an enormous influence on the outcome of any project of any scope. And as much as anything, "Julie and Julia" delivers on this aspect of living. To me, that is the real reason to read the book.    I have no idea what Julie Powell will try for an encore, but I am eager for more from her. 
   I bought this new version because of the great job Buddah Records did a few years back with Rock and Roll Heart and The Bells in remastering. I was hoping for more of the same from RCA/Legacy but it's not quite as good.     Whereas on those albums you can clearly hear every intricant sound in it's full glory (sounds are present on the Buddah releases that you can't hear on the originals that will just blow you away), the only thing I really noticed is that the overall sound level is higher and the sound more crisp.  That may be in part that more care was taken in the original RCA release (Rock and Roll Heart and The Bells were released on Arista)and not much left to be improved upon.  What I don't like is the high end hiss is still clearly audible (especially noticable on Coney Island Baby) but that may be from the original recording.   The bonus tracks are well worth the reinvestment though.  Yes, three were on Between Thought and Expression but there is some improvement on those.  The bonus version of She's my Best Friend is absolutely killer.   All in all a great disc and nice packaging make this well worth the money 
 One of the best collections ever! Thank you Mr. Liebrand for taking the time to put all of this wonderful songs together. Especially for including Patrick Cowley's remix of "I feel love", Moroder's disco-trance masterpiece. Patrick Cowley was able to perfect perfection by adding the high energy of his keyboards to the hypnotic rhythm creating the crowning jewel of all dance floors around the world! All the other  songs are great, but I would have pay the money just for that one alone. Long life for all of them whom keep on bringing back those treasures from the past!! 
 Eye of the Beholder is a very suspenseful and thrilling book. It will keep your full attention from the beginning to the end. It barely made me use my imagination to put a face on every person in the book, that is how well Behm writes. Not knowing what's going to happen from one minute to the next keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what the author has in store for you next. Horror has always been my favorite kind of book but this suspense thriller is a welcome change. Behm's style of writing was very interesting to me because he didn't drag the story out,he filled this book with many different interesting events. In other words this book was written about the characters over a long period of time, it wasn't just one event throughout the whole book. It took you along with these characters for many years of their lives and gradually came to a climatic end. This was a great book full of suspense and thrills and I would highly recommend this book to anyone 
 I am 6 years old in first grade and I love this book! I like the characters best. It's great. The words were not hard for me. I've got 20,000 Leagues under the sea, the last of the Mohicans, Robin Hood, and  Kidnapped, and Robin Hood is one of the best of these 
 I have read many books about Jewish resistance during World War II and this one is among the best I have read.  Once I started reading it, I could not put it down.  The book covers the life of Abba Kovner, a Jewish resistance fighter from Vilna, through World War II and its aftermath.  At the end of the war, Abba planned and executed acts of revenge against the Nazis.  This is described in the book as well as Abba's participation in Israel's War of Independence.  The book is well written and easy to read.  It gives you two different pictures of Jewish suffering during the war.  One picture is that of many of the Jews in the Vilna Ghetto.....one of fear and submission to the Nazi oppression.  The other picture is that of Abba and his group of partisans.....one of resistance and hatred of the Nazi oppressors 
 This is an amazing story of what started out as a branch of mathematics, and made a space for itself as a crucial tool in science. It spans a conundrum of ideas, and bits of the people who were bold and brave enough to have these thoughts and carry them into the world to be so easily used by all and sundry. It starts with the ideas of data being the distribution from KPearson, moves into the distribution being the data from Fisher, and thence into the branches that are the synergies born out of the marriage of these two grand ideas in statistics, with new age tools like computation and applications like epidemiology.   As with all tales involving people, the book is rich with drama:  the inevitable mess of personality clashes; men and women; fathers and sons; spanning countries, both rich and poor; a little epic all in itself. It's easy to get lost in a particular life, or an event; to form loyalties to one idea and constantly search for reasons to defend one's position. But the author doesn't let the reader lose the thread of the real story: it's about how statistics revolutionised science in the 20th century.   What warmed the heart the most, was to read of how these creators and analysers of cold, factual numbers, _worried_ about the impact of their findings and their science. It is an attitude that today's researchers and scientists need to keep re-orienting themselves towards. I abhor the saying: "there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics" because I think that that is a cop-out by people who are given the outcome of some very carefully constructed methods, and who ignore the instructions on the box that the methods come with. There is an equivalent of "caveat emptor" that comes with statistics - the last chapter in the book is a rather gentle attempt at pointing out the warning on the label.  I do thank you, Mr. Salsburg, for having written this book. All my life, I've learnt these tools, learnt to revere them without quite appreciating the vast and - may I use the word? - logical base that it was born from. This book has made me want to go back to the roots; it has made me think about where the next revolution can come from. It has made me want to help take it to the next step because I do think that the more the people know the base of uncertainty that all of our knowledge is coming from, the better a world we can be.  
 This is the first book in what will allegedly become a series. It is by a new British author, but she writes a solid book. I look forward to the next one. The main character is Gaius Petreius Ruso, a divorced and down-on-his-luck army doctor. He's a great character and his sense of humor gives the book a little depth. If you like historic fiction you will love this book 
 Ford's short stories are weighty, without being dull.  This weightiness does not derive from any complexity in concept or even character, nor does it derive from prose which is complex.  Rather, there is a wealth of detail in terms of what the characters are experiencing.  The common subject in this collection is marital infidelity 
 My mom told me about this book so i decided to give it a chance since I am not a big fan of romance novels. I read this book in a couple days and when I got to the end I cried for a long time. I have told everyone I know to read this book. They all tell me how much they loved it and how it made them cry also. I would recommend this book to everyone. 
 this movie is so sweet. After seeing eight preceeding films (all wonderful no doubt)where they squabble, it's so sweet to see them really act like a couple. The scene on the balcony of the Paris apartment, where Fred kisses her is aborable. Not to mention the acting is ducky. It would be easy to overact in a film like this but they pull it off fine. Ginger is a little scene stealer. (what else is new 
 Bring the Family is one of the most easily likable records of the 80s, and probably the most instantly accessible of Hiatt's career.  He still featurs a couple of songs off here in his live shows.  The band (Hiatt, Nick Lowe on bass, Ry Cooder on guitar, and Jim Keltner on drums) would reconvene in 1992 for another overlooked gem, Little Village.  Here Cooder's gentle sweeping guitar is the perfect compliment for Hiatt's "Lipstick Sunset" and "Tip of My Tongue," two of the most exquisite songs you're likely to hear.  Of course the big hit is "Thing Called Love," although not until Bonnie Raitt put it out the following year.    A quintessentially American record, probably the best from one of our true masters.  At the place where rock, folk, country, and blues converge to form real, authentic American music.  I'm calling it a classic 
 Richard Leakey is one of the most well-known, and respected, fossil-hunters today. One must stop to appreciate the irony of his rebellion toward his parents, without whom he may have actually had to go to college to establish the credibility he enjoys due to his last name.     Leakey's "shots" at Donald Johanson and other scientists aside, much of the analysis presented in "Origins Reconsidered" is quite interesting. His rebuttal of the "Lovejoy hypothesis" is well-articulated and rather persuasive. But the way he barely hints at his infamous "4-million-year-old homo habilis" fossil debacle (a claim he held far longer than evidence supported it) is awfully self serving.     The driving force behind Leakey's studies is this fundamental question: "what separated members of the genus homo from the "bipedal ape" australopithecines, and what were the environmental factors that favored homo's survival and led to australopithecus' extinction?" Nearly the entire book focuses on the analysis of this question, and rather eloquently at that.    This book would be best for the student of paleoanthropology, whose reading list on the subject would extend beyond this single volume. While scientifically valid, the range of theories in the area is vast, and each developing theory carries its own controversy. Only by understanding the range of these theories can one hope to have a good idea of the bipedal-ape-to-human evolution. 
 Sicx a.k.a. Triple Six Bounty released Dead 4 Life.  The disc was recorded around the same time as X-Raided's Psychoactive, but the album sat on the shelf for a few years before it was released.  The music is good, my favorite track is the ode to the 9MM.  Sicx can flow, the lyrics were not as deep or twisted as his next effort (If These Walls Could Talk).  If you like Horrorcore rap (not gangsta, this is much darker) then try Dead 4 Life!  Make way for the everybody killer!  "Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die. 
 I am using this cable to connect my compaq presario to my Samsung HDTV LCD 32inch and the image is great. I had no trouble connecting or anything. No loose screws and the quality of the cable wrapping is very good 
 For decades, Ray Bradbury has inspired a vast array of creative minds --- from writer Stephen King to film director Steven Spielberg, from rock guitarist Ace Frehley to astronaut Buzz Aldrin --- and now we get a very intimate look into the story behind the man. Sam Weller was given incredible access to Bradbury, his wife Marguerite, and many of his friends and family in an effort to compile this amazing look at the moments that built the framework of Bradbury's creativity.  Born in 1920 in Waukegan, Illinois, Ray Bradbury was a child of a father touched by wanderlust and big dreams at a time when the Great Depression had a stranglehold on the country. From Illinois to Arizona to Hollywood, Bradbury's family searched for work. Moving to various areas of the country, he never lost his simple midwest roots, which can be seen in many of his stories as he returns time and again to simpler times in Illinois autumns.  As a young boy, Bradbury was inspired by the adventures of Buck Rogers, Tarzan, John Carter of Mars, and a multitude of other fantastical wonders in print and on film. Weller shows us a young man who devoured books and always found the means, even in the hardest of times, to make his way into the movie theater. From these creations he felt the pull toward his own imagination, the results of which has entertained generations of readers.  In 1932, Bradbury had an unexpected encounter with sideshow attraction Mr. Electrico. The magician confronted him during his performance and shouted to him "Live forever!" Though Bradbury will no doubt have to leave us (hopefully none too soon), in the end he will have left behind a literary legacy that will ensure Mr. Electrico's bold command holds true.  As a young man whose youth was touched by hardships and tragedies, including the deaths of two siblings, Bradbury persevered and showed millions of readers the beauty and mystery of things on Mars and beyond, as well as the great discoveries to be found right in front of their very eyes. His work is a beautiful blend of the fantastic and the real, and they have a common humanity that touches all who read them.  Sam Weller's biography of this fantastic man makes him all the more human, and the reader is able to see that the most outstanding and astonishing fantasies have their roots in the simplest moments of everyday life 
 This has been by son's favorite book for months.  He is now 7 months old and will look through our books for this one.  We recently took a long airplane trip and this was one of the items we brought along--it worked  beautifully 
 HOW TO BECOME A RAINMAKER by Jeffrey J. Fox is one of my  all-time favorite books on selling . . . if you're in that field or know  somebody who is, do that person a big favor and get him or her a  copy . . . they'll be forever grateful.  I recently heard the follow-up, SECRETS OF GREAT  RAINMAKERS--written and read by Fox . . . for this latest effort, he conducted over 50 interviews with industry leaders from a  variety of field . . . .he then shares what he learned in a series of short chapters that all contain very powerful messages.  The amazing thing about Fox is that he takes what can be a difficult task and makes it relatively simple, provided that you listen to his advice . . . what makes it so interesting is that much of what he shares can't be found elsewhere.  For example, he tells you not to knock your competition . . . for if you do, you're telling your customer that he or she is stupid for considering somebody else.  He also presents "killer questions" that can be helpful in selling anything, such as:  * In addition to yourself, who is responsible for making this decision  happen in your country? And what might be their concerns about  going ahead?  * [when a customer has a question] Why do you ask? And how important is it to you?  There were many other memorable tidbits, including: * In a sales call, the customer should do 80% of the talking.  * Play Rolodex Roulette at least once a month. Give it a spin, pick some names, call some of them.  * Always use an intriguing postscript.  * The phone call never sells anything.  * Only after you get the order can you ask a non-business question.  * 90% of salespeople don't ask for the order.  * Always ask for something on a visit; e.g., a tour of the facility. If you're the one being asked to take a tour, that's a buy signal.  * Take handwritten notes on every call. Then summarize your notes in a follow-up letter to the customer.  * Don't mail your proposal. A good proposal, well written, has a 15-18%  winning percentage. Good proposals, when presented in person, have a 55-65% winning percentage.   * People who ask for the sale in person have four times the chance of getting it than those who don't.  And my personal favorite: * In the future, some power point presenter will be arrested for boring  the customer to death!    
 Absolutely delightful. Robson Green and cast are right on their marks.  Great escapist fare.  
 For any of us who remember Sharon Kingsland's marvellous history of population biology MODELLING NATURE a new Kingsland on Ecology is worthy of celebration & this book is certainly just cause for enthusiasm.  Here Kingsland brings her meticulous research and engaging writing style to bear on the origins of the science of ecology in the United States. Nicely footnoted, with some choice illustrations of key players, the book reveals a broad range of facts and personalities that too often get glossed over in ecology texts. Of neccessity much of the book examines the birth and growth of botanical ecology, but Kingsland also gives us valuable insights on the animal folks, and, as we move closer to the present the "ecosystems ecologists" like the Odums who came to dominate popular perceptions of the science.  This is a must read for anyone interested in where ecology has come from and hence where it may be going 
 I have had this selection on vinyl for many years. As Kavity Killer (Dentist per chance?) notes this album is akin to a spiritual mantra. Mississippi John Hurt was counting days to his promised land when he recorded this music, in all of its profoundness, in 1966. Sometimes we miss the greatest poets in our own life, concentrating instead on sensationalist memorabilia. To listen to this simple music is nye on hearing the angels for any true lover of the folk-blues tradition. Buy it, this is no one just after fame and fortune here. This is timeless.   
 Wine Report 2004 by Tom Stevenson is an exceptional reference for both the expert and the beginner.  I'm in the wine business and have dozens of wine books which each have their merits.  Mr. Stevenson's New Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia is one of the benchmarks of the business and is respected world over.  The Wine Report 2004 is a much smaller book in comparison, but it's chock full of information.  Relying on local experts to cover the various regions of the world is a well chosen strategy.  The Grapevine section at the beginning of each chapter provides juicy (no pun intended) gossip for wine insiders.  It's also great to read the opinions of the experts and their predictions/hopes for the future of wine in their part of the world.  The information inside is as current as it gets.  Simply a great pocket reference for the wine insider.  Well done 
 from the sky was a pleasant surprise.farish uses simple melodic foregrounds and canvases the background with synthesized atmospheres and hints of minamilism. if you love amethystium, this disk is a must have. very similar and yet unique of his own right 
 The cd is a great change for CRR...they stay true to who they are, yet give fans a new sound to love.  Great cd...I highly recommend it 
 I have not gamed in years. Actually since shortly after the 2nd edition rules came out. The 3.5 edition greatly simplifys the game and improves the balance. This 3 in 1 collection is a great value and provides all the basics you need to start playing or running a game 
 John Candy is a very funny actor, especially with the cast he is working with in this movie.  Very hearwarming movie 
 This is a great movie. The Adam Sandler version might be funnier in a silly, mindless way, but this movie makes a point that too many people forget. People who criticize this movie as naive or propaganda have bought into too much capitalist propaganda. The only people who wouldn't like the message this movie makes are slaveholders and feudal barons. Beautiful movie making a point that we should all remember in our daily life. When Deeds' assistant comments on the difficulty of feeding all of the farmers ("there's 2000 of them"), Deeds replies "that doesn't make them any less hungry." This movie isn't naive. It should simply remind us of how to be human. Its a shame that the message even needs to be said or that the Sandler version would suck the beauty out of it for a cheap lines from a hispanic butler 
 Great fun. Dickens' first novel, the first mass-market best seller in world history (coming on the heels of the invention of cheap paper). Essential reading for Victorian Literature and the evolution of Dickens' style. This edition (with footnotes and introduction, two appendices and maps) is fine in all respects, except that the print is too small 
 This bubble machine is great. My 4year old helps to fill it, he turns it on and bubbles every where.  Even our two dogs get in on the act.  It's great fun for summer time 
 This is an awesome piece becaue I think it will go with a modern decor, traditional, even classic because it mixes so well with everything.  It has three large planks that make up the top.  This is also available in white, but we bought the black version.  The grass baskets are really great and fit a lot of your stuff into it while still looking neat and tidy.  We are using this in a bedroom at the foot of the bed instead of a bench and the grass baskets fits 4 plastic shoe boxes (2 stacked on top of each other).  Great for other out of season storage also.  The open shelf is good for books and magazines.  We are seriously considering getting the matching end tables to use as nightstands.  These are great pieces for a studio or other small space.  One note about construction for this piece: I think that they should give you 1/2 inch longer screws for the piece that divides the baskets.  I used drywall screws from my hand 'mam picture hanging molly pack.  It is on the underside of the table and no one will see the silver screws instead of black.  The screws provided just don't go deep enough to secure the pieces together.  Otherwise it was a really easy process, requiring one person, although if you are less cordinated, you may need help putting the bottom into the dowels and leg screws 
 I am nearly finished with this book - I haven't been this mesmerized by a book in forever! I would certainly recommend it 
 This is a clearly written book with excellent visual aids.  I especially liked the concept checks and the current events boxes.  The sample questions from CFA exams were particularly helpful. On whole the book does  an exceptional job of explaining difficult subject matter.  I'd even  recommend this book to the 'lay' reader 
 This game asks questions about the Marvel Universe, mostly the recent trend in movies, but also some questions about the actual comic books and popular characters in various franchises.  The questions are relatively easy, but if you're playing with other people, this is part of the fun, as you race to see who can shout out the answer first. The DVD game modes are diverse and interesting, including clips, comic book covers, and other games based on either pictures or words (fill-in-the blank, scramble, etc.)  If you enjoy Scene It! (basically Trivial Pursuit with a DVD), then you'll like this game as well, as it is similar to other games in the franchise 
 This book is the best source for a Raw Diet available.  It is very comprehensive. There are lots of sources available with this diet to help you along the way, such as the website (www.volhard.com) and the Volhard Yahoo Group discussions, which provide all the answers to your questions.  If you want to provide the best life for your dog, this is definately the way to do it.  The research carried out on this diet is extremely comprehensive and a proven success for over 30 years 
 I really enjoyed the Theatrical release of Payback.  However, I heard at the time that it was not the intended version of the film.  Upon seeing this version, you can understand how different those versions are.  This is a leaner, meaner version of the film, and it gets rid of the silly, rotary car phones, for instance.  Definitely pick this up if you're a fan of Payback 
 I have read the Atkins, The Carbohydrate's diet, Protein Power etc.  This book touches on many low carb diet options, and explains all the different plans.  I thought this book was the best one I've ever read, to explain the different options, and benefits to low-carb dieting.  What you might be doing wrong, how much protein a person needs.  Why some people might still have to count calories on a low carb plan.  Very good book 
 I have been using this camera for about 2 months, taking it on a cruise as well as filming a couple college choir concerts.  All went well, exceeded my expectations, based on other reviews I read.  The only problem I have seen is with lowlight indoor filming, however the fix I came across supposedly works, but I have not had a chance to try it yet (see fix at end of review).  The 20gb drive was plentry for me, cpaturing several hours of HD quality film, still with plenty of drive space remaining.  I have had very few problems with the software, the ones I did have are more around lack of a manual, but have figured out thru trial and error.  Overall, I would highly recommend this product to anyone interested in a new camera.  Plus you can stop buying tapes.   Lowlight Fix (note I do not take credit for this, found it on the web but do not remember where).  Here is the text exactly as I found it, including the comments at the end.  How I get good low-light/indoors video (do the following steps indoors with the camera in capture mode):  1) Disable the "Gain Up" feature (major contributor to the grainy low-light video)  2) Turn on "Manual" mode (via AUTO button)  3) Go to the manual control menu (down on the 'stick')  4) Set AE to '+2'  5) Highlight 'MWB' in the WB menu, point the camera at a sheet of paper (position the camera so the sheet of paper fills the view of the camera) and press and hold the middle of the 'stick' until 'MWB' stops blinking (about 5-10 seconds).  6) Set S.sp. to 1/60  7) Press down on the 'stick' to exit the manual control menu   After doing this, my indoors video quality is MUCH better (no more noise/grainy video). The settings will be saved, even if the battery is removed or depleted; they will return even if you switch to AUTO mode then back to MANUAL. 
 Daniel C. Matt's compilation is an excellent sampling of traditional kabbalistic writings, covering a wide variety of topics in the "tradition."  As a survey, it is remarkable; its translations are poetic and beautiful.  However, the span of writing it covers is widely scattered, historically speaking; writings are grouped by topic, unrelated to chronology; if you're looking for a historical perspective on Kabbalah, this isn't likely to be your cup of tea.  As an introductory text, though, it will provide those interested in Kabbalah's philosophy and symbolism a good survey of paths to strike out on for further investigatio 
 Cornwell's protagonist is very human, and the reader identifies with her immediately. the book, on the whole, is readable because the plot is quite interesting, but no repeat-value 
 This is an excellent magazine. There are very few magazines that I choose to read cover to cover. This is one of the few.  The photographs illustrate the text and accompany it just right. They are gorgeous.   The writing is clear and concise and interesting. The topics they write on include history, travel, historical objects, animals, places and so on.   One monthly article that has fast become my favorite is about photographers. Each month they highlight a famous picture and the photographer who took it and discuss what made that picture  important. They tell a little bit about the photographer and the person who was photographed (if it is a person).   This is a fascinating magazine and well worth the money. Enjoy. 
 This book has great spelling lists, grouped by grade, along with spelling rules to be learned at different stages.  It covers 1st-12th grade spelling in one book and in non-consumable - so it is a great buy 
 This book is an exciting story of a man called Richard Hannay who is led into a secret by a mysterious man called Scudder who was killed in his apartment. Now Hannay must be on the aware of the police who suspect him as a killer and he is in fear of his life from the secret whom people would kill for.This engages in a serious manhunt across Scotland. This a well written thriller definitely a must rea 
 I was sceptic as most before seeing this movie. Personally, I would have rather watched a funny flick. But once I saw the first monster it started rocking my socks. The plot line does stray away but yet not too far from the original computer game. I would say that this movie is "based" on the game doom but is not a reenactment. Most people are probably expecting the movie to rekindle old memories of the computer game. One part of the movie makes you think of the actually game. But overall as a heads up, you will be disappointed. As for me I loved this movie just because of the action and the fight scenes. It really thrilled me. If you really don't care to see a game based movie at least watch this one for it's sheer action. Also, it makes you kind of think...would you turn into a monster if you were in the movie? Would you kill innocent people that had been infected even if they could be saved? HAHAHA The movie makes you think about that and it's cool in that aspect! =P The extras on the DVD aren't half bad either if you get the two disc edition. 
 I loved this story.  It was written in true steel fashion...exciting, interesting, and fullfilling 
 Eyewitness Auschwitz is the story of the author's three year journey through the hell that was the gas chambers at Auschwitz.  Although not a literary masterpiece, Eyewitness provides us with an invaluable and in depth look at what life and death were like in the horrific world that was Auschwitz.  How someone was able to survive under these conditions for three years and keep their sanity is a wonder.  The only characters missing in the book were Dante and the Devil, both of whom surely would have felt right at home in this living hell.  This is a book that must be read by all 
 I positively loved this book!  A great story all the way through.  There is just nothing bad to say about this writer.  I liked it so well that I bought all that he had out which was 4 at this time.  I'm anxiously waiting the next one!  I generally get my books from the library but this one is one to share with all my friends and relatives and then keep 
 This is what comics are supposed to be: thoughtful, well-drawn, and entertaining. The Sandman series stands above most other comics, and this collection stands above most other Sandman work.  Referring to an earlier story, the Sandman realizes that he has made a mistake, and caused immense pain to someone who never deserved it. He sets out to correct his error, not that anything will take back the pain already inflicted. That's when all hell breaks loose.  I mean literally. Not with Bam! Pow! fight scenes, but with delicate and varied art, with invocations of many mythologies, and with Gaiman's ability to put another twist into any plot. The final surprise, this time, is at least one more miscarriage of justice, maybe several, but perhaps in the name of a higher justice. Resolution is as ironic as it is inevitable, and not quite satisfactory in any way. Well, solutions to complex problems never are.  This volume collect several of the original comics, each drawn by different art teams. That's especially effective in this collection, and adds to the dreamlike shifting quality of the story. P. Craig Russell's art in one episode is especially enjoyable. McKean's cover art and other odd bits contribute their own elusiveness to the total.  The series of Sandman collections read well in order, and almost as well out of order. If you're new to the Sandman, this might be a great place to start. It stands well by itself, and shows just how good this series can be.  //wiredweir 
 M.R. James is the best when it comes to writing interesting and diversified ghost stories.  Other writers have come up with a good story here and there, but these are uniformly fabulous, and can be read over and over 
 I loved this book!  I am really impressed with the disabled characters in this novel--- the author gets their issues right on!  What a sensitive, intuitive, compassionate portrait of mentally incapacitated characters---- Madeline and Mikey are shown  with big, yearning hearts like the rest of us and their behaviors and personalities are very realistic.  It uplifted me to see how VISIBLE Madeline was in her family.  I'd recommend this book to anyone with a disabled love one.  It is uplifting, smart, and right on!  
 I like all the seasons all the way up to season 12 but you can see their steady decline, and this is still great. Nearly all episodes are enjoyable and still clever and hilarious. And whoever wrote underneath that the current season now is 14 they're completely wrong the current season is 18 and its been much better then the last couple. Look for the Simpsons to make a comeback and then screw it up with their desperate grasp for revitilization with their movie 
 This book covers a lot more than just the mechanics of how to use a build tool (Ant).  It has a lot of great "best practices" info and a lot of relevant examples.  It is easy to read, and includes a lot of technical information that is simple to follow. I think the biggest benefit of this book is the strategies it outlines for integrating Ant into a development environment.  Anyone who has been involved with building large scale applications (regardless of the tools used - including make) understands how complicated the process can become.  The author includes a lot of ideas about to create an easily configurable and extensable build environment.  This book should be required reading for anyone involved in configuration management. The other nice aspect of this book is the chapters later in the book that explain how to integrate other tools into a build environment (such as JUnit or XDoclet).  These chapters aren't complete enough to fully explain these technologies in full, however they are a good introduction to the basics of these technologies. Overall, I think this is a terrific book.  In addition to providing good explanations about how to use an important tool (Ant), it also provides a lot of "best practice" guidance which has proven very valuable to me 
 When I first started reading graphic novels, which was about two years ago I thought that it was truly pointless because I was not familair with grpahic novels, I thought they were like comic books. I was wrong. The world of graphic novels is complex, and opens vast doorways into regions of the world that exist far beyond, and From Hell is one of those Graphic Novels that catches you by surprise and shakes you to the bone, I strongly recommend this work to any reader. The film adaptation was truly brilliant and compelling, rich with horrors and thrills and saturated with laughs and screams. 
 I've seen a few reviews here that say "read it, but don't go see it." Most of the time, I would probably agree, because most people who do the play don't get it; they think it's a straightforward comedy, and it is almost anything but.  R&G is all about pace; except for a couple of spots, if the pace isn't almost franticly precise, the end loses its entire effect. The beginning of the second act  "Hmmm?" "Yes?" "What?" "I thought you..." "No." "Ahh."  takes a lot of work to get right; someone missing a beat is almost as bad as someone walking through the invisible fourth wall.  Guildenstern has the first real line in the play: "There's an art to the building up of suspense." If you aren't on the edge of your seat when the penultimate scene begins, then the director and the actors have missed the boat.  Unfortunately, nothing Mr Stoppard has done since is quite as good. His plays are good, especially if you like the Pinteresque types, but just not quite as good 
 James Scott Bell tackles a fascinating dilemma:  What if a Supreme Court Justice becomes a Christian right before appointment as chief justice?  The one who holds tie-breaking power has changed her worldview.  Bell handles the social debate with excellence and entertaining form.  I meant to do a quick read, but had to peruse every word.  The woman who had a knack for "beating God back with a stick," must scramble to open herself up to faith and the perplexity of answering why she's become the bait in a vicious public battle.  Great enlightenment for anyone who'd like to understand the people behind the politics.    
 This book is rich with some of the most fascinating observations on love in general and homosexual love specifically. The flower metaphor at the starting of the book is particularly clever. Proust has more of a sense of humour than usual in this volume. Around the middle of the book this is especially evident; there is more sarcasm, irony, and wit throughout than in other volumes. I found myself highlighting many passages as I was reading, and oftentimes just one sentence of Proust's work is enough material to write a whole book on! His observations are so loaded and so true that they can be stretched out a long way before they've been used up. I find myself constantly in awe while reading In Search Of Lost Time; Proust was so gifted in so many ways that it's a privilege to read his writings! I can't think of anyone besides Shakespeare who comes close to Proust in his understanding of all apsects of human nature 
 Some bands you have to dig for, or Amazon suggests to you and you buy...Either way its a joy to find these gems.  This album is a great listen from beginning to end.  Love the melodies, love the lyrics, love the passion.  If you find great pleasure, as I do, from music that moves your soul you must get this album today 
 This book is clear, solid, and workmanlike. It could work well as a textbook, or one of several texts for a term course.    It gives a systematic introduction to several high-level notations, describing the conceptual, executable, structural (or module), and code views. Most of the notation is well-formed UML, and the authors take care to add semantic notes to every part of the graphical notation. They supplement the standard notations with a few text-based extensions. These capture requirements, archtiectural decisions, risks and risk mitigation, and other operating features of a living software project.   One real asset is the related set of brief case studies at the end of the book, three separate products with a common conceptual base. This book is aging, it dates back to 1999 - five years, as I write this. That's old in the "architecture" literature, and the authors fail to apply the "product line" notion. I take this book for its good, though, and lack of one buzzword is a small enough fault.   The book uses a process-and-pipe model pervasively for architectural description. It's a good tool, but other tools are good for other purposes, and their omission is a problem here.   Still, the book is competent on the whole. Its sustained product-line example ties the whole together, and it focusses on practice intead of mainfestos and brand-name methodologies. There's a lot of good here, and you can pick out out easily.   //wiredweir 
 I bought this book because Janis, the author, was my writing teacher. Once I started I couldn't put it down! It was great! She does of a wonderful job of putting the ups and downs of the adoption of her son onto paper. It will take you to the busy world of russia and into the place she can't wait to take her son from. It also deals with her honest fears of motherhood and her capability of raising that little boy she knew only from a photograph. I totally recommend it for a wonderful read that will leave you longing for more 
 If you're not soft-skinned and can laugh at yourself and others, Carlos Mencia is one of the funniest (and truthful) comics out there. I rate him & his material better than Dave Chapelle. You're in for a good laugh

 With a title like this, one would imagine this to be a book about the conflict between evolution and creation, or something similar. In fact the book, despite its somewhat misleading title, is actually a good look at some of the abuses and misuses of science. Science is not so much taking on God, but demeaning personhood and human integrity.  Thus this book is really about the nature of science, the place of ethics in science, the relationship between science and values, the need for regulation, and the role of religion in tempering science. Winnick is well placed to handle these issue, having been a medical reporter for many years, and having written extensively on the intersection between law, religion and science.  As such this book deals with such topics as eugenics, stem cell research, population control, genetic engineering and the new reproductive technologies. And yes, there are several chapters on the evolution debate, but specifically on the Scopes Trial of 1925, Intelligent Design, and the way science is taught in the classroom.  Winnick begins her book by examining how the very notion of the sacredness of human life has been undermined in the past few decades, often by scientists and those in the medical community. Indeed, it goes back even further, with the eugenics movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.   The degree to which science and medicine have been bedfellows with the eugenics movement is testimony to the fact that science is not above corruption and deception. We all know of Hitler's use of science and medicine to promote his program of extermination. But American politicians made use of their expertise in the twenties and thirties to make a better human race. Forced birth control, sterilizations, and selective breeding were all part of their program.  The now infamous Tuskegee, Alabama case, beginning in 1932, it but one example of this. Four hundred mainly poor black men were afflicted with syphilis by the US Public Health Service to see what the disease does to the body. Such lab-rat treatment of humans has happened frequently, and many scientists have been happy to conduct such experiments.  Progressive, leftist political causes, social utopianism, and secular science have often combined, ostensibly to create a "better" human race, but the actual results have been nightmarish. Many of these deliberate attempts at eugenics are highlighted in this book.  And Winnick documents how leaders in the eugenics movement realised that religion, particularly the Judeo-Christian religion, had to be countered and neutralised if their dehumanised agenda could proceed.  She also examines more recent examples of unethical science. The stem cell debate is one such case. Miracles cures just days away are among the many over-hyped claims of Big Biotech. Demand for embryonic stem cell research is paraded daily in the media, despite the fact that only adult stem cells to date have led to any human therapies.  Because so much big money is tied up with these sorts of endeavours, mercenary motivations of science are often indistinguishable from more nobler ones. A person wearing a white lab coat can be just as greedy and subject to corruption as anyone else. Scientists are not immune from selling their soul to the highest bidder.  Winnick documents how science and technology is often motivated as much by financial gain as by humanitarian concerns. And the attempts by the scientific community to reject any regulation and accountability ensures that a Frankenstein's monster will continue to emerge.   The lust for power, the chase after profits, and the dangers of arrogance are all reasons for keeping science in close check, ethically and socially. An unbridled science will only be more tempted to go down the path of eugenics and dehumanisation.  Winnick concludes with a warning about encroaching scientism: it will "grow in political and economic stature, its own set of constitutional `rights' to both research and funding, arrogating to itself alone the power to make morally troublesome decisions." This will result in speculative funding which harms the poor, the commoditisation of the body, and the subjugation of the unborn to those already born. Brave new world prospects, in other words, which we have already witnessed enough of 
 This is a well thought out book, loaded with insightful comments and solutions regarding the problems with youth sports today.  I have coached youth sports for 9 years, and since day one, I have been very discouraged with the "system".  This book puts sports in it's proper perspective - it's not at all about "winning".  I would encourage anyone who is even remotely involved with youth sports to read this book - it will wake you up and give you lots of food for thought 
 I heard of this book 40 years ago when a TV version won an Emmy award. I was inspired to read it after my most recent trip to Italy. Growing up as an Italian-American, I wondered why my people acted the way they do, and this book provides valuable insight. Barzini graduated from Columbia U., and it shows in his command of the English language. This book is a classic, but like most classics, it's old, so while much of it is timeless, other parts are out of date, both culturally and politically. However, if one wants to gain a grounding in the Italian culture, this book is a very good place to start 
 I wanted to be there with the Quinn brothers.  I loved the description of the Chesapeake Bay.  It's very hard to explain how I felt.  I was a part of this book from beginning to end.  I just can't say enough about the book 
 This is one of the great milestones of twentieth century literary criticism.  Published originally in 1930, its relevance has not faded.  It is heartily recommended to anyone with an interest in poetry, and is absolutlely essential for anyone working for a college or graduate English degree.  It could also be profitably used by younger persons in high school honors English programs 
 As a work/family expert and author of several books on the topic, I've read many books on the pyschological issues facing entrepreneurs today. Frankly, many of them seem to regurgitate the obvious and what has already been said. "Balance work and family", or "when you die, you won't wish you'd spent more time at the office." I was impressed with the breadth and debth of this book, exploring concepts not previously written about, and for the CEO or psychologist who wishes to understand this issue in greater debth, the author does not disappoint. You can skim this book for a new take on the issue, or devote an entire Sunday to it and sink yourself into the book , probably feeling like the author spent hours interviewing you before he wrote it. By the end you'll be convinced that the author knows you, at a level deeper than even your spouse or closest friend. This book is not for someone who wants a quick fix and a few easy ideas that will make all of the deeper issues go away. Rather, this book is for those courageous ones who are ready to examine this issue on a whole new level. Bravo to the author for leading the expedition. I hope this book opens up new conversations on the topic all over America 
 I get this feeling that interest in Leonardo da Vinci is going to really increase next month (there's this little film called "The Da Vinci Code" coming out, based on a modestly-selling book). If you are too lazy to read an adult biography on Leonardo (and I am), this book provides an excellent glimpse into da Vinci's life and artwork. Kids love the pictures, and I love subversively introducing students to paintings (even though art is no longer taught in most schools).

 Once again, Prentice Hall displays why it remains a superforce in creating textbooks: its balanced and accessible research-based comprehensiveness.  As with my first Chemistry book in high school, I believe this book possesses everything you will need to know about early childhood curriculum.  The former champion, in my opinion,--Evelyn Peterson's A PRACTICAL GUIDE OT EARLY CHILDHOOD CURRICULUM--gets bested here because this text presents, in a well-understood way, what Peterson's book also did well: present pratical explanations.  This texts gets the slight edge because the authors ably worked in all the research and citations relevant to the concepts without overloading a teacher's mind with scholarship. It's a difficult feat that I have only seen one other time in an ECE text (J.A. Brewer's INTRODUCTION TO EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION).   Here's where you really get a smashing deal: this book will give you all you need to grasp the curriculum topics on the PRAXIS II: Education of the Young Child test.    The New Champion of Early Childhood Curriculum college textbooks. Take a bow and a victory lap 
 Este libro es altamente recomendable. Gracias a él he descubierto a muchos ilustradores que hasta ahora no conocía. Además tiene muchísimas páginas completas de ilustraciones a todo color y en cantidad de estilos. El libro contiene muchas ideas para ilustradores y para gente a la que le gusta el mundo de la ilustración. La relación calidad-precio es fantástica *(^_^) 
 I just read an article about Stacy DeBroff in the Atlanta Journal Constitution where she talked about getting organized for Back to School. I bought this book after reading some great tips she mentioned, and just love it! The book gives all kinds of advice about how parents can be involved in helping their kids with school. She talks about a variety of school-related issues, from homework and parent-teacher conferences to bullies and learning disabilities. She really covers all areas of school and gives unique suggestions that I would never think up on my own 
 Very thought provoking with some very practical, useable and powerful ideas. I recommend it highly 
 It can be jokingly said that the Lifetime Channel is really the Women-in-Jeopardy Channel given the number of TV-movies it shows that have women threatened by stalkers, abusive husbands and other myriad (and typically male) evils.  If there is an equivalent in the field of horror writing, it would probably be Richard Laymon, whose novels (at least the sampling I've read) all deal with women-in-peril.  No Sanctuary is a partial exception to the rule, but it basically fits in with Laymon's regular themes.  The lady-in-danger in this book is Gillian, who has an unusual addiction.  She is compelled to break into and live in houses belonging to people who are on vacation.  She isn't really a thief (although she does help herself to food and such), but she just needs to explore the lives of others.  Unfortunately, the house she chooses this time belongs to a nasty serial killer who particularly enjoys raping, torturing and murdering beautiful women, a category that Gillian fits into.  When the killer comes home early, Gillian has real problems.  What makes No Sanctuary a little different, however, is there is also a man in danger, albeit at the same time as his girlfriend.  Rick and Bert (short for Bertha) are taking a camping trip in the California mountains.  Rick hasn't done camped since he was a kid, with good reason.  During that last trip, while he was disabled with a broken leg, his step-mother was raped and killed.  But Rick loves the outdoorsy Bert, so he goes along and runs into trouble this time around, too.  There is a trio of teenagers who seem threatening, a strange vagrant preacher, and, of course, eventually, the serial killer that Gillian has intruded on.  Like Laymon's other books, this is a good, suspenseful read, but it almost seems like he has his own demons to wrestle with.  He loads his books with sex, but also crimes against women.  In this book alone, there are at least four different rapists/killers or potential ones, and I can see Laymon turning off quite a few readers with his explicitness.  In addition, this book suffers from the fact that the two storylines (Rick & Bert and Gillian) are completely separate until the very end, and, outside of flashbacks, there is no real threat to any of the characters until beyond the halfway point of the book.    Amazingly, although this may be one of Laymon's most flawed books, it is still a good book.  Laymon will make you turn the pages, so if you're a horror fan, this will be worth reading. 
 Truly his greatest film I have seen thus far.  Not only is one taken in by this movie, but it allows one to forget that it's filmed in black and white.  The boy, Elvis, of course, is even more beautiful in KING CREOLE.  Which leads me to believe he believed in his work for this picture.  The soundtrack is admirable.  He delivered it with such effervescence, such pride.  One can't help but fall in love with him and this movie.  Too bad Elvis was so loyal to Col. Parker.  He could have been the great dramatic actor he had always wanted to be.  This film certainly promised it 
 This is a captivating and hard to put down book. Needless to say I read it in one sitting. The writing transports you to a world that's almost upside down....twists and turns. Dark corners. You're not quite sure what's real and what isn't. It was an enlightening journey, don't miss it!  Shirley Jackson...when she's good.....she's GRAND. Check out her other works as well 
 Each chapter is like a tiny moment of life written out in a few powerful pages. It was a wonderfully written book and although it often isn't appreciated as much as it should be, it makes incredible airplane reading. 
 While I'm not a Photoshop beginner, I certainly do not consider myself to be advanced. I've been struggling for several years to get my old slides to the point of just being okay. I've spent a small fortune on DVDs and other tutorials and was beginning to think I'd never improve. Many so-called experts seem to try harder to be funny than to teach. After working through the first four chapters of this book I can already see great improvement in my pictures. I'd give this book 5 stars.  
 This high powered toothbrush helps you brush better.  However, it is not magic.  You still have to know "how to brush."  It is also much more messy, using this kind of toothbrush, but the dental hygenists strongly recommend them 
 I remember listening to this album a lot. You could tell a lot of hard work went into it. I would put it up against anything going at the time including efforts by the Beatles. It's one of the great unknown albums of rock 
 This book covers many historic methods. This book is for the photographer looking to go beyond silver. It gives you all you need to know to get you started. HIghly recommended - easy to read and follow 
 John Adams thought July 2nd would be the day Americans would celebrate, not the 4th.  That is just one detail Fradin and McCurdy bring out.  History is so easily made bland, but their work breaks many assumptions apart in an easy to digest way.  An important book for students and a good book for adults, with enough information between the lines  to keep some of the rebelion alive.  History is made not by dates, but by people decidedly taking steps toward multiple goals.  I recommend this book 
 This is a practical book that summarizes the most important aspects in the Music Theory, Harmony and an introduction to the Musical Analysis. The book is well structured and the explanations are clear and intelligible, for wich it is well adapted for beginners, teachers at college level, and also for those that, not being professional musicians, but they studied this matter years ago, they are looking for an a single-book-abridgment to refresh their knowledge quickly. It only lacks, from my point of view, of an appendix with the answers to the proposed exercises, what would help the self-students a lot.  
 Excellent service and fast shipping.  The product was just as described. I would recommend this seller and I would be glad to do business with seller any time 
 Our grandchildren -- boys and girls aged six to eight -- thoroughly enjoyed making the potholders and then using them in the kitchen.  We recall their parents having the same reaction 25 years ago.  This is a wonderful, constructive activity fit for small fingers 
 More like "TOS" (The Original Show") than the widely-loved Next Generation, "Star Trek Voyager" was not initially loved as a Trek series. Despite having a Vulcan, a Borg and one of the Most Annoying Alien Crewmembers Ever (Neelix), the show seemed to falter after the rich character development of "Next Generation" and the dark and mostly disappointing "Deep Space Nine."  But watching the DVD's in sequence, I realized, this was the best series of Trek ever invented. The saga of the ship that was flung far from home has an almost epic quality about it, and Captain Janeway (Katherine Mulgrew) does a good job of blending firm command, brave adventure, and nurturing Mom to a ship of homesick Starfleet crew and a weird mix of adopted aliens and Maquis misfits.   The introduction of the humanly regenerating Borg Seven of Nine (possibly the best looking female ever to stroll the universe) added to excellent plots. Some of the two part episodes are like films, and good ones at that.  My favorites involve the hunter species The Hrodin. The two part series, ending in a war on the holodeck, is really astonishing.   We were trying to decide why we initially hated "Voyager" and it was probably because it came too soon after "Deep Space Nine" and TNG. Seen in full in these DVD', you get a really involved series of science fiction, in my opinion, some of the best ever on television or even on film 
 The DVD was shipped very quickly. It arrived in perfect condition, case and media. The movie itself is going to be a classic in my collection of "drinkin" movies. If you liked Super Troopers you will love this movie 
 EA is the application of rigorous methods to the management of Enterprise IT.  Rigorous methods require, well, rigor.  As a new practitioner of EA you will quickly find that you must choose how you will document the enterprise, and how you will then document the documentation formats so they are repeatable.  This is dull work, tedious, and error prone.  Dr. Scott Bernard has done the work for you.  It will save you weeks of thankless dull effort.  The advantage of this work is not academic theory and fancy hocus pocus, it is not advancing some odd software approach designed to displace system engineering in EA practice, it is not endless words to make you sound smart to the CEO, but trench warfare level lists of real artifacts with documentation and examples for real practitioners.  Thank you, Scott Bernard from a 20 year practitioner of the art of enterprise scale IT architecture and strategic planning.  (On balance I should also mention that the cube, while it is an improvement on the FEAF triangle Dr. bernard helped author, remains imperfect as a clarifying device. It is unclear what the third dimension represents- some muddiness remains in the conceptualization.  The EA3 cube is not the icon of EA that the Zachman matrix is... yet.  I await his next try for yet another improvement. 
 A beautifully textured, fluid and organic autobiography, Camara Laye offers readers a piece of his life in The Dark Child.  As part of the Malinke community in Upper Guinea, Laye captures the layered tradition and culture of his community, deemed, perhaps by most, to be simplistic or primitive compared to today's modern standards.  Yet it is exactly from Layes descriptions of the traditions of his community that we can begin to understand the psychology of the author.  Each chapter is rich with imagery, and his words smack of sincerity and innocence, bringing about an effortless quality and flow to his work--it is as if we are there with Laye experiencing his many transitions, from boyhood to manhood. His descriptions of the communal lifestyle of his people is remarkable. Laye's works like other modern African authors reveal the realities of colonization, and help readers to appreciate and celebrate indigenous African traditions 
 This is a book about British arrogance. As you read this excellent work, the author lists the continuing, incredible decisions which had to eventually result in and force American Independence. The American Revolution did not occur because colonial Americans did not support their King, but rather, because their King failed his colonists so very, very miserably 
 The Perfect Store tell us the real story of how a dream might be reallity. it invites us to trust in our dreams an work (smart) towards it. for people like me - non native english speaker - its reading isn't so heavy so it's possible enjoy the whole book. - but I recomend having a good dictionary beside ;)  thank you  Mr. Omidyar for divide your dream with us 
 The Audio CD is very clear and easy to understand and in some examples, funny.  Mr. Cohen makes many excellent points and his voice is pleasant and home-spun.   I highly recommend 
 From the very first page Scar Tissue captivates the reader's attention.  Anthony Kiedis is a vocalist of the world famous band called the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  His life was full of so many exciting times like getting high and jumping off buildings into pools to playing in front of thousands of screaming fans.   In this book AK recalls the many highs and lows of his life.  There isn't a dull moment in this biography.  From cover to cover I found it hard to put the book down.  Any fan of the RHCP should read this book because it gives you a deeper understanding of what made them what they are today.  The stories behind many of their songs are discussed.  The many transformations that they went through are also detailed.  Overall this book would be a great read for anyone who considers themselves a fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers 
 Great Jack at a reasonable cost.  Material is excellent and comfortable to wear out of the package, choice of color.  Shipped in a timely manner.  Would continue to buy On Line from Amazon 
 Her writing style is so playful, amusing, charming, and sensitive. Her observation of the environment and culture is so acute. She brought alive the scenes, the sounds, the liveliness of Hanoi streets -- just like the classic Vietnamese novels that we had to read while in high school. I bought this book for my wife, previewed it and then finished it. Highly recommended.  
 Hauntingly lyrical.  Read the liner notes; they're worth the price of the CD.  The selections are broad and deep. I like to be able to understand the words when I listen to music.  McDermott's voice is clear and beautiful 
 I read this book in one day, a day where no classes were attended, no phone calls were taken, and no visits made. I cooked and ate my food with it in hand, and sometimes damned my inability to read faster, I was so eager to find out what was going to happen next.   "The Woman in White" is not just one of the most engaging and gripping Victorian novels I have ever read, it is one of the most engaging and gripping novels of all time. Collins creates vivid, memorable characters (ranging from brave intelligent Marian to the surprising and sinister Count Fosco) who are engaged in a plot that twists and turns like nothing else. There are so many unexpected, even shocking incidents, and Collins moves between them with exactingly precise yet graceful and beautiful prose. Not only that, his narrative style, which moves from character to character, allows for fantastic comic interludes which break up the drama (the chapter from the point of view of the hypochondriac uncle is gut-bustingly funny).  A couple of people I know, who are generally not fond of 19th century literature, loved this book. I have never met someone who has not been charmed by it. I strongly urge anyone and everyone to read it. 
 Swami Prabhavananda and Christopher Isherwood have collaborated to create this simple and yet poignant translation and commentary of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras.   The Yoga Sutras which were written approximately 2000 years ago and form the basis for the Yogic tradition. Originally, the Sutras were passed down orally (Sutra in Sanskrit means "thread")with commentary from the teacher or master. Isherwood is a masterful writer and clearly captures the essence of this tradition in both the cadence and style of the work. Much of the commentary is borrowed from greatly esteemed Vivekananda whose deep wisdom and honest razor sharp insight are true gift.   There are many translations of the Yoga Sutras, some arguably more literal, scholarly, and technically accurate. However, this work is one of the most accessible, and beautifully captures the essence and wisdom of the work.  
 Although this book was written in 1998, it is just as relevant if not more so today. The book discusses how Internet entrepreneurs should price their goods/services; how they can create lock-in effects to instill customer loyalty; and perhaps most importantly, how they can create network effects so as to exponentially increase their client base and barriers to entry. A brilliant book written by two leading authorities on economics. 
 After owning this on vinyl for almost 30 years, I finally got it on CD. The record still played well but it was beginning to show its age. Then there's the fact that they no longer make cars with tape players, apparently, and I need something to play in the new car I'm getting next month.   But most of all, I'm just bored beyond endurance with the majority of music coming out these days and have decided to spend my money going into the archives and revamping my record collection.  I am completely unabashed about my adoration for Quincy Jones. To me he is literally the best producer, conductor and arranger of my generation and I very much doubt I'll see anything to equal him in my lifetime. From the various magazine interviews and TV appearances of him I've seen, he seems like a pretty cool dude too.  This is the album that introduced to Q. I was 15 going on 16 and up until that point, the pinnacle of my musical pleasures had been provided by disco queens and old-school reggae dons. I mention no names. And then one day, my mother sent me out for some milk and I stopped by the house of this older guy I was friends with at the time. He told me he'd just bought a new album and asked me if I wanted to hear something special. I said sure, he put the record on and time just seemd to stand still. I stood there, transfixed, eyes wide open and mouth agape. And this was just to the first strains of the first song on the album, the title track, "Stuff Like That."  I literally didn't move a muscle until my friend had played the entire first side of the album and the first two songs of the second side. I was entranced. I had never heard anything like it. The clarity of the music (My friend had a pretty decent sound system. Sure it was 1978 but still), the lush orchestration that while complex was never overbearing, the solos...   And then there were the voices... boy, what that man can do with voices.  I came to, and left to run my errand. I got a sound clip around the ear for being late with the milk. Happy days. I vowed I was going to get a copy of the album for myself and vowed I was going to get a stereo system like my friend's. It was a year before I succeeded with the former and another nine before I managed the latter but there can be no doubt: It was Quincy Jones who set me on the path to the appreciation of quality music. That same year, Q produced The Brothers Johnson's "Blam!" and the soundtrack to "The Wiz", which is how he got to meet Michael Jackson. The following year he produced Jackson's "Off The Wall". The rest, as the say, is history.  It was on this album that Q introduced us to Bruce Swedien (even his name sounds efficient somehow) and his "Acousonic Recording Process". There's a detailed explanation of how the process works on the album/CD inner sleeve and whatever it is they do, it seems to work. Few producers have been able to match the quality of the sound produced by the collaboration of Jones and Swedien. It's my bet that few ever will.   The album is a veritable array of stars, both established and emerging (at the time):  "Stuff Like That", a funky tune featuring Valerie Simpson and the legendary Chaka Khan on vocals. Sax solo by George Young.  "I'm Gonna Miss You In The Morning", a ballad featuring Patti Austin and the late Luther Vandross on vocals (and this was some years before he went on to become the megastar that he did). Lyricon solo by Tom Scott.  "Love, I Never Had It So Good", a stomping choral piece with Patti Austin and Charles May on lead vocals. Electric sax solo by Michael Brecker, Fender Bass solo by Anthony Jackson.  "Tell Me A Bedtime Story", probably the first ever jazz tune that made me sit up and pay attention. Herbie Hancock lays down electric piano improvisations and Harry Lookofsky records his violin over the track, copying Hancock note for note. He doesn't do it just once though. He does it several times, over and over, and the end result sounds like an entire string section. But it was just one man! Flute solo by Hubert Laws.  "Love Me By Name", intense ballad sung by Patti Austin. Keyboards by Herbie Hancock, Guitar by the late Eric Gale.  "Superwoman (Where Were You When I Needed You)", another, more mid-tempo ballad sung by Patti Austin. Flute solos by Hubert Laws, Electric piano solo by Herbie Hancock, Lyricon solo by Tom Scott.  "Takin' It To The Streets", brings the album to a close with a gospel-influenced stomper. Luther Vandross and Gwen Guthrie, both of who have since passed away, sadly, provide vocals. Tenor sax solo by Michael Brecker.  There are no extras on the CD, no gimmicky remixes or video clips and that suits me just fine. There are just seven pieces of good quality music. Best money I've spent all month.  
 I wanted my daughter to be able to listen to music without headphones.  This product, the FP3 Speakers, was perfect.  She loves to walk around from room to room singing her favorite songs and carrying this around.  It is easy to turn on and very kid friendly.  The only downfall is that the price dropped right after I purchased it! 
 Because he is considered the best at locating the target, U.S. intelligence agent Todd "The Hound" Belknap is granted by his boss a much wider degree of discretion than his field associates to accomplish his mission.  Currently the Hound is irate that his superiors refuse to try to retrieves captured agent "Pollux" from a Lebanese militia in Beirut.  Refusing to leave a peer in enemy hands, the Hound comes out of the warmth to return to the cold.  He heads to Lebanon to liberate Pollux or die trying.  At the same time, the Hound begins stirring up local hostility in the Middle East, financial analyst Andrea Bancroft begins to realize that her family's philanthropic foundation is a cover for nefarious disturbing international plots.  She digs deeper as she uncovers a connection to a missing American agent in Beirut.  Going on site to see what is truly happening, Andrea fears that the Bancroft Foundation is at the core of global unrest even as she wonders if she is over dramatizing the conspiracy; that is until she meets the Hound.  Though Robert Ludlum of the Bourne fame died five years ago, new thrillers under his name have continued to appear.  The latest THE BANCROFT STRATEGY is a fast-paced international thriller starring a lone espionage renegade, a courageous intelligent female, a conspiracy, and a secret cabal with the vortex between them being Pollux.  The action never slows down, but lacks the freshness that Bourne contained (and still does).  Still this is a fun tale filled with plenty of action that fans of the author will enjoy even if it is Ludlum-lite.  Harriet Klausner 
 underrated like all the west coast stuff that came out after pac;s death still this is slamming more cool beats features snoop dogg, nate dogg, xzibit, mack 10, eve, drtag on, and jermine dupri warren g has done it again 
 This is one of the many poems by Edgar Allan Poe. It is a very good poem but at first I didn't really understand it. It took awhile before I fully understood it even after I had been told the main idea. In this poem raven represents death. What I believe that that the man in this poem is going to die and death is tapping at his door. This poem uses lots of figurative speech and it makes it sound very pretty. Such as "Prophet!,' said I, 'Thing of evil! Prophet still if bird or devil! Whether Tempter sent or tossed thee here ashore, Desolate ye tall undaunted, On this home by horror haunted-tell me truly, I implore- Is there balm in Gilead?- tell me- tell me I implore!' Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore." It would be a good idea to read The Raven.  From the editor of the Hoppin Readin Review on Blogspo 
 I am an avid reader of the Nibelung legend and will acquire it in any form I can find. Whether it be Wagner's opera, Lang's motion picture, illustrated books, novelized accounts, or various translations of the epic, I seek them with much vigor. This work of art escaped my attention until now, and it is with great fervor and joy that I heartedly recommend it to you. The reproductions of the paintings are exceptional in quality. The coffee table size book allows you to clearly see all the details that Ul De Rico invested in each painting. The paintings represent key moments in Richard Wagner's Der Ring Des Nibelungen and there are multiple images presented in each painting which presents a vivid progression of a scene. Whether it's Alberich's theft of the ring or Fafnir's slaying of Fasolt, you will be transported to the time of myth by the fabulous artistry of Ul De Rico. His paintings display the passion and sensual nature of the Ring that so eludes current opera directors and designers.  Since this book is now out of print, you should not hesitate to purchase it now, at an incredibaly reasonable price... I guarantee you will not be disappointed, but you may become so if the few editions that are available vanish before you decide 
 When I first became interested in rock music and playing the bass guitar, I listened to The Who almost exclusively for two years straight. To me, their music epitomized everything rock and roll should be. But the death of my idol, The Ox, and the seemingly predictable nature of Townshend's songwriting caused me to lose interest in the band.  After a few years I decided to buy Quadrophenia, which I had never got around to listening to in its entirety during my days as a really dedicated fan. This album changed my whole outlook on Pete Townshend. This man was a genius. Whether he is now or was in the 80's is up for debate. But at the time of writing Quadrophenia, his brilliance clearly surpassed that of just about everone else in the business (with the exception of Ian Anderson, that is). The rest of the band were at the top of their game here as well. Roger Daltrey's singing is at its most ferocious and expressive all throughout, especially in the climactic final songs. Entwistle's bass playing is simply off the charts. Every bass player on the planet should thank their lucky stars he came along to take bass playing out of the dark ages with performances like this. His horn parts are thrillingly authentic additions to songs like "5:15" and "Doctor Jimmy." Keith Moon is incredible as usual, leaving no doubt that he was indeed "the best Keith Moon-style drummer." His singing on "Bell Boy" is both humorous and heartfelt. Overall, I felt like a common thief when I was listening to it and remembered I had paid a measly $15 for this masterpiece. To sum it up, every note of Quadrophenia is positively sublime from start to finish. 
 This CD is wonderful!  The one to get if you plan to get one Babyface CD.  If "Tender Lover", "My Kinda Girl" & "It's No Crime" don't get you dancing, then you are dead!  I can't stop playing this CD, it is that good.  Run out & get it today

 "Romeo, Romeo!  Where for art thou Romeo?"   Wait a minute, wrong play!  In my opinion, Much Ado about Nothing was a very funny book/play and I somewhat enjoyed reading it.  The only bad part about it is that it was a chick flick (or in its case a chick play).  The old English also took away from the play sometimes.  However, for the most part it was understandable.  Overall, I believe Shakespeare probably had a reason for writing the play other than just for pure entertainment.  Much Ado about Nothing is a classic Shakespearian type play.  It is a comedy about two young couples.  One couple is Benedick and Beatrice.  At the start of the play they are in love with one another, they just do not know it yet.  They are constantly bickering and fighting with each other.  The other couple Hero and Claudio, who are madly in love with each other (or so they think) plot to make Benedick and Beatrice realize that they are in love with each other.  They also have help in the form of Leanato, Don Pedro, Margaret and Ursula.  Meanwhile, Don Pedro's evil brother Don John along with his henchmen, Conrade and Borachio, plot to break up Hero and Claudio.  The plan nearly succeeds, and the rather unusual constable Dogberry and his somewhat merry men must come to the rescue of Claudio's and hero's relationship.       As I said before, the main point of Shakespeare writing the play was probably for more than entertainment.  I believe he also wrote it because he wanted to show how crazy love can make a person.  In the play, Beatrice and Benedick fall in love with each other.  After Claudio shames Hero, Beatrice was so upset that she asks that Benedick kills Claudio.  Now that presents a problem because Benedick and Claudio are good friends.  At first, Benedick is very reluctant to do this.  So reluctant that he refuses to do this.  After she says she will not love him any more Benedick immediately agrees to kill Claudio.  Even though I would probably do the same thing in Benedick's position, it is still amazing what love can make you do.  Surprisingly, I actually learned something from this play.  It's the simple fact that assumptions are very, very dangerous.  Thanks to Don John and his henchmen's evil plot, Claudio thought that he had seen Hero cheating on him with Borachio.   In reality, it was Margaret and Borachio that he saw.  Acting on only what he saw, he shamed Hero and "killed" her.   In the end, it was another happily ever after moment.  Personally, I expected a better ending, but that's just me.  Yes, I would recommend this book but I myself did not love it.  Too much love, not enough action and drama.  However, it was very funny, especially the constable Dogberry (my favorite character in the book/play).  Also the plot was well developed so that kept my interest.  Overall, it was good and worth reading.  I would give the book/play 8.11 out of 10.  You would probably like it so go buy and read it.  Great play, but it's just not for me.   
 This is so cute.  Same idea as Mr. Potato Head but is more "current" with the times and what the kids like.  I will always love Mr. Potato Head but since my kids enjoy Spongebob so much, this was perfect!  Keep those little pieces together, though 
 The classic adventure story of The Wind in the Willows is set in early twentieth-century Britain and features the lovable characters of the Water Rat, Mole, Toad, and Badger. Rat lives in the river bank and is totally fond of his little place. Mole lives underground and wants to see a lot more of the Big World. It's no surprise that Rat becomes his mentor and best friend. Both animals do have one constant worry: Toad. Toad, who owns Toad Hall, the biggest building in the neighbourhood, is extremely rich and conceited. But both friends know that beneath his vain faade, Toad means well. But all their effort in vain, Toad gets in a big mess when he buys an automobile. Mole does not know what he can still do to avoid Toad killing himself and others, so he calls in the help of the intelligent and respected Badger, who lives in the Wild Wood.  The major theme of this classic story is the struggle between the noisy, common way of life of the Wild Wooders, like the stoats and the weasels, and the quiet and genteel River-Bankers. Toad is a lovable rebel who does not fit well into either camp. With this setting Kenneth Grahame delivers a lovable and enjoyable fairytale for the younger readers, but has not neglected to fill the story with enough witty sidetracks to address a much wider audience. It is not without reason that this book was voted one of the best children's books ever.   The Wind in the Willows started as a series of stories shared by Grahame in letters to his only child, Alastair, born in 1899. It took until 1908 before these stories were first published. After almost more than one-hundred years this book still manages to capture its own place in the hearts of thousands of people. The Wind in the Willows is simply a must read for everyone who is still young at heart 
 This one ranks in the top two.  I can't decide which is better, this or Crouching Tiger.  A temporary ranking:  1) Crouching Tiger 2) House of Flying Daggers 3) Hero  This is one of the most beautifully filmed movies I've ever seen.  The action sequences are awesome, especially the opening "dance" number.  Just sit back and enjoy it all.  It's a bit faster paced than the awesome-but-slow Hero.  On DVD it looks absolutely tremendous.  I own it 
 Nice little comp for a band that is largely under-rated.  Well, except for 1992-93 when they were everyone's darlings.  But how quickly even darlings can be forgotten.  Truth is, their early stuff isn't that great (okay, it's great!), and their later stuff isn't bad at all (seriously).  Frankly, I really dig LET YOUR DIM LIGHT SHINE and CANDY FROM STRANGERS is flat-out awesome.  Love the acoustic and live bonus tracks on this baby.  Hell, if you don't own anything by The Asylum then this is worth it for RUNAWAY TRAIN alone, possibly the best pop song of the 90's 
 This National Book Award winner and treasure trove contain all 41 of Eudora Welty's short stories, including: "A Curtain of Green and Other Stories," (1941); "The Wide Net and Other Stories ,"(1943); the seven interlocking narratives of "The Golden Apples," (1949), "The Bride of the Innisfallen and Other Stories," 1955, as well as two previously uncollected works, "Where Is the Voice Coming From?" (1963), and "The Demonstrators" (1966). Miss Welty also wrote a Preface especially for this edition, in which she says: "I have been told, both in approval and in accusation, that I seem to love all my characters. What I do in writing of any character is to try to enter into the mind, heart and skin of a human being who is not myself."   The intricacies of human relationships is the primary theme in this collection of short fiction. Eudora Welty's works combine wonderful humor and an astute perception of human psychology. Her ear for dialogue is superb and her prose lyrical and nuanced.    Eudora Welty was born in Jackson, Mississippi where she spent most of her life. From the moment of publication, her collections of stories won wide critical acclaim, as did her novels, "The Robber Bridegroom," "Delta Wedding," "The Ponder Heart," "Losing Battles," and "The Optimist's Daughter," which won the 1973 Pulitzer Prize. Her autobiography, One Writer's Beginnings, won both the American Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1984. In 1996, Welty was given France's highest civilian honor, the French Legion of Honor Award.   This is a remarkable compilation of short fiction by one of the most gifted writers of our time. This volume enriches any library it graces. Highly recommended. JAN 
 This is a great live cd!  I did not know about My Morning Jacket. I read some reviews of this cd where the theme has been, for the world of live cds, that this is a superior work. The live versions of the songs have been described by reviewers as vastly superior and different from the studio versions. Being a big music fan, I bought this having no familiarity with the band. I really do like it.  My Morning Jacket is definitely a different type of band. This is no funky, good time type of group. The songs are majestic and very arty. They sound like a cross between Coldplay, U2, Supertramp, Roadiohead and folky Bruce Springsteen. The singer wails like a banshee and is the heart of the sound. Guitars are used to punctuate rather than carry the whole melody. They are described as having a Southern Rock vibe but I do not hear that influence. The music always is very dramatic.  The thing that impresses me the most is the beautiful arrangements of these songs, especially how the instruments are used. There is nothing virtuoistic about the musicians yet every note seems like it was the perfect note played. They fit wonderfully within the context of the songs   I wonder if the sound was enhanced after it was recorded? If there are no overdubs then their live sound is truly incredible.  The songs I like the best (remember I knew nothing about them) are;  "Off the Record" This is a reggae type song that utilizes a Hawaii Five O riff then morphs into the best instrumental jam session on the cd  "Wordless Chorus" this song best demonstrates the singer's vocals  "Gideon" a cool, dramatic song.  "One big holiday" this song closest resembles conventional song structure. It is a song that builds into a crescendo all the time using a cliched, common guitar riff as a theme.  "X-mas curtain" I do not know what this is about b/c you can rarely understand the lyrics but it sounds like a beautiful song of elation  I was not impressed with this at first listen probably b/c the songs are complicated and challenging. After repeated listeings I recognized the  serious depth. All of the songs have energy but what makes them real special is that there is a genuine beauty contained within them.  I am converted and will see them if they play live in my town.  This lives up to it's reputation as a great live album 
 The endless summer day of love, lust, eating, fine friends, laughter and tears cannot last. Nikita Michalkov's brilliant film is moving . . . the hero revels in his last day of freedom. The acting is outstanding. The luscious tranquil scenery is the backdrop for this emotionally charged film. The hero faces fate with a laugh and a wink--he charges forward to certain death--he's ordered and has no choice. I couldn't turn away from this movie. It's images linger on in my brain. The undercurrent of the torment of the cruel state is symbolized by the balloon honoring Stalin. We remember all those brave souls who we're burnt by the sun. 
 Dewey's "How We Think" is the first book of his I have read.  What a joy!  I am in the "thick" of my doctoral dissertation, and am struggling to present and unfold my research work in a way that is clear to my audience (in this case, the members of my dissertation committee).  Dewey's analysis of thought has helped me to consider important elements of thinking (and writing) such as: (1) the iterative "ebb and flow" between inductive and deductive thinking; (2) what is necessary to train my own mind to think "better"; etc.  Following my reading of "How We Think," I am now reading Dewey's "The Quest for Certainty" and "Knowing and the Known."  Reading "How We Think" is not difficult; however, it does require one to pay attention to what Dewey is saying to his reader audience.  Now that I've read through it once, I will likely read through it again (fairly soon), as I work to tighten up my Ph.D. dissertation.  In conclusion, whether you are a student, teacher, or just plain interested in analyzing the world around you, then reading this book is very worthwhile. 
 Thanks for quick service and an enjoyable book.  Would buy from you again 
 A basic, no-frills introduction to the bottomless chasm of philosphy. Light-hearted and none to serious for those of you who aren't into the deep introspectives, but wonder what it's all about. Who could ask for more? And  who would expect more from a "Complete Idiot's" title? :-) If you  want it light and easy, here it is 
 MY NAME IS RED is a huge and densely-composed novel set in late-16th-century Istanbul among the small closed circle of miniature painters, who work their whole lives until (and even after) they go blind, illustrating books which may never been seen again by any other than their rich patrons. Though clearly a masterpiece (there has been talk about Pamuk as a potential Nobelist), it is by no means an easy read.  I came to this after reading Pamuk's later novel, SNOW. What the two have in common is a concern with Islam and an examination of its place in a secularized world; they also share a large scale and a certain sense of fantasy. But whereas SNOW is set in the modern world (albeit a distant outpost of it) and is told from a single perspective, MY NAME IS RED takes the reader back to 1591 and proceeds in a kaleidoscope of short chapters written by different characters in the story -- including Satan, a corpse, a dog, a tree, and (as in the title) a pot of red ink! Even the covers of the two books show their differences: SNOW almost monochromatic, MY NAME IS RED a collage of brilliantly colored panels and borders from miniatures such as those described in the book. The color, lightness, and even sense of fun draw the reader easily into the book until he is either held or repelled by the intensity of its philosophical argument.  There are two main plot strands: the mystery of a master miniaturist murdered by one of his colleagues, and a love story. The latter, actually, is not dissimilar to the situation in SNOW: an exile returning after many years, hoping to be reunited with a former sweetheart who has since married another man. But, as in much medieval and renaissance literature, the point is less the story than the many digressions within the story: lists, legends, historical precedents, parables and counterparables, and above all disquisitions on the nature and purpose of figurative art within a culture whose religion forbids it. Pamuk's handling of these sections is virtuosic, and they become the verbal equivalent of the miniatures and decorations in an illuminated manuscript, and the main reason why one opens the book.  I would have to say that Pamuk does not seem to put much emphasis on the delineation of character, or perhaps that he is not always successful at it. The major figures in the love story come over quite clearly: the writer Black, his beloved Shekure, her children Shevket and Orhan, and (to a lesser extent) her father Enishte. But the miniaturists -- nicknamed Olive, Butterfly, and Stork -- one of whom must be the murderer, are distinguished more by subtle differences in their attitude to their art than by qualities of character. So the reader has little alternative but to go along with the author in solving the mystery more as a theorem in aesthetics and religion than as an outcome of human nature.  The book's color and brilliance of linguistic invention reminds me a little of Salman Rushdie, though Pamuk is a much cooler writer. But the closest parallel that comes to mind (although it is a long time since I read the book) is Umberto Eco's THE NAME OF THE ROSE -- another murder mystery used to frame historical, religious, and philosophical disquisitions in the old manner. Readers who enjoyed Eco should certainly try Pamuk 
 I am astounded that one book could change the way I view my life!  I read this book cover to cover and then reread several of the chapters that I needed clarification on.  Alcohol is all around me and I don't crave it at all anymore.  I have tried to quit or cut back on drinking several times over the past few years.  It is always a miserable experience which ends with a drink.  After reading Carr's book, I not only feel great; I have hope!  I am amazed that I now have my life back!   If you drink, READ THIS BOOK!    Also, there are many more reviews on the UK website--Amazon.co.uk--for the Easy Way to Control Alcohol which I have read is very similar to this book.  Be free 
 Some people on the reviews complained about the book not just being Covey talking...but if you notice the book is written by three people (yeah, Amazon only shows 2, but I have the book in front of me) The CD is a good highlight to explaining the basics to the First Things First principles. The cd says to get the book for using the meat and potatoes of the book...BUT there is also a 3 Disc set out there which is Unabriged and tells it all (for some reason I can't find it on Amazon...but have found it in searching around the net) So if you want the basics to remind yourself of what you are doing (Review regularly to make it a part of your life is a common self improvement strategy) is quicker than re-reading the book over and over... especially when given the gift of traffic to slow down and enjoy the CD 
 A fantastic little book to teach the young ones about the sizes, shapes, and every other item concerning noses.  There are elephants and birds, and other kinds of animals, and some suggestions about how noses are used as well as what would happen if we didn't have any noses.  Terrific guidance for the youngsters and oldsters alike.  Beautiful poetry and colors, all primary ones.  Catchy and wonderful!! 
 Michael Cunningham's "Flesh and Blood," is one of the best novels I've read so far this year.   Constantine Stassos is a Greek immigrant with ambition, drive and a fierce temper. His wife Mary works hard to maintain the ideal or at least the illusion of perfection in her family. Constantine's three children are each touched, destroyed, or changed by their parents' behavior, especially their father's.   Cunningham's characterization is brilliant. Every thought, every action, every belief held by the people in "Flesh and Blood" rings true and results in a stunning display of cause and effect.  Susan, the eldest daughter is forever changed by her father's lack of boundaries, and Zoe, the youngest, the one named for Constantine's Greek heritage, is essentially ignored until the other two children have grown up and moved away from home. Constantine shows a unique tenderness to this wild child as they work together in the garden.  There's something different about Billy, Constantine's only son, and that fact haunts Constantine, a feeling left unsaid-at least in the verbal sense-but always there between them nonetheless. Here's an excerpt:  "When Constantine hit him he felt he was obliterating a weakness in the house. He was cauterizing a wound. The back of his hand struck Billy's jaw hard, scraped across his teeth with a cleansing burn. He heard Mary's scream from a distance. Billy's head snapped back and Constantine hit him again, this time with the heel of his hand, a smack solid and sure as a hammer driving a nail deep into pine."     The novel opens with a scene in which Constantine as a young boy works hard to make things grow, going so far as to carry bits of rich soil in his mouth so that he may drop it onto his poorly soiled plot of a garden. The image of the garden shows up again when he and his daughter Zoe work to produce beautiful vegetables, loaded with hidden caustic pesticides.   "She raised the tomato to her mouth, and Constantine had an urge to yell, `Don't it's poisoned.' Which was ridiculous. It was no more poisoned than most of what people ate, and probably less. But as he watched her bite into the tomato, a chill shot through his heart."  A stunning metaphor for the family affected by Constantine's devotion and poisonous weaknesses. 
 Delightful film.  We were glad to have a chance to see it again after all these years.  Nice change from the boring movies they make today.  Highly recommended for viewers of all ages 
 I really enjoyed the Lizzie McGuire movie. It was light and entertaining.  But I don't know if I would want my daughter to watch it because it's based on deception and I am really concerned about her not learning the wrong thing.  Lizzie is pretending to get sick so she could sneak out and do other things.  But for those who already know right from wrong and won't be convinced that lying is ok based on this movie, it's entertaining 
 If you have a digital camera I highly recommend this card. It writes super fast and I swear my picture quality has improved. It holds approx. 454 pics at 7.1 pixels. It is reasonably priced (especially with the rebate) and it has a lifetime warranty. It comes with recovery software and a nice little card holding case. I will be getting the 2 gb next.. 
 To appreciate this book, you truly must clear your mind and concentrate on what O'Brien is saying instead of just what he's telling. Simply a brilliant book, but not for everyone 
 When I was a freshman at the University of Richmond, Naguib Mahfouz's  Fountain and Tomb was one of the books all first year English classes were  required to read. I must confess, as a typical student, I had little desire  to read the aforementioned text; however, from the moment I read the first  paragraph, I was hooked. Rarely  have I ever discovered such pure joy in  prose. Each word, each sentence created so detailed a picture of a world  which delighted me and, by the conclusion of the piece, I longed for more.  Mahfouz has painted with words a beautiful, mystical portrait in the  Fountain and Tomb and I highly recomend this book to anyone who has even  the slightest passing interest in Egypt 
 This book looks deep beneath the surface of London society during the Age of Enlightment and describes in minute detail what life was really like for one and all, from the lowest street urchin to the royal family.  The daily struggle for existence by London's residents is covered -- all those unsavory things you probably didn't learn in history class. Overflowing cespits, Orphans apprentenced into professions where an early death from industrial pollutants was a near certainty, bakeries that regularly adulterated their bread with caulk, these are just a few of the many examples found on these pages. No detail is overlooked:  What they wore, what they did for fun, the cost of living, the cost of dying, the capricious justice system under which a significant number of lawbreakers managed to avoid punishment, even for murder, while an unlucky few were hanged for crimes that today would draw only a small fine. I highly recommend Dr. Johnson's London to anyone who is looking for an in-depth look at Georgian London.  
 I have read many of the Preston Childs books but this one is the best.  I love Pendergast!  He's intelligent and intriguing.  I only wish he were real.  I can't wait to read  more!  More Pendergast, pleasssse 
 Indulge me for a moment. It's difficult to listen to this CD and not think of what the songs have meant to me over my life. I originally got this record when I was 13 years old, and it's been with me ever since. I was wet-my-pants happy to find it on CD (my vinyl copy is a bit battered). To me, this is a perfect, and I mean PERFECT, slice of power pop, maybe the finest power pop available anywhere. There's not a so-so song in the bunch. And the six bonus tracks are all worthwhile additions, despite the fact that they're perhaps not as polished as the original ten tracks. I love this record! Now it's your turn. Love it! Love it! Love it 
 Often in my reviews, I touch on elements of the plot.  I wouldn't call them "spoilers" per se, but I went in to this movie almost cold, and that turned out to be an immensely rewarding experience!  Harakiri rewards patience.  I was actually bored for the first 30 minutes of the film, and then it all comes together.  Somewhat light on action, this film is an articulate criticism of the corruption power brings and the length one man goes to expose the hypocrisy.  
 If you enjoyed the movie Heathers, you will no doubt love Jawbreaker. In fact, a friend of mine who's all-time favorite movie is Heathers, almost refused to watch it. I told him it was similar to Heathers and if he hated it that much he could punch me when it was over. Well, he loved it too, and I'm talking about one of the most stubborn people I've ever met in my entire life. A dark comedy that focuses on the clique mentality. Jawbreaker is peachy keen in every possible way. Check it out...it won't disappoint 
 The video is excellent. I was not happy with the delivery of my product.  I bought this for Father's Day for my husband and it took 10 days for delivery.  Iwas not told it would take this long. Had I know, I would have went to a brick and mortar store to purchase this 
 Received exactly what I ordered at a fair price 
 This book was pretty good.  I liked the fact that the dad and the mom both got involved in the process of potty training.  I liked the concept that it pointed out that it might take a while for you to "get it".  That being said, my daughter wasn't engrossed in this book....I ordered it the same time I ordered "Potty Power" DVD--and she was so obsessed with the "Potty Power" DVD that she wasn't that interested in the book.  The book is worth a try though, IMO 
 Bryson has been one of my favorite authors for years now - the first thing of his that I read was a magazine article comparing American weather extremes with those in his beloved England.  This collection of his writings on things American has me confused.  Most of it, as his wife points out, is griping about this and that.  Bryson has a tendency to talk down anything that doesn't fit into his view of how life ought to be and a maddening myopia when it comes to understanding why things are the way they are in this modern world.  Balancing that though is his self-deprecating humor and his beautiful writing skills.  There is a piece on global warming in this book that all ought to read.  So, basically, even though he is preachy, and a bit gripy, he is laugh-out-loud funny and writes so very well that I will keep reading him.   
 If you're normal, then you probably aren't too excited about taking Organic Chemistry.  However, Jones Organic Chemistry is a much much better text than many of the orgo books out there.  The book is set up the way that you should learn chemistry, the way that it makes sense, and not the way that many chemistry classes are being taught at many universities 
  The book has an enormous volume of information for star trek fans and to any one who enjoys Science fiction. The only down side to the book is its lack of ship descriptions but this will probably be covered in a later or a different book. Overall well worth the pric 
 first off...this is great book in many ways ..presented in a most professional and clean manner, a publishing work of art to go with the works of art inside....the history of Stan and his team of talents is vast and covered very well in text and of course with images to amaze... the design, constuction and presentation of the art of Special make-up effects in the films that have become icons and benchmarks for fx artists to admire and try to outdo, well they are all there, of course there could always be more details and more information but any book of this scale is going to be marketed to a broader audience than myself and my peers in the fx world, but this book does a wonderful job of presenting what we do and what we would love to acheive in very warm and fun light.  Thanks to Stan for being the ring leader of such a talented circus of artits!  Anthony Veilleux, Make-up fx artis 
 While this is the story of Fong Sai Yuk, he is a very different chatacter than that of Wong Fei Hung of Once Upon A Time In China fame.  Both, I believe, were part of the heroes known as the Ten Tigers of Canton, but the association ends there 
 Thank you for this great purchase! The book is in great shape and I couldn't beat the price! 
 This is the best Cam album ever and my top 25 CD's ever Muc better than purple haze and the last album with the Killa Cam i listened to. The Only album with him that compares is  Children Of the Corn by the group of the same name which included killa cam, murda mase, Blood Shed and, Big L. R.I.P. Big L and BloodShed 
 A great piece of music from the former Soul Coughing frontman.  If you like Soul Coughing you will love this album.  5 stars all the way!! 
 Connelly really brings the characters to life.  The farther into you get, the faster you want to turn the pages 
 these are such comfortable boots!  if you want sheepskin boots without paying a bunch for UGGS, then these are the ones.  i highly recommend water proofing them first thing, because they're a bit hard to clean 
 Sylvester and the Magic Pebble is William Steig's third book and the only book Steig wrote and illustrated that won the Caldecott Medal.  This story is about a donkey named Sylvester Duncan and his family.  Sylvester lives with his parents on Acorn Road in Oatsdale.  One of Sylvester's hobbies is collecting pebbles of unusual shapes and colors.  One rainy day Sylvester finds a red pebble that will grant him wishes.  On his way home to show the pebble to his parents a lion frightens him at Strawberry Hill.  To save himself he wishes he were a stone.  His problem was he could not wish himself back because the red pebble was not touching him because he was a rock with no hands.  A year passed and his family thought that they would never find their darling child, until one day on a picnic at Strawberry Hill.  His parents eat on the very stone, which is Sylvester.  His dad picks up the red pebble and wishes his son was with them.  The dad puts the red pebble on the stone and Sylvester wishes that they were back together and at that moment he is a donkey again. The family puts the rock away to wait until they really need something again.        Steig addresses the theme of children's fears of separation from their parents, as well as their fears and terrors and even wishes for radical transformations.  Steig uses realistic fiction and animal fantasy in this book.  This is true because the book is about animals doing human like things, which is Animal Fantasy.  The fact that Sylvester finds a magic pebble and turns into a stone is fantasy.  At the same time, if you think of the characters as people, this story could really have happened, as far as people do have families, they have picnics, and children get separated from their parents.  I consider Sylvester and the Magic Pebble a good book.  Books for younger children usually focus on one or two main characters, cover short time sequences, and most often are set in one place.  Sylvester and the Magic Pebble has one main character, Sylvester, and it is set in two places, Acorn Road and Strawberry Hill.  The time sequence is also very short.  Even though the book spaced over a year, the time went by quickly.  Sylvester was a rock for each season and each page of the book had a new season, therefore he was soon reunited with his family.  Sylvester is also supposed to be the age of a child, therefore a child that reads this book will be able to identify with the central character.  This too is an example of a good book.  The language is concrete and vivid and not overly complex.  This story primarily names characters and their actions, nothing too hard for a child to put together.  This book allows the reader to put themselves in Sylvester's shoes, so they can have empathy for what it must be like to be separated from your family by accident.  This book does not overly teach a moral and is mostly an enjoyable read.  Once Sylvester's parents find him, they do not even want to use the magic pebble anymore, because they want nothing more then their son.  This shows that the book has truth to it with the human experience of realizing what you have once you have lost it.  The illustrations are equally as appealing as the text itself.  I love how William Steig is the author and illustrator in all his books.  Overall, the genre, plot, language, characters, style, theme, and illustrations all come together to make a satisfying whole, therefore I would absolutely consider Sylvester and the Magic Pebble a good book.  This book would be great to read in the classroom.  I thought of several teaching connections.  The book talks about a donkey that collects pebbles. You could talk to the class about collections and encourage them to share about ones they have or start a collection for the class.  Talking about different pebbles also allows for you to talk about the different kinds of rocks and gem stones. This is a great science lesson that you could even take a field trip to a gem mine and see what types of gems the students could find.  You could also use this book in talking about animals. This book does not show the typical animal actions, but you could talk about how the animals in the book are trying to act more like humans and explain these differences.  You could also do an art lesson, where students would find a large pebble and as a class everyone could paint pebbles.  You could also teach children how colors mix to make different colors during this lesson. 
 I think that this book; The Privilege of Youth, is a very good book. i dont recomend people who are depressed to read this book. it  took me 3 hours to read this book, as it did David Pelzer's other books, i have not yet read Help Yourself, but i will soon be buying it to read. i hope that people who think it is cool to abuse their children and to hurt people physicaly and mentally, read these books that David Pelzer wrote. it will give them an insite on what they are actually doing to their children. i think that it is completly sick how someone could do such horrible things to someone so young and helpless. i my self was also physicaly and verblly abused throughout my younger years and i am not even a full adult yet, i am 17 yrs old, and i still am abused. The Privilege of Youth is a good book to read. when i was reading it, i related to my self in school. when he was beat up and tortured, i didnt think about myself, but about wanting to belong and wanting to have friends that liked you for who he was, i thought of myself. i only wanted friends that liked me for me, but i never got them. Over all, i think that this book is a very good book to read. David Pelzer inspires all who read his books 
 Rudolph has crafted a fairly exceptional account of a history of student life in "American College and University: A History." Overall, this text focuses on the cultural changes that occur in society that impact the college student and the college life.  I also recommend the following texts to be consulted while reading this book:  "A History of American Higher Education" by John Thelin "American Higher Education" by Christopher Lucas "Campus Life: Undergraduate Cultures from the End of the Eighteenth Century to the Present" by Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz  Finally, if you are interested in the history of co-operative living I highly recommend the following historical account about the University of Kansas: "Making Do and Getting Through" by Fred McElhenie (it is locally published for the University of Kansas by Oread Books) 
 Although this book is one woman's personal experience, there is a lot of good information to be gained from reading it, particularly for a new witch.  Yes, it's political, yes she claims witchcraft is a re-birth of an ancient religion, etc, etc, etc.  And yes, surely those 'facts' aren't really facts at all...  BUT!  If you are of a certain age or reading skill, and can think critically for yourself, then this is a book well worth diving into!  She talks about her experiences with everything from how she first came into the Craft to starting, maintaining, and leaving covens, and much much more.  I see the real value in this book in the 10 and 20 years notes, which show how she, her coveners, and her local community, have grown and changed over the years...  I for one, don't see the point in skipping over something that has led an entire movement just because it contains 'historical errors', as I do not know of any Craft books that can be proven 100% accurate...   And to miss out on such an interesting viewpoint of an author who's gone back each decade to update how and why she's changed her own personal points of view over the course of her lifetime (maiden, mother, crone) over something so trivial, would be such a shame.  I would recommend this book to anyone, as long as they are able to take what they read "with a grain of salt" and would not treat it (or any other book on the Craft) as a strictly factual manual.    Read it and decide for yourself.  
 I really loved this book.  It has absolutely changed my outlook on eating and health.  I mostly focused on the stuff i could do today, but the future remedities were interesting too.   Moreover, i have since read over books to further expand my knowledge.  My diet is 100% different from before plus i take quite a few supplements.  
 Considering this band's penchant for mystery and a determined lack of publicity, it's no surprise that most people think of Belle and Sebastian as a male/female duo. Rather, they are a seven-piece band from Scotland, making music that is very typical of their homeland; reflective and well-structured, with a strong emphasis on poppish melodies (`pop' in the classic sense, NOT in the contemporary boy-band sense). Of course, Nick Drake comes to mind. And their Scottish predecessors, Pre-Fab Sprout. Maybe a bit of Aztec Camera, too. That's not a bad hybrid. Boy With the Arab Strap consists of fragile, whispered melodies that convey innocence, although the lyrics suggest something else entirely (the opening lyric is "He had a stroke at the age of 24...", for God's sake!). The dichotomy of gorgeous, wispy music that sidesteps insouciance for self-analysis could be overbearingly precious if it were any less artful, but the album maintains a sense of balance that keeps it from capsizing into a sea of narcissism. "It Could Have Been a Brilliant Career," "Sleep the Clock Around," and the title track are some of the most melodious songs I've heard in quite a while. A strange, recited song called "Space Boy Dream", with a TV-theme-type jazz-rock workout provides a bizarre but welcome mid-point, and it segues so beautifully into the Motown stomp of "Dirty Dream Number Two" that it can generate goosebumps. This is not music for nightclubs. It is better suited to library lounges and bookstores - private moments rather than public ones - but the confidence of each song's performance belies alienation. Is it a natural ease that informs each song, or is it ennui? Is the band enjoying a pastoral simplicity, or is somebody going to end up at the end of a dangling rope? This much sensitivity indicates an equal amount of vulnerability, which is exactly why these songs cannot be taken as lightly as the gently loping musical approach suggests. Even with the suggestion of such weightiness, the songs are a genuine pleasure to hear, flowing by as calmly as a country stream. Each arrangement suggests an attention to detail and generally upbeat sensibility that would (or should) transcend any unreasonable pathos that lies beneath, making Boy With the Arab Strap an evocative and subtly moving work of art.

 Pereira is a reluctant hero of our time: an inadequate, faintly absurd man  who tries to live a decent personal life in a political setting that allows little room for such illusions. Fascist Portugal in 1938, like some other "civilized" nations closer to our own day, is poisoned by false certainties and the corrupt exercise of vindictive power. Only proclamations of pious conformity are allowed. Pereira, himself a pious and harmless man, finds himself gradually forced, through circumstances beyond his control, to assume the role of a full human being, and to stand up, however briefly, for what is right. Pereira's moral resurrection is handled with great delicacy by Tabucchi. The English translation is another plus: Patrick Creagh is one of the finest translators working today, and here does full justice to Tabucchi's restrained and thoughtful prose. The cumulative effect is remarkable. If they read English over in Stockholm, this book could put its author in contention for the Nobel Prize 
 I usually don't like these sophomoric movies that have thin plots and not much substance (American Pie, Scary Movie, Van Wilder, etc) but I found this one funny!  The three main characters played their parts so well, and were very funny.  This is one movie I can watch again and again and still laugh.  Give it a try, it might surprise you 
 This is a wonderful book.  It told me more than I thought it would.  Just not what to eat but reason that this happens and what it can turn into.  This was the best money I have spent in a long time.  It also helped me with the Doctors visit and things I should have known already. Thanks a million 
 The United States bungled its national priorities from the New Deal to modern times, making fiscal and tax mistakes which have totaled over 16 trillion dollars from FDR through Clinton. The Sixteen-Trillion Dollar Mistake charts federal waste and how it's harmed this country's plans, providing the first book to examine politics, national priorities and federal spending 
 This book, along with Uta Hagen's "Respect for Acting" and any Stanaslavski, is the motherload of theater expertise 
 I'm starting to think that the number one requirement for the job of "president" should be "acting experience."  We seem to do rather well when we have an actor in office, whether in fiction or in real life.  I also love Ben Kingsley's character in this film.  Someone with his integrity in the White House . . . Perhaps that's too much to hope for.  We can always dream, though, and "Dave" is quite a pleasant daydream, even if it could never happen in real life 
 The Joy of Simple Living is easily worth the price in that you'll get tips on how to make your life simpler in almost any area of your life that you can put to work immediately. Rodale is known for doing a lot of these big books, and this one is a nice addition to the over-all line-up 
 Among the Betrayed is a suspenseful and unpredictable book by Marfet Peterson Haddix. Nina Idi is an illegal third child at the population police station. she is asked to betray 3 other illegals. but she remembers how she was betrayed and didn't like it. One day an officer was poisoned and dropped his keys. then an officet took her to ger cell were the other illegals were. but he didn't have a key and Nina had the guard's keys. so the officer left her alone. so Nina got the other illegals and are trying to escape. Will they get out and what will happen next 
 She is looking for the right place in her life. Most of the people are looking for a meaning to live for.  Helene Grimaud wants to capture this feeling with her book. She decided to be in the music. It is her religion to keep on going. The balance lies in the symmetry of life, music and nature. It is her way to cope with her life. In this harmony she finds her relief and strength. She explains her love for the music, witch touches her soul, her love for the animals and her free dealing with nature. These are the real balances in her life. The book describes her childhood in Aix, her studies at the conservatory in Aix and Paris. In her early years she showed her rebellion behaviour against her parents and her classmates. These examples show her unrestrained nature, her passion for the music and the strength to carry on in her life. For the most people who work with her, this attitude makes her moody and unpredictable. In the last chapter she explains her love for wolfs, her first meeting with Alawas. The early years in America were very difficult. She describes the foundation of the Wolf Conservation Centre. I read the book with pleasure because the connection between the stories and her musical career is very powerful. This book shares a common feeling. It is to be positive in the things to come and to accomplish your goals what ever it takes. 
 This book seems to be a shorter presentation of much of the material found in _The Absorbent Mind_, which requires a good deal more persistence.  At less than 100 pages, this book is easy to take in, while still containing fundamental principles of Montessori's theory of education, especially as relevant to 3- to 6-year-olds.  The writing is engaging, not academic.  I can easily recommend it to be the first or only book by Dr. Montessori for the parent of a toddler to read.  There is not much here specifically relevant to the nature of elementary-level Montessori programs, however.  Perhaps the foundational concept of Montessori's overall theory is that of the young child's "absorbent mind": "the child has a type of mind that absorbs knowledge, and thus instructs himself."  The universal example is that of language acquisition, which is flawlessly and gleefully accomplished by 2-year-olds who cannot read books or ask questions or attend lectures, while the same entails a very laborious and error-prone effort for adults.  The child's mind is, from birth, forming itself and its "organs" (drawing an analogy to embryology) by its own natural impetus and direction.  Environment is key.  "[T]he child who, making use of all that he finds around him, shapes himself for the future."  Up until age 3, the child's mind is "unapproachable by the adult, who can exercise no influence on it."  From 3 to 6, the child is able to tirelessly concentrate upon an environment carefully crafted with his or her psyche in mind, absorbing its lessons.  Another fundamental concept in the theory is that of the "normal" child, the "true" child which is revealed only when the environment is right.  Defects of character which may have been present before age 3 are resolved during the ages of 3 to 6, if the provided environment plays to the power and nature of the absorbent mind.  The title of the book reflects the author's belief that the world which "has been torn to pieces" (presumably these words were written during or soon after WW2) can only be fundamentally reconstructed through education.  Children create themselves, they create adults, and thereby they are the creators of culture and civilization and the whole world -- they are all-powerful in this sense, and therein lies the fundamentality of education as a cause of history.  Montessori also presents a notion of cosmic harmony, such that every organism is performing the role it was perfectly designed, through evolution, to perform.  There is both a sense of a normally pleasant universe here, as well as a questionable assumption of some important extra-personal purpose for each of us.  Not much in Montessori's program for 3- to 6-year-olds relies on this latter point, that I can find.  Some other points discussed:  the importance of using the body, especially the hands, in learning; the stages of physical and mental development, and of language learning; the small child's healthy motivation to complete tasks which may seem pointless to adults; the construction -- not "teaching" -- of moral character; obedience as obtained through freedom, not fear; and what is required of the Montessori teacher or guide 
 one of the boldest of the bold.  kudos to mr. iles for having the guts to take on the sexual apologists.  nambla has been put on notice.  this is work of pure satisfaction, from the death of every pedophile to the resurrection of our hero, cat.  another worthy pile of words from mr. iles, despite his ignorance regarding black people.  the dialog is downright embarrassing, but keep trying mr. iles.  if you hang out with african-americans rather than watch them on tv, perhaps you'll get 5 stars next time

 Not Your Father's ePhilanthropy: Online Fundraising Comes of Age - and So Should You  By: Brian Walsh  (originally published on onPhilanthropy.com)  For more than a decade now, ePhilanthropy has been the rage among nonprofit organizations.  During the concept's infancy, many thought that fundraising over the Internet would herald a new era of cheap, easy, and profitable fundraising.  Nonprofits, the theory went, would be able to dip their toe into the river of the New Economy and swim in the ocean of resulting donations.     Unfortunately, this initial excitement dissipated when many nonprofit organizations did not see the results they expected from their ePhilanthropy efforts.  Evidently, many nonprofits thought that by simply adding a "donate now" button to their Website, they were opening themselves up to an unprecedented new fundraising source.    Now that ePhilanthropy has learned from its childhood mistakes and is growing up, it is time for nonprofits to take another look at its potential.  A great place to start is the new guidebook, "Nonprofit Internet Strategies:  Best Practices for Marketing, Communications, and Fundraising."    Building upon extensive experience in the field, the book uses numerous case studies to examine what different nonprofits' ePhilanthropy strategies got right - and what they got wrong.   Recognizing that fundraising, especially online fundraising, can no longer stand apart from the rest of an organization's efforts, "Nonprofit Internet Strategies" lays out clear guidelines for integrating offline activities with an organization's online presence.  Branding efforts, marketing strategies, constituent recruitment and retention, communication approaches - they all need to be effectively coordinated within any ePhilanthropy effort.    Edited by fundraising and ePhilanthropy experts Ted Hart, James Greenfield, and Michael Johnston, each chapter of "Nonprofit Internet Strategies" was written by a noted contributor.   Since the book has been written for nonprofit professionals by nonprofit professionals, it is easy to read and easy to follow, avoiding overly-technical jargon.  There are also helpful screen captures and diagrams to explain key concepts.    ePhilanthropy is still an emerging and evolving field; this book provides clear support for any organization looking for guidance amidst this confusion.  Whether you are launching an online giving program, looking to increase your constituency base, hoping to carry important advocacy messages to a wider audience, or simply looking to expand your online presence, this is a helpful new resource.  "Nonprofit Internet Strategies" should not only be a handy everyday reference, but also can serve as a launch pad for further conversation and brainstorming by organizations.   It is now clear that, while online fundraising did not immediately produce the windfall initially anticipated, it will continue to be an important, even critical, component of any nonprofit's efforts.  By incorporating approaches explained in this book, all nonprofits - whether large and well-established or smaller and short-staffed - can adopt and enhance effective ePhilanthropy programs. 
 This is a great book whether you are a serious martial artist or someone who simply wants to learn a handful of extremely effective self defense techniques.  I am a practicing mixed martial artist with training in judo, wrestling and Kenpo Karate.  My experience has been that formal training, particularly in the martial arts, can be too time consuming and cluttered with useless detail and information.  After almost 6 years in one particular art I can tell you that the techniques presented in this book are right on the money in terms of simple, fast and effective as well as easy to learn, practice and execute.  The author clearly has the life experience to present this material.  I read the book in short order and am already practicing the techniques with training partners.    If you're serious about defending yourself in a violent situation, this is more than worth the investment.  The techniques are geared toward the reality of violence on the street rather than the perfect scenarios that are studied in a studio on a nice soft floor with padded partners.  And for those of you who are simply too busy with life, why would anyone want to learn 400 techniques when these 12 do a better job of covering all the bases and can be practiced to an extreme level of proficiency 
 This little book really helped me get the most out of my Maui trip.  It's restaurant and activity recommendations were right on the mark.  It gives you a great overview without being overwhelming 
 This was by far the best Genero/Kenzie novel of the series.  I loved this book.  Everything about it.  In this one, you really got to see the emotional side of Bubba.  Made him more likeable. The storyline kept me riveted and not wanting to put the book down.  I was happy to see Angie and Patrick back together.  The ending was very good and left you thinking the character could possibly come back in a future book. I'm scratching my head wondering why this was the last book of the series and why Lehane hasn't published another. It's been 5 years.  I will be watching for it 
 Upon first reading this work of art by Bruce Tuckman, i was vacationing at a friend's lake house.  The book was recomended to me to read so i began reading.  The book did not leave my hands after that until I was done with  it.  It contains the same descriptiveness as the book, Once A Runner, by  John L. Parker.  This book ranks up at the top with the rest of them 
 As a self-proclaimed 'messie' I have been led to read many organizational books. It was so refreshing to find this book which combined the two desires of my heart; to one, transform myself spiritually not just physically, and two, minister to my family's specific needs as we homeschool. This book addresses the specific heart issues that can challenge you, and gives scriptures of encouragement to feed the soul. Vicki also gives many practical insights to inspire one to adapt to their families specific needs. As soon as I discovered it, I bought one for myself and promptly bought 2 more and gave them to friends. I highly recommend it

 I'm not going to try to answer my own question. I will say that this is an interesting look at the 67 march from Mailer's perspective. The section on the development of the march itself and the organizers was very informative, as was the section entitled "Why are we in Vietnam?" (a clear reference to Mailer's previous novel, which was criticized for not answering the question clearly enough.   The analysis of the changing liberalism in the US is also quite good. Overall, there is no plot. And Mailer's attempts to avoid even the most minor suffering are laughable especially when held against the suffering of the Vietnamese and the US soldiers enlisted to fight a meandering war.   Reading the book in 2005, however, gives the book great significance. It's clear that liberals write books and conservatives work in politics. And unfortunately, neither side listens to the other very closely.  Mailer's style in this book is very fast and pulled me through the first section quickly. Things slow down in the second section, but not because the subject matter is slower. Mailer clearly wanted to switch styles (and even talks about how he prides himself on changing styles with every work).   Anyway. Enjoy it for the connections to 2005 America, but remember that Mailer is...Mailer. And he loves to talk about himself and how important he is to everyone around him 
 While interesting and informative, this book tends to ramble without really giving you a tight narrative of a trip on "The Mother Road". While perhaps appropriate given the disjoined nature of todays remnants of the famous road, I would like to have seen the state by state commentary accompanied by a start-then-now map of the road with the highlights/attractions indicated and located.  It is none-the-less an interesting and reasonably well illustrated boo 
 Totally awesome movie with jokes and sight gags galore.  Eddie Murphy is one talented man playing all those roles of the Cletus family plus Buddy Love.  A little crude yet but alot of laughing......gas!  Definitely pick this one up and pass on the sequel as that one overdoses on the fart jokes.  This one uses a multi-joke formula all the way to success 
 This CD has a great compilation of songs.  Reminds me of Sunday afternoon drives on the 101 hwy 
 In preparing to go to Paris for the first time, this book is fast becoming my best friend and travel companion.  What other travel books lack in logistics, this more than makes up for.  The way the book is divided so that you can look by region or by interest is very helpful.  There are plenty of different maps with varying levels of details, for whatever your need. Fantastic.   I would have given this book 5 stars, but I was quite disappointed by the hotel section.  Unlike Rick Steves, these good people think that the average traveler can spend $75-$100 per night for accommodation, which is not always the case.  It definitely isn't mine.  Also, this book is quite heavy - literally - which will mean that it stays in the hotel, while Rick Steves goes with me out & about in Paris, helping me travel like a temporary native (I recommend checking him out too.  His books are very user-friendly).    Still, it's a great guide for the first-time traveler, and I suspect will serve me even better for my second visit 
 Very heavy and well built phone, great ringer sound, brings back the old days ... Kids hate it because it has a cord, now I need a black and white TV so I can finally have my phone and TV all to myself. Great Phone 
 OH YA FORGET NAVY SUBS WELL THE RUSSIAN MILITARY IS BETTER AND RUSSIAN ARMY BETTER THEY CAN BEAT USA 
  Because of poor money management by her clergyman father, Agnes becomes a governess, first to the Bloomfield family and then to the Murrays. Writing in the first person, Agnes relates her experiences, taking her remembrances from a journal she's kept for many years. Caring for the three spoiled Bloomfield children, she learns all about arrogance and over-indulgent parenthood. It is always Agnes's fault when the children misbehave. Yet it is her calm reportage and her own high principles that mainly impress the reader.   With the Murrays her problems are different, and concern mainly the dealings of flirtatious Rosalie, who cares only about finding a suitable husband. Of course she chooses poorly and ends up unhappy. It's Agnes, though, who comes through all this the "victor": not only does she find a good husband in Edward Weston (the curate whom Rosalie had rejected), but she is obviously head-and-shoulders above the upper-middle class people she works for in morality, decency, self-respect, even common sense. To witness Agnes's success is the joy of the book; her straightforward and ironic tone only add to the pleasure 
 An absolutely mesmerizing movie.  I saw it at the Balboa in SF and Jim played a set at intermission 
 Despite its rather mundane and unalluring title and the name of her lead character, Cordelia Gray, PD James has concocted a fairly riveting tale of murder, deception and betrayal. She introduces us to Cordelia Gray, a 23 year old private detective who inherits her own agency when her older partner commits suicide due to untreatable cancer.  Her first solo case comes in the form of investigating the suicide death of a young man.  His father, a noted scientist, wants Cordelia to find out why he killed himself. James' mainstay Adam Dalgleish is a ghost in most of the book but he does come in for the final section.  Of course, Cordelia's digging leads her to believe the suicide is really a murder, and finds her own life in danger. James' prose is highly atmospheric and she fills the book with interesting, if somewhat unlikeable, characters (Are Brits really as self-centered and pompous as they appear in these mysteries?).   AN UNSUITABLE JOB FOR A WOMAN is a well written mystery and again demonstrates the popularity of Ms. James 
 What more is there to say, I liked it. Funny and a tad bit too silly in parts over all it's a good movie 
 Big print, clearly written, direct and concise.  Love the lay out and simple to read summary of treatment protocols.  Format itself, even above the content, encourages patients to pursue a course of action when they find others share in thier struggles and have found hope in solution options.  
 This is the best review of the JFK assassination that I have seen. There is still a large "assassination industry," which can afford to find documents that you haven't read and charge you with ignorance if you haven't read them, and find 15 more if you read them. This gives a common-sense overview that seems quite reasonable. I trust it. I am always willing to consider other opinions, but the balance of evidence has always indicated that Oswald acted alone.  It would be nice to have a new edition of this book.. 
 This is a great book for one who is looking for an easy-to-understand but in-depth analysis of Kieslowski's various films. Although the most recent trilogy is yet to be incorporated into this text, this book nonetheless serves as both a foundation and structure for studies on the 'transcendental' image. This book also cites varying philosophers and important literary figures. A good sum-up point would be the fact that almost all characters, as described by the author, are in between something, usually dichotomies, like life and death. 
 Benedict Anderson's "Imagined Communities" is justifiably a classic of political science and history. Its impact on the study of nationalism - which is arguably the ideology most resistant to academic study - can hardly be measured.  Anderson, a specialist in South-East Asian history, lets his scholarly instincts roam across the entire world as he seeks to explain just why it is that nationalism has become so prevalent in the world. What factors have meant that we take pride in someone dying "for our nation", while we don't take the same pride in someone dying "for our political beliefs"? The answer, somewhat surprisingly, begins with a description of the origins and impact of the printing press. Anderson's argument, particularly the section most well-known to his readers, is that the ability of those living in a particular place to read in their own language (as against Latin, Arabic, Sanskrit or Chinese) began this process. It was enhanced, he contends, with the production of newspapers, allowing people to "imagine" themselves as Peruvian or Chilean, rather than as Spanish colonials. Yes, the choices of nation were used advisedly above, as Anderson's second striking conclusion is that nationalism is a new-world (i.e. the Americas) phenomenon. The "Creole" intelligentsia, allowed to progress only so far by their colonial rulers, became the fertile ground necessary for nationalist ideals.  Anderson also discusses "official" nationalism in some depth, focusing on Europe and making some quite surprising comments regarding the penetration of the various vernacular languages into their respective empires. This analysis seems a little more forced at times, but the general point remains that a "nation" is essentially a modern and "imagined" community.  The revised edition of this work also goes into some detail about the roles of censuses, maps and museums in the creation of nationalism. Using his South-East Asian training, Anderson is able to explain such things as the importance of West Papua to Indonesia, despite the marked cultural differences between most Indonesians and citizens of that province. While this analysis is self-consciously global in scope, Anderson is modest enough to remind the reader that his training is in one region alone. This is a refreshing change from many scholars, who propound theories of global scope based only on observations of a limited series of events.  "Imagined Communities" is, as indicated above, a read of considerable intellectual robustness. It is not, however, a read for the casual history-reader. Anderson makes many demands on his readers, not the least of which is to follow his logic which is not always entirely apparent. With that in mind, the book can be recommended to all with an academic interest in history, but with considerable reservations to those without 
   Amidst the chaos and madness of the world, one occasionally finds people who make life worthwhile and suggest that perhaps there is hope for humanity. Among these justifications for the existence of homo sapiens are Socrates, da Vinci, Mozart, Einstein, and Bullwinkle J. Moose.   I am old enough to remember watching some of these shows when they first came out, but nostalgia is not the reason I'm so enthused--I don't really recall any of the programs. No, my five-star recommendation is based solely on the excellent writing, the superb voice acting, and the fine, though simple, artwork.   Jay Ward must have been aiming at both adults and children when he invented Rocky & Bullwinkle. The slapstick, blow-em-up scenes alternate with sophisticated word-play (how many kids would recognize the joke in a title like "The Ruby Yacht of Omar Khayyam"?), stiletto-like satire, and even attempts to improve the grammar and logic of the viewers. ("Our heroes were surrounded on all sides," says the narrator. Bullwinkle looks amazed and asks, "Is there any other way to be surrounded?")   Rocky and Bullwinkle are surely among the most endearing cartoon characters ever created. Boris and Natasha could acquire legendary status, like Captain Queeg. Fearless Leader is a great lampoon of a fascist/communist dictator.   Different viewers will prefer different parts of the shows. My favorites are the main stories and Mr. Know-It-All/ Bullwinkle's Corner. Fractured Fairy Tales and Dudley Do-Right are generally very good. I don't care so much for Aesop and Son or Mr. Peabody. The booklets with each set are very well-done and helpful.   Buy Series One. You will quickly get Two and Three, and, like me, be looking forward to Four. This is great stuff. 
 I don't think I've been more drawn in by music since ever! Any chance I find a Meatloaf song. It's immediately on my MP3 Player. If I don't got the cord to get the song I'll e-mail it to myself so I can sync it later. That's just Meatloaf. The kind of music you've got to have.  I've always loved Meatloaf ever since I was what? Five? Four? Maybe when I was just being born. His music is just fantastic. I love numerous of his songs. My top favorites are "Paradise By the Dashboard Light", "Dead Ringer for Love", "I Would Do Anything for Love(But I Won't Do That", and who could forget "Hot Patootie-Bless My Soul/What Ever Happened to Saturday Night?"?   Speak bad of him all you want but Meatloaf has this thing that just lures you closer to listen. Whether you bop to the music, or just listen intentively. Every song tells a story. And Meatloaf does just that 
 If a short story sticks in your mind long after it has been read that says something about the writers craft. Fords short story called Under the Radar (which is in this book) is a good example of this 
 this movie was one of the better movies i've ever seen. as far as cute guys, great story-line, and talent go it's all that! i can't believe how  ne1 could not like it. i think it sends a very positive message out about  racial issues. and the movie also isn't mushy at all considering it's a  drama. if u like or dis like basketball it doesn't matter because it's  still a great movie no matter what! : 
 This book, with its initial copyright in 1936, shows Christie at the height of her powers.  One of the coziest things about a Christie mystery - especially those which were written earlier - is that they are set before so many of the great advances in forensics.  There's no mention of computer databanks or DNA, no fiber analysis nor hair samples.  Now, I'm all for the wonderful things that can be done with forensics for capturing criminals in the real world, and these can make for fascinating reading, too.  But novels are sometimes more pleasant when they don't deal with the technical side of things, but let the readers ponder, along with Christie's detective Hercule Poirot, the psychology behind the murder.  In Cards on the Table, Christie sets up an imaginative, elegant, albeit implausible scenario.  Four murderers - successful ones, those who have gotten away with it - are invited to dinner by Mr Shaitana, a rich eccentric who collects only the best - including collections of people.  To the same dinner party this Shaitana invites four specialists in crime - a policeman, a man in the Secret Service, a writer of detective novels and of course our protagonist, Hercule Poirot.  The dinner is excellent and Shaitana then makes some provocative remarks, putting the wind up in his quartet of murderers.  The two groups - murderers and crime specialists - then divide into two different rooms and play bridge for the rest of the evening.  Shaitana does not play, but sits in an armchair by the fire in the same room as the murderers.  The evening continues until late.  The crime specialists come to bid their host farewell, when lo! - to their great surprise, they find that their host has been murdered in the chair.  The deed must have been committed by one of the four bridge players during the course of the evening.  Christie then proceeds to reveal much about the murderers and their history.  She does her best to be fair during the course of the book, putting her own cards on the table.  And of course the pool of those who could have committed the crime is also limited - in another sense, the cards are also on the table.  Finally, the bridge game plays a role in the assisting Poirot in figuring out whodunit.  You can enjoy this book if you don't know bridge, but it helps if you do.  Another advantage of this book is that there's also no appearance of the dim Arthur Hastings, for which I'm grateful.   The psychology, in my opinion, is spot on in this book, and makes it one of Christie's best.  My only question - and one which she did not have to answer - is to wonder if Shaitana had any plans for the end of the evening, assuming that he had survived?  But Christie is not obliged to answer this question, and she does not. 
 John Michael is truly a great country singer. A voice at times reminiscent of Garth Brooks, but more traditional than Garth. This album contains some great good ol' country tunes. The sad ballads to love songs, to up-tempos. "I love the way you love me" was a big hit, and my personal favourite from the album. It was also later covered by Boyzone. This album was recorded in 1992 (I think it was his debut, but don't hold me to that), and he is still going strong 
 I've said this before and I'll say this again: Lehane doesn't write mysteries, Lehane writes Literature. I see no difference between Michael Chabon, Jonathan Lethem, Richard Russo, Michael Cunningham, and Dennis Lehane. When I finished Mystic River, I remember thinking "if this book does win the Pulitzer for best fiction, then a crime has happened." I felt the same when I read Darkness, Take My Hand.  Somewhere between writing A Drink Before the War and Darkness, Lehane got really good! I've seen him a few times at signings and I've never asked him what he did or wrote between those two books that made his skills leap into a whole new categories. A Drink Before the War is good, don't get me wrong. I don't agree that it's just an action book even though there's a lot of it in there! There's substance in Drink but Darkness is so much more! Every character is wholly fleshed out and pushed to the limit. The villains are so damn evil it hurts! The violence is gut-wrenching! And the writing is so taut it's like a piano wire. This book starts off like a bullet and doesn't slow down. And I'm not just talking about the action! I'm talking about the narrative (Patrick's narrative of the story can make you laugh at times then make you cry a second later), the subject matter, the dialogue, the setting, everything!  This is why I read! Not just why I read mysteries but why I read fiction! To read something this good and profound just makes me happy to be alive 
 This was a pretty good book.  I found the beginning to drag a lot and a few times I really wanted to put it down but I went on and on the whole I am really glad I did.  Once the book picked up it was hard to put down.  The ending was cool and in this day and age really believable 
 This translation of Meditations by Maxwell Staniforth (this is not the Gregory Hays translation that a lot of people are reviewing) is the best I've read. It reads clearly and simply, with no useless ornamentation to the text. Indeed, what I like about the Great Ideas series that this is a part of is its lack of extras--forewords and introductions and the like which, though often helpful, are usually written by people other than the author and sometimes set the reader up to completely misinterpret what they are about to read. This copy of Marcus Aurelius is only Marcus Aurelius, with perhaps a dozen or so explanatory footnotes sprinkled throughout.  The book itself is well-known, content-wise. The titular meditations are bite-sized thoughts written down by Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius during his later years, as he reflected on his past while campaigning in the north. He was one of the greatest and most famous stoics who ever lived, and this book encapsulates his personal philosophy and manner of thought. His ideas are at once brilliant, challenging, and soothing, making this book good down-time reading and an excellent gift for a friend. I've read it several times, finding something new and moving every time. This is a very good edition of Meditations to have. The text is completely intact--not a selection--and the translation is clear and precise, but never boring. Maxwell Staniforth has done us all a great service with this translation of the last good emperor's journals.  Highly recommended 
 As a resident of Los Angeles I found Ecology of Fear a great and informative read. I understand those who review it and find things to quibble with. Nothing is perfect. But for someone like me, possessed before reading this with a feeling that so many things in LA were just wrong, but not having a good understanding how how and why things got to be so messed up in so many ways, Ecology of Fear is an indispensible book. Perhaps the greatest thing I took away from this book was an abiding sense of the "alternate reality" LA that perhaps exists in some other dimension-- an LA where greenbelts line the rivers, where the foothills are left undeveloped and able to burn seasonally as meant to, and where resources are more equitably distributed 
 This book is a thoughtful and well-documented antidote to libertarian and conservative propaganda.  It shows exactly how racial discrimination permeated every layer of public and private life in both North and South -- and lasted well into the 1970s.  Before the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and during legal racial segregation, especially under the GI Bill of Rights, whites -- especially men -- benefited immensely and blacks were either denied benefits or prevented from getting them by local bureaucrats.  This is proof that we have barely begun to correct the effect of racial segregation on generations of Americans. White men benefited from quotas in the past.  They want to lose no priviledges.  Libertarians and conservatives want to keep those advantages for themselves and deny fair competition to all those against whom they discriminated in the past.  Color-blind policies now simply perpetuate the unfairness of a color-segregated past 
 I have had so many of my music students buy and listen to this recording.  It is excellent.  The singing is clear with astorg character sounds.  Its the tye of CD that you try and emulate in all future productions.  A classic 
 The phenomenon that catalyzes - and paralyzes --  the Israeli-Palestinian conflict seems to be the riddle of our age.  By reopening this 1992 murder investigation, journalist Fox reveals how much wider a puzzle it is. Why has this patch of earth attracted so much political, cultural, and religious investment?      Investigating the murder of Dr. Albert Glock, director of the Palestinian Institute of Archaeology, Fox uncovers the key role Biblical archaeology, an opportunistic subdiscipline founded on the idea that the Bible is a true chronicle of history, has played in Palestine's tumultuous history.    Since the age of the Holy Roman Emperor Constantine, the field has been replete with religious charlatans and swashbuckling adventurers, generals and statesmen, all mining Palestine for biblical wonders to advance their own causes.  Fox calls this "negative cosmopolitanism", meaning the identification of many people with one place  -- the region's most insoluble problem.   Making the landscape fit the map has served the modern state of Israel, Fox claims, yet soon enough he admits his bias, writing that he "took to rooting for the Palestinian underdog."   Regarding the Hague Convention's 1954 prohibition of excavation in occupied territories, the author gleefully reports Professor Glock's circumventions, while reminding us "all respectable archaeologists" refrained from excavating, "except the Israelis." 
 I loved this book and this series, I couldn't put this book dow 
  they need to make a movie of this !!!  - 
 In the bright daylight of modern day it's with some difficulty that one attempts to comprehend the horrendously monstrous things that the Nazi regime perpetrated against some of their fellow human beings. Everyone has read books or stories about the Nazi atrocities committed against the Jewish people, but Ms. Pringle's highly researched book really delves deeper into the "Final Solution" of the Third Reich and details the acts of the  upper echelon of scientists and scholars involved in it.  All through this book I was wondering what could motivate seemingly "normal" people to devise and even participate in these terrible events? This even seems to be the author's final question about her own research. Probably the most striking thing about these events and the people involved in them is the fact that so many got away cleanly and continued to live normal everyday lives, some even going on to great accomplishments in academia.  For anyone interested in the WWII era or interested in the true underlying framework behind the Holocaust, I cannot more strongly recommend Ms. Pringle's book. Even for those like myself who have researched this area of history extensively, one can still be shocked by the almost unbelievably heinous motivations and actions of those who actually carried out the "Final Solution" 
 This is probably the most used book in my quilting library, both for researching the names of patterns I've seen, and for inspiration for new quilts 
 Rudy Baylor is a law student in his last year of law school. As one of his projects, he is required to offer free legal advice to senior citizens at the local nursing home. Little did he realize that he would meet Dot and Buddy Black who would present to him the lawsuit of all times, one that would make him a "Rainmaker". Rudy jumped right in and fought for the Black's son Donny Ray who was diagnosed with Leukemia and then later denied medical treatment by a large insurance company for no apparent reason.

 A balloon ride over Celesteville leads to Babar and Celeste deciding to turn in an abandoned train station into a museum in which they can display their great collection of fine paintings.  Everyone in town gets more and more excited waiting for the big day when the museum is opened and everyone can see everything that is hanging on the walls inside.  The paintings might be intended for the elephants and other animal friends of Babar and Celeste and this book might be intended for younger readers, but the readers who will most enjoy Laurent De Brunhoff's book are going to be those old enough to appreciate the witty elephant-inspired version of great paintings from Michaelangelo's "Creation of Man" and Sandro Botticelli's "Birth of Venus" to George Surat's "A Sunday on La Grande Jatte" and Edvard Munch's "The Scream."  There is just something intrinsically enjoyable about taking Leonardi Da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" and making the lady with enigmatic smile an elephant, and the idea of doing the same thing with Vincent Van Gogh's "Self Portrait" is hysterical since Babar is an African elephant and not an Indian elephant.  The more you know about great art the more you will enjoy strolling through the galleries with Babar and his family.  The book also includes a pull-out poster of the delightful art found in "Babar's Museum of Art."  The adventures of Babar have been delighting children for half a century and this is a charming addition to the series.  It should also inspire its young readers to check out the "real" versions of these great paintings so that they can find out what the adults are chuckling about as they enjoy "Babar's Museum of Art."  Is it too early to be thinking about books that would be great to give as gifts to young readers for Christmas?  This one should be high up on that list 
 Tony Joe White eats bubblegum pop artists for breakfast. If you're ready for your music collection to grow up, this is your guy and "Uncovered" is your cd. An often overlooked gem, Tony Joe White has returned with the most smokin' album of his career and he's brought along pals like Eric Clapton for this swampy, fantastic musical ride 
 This is a great book with some lovely layouts but what is not made clear that many of the ideas are copied into another book Scrapbooking Family Heritage by Creating Keepstakes 
 I've never liked poetry much because some of it is very hard to understand.  I adored Saul Williams' movie "Slam", and I stumbled upon this book by accident and bought it.  It let me explore emotions I didn't even know I had.  I love to listen to the cd that comes with it.  I played the cd on the long car ride home and I didn't even realize I had been crying until I got home.  Not only do you have to get this book, but keep your eyes and ears open for more to come from Saul Williams 
 The first thing I thought of while reading the book was how much is reminded me of Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides.  Obviously Solitude was written first.  What I loved so much in Middlesex (family history, foreign country), I grew to enjoy in this book.    What I think is crazy about the book is that the most frustrating parts of it the author included on purpose!  For Example, everybody has the same name regardless of what generation they are from.  The frustration of separating the characters was done on purpose to show much of the family's history and experieneces repeated.    Another frustrating thing about the book was that it would skip around chonologically.  This took a bit getting used to but became another example of the repeating of history.    I was equally impressed to meet someone over the weekend that had read the book in spanish.  I was VERY impressed.  This book was great but at times I felt it a bit dificult.  I needed a dictionary next to me while I was reading : 
 I would reccomend this film to any Robert Johnson fan as well as to anyone just getting into the blues who wants to know where its really at. It includes some great interviews with Johnny Shines, Robert jr Lockwood and others who knew Robert. Its worth it just to hear Lockwood play an unrecorded song of R.J.'s! The parts where Keb' Mo' re-enacts segments from R.J.'s life are well done and effectively illustrate what life would have been like back then for a traveling bluesman. My only criticism would be that there are few extra DVD features,however, that doesn't stop me watching this film again and again! A very informative insight into the life of one of the greatest Delta bluesmen 
 This is a wonderfully creepy movie.  One of my favorites.  
 Based on a true story; Location; Vietnam in The valley of the death. Lt. Colonel Moore leading 400 American troopers is surrounded by 4000 North Vietnamese soldiers.  Amazing combat scenes, costumes and weapons with perfect graphic authenticity, making this movie stands apart from all the Vietnam movies ever filmed before.  The casting, the dialogue and colors are amazing as well; not to forget the perfect acting of Mel Gibson and Sam Elliott.   I have seen all the war movies about Vietnam. In my opinion, `We were soldiers' is one of the best that came so far. From all the aspect described above including the historical side, this movie is a must own to all collectors of this genre.  
 This is a great book if you like exploring where science originates and how personal battles control the dominant paradigm. Sawyer traces the journey of ALH84001 from its discovery in the Antartic ice by Robbie Score to its place of fame as the first possible clue to possible bacterial life on Mars. Sawyer also includes the massive controversy at stake, the secrecy of the research, and the rush accompanied with going public with their findings. In addition, she explores the backlash against the claims of the McKay group claims and their attempts to explore every possible avenue of contamination. Bringing together scientists across the board from glacial geologists to chemical specialists, ALH84001 allows almost everyone in the scientific community to evaluate the possibility that Mars might have seeded Earth with microbacteria or vice versa and, thanks to Sawyer, you can too 
 Following a savage storm, a small group of people are trapped in a supermarket and find themselves in a world where bugs become huge predators meant on devouring us all. They realize that the world has changed and must band together in order to survive this new-born nightmare. Absolutely awesome creation by King. 
 The book is mainly aimed at valuation practitioners and MBA sudents. The book deals with 3 valuation techniques- DCF, relative valuation (based on PE, P/BV, PS multiples) and contingent claims (options). Great insights into determining key variables (PE, PS, P/BV) based on business fundamentals and pro and cons of using each approach. However, the book does not go into enough depth in CAPM and APT. The author assumes that the reader would have a fair idea about financial ratios, fundamentals etc.   The best part of the book deals with valuation of special cases like cyclical firms, brands etc. and how corporate restructuring affects value. It also provides great insights into valuation for takeovers and mergers. The author provides a usable framework for valuing intangibles in an acquisition target- what the different sources of synergy are and how to value each in a lucid framework. Overall, a good book to gain a firm footing in investment valuation techniques 
 Does anyone know about if the second page of the lyrics book is supposed to have writing on it? I was looking through it and it looks as though somone actualy wrote in the golden box on the second page of my lyrics book. Its writen in a blue sparkly pen. Was wondering if Utada herself wrote it, cus it dosen't look like a computer did it. Anyway it says shishunki in kanji wich means puberty basicaly. I got the album in japan on a trip this week. Just wondering if anybody had any insite. Thanks. Oh and Yah this album rocks. Shes my favorite Jp artist 
 My first Nuevo Flamenco CD and it's AWESOME.  Very upbeat and expressive.  The CD is great to work to because it's soothing yet catchy.  I caught my boss humming along with the CD while he was working...I own all of Johannes Linstead's CD's and still feel this is his best so far 
 Don Quixote is everything you could want and more from fiction.  Edith Grossman reveals Don Quixote's madness in full glory, and her Sancho Panza walks a wonderful tightrope between simpleton and savant.  This amazing book crosses all literary genres - satire, political/social commentary, epic, grand romance.  Cervantes' humor has a timeless quality that translates very well into today, and Grossman's translation nails his irony and wit right on target.  Grossman's Don Quixote made me laugh out loud often.  I listened to Don Quixote unabridged on audio narrated by George Guidall.  Guidall's performed hundreds of audiobooks.  This reading is his best of many I've listened to.  His Don Quixote and Sancho Panza are incredibly expressive and so different from one another it's hard to believe one actor is voicing both.  Cervantes and Grossman have combined for a masterpiece, and Guidall matches them with a terrific reading 
 this surely is the best piece of literature i have ever read (except when i bought it, it was a lot more expensive).  i can't wait for the movie 
 Are you wishing to take a break from heavy reading?  Want something short and sweet to kill a few hours on an airplane?  Then this book is for you!  Don't be put off by the original publish date - it could have been written this year.  A simple tale, simply told, of a delightful few characters and a rolling bookstore on wheels, Parnassus on Wheels is just a fun and uplifting little book to read.  No complex sub-plots, no surprise endings, just a simple story that is well told.  I enjoyed this book a lot, right down to the predictable happy ending.  It was a very nice break from the other stuff I've been reading, took only an afternoon to read, and I highly recommend it for what it is - a fun little story.  5 out of  
 It tells you step by step what to do and who to talk to and the different engineers you'll need along with percentages on prices. Hands down a great guide to getting real project built 
 Having just watched THE CONVERSATION for the first time, I must say that I am utterly stunned.  It is one of the best films I have ever seen.  And to think, I just added it to my queue on the off-chance that Francis Ford Coppola's other films in the 1970s would reveal some of the same mastery as the GODFATHER franchise.  Francis Ford Coppola is, indeed, at the top of his game in THE CONVERSATION and the director's own fascination with his own screenplay is evident.  While many have flagged this movie as a 1970s exploration of lies & secrecy stemming from the Watergate incident, ultimately this film proves to be a character study on one of the saddest and complex characters ever to have graced the screen.    The film opens up with a masterful long shot of a park in San Francisco, slowly zooming more and more on a character in the park, whom we later find out is Harry Caul (masterfully played by Gene Hackman in one of the best performances of his career).  Caul looks about him nervously as if paranoid that someone is watching him.  Of course, here we are, silently hovering above him, eavesdropping on Harry Caul's life.  It is the first of many such "voyeuristic" shots.  The plot soon becomes apparent.  Caul seems absorbed in following a couple as they walk around in circles in the park, sharing a conversation.  Gradually, it is revealed that there are several characters listening in with powerful directional microphones, all orchestrated by the able hands of Caul.  Harry Caul is one of the best surveillance men in the country and we learn that he gets paid top dollar to do what he does best--tail people, violate their privacy, and emerge with an audio tape of their intimate conversations.  Using the various recorded bits of audio, Harry is able to weave together a single master recording of the couple's conversation.  It is part art and part science.  Everything is going smoothly until Harry begins to listen to the content of his most recent assignment.  While piecing together the final tape, Harry discovers that his tape may lead to the couple's harm.  Despite his professional oaths to complete the job and tune out the content of the audio, Harry plays the tape over and over, further convincing himself that he may be responsible for something terrible.  The truth is that this has happened to Harry before and he has never gotten over it.  Try as he might to cling to the scientific and technical aspects of his craft, he is tortured by his knowledge.  As Harry begins to become more and more involved with his most recent assignment, he becomes involved in a horrible and sinister plot that exposes him to just the sort of surveillance he fears.  What follows is Harry's descent into madness.  Given the nature of Harry's profession, he is a paranoid person, incredibly secretive and constantly convinced that he is being watched.  The sad irony of this fact is that Harry's life is so guarded and closed-off that there is nothing for other's to spy on.  In fact, we (the audience) are the ones who are violating Harry's private life.  There is no pleasure in this voyeurism.  Watching Harry's sad life unravel is a painful experience.  And yet we cannot take our eyes away from the screen.  THE CONVERSATION grabs your attention from the top of the film and doesn't let you go for an instant.  Coppola's shots seem to purposefully mimic the movements of surveillance cameras.  The shots are left open, characters walk in and out of frame, culminating in the film's final shot--a perfectly timed pan (back and forth) across Harry's apartment that feels exactly like watching a surveillance monitor.      The twist at the end of THE CONVERSATION is shocking and mesmerizing--sparking as many questions as it answers.  If you haven't already seen this film, you must drop what you are doing and see it right away.  Gene Hackman turns in one of the best performances of his career, if not the best.  Normally, Hackman plays supermen who are supremely confident of themselves.  It is amazing to see his transformation here, a broken shell of a person, sneaking around in a plastic see-through rain parka.  Coppola's direction is amazing and his camera work is perfectly calibrated to match the mood of the film.  The effect of the "voyeuristic" shots is that we feel like intruders into Harry's world, eavesdropping on his private affairs.  And yet, as close as we are brought to Harry, the cold feel of the camera also serves to distance us at the same time.  I now have to see more of Coppola's work, but I can say that this is (by far) the best film that I have seen Coppola direct.  Buy it today; rent it; watch it.   
 This book changed my life.  I had tried FlyLady and loved the concept but just couldn't seem to stick with it. I decided to get Sidetracked Home Executives since that is what FlyLady based her system on.  For me, S.H.E. worked much better. I realized that FlyLady is for those who are disorganized because they're paralyzed by perfection; S.H.E. is for those who are disorganized because they're too easily sidetracked and/or just plain lazy (like me).  I have been using the cardfile system they recommend consistently for six months now -- and I didn't even fall behind when I had my second baby recently, which is the ultimate test of how well an organization system works.   If, like me, you're chronically disorganized because you always have a million things going on at once but never manage to finish anything, this book could change your life 
 Overall, we are very happy with this product. I like that it covers the entire side of the crib and doesn't come up only partway like a traditional bumper. Also, I like the breathable netting since baby can see out through it and since it "gives" a bit when baby pushes and kicks it. We have a nonstandard length crib (Babee Tenda), so we do have small gaps at each end of the rail, but we had read about this issue in another review from a Babee Tenda crib owner, so we knew up front we would have these gaps. These small gaps have not been a problem for us as our baby doesn't seem to want to stick her legs through the gaps in this location (I think it's difficult since she would have to lie almost flush with the headboard or footboard to do so). The white satin edge is very pleasant to look at. Overall I like this product much more than the traditional bumpers I have seen. 
 I had a Norelco AccuTrim Beard and Moustache Trimmer T765 for a little over a year before I lost the charger. After looking for one both in town (San Diego) and on the Internet, I decided to just buy a new trimmer all together. At this point, I began to do some research.   Originally, I looked exclusively at Norelco trimmers though my rational was solely based on name recognition. After reading many reviews and comparing prices, I decided to look at other brands as well. That is when I came across the Panasonic ER224S. The reviews for this product were overall excellent, and the price was appealing as well: only 5 dollars more than my old Norelco when bought at Best Buy.   Before we proceed, I should let you know that I am more of a beard growing enthusiast than a beard growing professional. While I have been growing a beard for about a year now, I don't now, nor have I ever had aspirations to have a ZZ Top caliber beard. With that said, for my needs, this beard trimmer does everything I could hope for.   This trimmer improves over my old Norelco in so many ways. The adjustment setter has 14 settings for a beard length up to 20 mm over the 9 setting my old Norelco offered, and the setting becomes locked once you power the trimmer on. There is an additional detail trimmer that offers the flexibility that my old Norelco could never offer, and it hides away when you aren't using it. The ER224S also allows you to operate the trimmer while it's charging. This was something that drove me nuts concerning my old Norelco. It's just as quiet as any other trimmer out there and in my opinion, it's the best looking trimmer you can buy. It simply looks classy.  It doesn't have a built-in vacuum, but I really don't see that as necessary. From what I have read, they most often break or the performance is sub-standard. In the grand scheme of things, how difficult is it to rinse out the sink after you are done? The trimmer is also rather easy to clean. And the manual was very thorough explaining the ins and outs of the trimmer.  In fact, the only con I can think of for this product is the rather large charger. However, I trim my beard 2-3 times a week, and the charge seems to keep for quite some time.   Overall, I am very happy with this purchase 
 This has to be one of the saddest books I've read in a while.  It's beautifully ironic.  This book comes along and laments of the conflicts of interests with the marriage of universities and business while I am learning to embrace that I can love to have money.  I graduated from the University of Southern California and had a sense that something was amiss in the university system.  Back then, I saw a university that catered strongly to the football program and felt like I was getting the scraps.  The football program brought in the money and with the latest successes some immeasurable advertising.  However, there was an uneasy truce of advancing education and earning money.  A university gets all excited about a new corporate sponsor giving millions to a department.  But what if the corporate sponsor stipulates that the money be spent on research for the advancement of the sponsor's own products?  Or that any breakthroughs from the research would be considered the assets of the sponsor's?  And what happens when a professor mentoring graduate students is an owner of a private company?  In the former scenario, the research would have a STRONG affinity toward saying something positive about the sponsor's product.  What department would say something bad about their sponsor even if research says so?  There's statistics that would be some bias.  In the second scenario, the spirit of research/education in a university environment is stymied and looks more like competing departments in a business or competing businesses.  Instead of open sharing of ideas at the local coffeehouse, students are making fake notes to disguise their research from each other.  In the final scenario, we may have a professor who only supports a thesis that supports his stock portfolio.  I recommend the book for anyone who is in the process of higher education or thinking of going in that direction.  It could turn your head.  There's a whole lot of research and data in this book that began to numb my brain.  I give the book 4 stars because it was difficult to read - perhaps more because of the revelation of the corruption of higher education.  It will make a lot of you sick.  
 This is a masterful work for two specific reasons: 1. It very realistically displays the depths to which Apartheid pervaded South African society.  It goes beyond the simplistic "Apartheid is bad" motif so easily turned out in Paton and Brink. 2. Gordimer is masterful--shame on those reviewrs who call it exclusive or pompous.  This is a tremendous work that has blended polemic with prose.  Had Mailer, Wolfe, or Brink written this, they would have been hailed genius: why should Gordimer face such scrutiny? A must read for anyone getting into South African lit 
 Hilts' readable book is the best introduction I know to the history and politics of FDA regulation.  That history, as Hilts retells it, is a spiral.  Clearly, there have been significant regulatory innovations since the days of T.R., and Hilts  takes us through the key turning points.  At the same time, the same core arguments about the virtues of regulation and the virtues of free markets recur.  Specialists will find some of the retelling oversimplified, and Hilts' own position (some will say "bias") is always clear.  Nonetheless, there is no better first immersion into these issues, a terrific foundation for more nuanced analysis 
 Marvin Harris' book, Cultural Materialism, is a must read for any student in the social sciences who intends to address issues of war and peace, environmental decline, and social justice. Written in clear, understandable language, the theory presented is compelling and fully relevant to the most pressing issues of today. The updated edition offers an introduction by Allen and Orna Johnson that "examines the impact that the book and theory had on anthropological theorizing." Compared to today's muddled and often unfathomable social theories-Cultural Materialism provides a practical and useful research approach relevant to any social issue and usable by those working for social change. Don't be put off by the title, the book and theory fully address all aspects of culture and in an evolutionally perspective. I particularly recommend the book and theory to those who work on environmental and social justice issues. Conservation biologists seeking to explore sociocultural issues, especially when addressing conservation planning implementation problems, would be well served appreciating the Cultural Materialist perspective.           
  Arthur Machen, master of the macabre, created something a little bit different in this book. Coming from a childhood background that left him lonely and prone to living in imaginative worlds himself, the main character here is exactly the same. Lucien Taylor, unable to attend Oxford because of a lack of money, "lives" in his father's library. He is particularly attracted to ancient history and magic and hopes to become a writer. This hope is crushed, however, and, with the help of Annie Morgan, a woman who loves him, he escapes into an imaginary world of ancient times. There he remains, totally self-absorbed (to the chagrin of Annie), until he is jolted back to reality after receiving a small legacy. He then becomes an opium addict, which causes his death. Machen captures the moods of his characters perfectly, and this is the best of his books 
 I am sure the book is great-the book was purchased for a gift 
 Hank Hanegraaf, president and CEO of the Christian Research Institute, tackles some very controversial issues that exists in some churches today.  The book focuses primarily on two churches: one in Toronto and another in Pensacola, Florida, plus several individuals, who all thrive on spiritually mystical, or perhaps more accurately, overtly sensational worship services.  The book carefully examines incidents of people losing entire control of their body, either by freezing still for hours, collapsing to the floor (also known as "being slain in the spirit"), laughing continuously or shaking uncontrollably.  It also addresses reports of questionable healing and prophetic messages allegedly coming from God.  It's no understatement to say that it's a very scathing commentary about this movement.  Just about all the key figures are discredited either by exposing fraudulent accounts of what actually happened in these services, or by accusing these people of inducing these behaviors by manipulative techniques, or by exposing their secret un-Godly lifestyle.  One significant example was that the head pastor of the Toronto church, who was married, later died of AIDS due to allegedly engaging in a secret homosexual lifestyle.  By far the best part of the book is the final section where he thoroughly discusses psychological manipulation techniques such as hypnosis, the power of suggestion, the use of strong peer pressure and exploiting one's expectations in order to gain some desired results.  Another very damaging point made by Hanegraaf is that all of these seemingly supernatural behaviors are also commonly found in Hindu rituals performed by gurus and these same types of manifestations can also be induced by secular hypnotists.  The book also covers the history of the movement, which really didn't start until around 1905.  I have only two minor criticisms of the book.  One is that it doesn't do an adequate job making it clear what worship should be.  He does brush over the topic with several Bible verses but I believe the that central point is missed. Worship is for God and not for man.  All believers must be focusing on glorifying God and praising Him for His majesty.  Laying unconscious on the floor doesn't do that, nor is a person walking around like a chicken, nor is a person quoting erroneous prophesy.  One example in the book quotes a prominent revival figure, Bob Jones, stating that, "I figure if I hit two-thirds [of my prophetic messages], I'm doing pretty good".  Of course if prophesy is from God, it should be 100% accurate.    The second criticism is that it should have made it clear that real healing and other miracles are still possible and believers should still pray for God's will in those matters.  Again these are minor points and I still highly recommend this book.  I would more accurately give this book 4-1/2 stars if the system allowed 
 What an amazing concert DVD! I stumbled across Kamelot almost by accident. I was listening to Last.fm streaming radio, and heard a few songs by them and was intrigued, so I bought the last two CDs. Holy [...], they were good, but even those didn't quite prepare me for this DVD. This is probably the best live performance I have ever seen. The sound quality is perfect, the musicianship is perfect, the energy is awesome, the theatrical effects are great. It simply doesn't get any better than this. The absolute highlight is the performance of "Abandoned", which gave me goosebumps as I was watching 
 Why we can`t wait is written in the same style as all of Martin Luther`s writings. It is rhetorical and gripping. It states clearly and leaving no room for doubt the requirements of the [Black] people and the forms of their oppression. It is a fairly short book (A bit over 100 pages) and can be read within a short space of time giving a powerful, if slightly repetitive idea of why he was moved to fight for the rights of his people 
 I graduated from law school 14 years ago and had taken professional responsibility as part of my course work. Unfortunately, the ABA had thought it good to revise the rules a couple of times since I took it.  Plus, I've not practiced law during this period.  This book and DVD were the only preparation I used for the MPRE. I got a 121 scaled score -- more than enough to be admitted in my jurisdiction.  Your mileage may vary, but I'm very pleased. 
 Ataturk may have been a dictator; brutal and vicious in his forceful transformation of Turkey from a weakening Ottoman Empire, to a Westernized nation-state, but today, he is Turkey's national hero; the father of the Turk.  From a rough childhood, to joining the military, Mustafa Kemal stands out as different. Some liked him, but many did not. He possessed leadership skills, and knew how to put them into good practice. His courage and celebrated fortitude cannot be overlooked.   Ataturk may have ruled with an iron-fist; brought to an end the longest lasting empire; and Westernized Turkey to the extent of perhaps causing an identity crisis, but he wanted a Turkey for Turks.   Ataturk the dictator; the hero.   The author remains objective to the best of his ability, and gives us, the readers, the chance to make a final judgment. I enjoyed the book. The chapters are short, and not at all boring - at least for me. I would recommend it to those who are interested 
 I thank Lederman and Hill for making me aware of how nave was my simple notion of symmetry. Very likely, few scientists outside of physics had more than an inkling of what symmetry means before having read this book. The word" symmetry" connotes something to most of us, but few of us recognize symmetry to be the linchpin for what is (or might not be). "Exhilarating" best describes my new appreciation, as I re-read parts of Symmetry, my notes, the authors' notes, and my notes on their notes...and to feel the satisfaction that derives from dissolving each little bit of ignorance in physics. 
 i spent the entire summer of 2006 starting in about may thru till november reading the left behind series in its entirety from the rapture book onwards. (i already read the rising and regime previously).  i finished glorious appearing on november 18th. i read other reviews on this book saying bad things about it and i have come to 2 conclusions:  A. the people that gave bad reviews ARE NOT BORN AGAIN CHRISTIANS but unbelievers who have no spiritual clue as to what the book is all about -  thus their erroneous reviews on the  book !  B. the bad reviewers are born again Christians but they cant accept the fact that Jesus will return again to the earth and sentence to hell all those who take the mark of the beast (antichrist) ! these type of Christians want to believe in a jesus that fits their mentality - however it is not the Jesus of the bible - THE TRUE AND COMING KING!   having said all that. let me tell you i was so blessed by God reading the whole left behind series during the summer. if you ever want to understand the book of revelation,reading the series is one of the best ways to do that. the authors have done a fantastic job weaving futureevents and a storyline together. dont believe all the bad reviews! those bad reviewers couldnt find a good Christian book even if i gave them a flashlight!   this book predicts what will happen in the battle of armaggedon - the antichrist and devil lose! and Jesus and his army wins! to win - one must confess Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior , and NOT TAKE THE MARK OF THE BEAST - IN THE NEAR AND/OR FAR FUTURE!  that is the whole premise of the book - which side will you choose?  will you be a winner or a loser?   God bless you - JESUS LOVES YOU - JOHN 3:16   AL    
 I wanted it for my collection, however you can sift through all the youtube stuff and end up with the same video for free if you want to do the work 
 Rachel Corrie's communications in the weeks preceding her death, herein collected, are among the most elegant of testimonies to what is best in the human spirit.  Rachel wrote, as she lived, for what counts, with precision, passion, and single-minded devotion 
 I love the Halloweentown movies. Every year, I couldn't wait for October because I knew the movies would be on the Disney channel. Now, I don't have to wait. I can watch them anytime that I want. For having two movies on one disc, the quality is amazing. I've never seen Halloweentown so clear before. The Halloweentown movies are perfect fun for everyone, no matter how old or young you are. It has monsters but it's not too scary for little kids. It has fun and action for the older among us. The only thing about the movies that I found lacking was the absence of a commentary track by at least one of the cast members, specifically Kimberly J. Brown. As it stands, I give Halloweentown/Halloweentown II - Kalabar's Revenge a four. You should get it here, though, as it's terribly difficult to find in the stores 
 Their from authors who teach us the truth.  Only Disney changes them and makes all the endings happy.  Happily Ever After-that is a fairy tale all in itself.  I read this when I was 6 or so.  I felt said for her too like every one else did.  I tried to save a dumped kitty in this horrible snow storm.  I don't think she made it so I bought this book to comfort me. I'm 42 and when it snows I imagine the older sick people with hypothermia and a late bill for heat.  That is creul.  I think that this book makes you understand death is not cruel, the people are. Death is a  better place to be, rejoiced and released of suffering.  I think it should be for teens.  Not for anyone younger, a good way to start to learn sympathy and empathy. You can not deny this happens 
  Some dismiss this movie as a chick flick.  I frankly don't see it.  My anti-chick flick sensors didn't activate once during multiple viewings of this film.  This is an intelligent, witty, camp film that I seem to find something new to laugh at each time I see it.  It definitely helps if you are fan of Shakespeare (read English major) like I am.  The action centers around the Rose, one of the leading theaters of the period and the set they use is authentic and despite its simple nature invokes the power of theater.    The casting is inspired and each actor sets his teeth into their role with relish.  You can't say too many good things about this cast.  Judy Dench is brilliant as a gnarly old but savvy queen Elizabeth,  Joseph Fiennes is great as a floundering young Will Shakespeare and  Geoffrey Rush is inspired as the tight rope walking theater owner William Hensley.   The story line has enough twists and turns to freeze your attention waiting for the next near disaster to fall on top of Will and Hensley whether it be a cuckolded duke, a blood thirsty loan shark with a taste for the theater or the malevolent master of the revelers.   Easily among the top ten films that have been made in the last ten years. 
 Frances Roberts has taught me how to sit at Jesus' feet and listen.  Her inspired interpretations of what God would say to us in any given situation are timeless.  I recommend this book as a gift to any believer for encouragement, or a non-believer, as an introduction to their heavenly Father 
 Ella.  In this world of 36 Mafia do I have to say more 
 Peter Parker (Tobey McGuire) is having a hard time balancing his priorities.  Thanks to his secret identity as Spider-man, he's lost his job, his grades are failing, he's lost his best friend Harry (James Franco), and he lost the girl of his dreams, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  While he still sees these friends occasionally, Harry is obsessed by his desire for revenge on Spider-man and Mary Jane has a new boyfriend.  Things are even a struggle for Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), who can't seem to pay her mortgage.  All this is enough to make Peter rethink his superhero ambitions.  And, since he seems to be losing his superpowers, maybe he can put everything behind him.  All this couldn't come at a worse time, however.  The brilliant Dr. Octavius (Alfred Molina) is conducting a dangerous experiment with fusion.  When it goes wrong, he winds up with appendages wired into this nervous system, giving him four extra arms.  The arms also begin to control his actions, and the newly named Doc Ock soon becomes a danger to the city.  Can Peter pull himself together to save the day?  I loved the first movie, but this one isn't as good.  They tried to replicate the emotional impact of the first movie, but it doesn't ring as true here.  In fact, the emotional story slows the movie down in places.  Frankly, I don't go to see superhero movies for lots of emotional story telling.  Some is fine, but they went a little overboard here.  But the movie is still entertaining.  The action sequences are great.  The entire cast does a great job again.  And the special effects have improved since the first movie.  There are only a couple times I can even tell that it's not 100% real this time.  The climax was weaker then I would have liked, but I am willing to forgive that.  This may not be as entertaining as the first movie, but it is still well worth watching 
 Simply put, Waylon Jennings undoubtedly was the greatest outlaw cowboy singer that ever lived. His history, actually having been present and almost done in on "The Day the Music Died" when Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper and Richie Valens told Waylon, who had a cold, to take the bus is legendary and astoundingly prophetic. Afterwards, Buddy Holly's tinker toy plane ditched in the throes of a North Dakota Artic like night when crystal like ice permeated the atmosphere and contaminated their survival like a runaway cobra in a Bombay marketplace. Waylon went on to greatness and on this CD, songs like Mammas Don't let Your Babies Grow Up to be Cowboys, Are You Sure Hank Done it this Way and Luckenbach Texas are indescribably ingenious in their presentation and quality. You have Willie Nelson duets (Waylon and Willie) that are outstanding because to put it bluntly, Willie is no slouch either. Waylon, with his syrupy and very demanding and forceful vocals coupled with guitar finesse and his sheer presence as a man who has lived through it all, evolved subsequent to that fateful and disappointingly tragic day in the late fifties when those rock and roll fans who sensed that something affecting their futures like a bullet to the heart perceived that Waylon would be the scion to carry all of it on, realized that Waylon was not only country, he was iconic and unique to the point of an infinity-like fabric. My recommendation as a CD Reviewer of some prominence is for you to build a library of Waylon Jennings Cd's. Waylon was not only a pioneer, he was simply the best.

 If you are a golfer, read this....gives you a new appreciation for the game and people that play it.   It looks so different on television... 
 If you want a CLEAN - CRISP -SUCCINCT- COMPASSIONATE  and POWERFUL way to feel inspired about WHO YOU TRULY ARE then this book provides the answers! For me, Abundance Intelligence (AQ) serves as the accountability litmus test to keep me awake, responsible, and passionate! This book is a winner 
 Why is this CD out of stock?  Some of my favorites include Catwalk, En Vogue, and Copa Cabana.  Please get it back in stock!  Thank you 
 I am on a strict high protein diet so this was a very good book as it lists protein amts. for tons of foods.  My one complaint is it seems to list almost all pre-packaged or restaurant foods.  How 'bout a chicken leg you make or a hamburger not from Burger King?  I'd find it helpful if that type of info. were included as well 
 This is an excellent (and well-written!) case study of bringing a popular product to market with infomercial marketing.   I liked it so much I read it cover to cover, which is rare for me.   I am recommending it to all my students at copywriting university.   Emphasis on marketing, typical business production/legal issues, plus very motivating on persistence while being an entrepreneur. I liked the testing details, copywriting and media buy numbers.. very eye-opening to me, and extremely insightful.  
 Watson's classic text was written before the more modern age of "topologically flavored" arguments. Consequently, much of the presentation may appear to be a bit ponderous, relying on explicit calculational detail when that is no longer strictly necessary. By now many  points can be deduced "by pure thought". However, the text gives  a very complete and deep view of Bessel's functions. Because it "does  everything" it is also a fine and practical way to learn complex  analysis in the style of the "old school". If you just can't  stand older style writing, you should probably look at Olver's book on  special functions. If you can tolerate the old style, buy this and have  many (many, many) hours of good fun and insight 
 An amazing analysis of the perceptual principles involved in film viewing.  Arnheim provides a fascinating and scholarly look at the psychological and physiological aspects of cinema. A profound and thought-provoking work 
 There is, throughout Terry Pratchett's "Sourcery," a somewhat sorrowful tone being struck amidst the high spirited comedy and dramatic saving the world (again) sorts of action.  Because, at the heart of this story of how a most magical being, one whose very existence could unravel the fabric of the universe, is a scared and cruelly tormented little boy. That Pratchett keeps this in mind, and indeed, makes his salvation just as important as saving the world, is a credit to his skills as a writer and heart as a person.  The eighth son of an eighth son is a wizard. And the eighth son of a normally celibate wizard is a sourcerer, a living font of magical energies. But it's slightly more complicated than that: a father with a grudge against the magical establishment, a magical establishment (the cast of Unseen University, alternately pathetic and for once frightening) that's hungry for power, and a chain of events that quickly gets out of control all hurtle this story towards disaster.  Along the way, we get introduced to the daughter of the greatest hero in Discworld's history, who just desperately wants to be a hairdresser but finds that some things are just in her blood. We also pick up a very unlikely barbarian hero and a literary minded monarch and his fabulous pleasuredome. And, of course, the magic-less wizard Rincewind and his animate Luggage make a triumphant (well, as triumphant as Rincewind gets) return.  "Sourcery" is Pratchett's most heartfelt novel to date, and he puts the characters ahead of plot or jokes -- although there are plenty, especially concerning Conina and Unseen University -- and it makes for one of the best Discworld novels to date.  Strongly recommended 
 I bought this book after studying PHP with the author's online tutorials.  They covered quite a bit of what was in the book but I enjoyed the online version so much, I decided to thank him for putting a free online version out on the net by buying his book.  In addition, I like to have the hard copy for a reference.  Excellently written and one of the clearest and easiest programming books I've every read.  It is also one of the few programming books I have read without any programming errors in it 
 A basic protection item you should have.  Does not appear to be multi-coated, as the more expensive Hoya filters are, but clearly worth it.  Fits the Nikon 18-55mm ED perfectly and allows the Nikon lens hood to fit well 
 Earvin Johnson a.k.a Magic is a regular guy who is a nba legend who has aid, that' s what we all know, but at the reading of this book i found out, Earvin the man , how he felt when he found out he has aid , how much he got respect for other NBA players like Michael Jordan or Larry bird, it's a very interesting book,..., just buy it and enjoy it 
 The reading is not as accurate as the oral/underam/rectal thermometer, but given that it is next to impossilble to hold my one year old down long enough to get his underarm temperature reading I found the Braun Thermoscan to be really usefull.   One thing to keep in mind is that the readings vary in a range of .5 degrees over a couple of readings. So I tend to average it out and if the temperature is at or over a 100, I also double check with the underarm thermometer. It's a very convient device and you can take your childs temparature when they are sleeping or distracted. The only problem is that the readings are not very consistent. i.e if you check your childs temperature a number of times, the readings you get will have a range of about .5 degres 
 Some women want to strangle models, but most people don't actually go that far. That's not the case in "Blood and Black Lace,"  where models run, scream, and die in all sorts of gruesome ways. Mario Bava's classic giallo has some monotonous moments, but mostly it sticks to stylish slayings.  Just before a fashion show, the model Isabella is found dead in a wardrobe. The police investigate the fashion house's various models and managers, but can't find any solid evidence. And during the show, one of the other models finds Isabella's diary, which is loaded with scandalous information about drugs, lovers, abortions, and debts.  But then the diary is stolen, and trenchcoated killer waits until the models are alone -- and then he burns, strangles, drowns, and claws them. The police suspect the men -- designers and managers -- at the fashion house, but even detaining the suspects won't stop the gruesome murders...  At first glance, "Blood and Black Lace" seems like just another bloody slasher movie. Well, giallo is to slasher movies as fine cheese is to Velveeta, and "Blood and Black Lace" is a perfect example of a giallo, with the arty lighting, graphic violence, colourful sets, and of course those black gloved hands.   The plot is a pretty straightforward whodunnit -- it's not blatantly obvious who the killer is, but seasoned movie fans can probably guess. And while there are gruesome slayings, the killer doesn't just jump out and kill. Bava builds up the tension and fear (which the characters also demonstrate) until it's almost a relief when someone dies.  But one of the biggest necessities for a giallo is visual style. The fashion house is lushly palatial, and the murders are elaborately choreographed chases, with weird lighting and lots of luxurious surroundings. The second murder, for instant, is like hide-and-seek in an antiques store. The only problem is a misogynistic edge, such as when the women have their shirts ripped halfway off.  None of the characters really stand out much -- they're the Models, the Creepy Boyfriends, the Skeptical Police, the Weird Landlady, and a handful of others. So it's a credit to the actresses like Mary Arden and Eva Bartok that they are able to make us feel sorry for their characters.   "Blood and Black Lace" is a beautiful, bloody guilty pleasure, and a perfect example of a giallo horror movie. Good stuff 
 Peter  de Krassel's book is a beam of light through a pitch-black series of essays on our present time in history. His viewpoint serves as an indicator that illuminates understanding for how we arrived into our contemporary drama and provides impetus for embracing recognition of a global community. Includes opportunity for amazement and many good chuckles, as well as a view of Hong Kong that we ordinarily are not privy to experience from our receiving end of the media's voice. Inspiring and challenging with a delicious sense of connectedness served with humor and sensitivity beyond outrage 
 I fell in LOVE with the LYTE when I first saw Lyte As A Rock. I was amazed that she stepped up and claim her throne in the hiphop industry. She definitely has not been recognised like KIM or Latifah, but her influence to the game would never be surmounted by any other female MC. "Eyes on This" is definitely a classic hip hop album. Its like the Female "ready to die". She showed that the ladies were capable of being way better in style and lyrics than some men. Her attitude and flows and themes were so amazing that I paid so much attention to whatever she was saying. The L-Y-T-E is the undisputed "QUEEN", "DIVA", "GODDESS" of hiphop. She is the female RAKIM definitely. Keep on doing ya thing 
 My husband and I did a similar thing to David's family--we skipped out on our "happy perfect" lives in a quaint New England town, to give rough and tumble Dublin a go.  We've never looked back and David's book is the one we'd write, if we had his eye for a story and his talent for telling it.  This man knows of what he speaks, when it comes to capturing the expat life in an accurate and compelling fashion.  I am amused to see the American reviews focus, I think, somewhat overly much on the negative sides of the Monagan adventure.  If they didn't have mistakes and dark encounters, what stories would they have to tell?  Living in Ireland, I read those stores with both recognition but awareness of the hugely compensating postive sides of what the Monagans did.  If you have any interest in what it is like for an American family to live in a foreign country, and you want to hear it "told straight", run to buy this book. I read loads of this genre and this is definitely one of the better selections (along with Paris to the Moon by Adam Gopnik) 
 Crystal Method showed us their skills as DJs in addition to producing on their 2001 mix, "Community Service",  They're back at it with this offering, and they don't disappoint!  Rising stars like Evil Nine and Elite Force feature alongside "names" you may recognize like Koma + Bones and Meat Katie.  The breaks are relentless, not slowing until the final cut, and the track selection and transitions are excellent.  The disc is worth hearing for several reasons:  Like their last mix, TCM serves to expose you to new talented producers that you might enjoy hearing more from.  Also, this is the place to get the unreleased Crystal Method track "Kalifornia" (which has a dark, urban feel similar to the style of both Vegas and Tweekend), as well as their awesome rocking remix of the Doors' "Roadhouse Blues" and a respectable take on New Order's classic "Bizarre Love Triangle".  The only down moment comes in the form of the final cut, New Originals' remix of the Smashing Pumpkins' "1979", which borrows extensively from the original without adding anything special or new, and is also the most subdued track on the mix...a necessary come-down from the beats? 
 This is a great childrens book but also great for young adults. It is a wonderful story about the apprentice becoming the teacher uing strength and courage to overcome troubles 
 Have you ever thought you wanted to learn how to program, and bought a book on programming that didn't teach you anything?  Or maybe you took a class that had a required textbook that was worthless?  Did you get discouraged, and think programming just wasn't "for you"?  That maybe you just didn't "get it" like those other people that seemed to have no problems learning to program?  If so, then this book is for you.  If more computer programming books were written like this, I KNOW there'd be a lot more programmers in the world.  It's not about intelligence, it's about LEARNING STYLES.  This book is more narrative than just lines of code to interpret.  John Smiley talks TO the reader, not AT him.  He puts you in a classroom setting where people ask questions, even DUMB questions that you yourself may have wanted to ask.  And guess what?  He ANSWERS the questions.  If you've been stymied in one way or another from reaching a point of confidence with programming then this book is for you.  I give it 5 stars because that's the most that Amazon's system will let me give it.  If you don't believe me, hit the library.  Then buy the book to put food on this man's table, and have this awesome book in your personal library 
 'The Untold Story' is purportedly based on a true story. If that is indeed the case, this film is one of the more horrifying endeavors I have had the pleasure to witness in all my years. Even if it is not, this still quite a film...  Herman Yau directed this HK horror masterpiece masterfully. Anthony Wong (as Kai) gives one of the most convincing psycho performances I have ever encountered (at that's saying a lot)...  The story is a relatively simple one (albeit very effective). At the outset, Kai and his boss have some sort of monetary dispute involving gambling and cheating. An argument ensues, at which point Kai than proceeds to go sickhouse, and kill the man... Fast forward 8 years...  Kai is running a restaurant. Mysteriously, the previous owner and his family are nowhere to be found. As the police and various people begin to inquire about how Kai came into ownership of the restaurant, the questions begin to pile up (as do the missing bodies)...  Kai, being witty as well as psychotic devises a clever and creative way to dispose of the various bodies that he has created. By the way, don't eat the 'pork buns'...   Eventually the local police (who are portrayed as silly, Police Academy-esquire buffoons) become suspicious, leading to the arrest and eventual imprisonment of Kai. Torture and brutality ensue, culminating in a coerced confession presented beautifully and horrifically by Yau...  Much has been made of the violent and wicked nature of this film. Perhaps I am jaded, but I did not find this film to be gratuitously violent. All of the violent and wicked acts depicted were in context, and served the purpose of showing what a monster Kai is..  This may sound like a rather simple film. Plotwise it is. However, the story was well-constructed, and Yau's capable direction keep things moving forward engagingly so. This is a captivating and enthralling story, all the more incredible because it allegedly happened. If you love a good true crime/horror story (and are not of the squeamish variety), you will most likely find this to be a fascinating and well-done film... 
 Greek village life has been disappearing rapidly over the past 30 years as the actual villagers have died off. But this study was made over 100 years ago, when villages were thriving with thousands of people, and the direct connections between their religious and cultural practices and their ancient ancestors as shown in this book make it an incredibly important and truly invaluable historical document 
 Harvey's last novel (In A True Light, his first after the ten-book Charlie Resnick series), left Nottingham for London and New York. This very good new book returns to familiar environs, with the majority of the action taking place in the Midlands, including Nottingham (Charlie Resnick even has a cameo walkon) and the Cornish coast. The protagonist is a familiar type for Harvey, Frank Elder is a retired Detective Inspector who left the police force to lead a hermit's life on the coast following the end of his marriage (the details of this are laid out in a short story called "Due North" which has appeared in several anthologies, including Crime in the City). He lives in a small cottage and is haunted by gruesome nightmares, as well as the knowledge of his wife's adultery and his lackluster performance as a father to their teenage daughter.   Also haunting Elder is an old case from 1988, a brutal rape and murder committed by a pair of sadistic men who may have killed another teenage girl who disappeared at the same time. The parole of one of the men spurs him to leave his hermitage and start poking around the cold case of the missing Susan Blacklock. Much of the book alternates between Elder's investigation and the parolee's fractured attempt to make it on the outside. The parolee disappears at the same time another teenage girl is murdered, and Elder is brought into the investigation as a consultant. Most of the book proceeds in the typically tight and angst-ridden prose that characterized Harvey's Resnick series. The procedural angles are all covered very well, and Harvey does an excellent job of peeling away the layers to get to Elder's inner fears and disappointments. His awkward relationship with daughter is handled very well (the father/daughter relationship drives the plot of In A True Light), as his is uncertain romance with a middle-aged woman.   There are two flaws in the book, neither major, but enough to keep the book out of the superb category. One is Harvey's succumbing to the unfortunately tendency of crime novelists to make their plots and villains intersect with the hero's friends and family. It gives nothing away to say that's what happens here, and the result cheapens the story. The other flaw is the unnecessarily pay-off of Elder's nightmares, which are revealed as being exactly prescient. This introduces an odd quasi-mystical element to an otherwise entirely gritty and realistic story, and serves no good purpose. These are minor bumps, though, and Harvey's fans and newcomers will find plenty to like about this fine crime novel. Elder returns in Harvey's next novel, Ash and Bone.   NOTE: The American dust jacket of this and In A True Light are terrible--they are garish and completely fail to convey the tone of the novels. It's a mystery as to why they don't just go ahead and use the art from the UK editions, which is much better. 
 This book should be on the reference shelf of anyone designing or evaluating logos. It is compact and packed with information on shapes, images and symbols from the perpectives of cultures around the world - from  prehistory forward. It is illustrated and cross-referenced. Grab it several  time throughout the design process to make sure you are on target with the  symbolism inherent in the shapes and images you are using in your designs.  Great value 
 I just read the review from S. Haus, and I believe she missed the meaning of this book.  It is entertaining and informational.  It is not meant to be a "How To Primer".  It is an observation of how modern conveniences can be integrated into the colonial style house and not ruin the original quality of the home.  It is also a historical view of how these homes have evolved through the years. If she were familiar with this author, she would know that many of her works offer a historical chronology of how architecture and furniture styles have evolved.  I personally loved the book as well as the book "Bungalow Style" and have sent dozens of copies to my relatives and friends as gifts.  I believe that when Mr. and Mrs. Haus move to Boston, they should invest in a decorator instead of a book if they want historical accuracy without being "too dark" 
   This is an incredible piece of work, absolutely integral to any collection of anyone who has an interest in the Dadaists or Surrealists.  Ernst's intuitive juxtapositions create an intirely seperate and complete logical (or illogical, depending) world of lurid mysticism and dread.  Though not without a sense of humor.  If you like this, also check out (if you've not already) the work of Joseph Cornell and the writings of Lautremont.  
 This collection of short stories was absolutely amazing. Those who may be interested in purchasing this book need to understand that this is a collection of short storied and NOT a novel!!!   I was introduced to some amazing Latina Authors and now I am hooked. Thanks ladies. I loved it...  
 This is an insider's look at USC's breathtaking 2005 season in which the Trojans won their 35th straight game, landed a 4th straight BCS bowl game, 3rd Heisman Trophy winner in the last 4 years, and much more. Highlights of every game, including big road wins at Oregon, ASU, and Notre Dame, lead up to the National Title game against Texas State.   The 2005 Trojan team may not have been the greatest team of all time, as ESPN touted in its hyped build-up to the NC Title Game, but this DVD shows why no other college team has even come close to USC over the last 4 years. Great for any fan of college football! 
 The storyline and acting were great. The premis was too funny, and Geroge Hamilton did a superb job playing Dracula. Though I had seen it in the theater when it was released, I watched it with a friend who had never seen it, and he thought it hillarious 
 Works fine though every odd time I will come across one that is not perforated completely...it happens I guess. Overall, I am very satisfied with the product 
  This book is a remarkable feat of scholarship, especially in its ablility to remain highly readable despite its scholarship.  We find here a very human portrayal of a man struggling to literally embody God, and, despite the scope of such circumstances, we are oddly able to empathize with Jesus. He confronts his extraordinary situation, paradoxically, as an ordinary man.     The spareness of the biblical style helps us forget the author and the complex theological and historical weight that the story carries.  We are able to focus on the personal, day-to-day, hour-by-hour inner life of Jesus, the man.     If you expect quirks and controversy, forget it.  If you expect either a born-again, hysterical excitement or a ponderous intellectual examination, take a pass.  But, if you are looking for an intimate look at the plausible humanity beneath the religeous and emotional furvor, then read this book.     Mailer's account is particularly comprehensible to the 90's mind in that he allows us to see Jesus coping consciously with the dangers his "celebrity" as a miracle worker begin to pose.  In our celebrity conscious, media saturated time, we are perhaps more ready to appreciate the "crowd-control" aspects of the story of Christ, and the practical and psychological impact that those factors must have had on Jesus' day-to-day decisions.     So how can a jewish author in the 1990's create a plain spoken text in biblical dialects that becomes an exciting "page turner" even though we all know from page one exactly how it is going to turn out in the end?  No matter how unlikely, Mr. Mailer has accomplished that feat.  Read it with an open mind and your mind will open still further.         
 It's a pretty decent book and has some suspense but you see where it's going about 3/4 of the way through.  If you're interested in policework and Native American culture and lore it's a good read.  I would have liked more supernatural aspects with a title like "Skinwalkers" though......  If you're a cop, like me, prepare to be a little annoyed by the lack of realism in a few law enforcement aspects; but then again, isn't that almost always the case!? The fact that it involves Tribal Police does add a redeeming (interesting) facet.  
 The farther we get from Larry Niven's original Ringworld book, the more the central characters evolve and change, just as the Ringworld itself changes.  Not only do we learn more about the nature of the Ringworld itself and how the interference of many protagonists has changed (and almost destroyed) it, but we learn how the natives have changed as well.  For me, this is the essence of science fiction, and it's a pleasure to watch a master at his craft.  Nivin's writing, too, has changed over the last 35 years, which is hardly surprising, and his readers' tastes have undoubtedly changed, too.  Larry has other, newer things to say today, and they're worth reading.  You need not have read the previous three books, but might be a good idea; the Ringworld books tell a complex story, and if it's been a while since you've read them, it certainly wouldn't hurt to do a bit of review.  Larry updates his slant on technology, but he does it in a way that weaves it into the previous books.  This may jar some readers, but it has, after all, been 35 years.  Recommended 
 I had more fun reading this book than I have had reading in quite a while. It was informative, intereseting, and educational.  It's been about 4 months since I finished the book and I still find myself reflecting on some of the lessons learned.  I had very little previous knowlege of psychology.  I reccommend this book to anyone interested in how the human mind works 
 This is the book to have if you need to implement group policy in your organization or even if you just want to find out how group policy really works. There is nothing out there like it.  I can't tell you how many hours I have spent pouring over Microsoft Technet documents and other technical publications - reading a paragraph here and a paragraph there, in order to produce just a piece of a solution using group policy. This book has everything you need written in a fresh and interesting style. It is the first technical book I have read cover to cover -and I have been in the business for over 15 years 
 Barnes and Noble, Circuit City, Cat's, Sam Goody, Best Buy, all of these stores are filled with thousands of CDs, and I find Clannad at Wal-Mart of all places? Thrilled as I am, it's still a bit of a shock. I had only seen Clannad albums online, and downloaded MP3s of their music before finding and immediately buying this collection. All who have taken any interest at all in the new age genre (those of you who will be reading this review) are already familiar with Maire Brennan, and most because of her more famous sister, Enya. Clannad seem to be in themselves legendary for international celtic music. Enya probably heads that particular genre in the mainstream, but may be bested by Maire and Clannad in talent. Personally, I prefer Clannad's music AND Maire's voice to the more symphonic Enya. The best tracks on this album seem to be the often acoustic ones, such as "Many Roads", "I See Red", "Coinleach Ghlas An Fhomhair", and others. My favorite song on the entire album is unquestionably "Skelling". A true celt talking about the viking ships and a "King of the World" suits me just perfectly. As for a comparison between Enya and Clannad, here's what I would tell you: Maire's voice is very defined, she has her very own sound, whereas Enya sounds like there are three or four of her singing. Maire's voice is stronger, louder, and definitly more personal.Clannad's music is more pop-oriented, complete with horns, acoustic guitars, keys, slow drums, etc. It's much more interesting in aspects of a rock or pop album than it is a relaxation tape, which is basically Enya's style. If you enjoy new age at all (Will Ackerman, Acoustic Alchemy) then let Amazon.com ring this one up for you right now. It's a great listen 
 This book consumes the reader with its ideas and its poetics. It is Apocolyptic literary fireworks, man. Morgan Rainey, the warped Jehovah. Rhienhardt, the suffering Judas. Geraldine, the sacrificial Virgin whore.  New Orleans tranformed into a Dantean Inferno, a Boschian landscape of  demonic avian fascists, lecherous, dragon like, regal homosexuals like  Lester Clotho, shimmering toothed Hollywood vagabonds and ice-evil  Capitalists with frozen souls. This book is pure inspiriational genius. A  60's morality tale that reads like an insane, surreal masterpiece hybrid of  Conrad's & Chandler's novels 
 book came promptly and was in excellent condition.  Thanks 
 Like a fictionalized "Sacred Blood," this is a disturbingly fanciful mystery about what could have happened if the evil Dr. Mengele's bizarre experiments had worked out to the Third Reich's advantage.  Simply told, it is reminiscent of his storytelling in THE STEPFORD WIVES and is an enjoyable read, especially if you haven't yet seen the movie version 
 I was very impressed with the on screen chemistry of Cate  and Giovanni Ribisi in the  movie "The Gift" so I was delighted to find them both appearing in this movie. The plot concerns a  justice seeking killing which goes wrong and Mr. Ribisi's character throws away his everyday life as a Police Interpreter to be with Cate's character and then they are on the run from the law. The silences between sentences in this movie speak volumes and Cate gives us an excellent performance in a not so glamourous role and Mr. Ribisi is as close to perfection as an actor can get. This movie is also enhanced by the stunning Italian vistas. Bravo to all for the making of this excellent and most thought provoking film 
 This book had a lot of technical stuff, but I still really enjoyed it.  I'm more excited by the new book by Osama Bin Laden's mistress, Kola Boof--"Diary of a Lost Girl".  I've read an advance copy and it was absolutely stunning.  I think her portrait of Bin Laden and his inside world should be widely discussed by the Bin Laden experts.  She really shows a new side of him and his friends and family.  I just found it so fascinating and detailed and marvelously written.  
 If you're one of King's constant readers you will agree that The Talisman was all King.  Black House seems all Straub.    The narratvie reads like a screenplay, which at times is drudging.      You look and look and sometimes you find King, buried in a sentence here and there ... here and now.  But (and here I'll use Black House style of narrative) as we float over Straub's neighborhood, and as we float over the Safeway, which  seems to have a sale on toilet paper, we reach Mr. Straub's home.  He is scratching his head with one hand while the other tentative hand is resting on the keyboard of his computer.  He's stuck.  He can't seem to come up with the next sentence.  Then he 'flips' and there is King, next to him, and he whispers into Straub's ear, and Straub has the next sentence.  So as we read Black House we know it's Straub, but the haunt of King is evident throughout the novel.  It's Straub's writing style, but it's King's imagination.  Oh, and the DT tie-in's are executed masterfully 
 Kids can certainly relate to all the bad things that happen to Alexander and they understand the importance of each. From getting gum in his hair to a cavity to not even getting the pair of tennis shoes he really wanted, children can commiserate with his woes from their own experiences. This book is a great reminder that even though as an adult we may think it isn't a big deal, to a kid it's a major bummer. (And of course, tomorrow is another day, so things may not be so bad afterall. 
 Far Tortuga is one of the finest works of fiction I have ever read.  Had this book been written a hundred years ago, we wouldn't be comparing Matthiessen to Conrad today (as happens often), because Matthiessen's writing is so much better.  This book's prose is mytho-poetical, gorgeous, and shorn of everything that is not necessary (unlike Conrad's heavy-handedness).  Even though we (ironically) live in an age of some fine writing, the frenzy of life and the vulgarity of taste of most people is such that a book like Far Tortuga comes along, gains some readers, gets some good reviews, and is forgotten.  It's not Matthiessen's fault; it's just that anything today of real quality is noticed by fewer and fewer people.  Far Tortuga is a dream.  Please read it, you won't be disappointed 
 If you enjoyed the movie, you'll feel the same for the soundtrack. Nicole Kidman has a beautiful voice and does not disappoint. The blend of old songs with new is truly enjoyable to those of us who heard them all in their day 
 A young man is beaten to death in an alleyway at night. The plot thickens when his identity is discovered: Jason Fox, a leading light of the Albion League, a thoroughly unpleasant extreme right racist fringe group. As DCI Banks and DC Susan Gay piece the details of Fox's nasty story together, their lives complicate in other ways. Susan is embarking on a relationship with Gavin, a colleague from regional HQ. Meanwhile the state of Banks' marriage is going from bad to worse as is his relationship with his boss Chief Constable Jimmy Riddle. This book, whose British title is `Dead Right', didn't seem to me to be quite as good as its predecessor `Innocent Graves' but is nonetheless another pretty strong and worthwhile procedural from Robinson. 
 A spectacular book everyone should have the pleasure of reading 
 I was always taught not to "recite" prayers, but that really isn't a problem with this book of prayers. Sometimes I read them for the comfort, or say them aloud to ask them of God. I especially liked the ceremonial prayers in the book. It seems a minister could use this as a reference book. And the "Prayer for Amends to the African American" and "Prayer for Amends to the Native American" are both wonderful prayers that all of us should say. Marianne Williamson is true greatness 
 This is fantastic journalistic-style fiction that has all the elements of a great book:  gambling, Vegas, murder, sex, and the potential for personal ruin.  This book is ostensibly about the murder of Ted Binion and the sex/money scandal surrounding that.  This storyline is what sucks the reader in, but McManus quickly abandons that story for a much, much more fascinating one about playing in the World Series of Poker, held at Binion's Horseshoe and founded by the Binion family.  McManus was sent by Harper's magazine to cover the Binion story, but he's a cocky poker player himself, so he puts his welfare and relationship with his wife on the line by taking his entire advance and playing into the World Series.  Knowing that McManus has his own money on the line, and he's not funded by the magazine to make a good story, makes this journey absolutely amazing.  McManus teaches the reader how to play poker and gives the basics of the poker masters' strategies, so that the reader is able to play along with the highs and lows of the game.  McManus even finds himself playing against people whose poker books he has read, so he knows what they taught him and the rest of the world about poker, which makes for interesting mind games at the table.  I would love to give this book 5 stars, but there is some material in here which really should have been edited out.  McManus goes off for pages about how he knows David Sedaris or the illustrator of Me Talk Pretty One Day, or some other fact that is unrelated to the book and serves only to prove how cosmopolitan the author is.  He also gives not only his childhood story, but that of his father and grandfather, and I found those to be very trying chapters that distracted from the high paced action of the book without adding any real meat to the story.  This is a great intro to poker, and McManus gives the reader enough info to get them intersted in the game, and to know what books and software to check out if they want to start playing.  I highly recommend this book to any non-fiction lover 
 After a rocky start in the late 70s and early 80s, the Eurythmics focused all of their talent and experience to produce the defining moment of their career.  The most memorable point in this moment was the video for "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)."  During the baby stages for MTV, most of the videos were cheesey and embarrassing.  A few artists were so cool, though, that they stood out among the rest.  The Eurythmics were one of those; they truly raised the standards for making videos.    Beyond the videos, the music on this album is what's really important.  With "Sweet Dreams" and "Love Is A Stranger," Annie's bitterness about love is surrounded by Dave's pulsating synthetic beats and soft, dissonant laser chimes.  By just listening to these two songs, one would think that the Eurythmics had become a full-fledged New Wave synth band; and there are certainly other songs on here to appease that taste ("I've Got an Angel," "I Could Give You A Mirror").  But, the band refuses to be categorized.  Several songs are textured by Dave's sleek guitar licks, adding some blues ("Wrap It Up") and even a tinge of latin ("This Is the House").    From beginning to end, "Sweet Dreams" flexes its muscles and relaxes, then flexes again and finally sighs with the brilliant "This City Never Sleeps."  In fact, there is not a dull moment on this recording.  While most of the albums from the eighties New Wave craze have dated and fallen into novelty, "Sweet Dreams" will remain one of the definitive albums of the genre and decade.  Truly a one-of-a-kind Masterpiece 
 Fabulous book for my 8 and 4 year old children.  It captures the culture and daily life of specific children from around the world.  The photos are vibrant and captivating. The text is intermixed with the photos, allowing my 4 year old to maintain his attention span - and they are able to compare their lives to that of the children in the book.  Simply put, it takes me and my children to exotic (and not so exotic) places from the comfort of our sofa 
 As someone who reads and reviews dozens of books on food and farming each year, I highly recommend Grub. Where else can you find a great read, cookbook, and party planer, all rolled into one?    Very rarely does a book as complete and engaging as Grub: Ideas for an Urban Organic Kitchen, make it to the mainstream. Grub, as defined by the authors,  Anna Lapp? and Bryan Terry, is "healthy, local, sustainable food for all... food that supports community, justice, and sustainability." Blending a healthy mix of information, analysis, and scrumptious recipes, Grub is the ideal kitchen, classroom, or bedside companion for all things food. Part 1 is a well-written expos? of the industrial food complex, replete with revealing graphics and information. Part 2 features a diverse cookbook that champions seasonal and whole foods, from vegan to carnivorous options.   The most exciting part Grub is its underlying objective: to build community around a just and sustainable food system. Grub provides a guide to throwing "Grub Parties," complete with recipes and discussion guides, making this book not only a fantastic catalyst to taking the next step in rescuing our food system.   If you are going to buy one book on food or farming this year, Grub is the one to get.  Ryan Zinn Organic Consumers Association 
 One of the best books of poetry I've ever read. Each time I pick it up I am newly astounded at the elegance and beauitfully contained passion of these poems. Encompassing a summer of growth, change, and conversations with God in the original Holy place, a garden, this book is well deserving of its Pulitzer Prize, and of being read many times over 
 Ray Kroc's success story is quite a record of persistence and achievement. He didn't invent the McDonald's chain (as many erroneously believe) but he knew a winner when he saw one and he negotaited to buy the business. He truly believed that McDonald's could be a huge, global operation if it was promoted right and run with an emphasis on quality, customer service, cleanliness, and value. These four attributes made the acronym "QSCV", and it was something that Ray Kroc preached to his people every single day.   Ray Kroc shows his confidence throughout the book, not just with business, but also in his personal life. He pursued his business dreams with unmatched vigor, and he was equally determined to reach his personal goals. His relentless courtship of Joni, his one true love, is one of the highlights of the book. It's fun listening to Kroc spill his heart out, telling the reader all sorts of details about his personal life. He was absolutely ga- ga over his beloved Joni, and he shows no embarrassment in admitting his feelings. Here was a man who had the world in his hands, a senior citizen who was head of a large corporation, and yet he was completely, hopelessly in love and willing to give it all up for his number one lady. He was having trouble sleeping, and couldn't concentrate on work anymore. He was like a starry- eyed teenager, always in a daydream- like state, fantasizing about the woman he loved. He was prepared to do virtually anything to capture her heart.   Kroc was an outspoken and egotistical man, and these personality traits pop up throughout the book. He blew his top several times, when things didn't go his way or when someone would make a negative comment about McDonald's, and he could often be quite profane and a little vile. This was true in his other business ventures as well like when his San Diego Padres baseball team (he was the owner) wasn't performing up to par. There was one episode, in 1974, when the Padres played miserably and Kroc let them know exactly how bad they were. It was the home opener, and at its conclusion, Kroc grabbed the public address microphone and harshly criticized the players for such a lousy performance. The media jumped all over the incident, but Kroc was undeterred. He gave no apologies, feeling that the team was letting down the fans and deserved to be chewed out.   One place where Kroc didn't let his ego get in the way with smart business was with the naming of the restaurant. He decided to keep the original name, McDonald's, rather than using his own name. This was a wise move, especially considering Ray's last name. Would you want to visit a restaurant that was named "Kroc's"? Just the name alone would make me lose my appetite and it was a wise business decision to keep the original name intact.   This book shows occasional dabs of humor and some good writing. Kroc and editor Robert Anderson both deserve credit for making the book more enjoyable to read with its easy- flowing style. It's not awash in humor, but there's enough to help keep the book interesting. One criticism that I have of this book, however, is the layout; specifically, the fact that the chapters have no titles, which is inexcusable. Titles are helpful for reference purposes, and they should have been included. If Ray Kroc didn't realize this, then the editor should have. Other than that, the book is well- written and partically error free from a grammatical standpoint.   Kroc tells his story with gusto and pride. You can tell that he's very happy with the McDonald's company and gleaming with satisfaction over the way his personal life and professional life have turned out. This book was written in 1977, and much has changed since then, both with McDonald's and with fast- food in general. There are far more choices in fast- food today, like submarine sandwiches, which had not yet achieved a substantial share of the market back when Ray Kroc wrote this book. It's hard to say how Kroc would have reacted to these modern- day changes in the marketplace, but I'm sure he would have welcomed the challenge.   Many people don't prefer McDonald's food, but the man behind the arches, Ray Kroc, is a person who deserves respect. His tenacity was unrelenting, his confidence was unmatched, and his drive to succeed was unstoppable. He took a small, roadside restaurant in California and transformed it into the world's largest fast- food chain. "Grinding it Out" is a testament to the difference that one man can make when he has guts and determination to be the best.  
 An interesting book giving a snapshot of one family every generation from 1066 in Sussex, England. Although the BACON family were from East Anglia, their travels took them to York in 1190; Scotland in 1304; France in 1320; Agincourt in 1415 and finally to America in 1640. Each chapter has a context / comments and a notes section. There is also a comprehensive bibliography and index. I bought the book because I also have BACON family in East Anglia, and I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to read a generational snapshot of an ordinary family set in the context of national and international events 
          If you have ever felt that feeling of not being good enough or the insecurity of feeling not wanted, you might relate to this book's main character Miri. Miri is small and can't work in the quarry with her father and sister. She gets little importance out of handling the family's trade and she wants to do more and know that she is needed. The town counts on the quarry to keep it going and get them enough money to trade. That chance to prove herself comes at the Princess Academy, where the fancy "lowlanders" are going to try their best to make a mountaineer worthy of marrying the prince. An inconsiderate witch gets the job of trying to make them worthy.  Although this book's title may be deceiving and make people think it is a fluffy story of romance and happily ever afters, it's not. Miri has to fight to make it to the top, she has to stick with who she is, and she has to get over her feelings of inadequacy in order to get what she wants. She gets rejected and is lonely because of fighting for what's right. I really like this book because I think everyone can relate to feeling not good enough at one time or another. I easily went through this book because of being able to relate to it. Plus, Shannon Hale's way of writing is very captivating and makes you want to keep going. People from junior high all the way to high school could enjoy this book. It's and easy read, but it has good principals also.  Princess Academy will probably be the most misunderstood book because of its title, but as they always say, don't judge a book by its cover 
 This book has inspired me to market and sale my own books. It has also provided me with information and resources to publish my own books 
 This book tells the story of a woman scientist who I had never heard of.  Her work on DNA is only a part of the book.  She died of ovarian cancer in her late thirties.  The book suggests that she might have married a fellow scientist, Don Caspar, had she not become ill. The science is accessible and held my interest.  Maddox by no means paints her as a saint but presents both the positive and negative.  It sounded like she may have been arrogant at times but she certainly had no picnic in making her way in science in the fifties.  Very moving story 
 I switched from coffee to tea a few months ago, purchased this unit and am completely happy with it ... I can't recommend it highly enough.  It's well made, ergonomic, well thought out, and a joy to use.  The Japanese think of everything.  A Japanese friend of mine told me that homes in Japan almost always have one of these units, or one like it.  Now that I drink only tea, I can understand why.  The three temperature settings (well, four if you count boiling) are perfect.  208 is good for herbal teas, tissanes, and also the increasingly popular (and wonderful) Rooibos.  That's also a good temperature for ramen, oatmeal, etc.  195 is good for black tea and also oolong, and 175 is good for green tea or white tea.  Now, you can make gourmet tea properly with no muss and no fuss.  Just get yourself some gourmet loose tea, herbal tea, or Rooibos, (all available from Garrett, Adagio, or Teavana), and a convenient brewer, like "IngenuiTea" from Adagio (Teavana also makes a good one that might be slightly better in quality), and you will be good-to-go!  Your taste buds will thank you and so will your body.  (The health benefits of green tea and oolong are well-known, and also Rooibos has 30-50 times the antioxidants of green tea, and no caffeine).  My blood pressure has dropped 20 points with less caffeine (compared to caffeine in coffee, black tea = 20-25%, oolong = 10-15%, green = 5-10%, white = 1%, rooibos and herbal = 0%).  Buy a Zojirushi!  You won't be disappointed. 
 I enjoyed this book.  I loved the flow of the story.  He did a wonderful job in developing the Dr. Cook character to be likeable although many of his actions were unlikeable.  I thought this book was the best book that I have read so far this year.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading books with some suspense 
 I loved Tintin as a child, hadn't read them for years, an thought I'd buy the complete set... I love them still now! I have a different appreciation of them now, but still think they are some of the best Graphic Novels/Comics/Sequential Art ever written/drawn! The English translations are brilliant with a lot of thought having gone into them, they are not just word for word copied from the French. I strongly recommend for anyone with a sense of adventure 
 This book is enormously helpful to asana students AND it does justice to Yoga's spiritual background as well 
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book! The character development was well thought out, the plot was superiour, and the entire book held my attention from beginning to end! It's also nice to see a lesbian main character go through  "real life" 
 I think the book is fun to read, yet I wanted something that related more to the show. However, I have an interest in gemstones and the book goes into detail about the use of them as well as candles and herbs.  So, it's interesting and fun, but may not be exactly what you want if you're more interested in the show 
 I bought one box of this and my entire family tried it. It has since become a staple in each of our three homes.  Great taste, with or without sugar 
 Makes thin krumkaker the way a Norwegian likes them.! The ability to select color intensity is very nice - but you need to know what to look for! Too hot iron will bake thin batter faster than you expect. First time use, pay attention, but then you are set.  Very convenient, easy to clean. This iron has become my best friend, since I can serve delicious krumkaker in no time. Well worth the money 
 Billy Cobham, Alfonso Johnson, Tom Scott, Steve Khan (and a young Mark Soskin on piano) - really, what more be said. These four artists all qualify as board members of the founding fathers of electric jazz. Together they meld seamlessly as though this band had been a long term project and not the "one time only" act it was. I own it on vinyl and the only slight downside was the live mix. All these players have gone on to grow artistically and produce brilliant works, arguably more profound then what's on this album - but the magic lies in the mix of wonderful creative responses to each other, a rare and spontaneous spark that was thankfully captured on tape. How many times have you been to a live performance and walked away saying, "Man, I wish I had a tape recorder for that one!" Well, think of this as a chance to go back in time and get that recording of a world class group, totally jamming it out, right during the time in musical history when fusion reigned king - and these warriors were riding at the head of the battalion 
 Penelope Stokes weaves her story through several peoples lives and you feel like you get to know each one personally.  She will have you go from laughing to crying from one chapter to the next.  This is a definite must read for everyone 
 A fictional account of the myth of Eva Peron that delves into the latin desire to make icons out of humans. Evita is the quintessential rage-filled femme whose ambition still provokes the world, and at least her native Argentina. Her dying wish was to never be forgotten and in the years since she perished in 1952, it has been fulfilled over and over again while her embalmed body rests in peace in the Recoletta cemetary of Buenos Aires 
 I found this book to be informative and easy to read. I practiced the exercises in it and have noticed an increase in energy and alertness. Suddenly people are making "you look so young" comments (I'm 60 years old) and my 95% grey hair has actually gotton a bit darker (my hairdresser even commented on it). The book is a quick read and the exercises only take 10 minutes a day. It is well worth it 
 Delroy Lindo puts in another great performance, the cast is generally very good and here Spike Lee finally gets off the soapbox for a change.  It's just straight bio of sorts, a simple story about a simple family going through some hard times, populated by many memorable characters.  Very high reality quotient, nice blast from the past i.e. the Suckin' Seventies.  
 I have few DVD's because I will only collect what is meaningful and will be replayed. This is a favourite. It is funny, moving, and you must watch it carefully for all the nuances of black comedy. Peter Sellers was a wondeful comedian and straight actor 
 I've always been a big fan of Dams' Dorothy Martin series, but was late coming to the Hilda Johansson mysteries. Now I think I actually like them more than the Martin books. In this series, the reader is transported back to the turn of the century and experiences life in South Bend Indiana through the life of the protagonist Hilda Johansson, a maid in the wealthy Studebaker household.   In Crimson Snow, Hilda's brother Erik's teacher has been murdered, and the police are not having much luck, or maybe not trying too hard to find the killer. Erik initially gets Hilda to snoop around the case, but when a close friend of the Studebakers is suspected of involvement, her employers ask her to seriously investigate.  This book is perfect for fans of historical mysteries as it is based on a real case that to this day is unsolved. Many of the chapters are headed with short quotes of various news articles about the murder from the South Bend Tribune. Also, the research for this book as well as the whole series is impeccable. The reader gets a taste of what life was like not only for the servants, but also the family Hilda works for as well as society as a whole.  Readers who enjoyed watching the BBC's Upstairs Downstairs series should give the Hilda Johansson books a try.  
 ...and a good CD for background music during quiet times,or falling asleep times.If you are into gentle,spacy kind of music,then this is for you 
 This is a classic tale of a company run into the ground because it had two CEOs and two different departments fighting one another for the juicy bonuses. Moreover, the CEOs had totally different characters and a completely different business vision. One was extrovert, overambitious, jealous, profoundly selfish, impulsive, volatile, dominated by lust for power, vindictive, an intriguer. The other was rather introvert, cold, too trusting, apersonal, a bad communicator, self-centered, rather an intellectual aristocrat.  The introvert was ousted by the extrovert, who wanted to run his own show.  The house of Lehman was divided in two different clans: the bankers who were rather fixed on medium and long term business with stable clients and the traders who were only fixed on the short term. While the introvert CEO could stand above both business divisions in the battle for the bonuses, the extrovert was himself a trader and was rather despised by the bankers. When the latter took the rein, key banking personal left the company. The traders wanted to cash in their shares as quickly as possible and the company was gobbled up by a third party.  This story shows also that `human relations matter as much as the bottom-line.'  A very worth-while read. 
 I've watched a lot of television in my 28 years. I've read newspaper articles, seen press conferences, and listened to radio interviews. But I never realized the deliberate steps those people were taking to get their message across.  I had no idea that there was a thought process behind how often to plug your new venture in a radio interview (as opposed to a newspaper interview). I didn't realize that you should address a T.V. reporter differently (and more often) than reporters in other media. And I certainly didn't think about the methods used to create those "talking points" we hear so much about these days.  I'm not sure this book prepared me to immediately jump in front of the cameras. But, it caused a definite shift in my thinking. This book is an important first step for anyone who is naive about the effort required to effectively communicate with the public (via the press). It's also vital for those who are cynical about preparing for interviews, or worried about "selling out" for the purpose of gaining attention.  This book could easily be subtitled "How To Respect Your Audience." Mr. Walker spends a fair amount of time explaining that when you don't properly prepare yourself and your message, you do a huge disservice to your audience. I recommend this book as a primer in dealing with the media.  It gives lot of techniques with examples.  But, most importantly, it explains the rationale for each tip.  Because all the techniques, tips, and tricks in the world won't help you if you don't firmly understand and believe in the power of preparation 
 Back in the 80's when I was about 7 or 8 years old, this 2 part movie came on TV and we recorded it, of course it was on Beta back then.  I totally fell in love with this movie.  After I only saw it once or twice, I wasn't able to see it again for the longest time because my family lost the tape and TV never showed it.  So I was wanting it for years and finally in the late 90's, like 98 or 99, I just happened to look in the Disney store and saw both Alice In Wonderland (1985) and Alice Through The Looking Glass (1985) and I bought them right away.  They were on VHS but it doesn't really matter because I love them so much.  To this day, at 27 years old, I still love this 2 part film and never get bored of it.  I have watched many other versions of Alice In Wonderland and no other version has had an Alice as good as Natalie Gregory or a white rabbit as good as Red Buttons.  Even Ringo Starr is in this version.  I totally love that rabbit costume and back in the 80's, you can tell, or at least I can tell how much work the director put into this film.  Since 1985, other versions haven't shown as much detail and work like this version has.  Even the roses in the rose garden looks real.  I do hope one day, they will release this 2 part masterpiece on DVD because my tapes have gotten a lot of use in the last 5 or 6 years.  If you own any Alice In Wonderland, own this 2 part one because this one puts every other version to shame!! 
 This game is a great game where kids can have fun and learn how to count, add, and subtract money all at the same time! This is great for kids of all ages 
 (Fourth in the Debutante Dropout Mystery series)  Oh no! Andrea "Andy" Kendricks's favorite dude (a.k.a. boyfriend) is missing! Brian Malone was last seen at Dallas' popular strip joint, The Men's Club, trotting behind a hot blonde, supposedly to land a lap dance for his buddy Matty. That's the story anyhow. But truth be known, Andy's beau was seen sneaking out the club's back door with same said blonde, who was only wearing a flimsy, crotch-length robe, and he hasn't been seen or heard from since.  I don't want to give too much away, but Brian better have a good explanation because Andy and her posse (her socialite mother, Cissy; Brian's law colleague and ex-girlfriend, Allie Price; and Cissy's new man-friend, Stephen Howard) are gonna hunt him down like a dog to see what nonsense this straight-laced guy is up to.  Such is the basic plot line from Susan McBride's Night of the Living Deb, the fourth installment in the Debutante Dropout Mystery series. McBride is at her best in this midnight caper that's a cross between the elegance of a Cary Grant movie and silliness of an Abbott and Costello movie.  Andy drops fewer clothing-designer names but hones in on pop culture, which made it easier for the non-fashionista like me to relate to. Also, readers get to know Andy a little better since her passion for painting is revealed. Andy's internal and external voice is flawless, and McBride has sharpened that comedic timing that is so difficult to emulate, especially on paper.  Night of the Living Deb is fun, smart and sassy. It's a great way to break the mid-winter blues or the perfect paperback to pack for that spring vacation.  Armchair Interviews says: This book is a hoot 
 This book explores the forgotten reality of human history from the source. Genuinely educating book 
 I am a First grade teacher and this book compliments my Math series at school beautifully! I am currently using the "Investigations" program in Math, and this book really allows for the children to see the different kinds of buttons and how the little boy sorts them. This book is a good introduction to any lesson about sorting 
 I wanted this Bible for Mother's Day after I did not get it I ordered it on June 25 and got it rather quickly.  Enough said about the wonderful shipping time with Amazon Prime.  I normally do not like Bibles that do not have the words of Christ in red but this Bible is sensational.  I love it!!!! I like the way it gives an overview of each book of the Bible.  The colorful maps and illustrations make this Bible beautiful.  At the end of the Bible there are 365 memory verses to be learned each day.  So not only is studying emphasized but learning scriptures is also emphasized.  This Bible is wonderful for individuals who are new to reading the Bible.  I would highly recommend geting this Bible as a gift for a new convert or seasoned veteran in the Gospel who is interested in in depth study.  Reading this Bible is fun.  
 This is my first Deaver/Lincoln Rhyme book and it is making me go back and read the others.  It works as a stand alone, although I am looking forward to seeing the genesis of the characters in the predecessor works.  The inner circle around Deaver, especially his former model/lover/eyes and ears are well-developed with personalities that interact well.  Rhyme is wheel chair bound and, like Nero Wolf, solves crimes from his NYC apartment.  He is a former crime scene investigator, so that is the thrust of the sleuthing.  In this novel, a thirteen year old black girl from Harlem who is bright and on her way out of the ghetto, gets wrapped up in a series of crimes through no fault of her own.  There is plenty of plot twists and turns and misdirections to make any mystery fan wrapt.  There is also the solving a post-Civil War crime that needs to be addressed.  Mr. Deaver's young ghetto character is convincing in voice and demeanor, even to the point of chiding authors who don't really know Afro-American speak.  Based upon the mystery alone, this is a good book.  What separates it from much of this genre of CSI is the almost non-stop action.  It seemed as if every ten pages there was another action scene or tense moment.  This constant intensity made a cerebral crime scene analysis into a thriller-like page-turner.  As noted, this will happily lead me to Mr. Deaver's earlier Lincoln Rhyme books.  Highly recommended 
 A student gave me this book. Now I assign The Israelis in my university sociology class and students -- Jews, Christians, Muslims and Buddhists -- love it. It's lively, balanced and fascinating. The best book about contemporary Israelis I know.  Israelis of very different backgrounds -- youth, high techies, soldiers, Jews, Moslems, Christians, left and right wing -- tell me this is THE most outstanding, accurate and up-to-date book written about them in years. My colleagues in Israel, Germany and Japan are assiging it too.   The Israelis focuses on ordinary people, not the politicians. It smashes stereotypes. No better way to understand the many types of today's Israelis, from very modern to very traditional. And half of them are women.  No matter who you are - university or high school student; priest, pastor, immam; Israeli, Arab; tourist, business person, or diplomat - you'll read and REread THE ISRAELIS.

 Five Stars doesn't do this fragrance justice. It is the most amazing scent, fresh, light, and clean.( In my opinion everything a fragrance should be) It is truly Lovely... 
 This is the funniest cd i have ever purchased. I just started listening to them on the radio (KSHE 95, 94.7 FM for those not in the St. Louis and surrounding areas) and their skits are the funniest skits you could ever hear. When I found out that they had a greatest hits cd out i immediately rushed out and bought it. When i put it in my cd player, i couldn't take it out 
 Def an Awesome album, one of the best for 2005!!  I Really wish that Man Up would had beem released on the regular CD, so that more people could hear it. Man Up is the best track on the dual disc and one of the best on the "regular" cd, whatever you want to call the part of the disc that only plays in CD players. My favorite tracks are 1 Thing, All I Need, Touch, Talkin' About, Rolling Down My Face, Can We Go, 1 Thing (Remix), Why Don't We Fall In Love (Remix), and Man Up (Feat. Nas) 
 This book was filled w. excitment ever since u opened the first couple of pages. When Lani is being forced to leave b/c of her grades she tries hard to get them up and overwhelms herself. A stress related riding crash and excuses not to get back onto her favorite pony cause a dispute among friends. When Lani shows her dad that she really belongs by putting together a rodeo day fundraiser w/ a famous pro rodeo star to give money to a charity. Will it ever work? This book kept u on the edge of your seat constantly flipping the pages:- 
 There's a new Queen of New York and her name is Zya Miller.  After being left destitute when her boyfriend, Jules, is locked up, Zya does the only thing she knows - hustling.  A gram here and a gram there quickly turns into an empire, an empire to rival that of the late Anari/Tony, the former Queen.  Mo' money, mo' problems.  As Zya is doing big things and making major moves, she garners some unwanted attention.  Will Zya crack under pressure or reign supreme?   Authors Ashley & JaQuavis undertook the challenge of incorporating some plot elements from their previous works into this new plot.  It paid off.  I did have a few nagging questions, but not enough to distract from the story at hand.  Ashley & JaQuavis present characters grappling with loyalty, trust, revenge and life in the game.  The biggest struggles, though, occur not between the opposite sides of the law, but instead within each character.  To trust or not to trust?  To kill or not to kill?  To love or not to love?     The evidence proves it...Ashley & JaQuavis are a talented and formidable team with fresh ideas.  Supreme Clientele is packed with drama, twists, deceit, and gun-play (not to mention some attention grabbing sex scenes) that will captivate its audience.  This is definitely a worthwhile read.

 Elizabeth Berg never lets her readers down. She shows a depth of understanding of young women and their feelings as they grow up.  I bought this for my daughter who is a young mother; as she unwrapped it, she exclaimed, "Wow mom, I didn't know there was a new Elizabeth Berg out! 
 Imagine yourself driving a convertible on a bright sunny summer day down route 1 on the coast of California. This is the atmosphere Govi provides with his music - a sense of outdoors, of freedom and breath. With interesting rhythms and orchestrations, this recording was made for you to sit down, relax and put a pleasant smile on your face. Simple, beautiful, unpretentious, a success! 
 I loved this book. I needed an quick read, easy to navigate, marketing information for a new business. After reading this book one afternoon I quickly learned new information as well as refreshed my memory on other  important and critical marketing principles. I keep this book next to my  dictionary in the office. These are the two books I use the most when  writing and designing dynamic attention ads and new client generators 
 This book is a great read--helps to understand the tribal origins in the Middle East and presents an amazing woman 
 Great album. Maybe their best stuff. Aja is great...but it strays from what the band is all about. And that is rock and roll for the average moron hater 
 "Peach Trees" and "Memphis Skyline" are two of the greatest songs ever written.  Everything else on the album is very good, except for Old Whore's Diet, which is sort of silly.   
 I was impressed with both the quality of the pictures and the authenticity of the story line.  The pictures provide a realistic representation of Nam and the author tells his story well to make the book interesting for young readers.  It would be a good companion text to a history unit about the Vietnam War 
 If you don't know the person for whom you're buying a gift, well get them this. It's laugh-out loud funny even for someone who doesn't read much or who has never heard of Twain 
 As a person who believes uncovering past lives (and communicating with the individual found) is nothing more than communicating with evil spirits, my  rating of four stars is awarded purely for the entertaining nature of the  story told.

 It's nice to see that there are many fans around who still appreciate what a masterpiece this album was. I grew up a big, big fan of Alice's first band, who were incredibly talented musicians as well as powerful songwriters. People forget what an important player guitarist Michael Bruce was in those days, but if you look back, you'll see his songwriting credits on all the biggies from that era.   Having been practically weaned on Alice, I found it as sad to see this band break up as I imagine it must have been for fans of groups such as Pink Floyd or Van Halen. Sadder even still was watching Alice become less of a musician over the years and more and more of a shock rocker, and knowing that younger generations would never be aware that he had once made some truly remarkable music. Although there were a few flashes of brilliance in his solo period (most notably on 'Welcome to my Nightmare' and 'From the Inside'), there was nothing, to my mind, that ever came close to the stuff that was put out on Love It To Death, Killer, Billion Dollar Babies and School's Out.  To me, however, School's Out was the pinnacle. Not as hard rocking as some of the others, yet delightfully sprinkled with touches of various musical influences ranging from jazz to Broadway musicals, this was the opus for Alice and company. Interestingly, the title song, which was Alice's biggest solo hit with this group, has always been my least favorite. While I do like how it sets the theme of the album, I've always thought that things really kicked off with the second track, "Luney Tune," which is a neatly packaged song about losing it that has what is arguably their tightest song-ending ever. "Gutter Cat," "Blue Turk," "My Stars" and "Alma Mater" are likewise among the band's best tracks, and the closer, "Grande Finale," makes a fitting finale indeed for this particular piece of music.  I agree totally with one of the earlier reviewers who lamented that School's Out has not yet been digitally remastered. If there was ever an Alice Cooper album that would be suited for it, School's Out, with its extensive musical range, is definitely the one. The day that happens, I'll be sending for a copy, and pronto.  Mainstream Alice fans, this might not be to your taste. It's pretty experimental, and there's a lot less rock and guitar work than usual. However, if you consider yourself an Alice Cooper fan and are into musicianship and songwriting, than this should definitely be in your library. 
  "Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,      Till Earth and Sky stand presently at God's great Judgment Seat;"  R. Kipling       East, and West:  Russians are accustomed to referring to Russia as the East, although, as one thinker said, "our spiritual, political, and cultural centers are not in the East. Furthermore, even if we belong to the East, it is the East of Europe that we belong to. And if the real East and the real Far West can meet, the meeting of two parts of the unified European culture is all the more natural."    Russia & West Europe: After the reforms of Peter the Great, when Russia returned to Europe, the relationship between Western Europe and Russia became so tight that the European WWI, led to the 'Russia catastrophe'. Russia was already part of Europe, and its collapse resulted in degeneration of many European countries. As early as the 19th century, when Russia acquired its cultural and artistic self-consciousness, her thinkers were persuaded into the Western idea of Russia's extra-European path and has chosen to adopt it. This very idea of the special path, which was to be used for leaving Europe behind and turning Russia, as Peter Chaadaev put it, into Europe's "joint court,' supported by the majority of Russian thinkers, Westerners as much as Slavophiles (Chaadaev, Danilevsky, Herzen, and others). They didn't admit that they had picked up this concept from the West. European Russians, as Pushkin, Turgenev, Chekhov and Bunin believed themselves a part of Europe; a curious concept, no one recalls.    Russian religious thought: As Russia entered the modern age in the nineteenth century, many Russian intellectuals combined the study of Western philosophy with a return to their own traditions, culminating in the novels of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky and the religious philosophy of their famous contemporary, Vladimir Soloviev.  Exploration of the central issues of modern Russian religious thought by studying the work of Soloviev and other religious philosophers who developed his ideas in the early twentieth century as Florensky, and S. Bulgakov, generally placed in the contexts of both Western philosophy and Eastern Orthodoxy, presents a substantially new perspective on Russian religious thought. The work of these philosophers, influenced virtually all aspects of modern Russian tradition, and many aspects of twentieth-century Soviet culture, and enhanced a rich philosophical tendency devoted to issues of community, humanity and even divinity, that transcend Russian boundaries and national soviet historical eras.    Russia's mystical mission: Demanding all or nothing, alternatively apocalyptic and nihilistic, Russians strove to justify culture and discover Russia's mystical mission. Impatient with the slow processes of history, distrusting authority while haunted by a vision of unity, great thinkers, as Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Federov, and Solovyov created an original and vital religious philosophy that culminated in the Russian Renaissance of the twentieth century. The fruit of these heroic figures, of whom Berdyaev was one, included Florensky, Bulgakov, Rozanov, etc., was cut short by the 1917 Revolution. In recent years, however, their works have been available in self-published editions. Underground, a great philosophical and spiritual rebirth (renaissance) was occurring.    Russia's mystical idea: Berdyaev's 'Russian idea' is thus a mystical one, he suggests that theology, not political economics determine Russian history and society. He takes up the story, starting with the nineteenth century, tracing the powerful chain of artists and thinkers as Bakunin, Chaadev, Khomyakov, Leontyev, among others, who struggled to dissolve the East and West polarities in the Russian soul. This immense, boundless soul, is so mystically vague that it is incapable of settling for "the halfway kingdom of culture."  Vladimir Kantor, eminent Russian scholar, masterfully summarizes the case, "thinkers appeared who turned the idea of Russia's European involvement into a determining one. I'll mention here the ranks of philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev. ... irrational myth of the socialist world. It would be unfair to underestimate the role of the Russian diaspora. The names and texts of Nikolai Berdyaev, Ivan Bunin, Vladimir Nabokov and others were reaching Soviet Russia."    Nikolai A. Berdyaev:  Berdyaev (1874-1948) was born in Kiev into an aristocratic family. He was educated in a military school and later entered the University of Kiev, from which he was expelled for embracing Marxism and taking part in political agitation. At twenty-five he was exiled from Kiev to the north of Russia  before the Revolution. He had broken with Marxism, previously, together with Bulgakov, contributing to a symposium that reaffirmed Orthodox Christianity. After the Revolution, he was appointed by the Bolshevists to teach philosophy in the University of Moscow, but soon fell into disfavor for his independent political opinions. He settled first in Berlin, where he opened a Russian Academy of Philosophy and Religion, then moved to Paris, where he lectured in a similar institution. He was invited to lecture at the Sorbonne in 1939, and survived the German occupation with no harm.    Christopher Bamford  A Fellow of the Lindisfarne Association, is the editor in chief of Steiner Books and has lectured, taught, and written widely on spiritual and esoteric traditions.   Book Reviews: Now that this book is available again, and the next installment of the Russian idea is being prepared, it is no doubt, an essential reading for an understanding of the new Russia, by Americans and Europeans, lay and experts.  "Imperative reading for persons interested in Russian culture." Alexander Vucinic "No one wishing to understand Russian thought should overloook it." --Donald A. Lowrie, The Rebellious prophet: A life of Nicolai Berdyaev 
 I found this book a few years ago when I was helping out in my school's library.  I looked it over and since I had read another of her books I tried it.  It was so well written that I couldn't put it down!!! Congradulations to Jane Yolen on her wonderful gift of story telling.  The characters were real and the blend between the past and fantasy was awesome!!! 
 The Grateful Dead circa 1969 were truly something special since that was a very pivotal year for them. 1969 not only saw their perfection of the psychadelic sub-genre, it saw them move to country/folk which was quite a leap. The recordings on this great CD are from the era when they pefected the psychadelia they'd been playing for a while. The Fillmore East was such a wonderful place and I hope that it along with the Fillmore West still stands today. This cd is a great showcase of not only that the Grateful Dead were the greatest band to ever assemble but the proof that their vocalist Pigpen McKernan was the greatest frontman of rock. That's all from me. Check this out and the only dissappointments that you'll have is that you should've got into the world of the Dead earlier and the fact that Cosmic Charlie is viciously cut off at the end of disc 2. The Grateful Dead are the Greatest. Jerry Garcia is my idol 
 I've always fondly remembered this movie. Bette Midler and Danny De Vito have perfect comic timing. :-D  
 What a reveiling book on what goes on in our government that the American public is not aware of.  It makes you look at politicans as power hungery, paid off people who have hood winked the public into thinking they are working in our behalf.  The facts tell another story.  Read to see just what your tax dollars are paying for 
 This has been the third novel I have read by John Irving.  The reason why I gave it four stars and not five is because at times I felt that the story was a bit too long winded. It appeared that John Irving had difficulty getting to the point at certain times of the story.  I also felt that he didn't tie up all the loose ends.  I will not go into that detail as I don't want to give too much away.  But with that aside, it was a terrific story not just about a man from Bombaby, but about people from all different walks of life.  What I like about John Irving is that he writes in such a way that I almost feel that I am living along with the characters he created.  Yes, it is a long book, but I wasn't able to put it down because I was always yearning to know what was going to happen next.  This is one of those books that I will be able to remember for a long time as the characters and story is very poignant. Who knows, I might even give it a re-read further down the road.  All in all a great book that will sit on my bookshelf for a very long while. 
 I love Mr. Poitier's style of writing and loved the fact that he actually shared his innermost feelings and his spirituality with me. That's a very personal thing. This is a most excellent read and even though I haven't finished the book as yet, I already plan to re-read it. Thank you, Mr. Poitier, for sharing your life with us! 
 A wonderful two DVD Set.  Great cover art box.  The film is almost worth the fifty year wait 
 I generally don't write reviews but I've been a Kinks fan for over 35 years so I had to speak up. This EP and Tourist EP from England prove that Ray has lost none of his ability to champion the common man. This is a GREAT song. The two versions of Thanksgiving Day are completely different so buy this so you won't miss out. I love Dave and The Kinks but Ray is who all true Kinks fans have been waiting for and he delivers 
 _When I first read this novel I thought that the author had been heavily influenced by H.P. Lovecraft. Then I looked up the original date of publication (1908), which is several decades before Lovecraft published. I wouldn't hesitate to call this one of the best otherworldly and weird books ever written. It is not graphic blood and guts splatter- Edwardian gentlemen did not write such [stuff]. This is better, besides the psychological terror that builds, you have cosmically mind boggling themes of infinite time and space- and the world beyond this world, of which ours is but a pale inferior shadow.  _I often wonder just who William Hope Hodgeson was. He was plainly a man of action, that much is clear from his battle with the pig demons, but he was also something more. I wonder what forgotten corner of the Empire he picked up his knowlege of things cosmic and beyond the veil... 
 This book is about a 32-year old retarded man, Charlie, who is made smart through surgery.  Scientists had previously tried this surgery on mice and though the mice got smarter, they rapidly declined.  Finally a mouse comes along that seems to stay smart (Algernon), and the scientists decide it's time to try the surgery on a human.  Charlie is selected as the best candidate for the surgery, and he wants very much to be made smart.  The surgery appears to work, and Charlie becomes smarter every day.  Eventually, Algernon, the mouse, begins to decline. This worries everyone that the same thing will begin to happen to Charlie.    What's interesting is that Charlie has become so smart that he is now smarter than the scientists, and he begins to search for his own cure.  The book is written as a series of journal entries.  The grammar, spelling, and punctuation greatly improve after Charlie's surgery. Charlie is really a lovable character in the beginning series of journal entries.  This is a good book with an interesting story to tell.  At the peak of Charlie's "smart period" the book becomes a little tough to follow, but overall it was fun to read 
 Why Absolute Sovereignty Can Not Offer Perpetual Peace -On the Desires of Men         In the Leviathan, Hobbes brings forward the theory that Commonwealths arise because without governments, people live in a state of nature with the constant danger of death. Furthermore, he believes that the best form of Commonwealth is one ruled by a monarch with absolute power; just like a person with two brains will not function, if the power of the monarch is not absolute, the commonwealth will fall back into the warring state of nature. When the sovereign power becomes truly absolute, Hobbes believes the Commonwealth could "live as long as mankind" unless attacked by foreign powers (p210).          Indeed, Hobbes is right in that life under any government is better than life with no government, and also that multiple powers inside one commonwealth will cause an end to the commonwealth. Nevertheless, he is wrong in asserting that absolute monarchy is the panacea for perpetual internal peace. There are two intrinsic flaws in the his system which are bound to push the commonwealth into the state of nature: one flaw is the unchecked greed of the monarch, another is caused by the unfulfilled desire for power of the subjects. Although this paper can not offer a better formula for governments, it will show that absolute monarchy does not provide the perpetual security that Hobbes promises.         First of all, extraordinary greed of the absolute ruler can break the Commonwealth. A ruler's greed can impoverish his subjects so abjectly that they no longer have enough food to survive on. Since the purpose of the commonwealth is to guarantee the security of life, and without food there is no life, the greed of the ruler will force the absolute Commonwealth to fall back into the state of nature.          Hobbes believes that the interest of the ruler and the interest of his subjects are so interdependent that the actions of the ruler will always be in the interest of his people. He writes,        "Now in monarchy the private interest is the same with the public...the riches, power, and honor of a monarch arise only from the riches, strength and reputation of his subjects." (P120)          Hobbes is right; the sovereign is the incorporation of its subjects, and so any injuries to the people are collectively an injury to the sovereign. Nevertheless, arising out of the great complications of the businesses of state and the wide expanse of a Commonwealth, there will always be a lag between when acts of the sovereign takes effect with people and when the sovereign feels the reactions of his people himself. A ruler with perfect prudence might be able to see through the gap and act in ways that are only ultimately good for the people and himself, but as Hobbes rightly observes, no one has perfect prudence (P14). This imperfect prudence becomes especially short-sighted when the ruler's reason is clouded by his present desires. Hobbes acknowledges these desires, for he says:          "And hence it is that kings, whose power is greatest, turn their endeavors to the assuring it at home by laws or abroad by wars; and when that is done, there succeeded a new desire, in some of fame from new conquest, in others of ease and sensual pleasures, in others of admiration or being flattered for excellence in some art or other ability of the mind." (p58)       So clouded by the lack of prudence and by excessive desires, the monarch might take actions that seem good at the moment for himself, but which turn out harmful for himself later. To illustrate this, let us observe the following scenario:        The new ruler of a poor but secured country builds a modest palace, for he has learnt from history books that he should not splurge. A couple years later, however, a desire for great things tempts him, and he wants to build a winter palace. He seeks advices from ten advisors, who had all the qualities that Hobbes praises (Chapter XXV); nine out of ten advisors privately dissuade the king from this luxury for a flood is raging and their nation is poor. Saddened, the king turns to the last advisor, who, seeing an opportunity to gain favor with the ruler, loudly exclaims that the other counselors do not love their king who needs a winter palace to escape the cold. The king happily agrees with him as his reason becomes clouded by desires; and soon, the construction begins.           Having gained favor, the 10th advisor convinces the ruler to imprison the other advisors for their "bad mouthing" of the king, making him the sole voice by the ruler's ear. As time goes on, the king exerts ever greater taxes on his people to pay for ever grander palaces, and every time, the advisor not only finds more elaborate excuses for the king but praises him for his greatness and also funnels some of the money for construction into his own coffer. The affairs of the nation are in utter neglect.         One night, the king remembers his father's warnings against indulgence, and he shakes with fear; but when he sees his gardens filled with singing girls half naked, lacking the prudence to see the future awaiting him, he says to himself, "I have been endowed differently by God, the fate of others can not be my own."          The poor people of this nation become more desperate by the day, yet the ruler who lives deep inside his palaces can not know their suffering. Some years later, the harvest is so bad that people have barely enough to feed themselves, yet the king sends his money collectors for even higher tax quotas. Realizing that they could either die of starvation or die fighting against the dictator with at least a chance to live, the farmers revolt. Hobbes would support them, for he writes, "the obligation of subjects to the sovereign is understood to last as long, and no longer, than the power lasteth by which he is able to protect hem." (P144)        When the farmers' army charges into his bed chamber, the king finally feels the injuries that he has done to the people and to himself, yet reason and prudence are too late.          Absolute sovereignty means absolute power, and as the old saying goes, "power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely." In fact, Hobbes acknowledges the greedy corruption of the monarchs, and even gives his justification. He writes,           "A man may here object that the condition of subjects is very miserable, as being obnoxious to the lusts and other irregular passions of him or them that have so unlimited a power in their hands...not considering that the estate of man can never be without some incommodity or other, and that the greatest that in any form of government can possibly happen to the people in general is scarce sensible, in respect of the miseries and horrible calamities that accompany a civil war." (P117)           Hobbes makes no mistakes here. Any government is better than no government, but as mentioned before, he makes the claim later that Commonwealths, "by the nature of their constitution they are designed to live as long as mankind" unless attacked by foreign powers (210). In the same chapter (XXIX), Hobbes attributes all the internal infirmities of the Commonwealth that shorten its "natural" life to variations of the lack of absolute power, but describes no infirmities when the Commonwealth is ruled by an absolute monarch. He thus makes it clear that if there is absolute power, then the commonwealth will "live as long as mankind" even if the monarch is corrupted. However, as shown in the illustration above, Hobbes' absolute monarchy does have tremendous infirmities.          Hobbes can, however, still argue that the previous illustration is an extreme example that barely happens in reality. Hobbes might say that if only the absolute sovereigns all studied the Leviathan carefully, they will always initiate policies for the interest of the people. Granted, Hobbes' excellent book can convert many, yet, even when the absolute sovereign is good and strong, the Commonwealth can still fall back into the state of chaos.         To Hobbes, the foremost law of nature is to find security ("a man is forbidden to do that which is destructive to his life" [P79]), but is survival the only thing that men search for? No. As Hobbes points out himself, survival is the means and not the ends of life. And while people all want to survive, they live for different ends of life as influenced by their education and upbringings. Hobbs indirectly talks about the fulfillment of some ends life when he writes,         "In such condition (of war) there is no place for industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain, and consequently, no culture of the earth, no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea, no commodious building" (p76)          For certain people, the end of their life lies in gaining political power-to be the ruler instead of the ruled. Hobbes indirectly recognizes people's "unnecessary" desire for power, when he writes (OL) "there are those who, from pride and a desire for glory, would conquer the whole world, which they pursue farther than their security requires." (P75)          This kind of desire, nevertheless, can not be fully satisfied in a state of absolute sovereignty. For one, the greatest prize of all, the prize of becoming your own sovereign is off-limits. Additionally, although those borne with the heart of Napoleon might be few, lower offices and positions in a state of absolute power come merely at the mercy of the sovereign-for one eager for any honor and position, his dream may never fly high because the sovereign can give the honor he deserves to someone else. As Hobbes says himself, "a man may be worthy of riches, office, and employment, that nevertheless can plead no right to have it before another, and therefore cannot be said to merit or deserve it." (p57)         For some, the limitation on of the fulfillment of their political dreams results in nothing other than the acceptance of their fates, yet history never fails to produce some who have the eagerness and bravery to challenge the ultimate authority and break the bondage of power.          Hobbes would call the act of such eager men anti-nature, since dissenters will almost certainly face unnatural deaths by the sword of the king, or face the danger of death by returning to the state of nature. However, again, survival is the means, not ends of life. The following example illustrates why people might endanger their means for their ends.          Colonized people have throughout history fought for independence against their colonial sovereigns. To Hobbes, these wars for independence must be irrational: for one, the colonized people could be enjoying many benefits either from direct aid or commercial links with their colonizer; additionally, hundreds of thousands of colonized people might die in the immediate war or during the consequent internal power struggles caused by the revolt. Yet, despite the "practical benefits" and the peace that the colonial sovereigns bestows upon the colonized, this smooth highway of subjugation is not the one that the people want; they desire for a road, smaller and rougher maybe, but one that is built by themselves to a destination that they determined for themselves. Thus, in their search for the power that is forbidden to them, they set out for the "unreasonable".          To be sure, Hobbes' Law of Nature still holds: on the battle fields, those who fight against the sovereign will always do all they could to triumph over their enemy and avoid death, but again, the need for survival is only a part of the story.         Regarding this fight for independence, Hobbes might say, as he writes, "those men that are so remissly governed that they dare take up arms to defend or introduce an opinion are still in war." (P113) This means that since the any revolutionaries must never have been a part of the commonwealth, and hence the commonwealth was only attacked from the outside and did not fall internally. Nevertheless, Hobbes also says that a monarch's "subjects" are delivered from their former obligation, and become obliged" to the victor in a war against their original sovereign. (P145) The new subjects of the monarch might have a high tendency toward revolting against ruler for the same reasons mentioned before, and in this case, Hobbes must certainly recognize that the revolutionaries are a part of the Commonwealth.        In the Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes dedicates himself to finding the best form of government, that perfect house which can last forever and provide eternal peace for all. The book is quiet admirable with its precise arguments and high ideals. Nevertheless, Hobbes ignores the fact that people will always willingly take actions that might hurt their security because they are either short-sighted or desire for something other than mere survival. Still, the Leviathan is a work of Epic proportion, and this essay does not find a form of government better than absolute sovereignty.        
 There are six books in Peter F. Hamilton's "Night's Dawn" series:  - "The Reality Dysfunction - Part 1: Emergence," - "The Reality Dysfunction - Part 2: Expansion," - "The Neutronium Alchemist - Part 1: Consolidation," - "The Neutronium Alchemist - Part 2: Conflict," - "The Naked God - Part 1: Flight," and - "The Naked God - Part 2: Faith."  Be warned: you CANNOT read these books individually. They are, essentially, chapters in one whopping great book. If you like the first book, then you'll have to read the other five books in order. There's no tie-up of any sort between any of the books. The publisher just broke the story up because it totals over 3,000 pages. If you pick up a book before you've read all the previous books (in order), put it down. It won't mean anything to you. Since these books are entirely dependent on each other, I'm writing this review on the series as a whole, not on the individual books.  This is one of the greatest science fiction sagas written. It ranks up there with David Brin's "Uplift Saga." It is literally a story of good vs evil and shows some of the potential (and pitfalls) of the human race. Over the years, I've read the whole series five times, and I still love it. I really only have two gripes with the book. First, and this is unavoidable in what Hamilton is doing, the evil in the series is definitely, graphically evil. This is not a book where the villain twists his mustache and laughs "nyah hah hah" as he forecloses on the orphanage or ties the heroine to the railroad tracks. The writing is fairly graphic in a lot of places. After five readings, this gets a bit wearing. My second gripe is one which somewhat limits the audience of the series (even more so than the evilness presented, and it's why I've given the series four stars instead of five): there's too much sex and the writing about it is too graphic. This is a problem with all of Hamilton's books, but it seems more prevalent in this series. Because of this, I wouldn't recommend the book for your children to read. But, as long as you're aware of that, I highly recommend the series and give it 4 stars out of five 
 I'm from Georgia, and everything Clint Johnson says in this book is true.  Actually, this should be "KO-rec'" (as we pronounce it down South), because it exposes the prevalent liberal myth that we're all a bunch of dumb rednecks.  We ain't - till you push us 
 I loved the story becauseit has los of animals  .And I love animals.The most part I love is when the mitten shot off the animals.And another thing I like about the story is that when Nicki comes home and gives Baba the mittens.And she look like she is curious.And sher did like the Rabit. I can tell you that this is one of my  favorite books and the best book I have ever  
 This book and the newspaper reports it descibes literly changed my life.  It also changed fhe view of all thinking Americans of  the presidency and the press. We need a similar team today. Should be required reading in our schools 
 Great transaction - the book was in excellent shape and sent in a timely manner.  Seller is highly recommended 
 If you love the art of dance and this takes you to a blast in the past, then buy this movie for the collection and the history.  The story and acting is pretty bad, but the dancing is excellent!  If you are looking for something with a good story, keep searching.  If you want something entertaining, then this movie is worth it 
 If you have an interest in Marine training, especially this very challenging drill that young men in boot camp must master to graduate, then this is a very informative read for you. I have a son who is a Marine and I wanted to understand the 13 week process that they go through in their training.  By studying the training schedule and reading this book, I had more of an understanding of what he had gotten himself into.  This is an incredibly grueling 52 hour "march" and training regimen--this Crucible.  The author takes us through the very beginning of the march, what the recruits are thinking, feeling, their fatique, all the way to the long march back to bootcamp. We actually finally see a human side to the drill sargents, because they are participating in this as well.  I really liked the way that the author took the reader from station to station and explained how each challenge was named for a particular Marine who had given his life and the valor behind the story.  That is something you will not forget after reading this book.  Another point is that there is so little contemporary material available concerning Marine training for readers such as myself, and this is so fresh and fairly easy to understand.  
 I loved this book. I learned things that we should all know and are not being told by traditional ways in this modern society. I think everyone should read this book and just become aware of what we need to know to be healthy. It is written in a very understandable way 
 I bought about a dozen of these for Christmas gifts - for our daughters, our son's girlfriend's, work friends, sister and sisters-in-law, myself (!) and everyone loved them!  Even though I subscribe to Ophrah's magazine the book wasn't a repeat...it's a beautiful book compiled in a reference format with great articles for quick reading on particular subjects that every female needs to know!  The pictures throughout the book are gorgeous, in full color on heavy, glossy paper. There's a picture of a naked couple - tastefully done, very discrete for full nudity.   This book is a gift several times over - it's a gift in itself and then the advice within is enlightening, uplifting, encouraging, fun and inspiring - the best gifts you can give yourself and anyone you truly care about!   There's mention of this being an annual..I hope so - I know just what to get everyone again for Christmas this coming year! (And one for myself!) Enjoy!   
 This is my favorite cook book that I use above all others. The full color photos of the preparations inspire me. The organization of the book makes it easy to quickly find what I need, although I think the index could use some improvement.   Although it would be very helpful to have access to a local Indian or organic foods market, I've found that many of the recipes I can adapt in order to use what is commonly available or I can omit the special or foreign ingredients altogether.  I do prefer spicier food also, so many of the recipes I cut down the main ingredients but maintained the spiciness.   Overall this is a great source for ideas and lots of important info regarding a vegetarian diet (the art of eating), the ingredients used, as well as menu plans 
 Greg Iles writes the type of book that is hard to put down.  This can sometimes be problematic as his books are also generally long.  Still he's an amazing storyteller.  His characters are well formed with many dimensions and often have both endearing and distasteful characteristics.    Audio versions of The Quiet Game can be found read by either Tom Stechsculte or Dick Hill.  Both are great narrators, although I would rate Stechsculte higher.  He really brings books with deep characters and intense story lines to life 
 A rare instance of a book on the topic of mind control that is neither sensational or paranoid. Scholarly, yet readable, this is a valuable book that everyone should read 
 I thought this CD was great. He talks about food a lot but it's still funny. Frankly, i thought....BETTER than the last Dane Cook cd i bought. It's only an hour though, i wish it was longer. 
 I liked this book.  Obviously, with the Cold War over, America now needs to compete globally with India and China, among others.  This book talks about the ways that companies can do so and the challenges facing us.  This book is quite similar to Thomas Friedman's book The World Is Flat, in places.  The apologists for globalization say one thing--  the opponents of multinational corporations' exploitation of workers say another thing-- but the fact remains that worldwide capitalism is changing, and each of us needs to change to remain employable.  This book is a report on the inclusion of India and China's billions into capitalism 
 Tayman's account of the leper colony on Molokai and its history is fascinating and brilliantly written.He clearly shows us the various characters involved over a century of "medical segregation" as he calls it. All in all many scholars have come to the conclusion that the isolation of the lepers prevented the further progress of the disease in Hawaii.The poor planning by the Board of Health made the victim's suffering more acute in the beginning of their isolation and the effects of this have lived on in the hearts of the Hawaiian people. 
 International man of letters and tireless critic of Israeli lawlessness towards his own people: Columbia University professor Edward Said represents everything Israeli apologists never admit - the virtual hidden history of Palestinians being massacred and forcibly removed (described if at all in contemporary newspeak as "displaced") from their lands for the last sixty years by Isreal's brutal and relentless campaign.  Said, living proof as himself is one of the half million Palestinians forcibly transferred in the late 1940s, quite simply speaks the truth in this fantastic, informative and sorrowful collection of essays, which originally appeared over the course of seven years in various Middle East news outlets.    His flair for language and the crystal clear prose make his essays seemingly flow off the page and are a joy to read.  "Peace and Its Discontents" is a welcome counterpunch, especially for an American audience fed a steady supply of Israeli and United States propaganda and deceit that whitewashes Israel's flaunting of international law and its consistent violation of a resilient and proud peoples human rights.    That someone becomes so filled with hopelessness and despair to strap a bomb to themselves to wipe out a group of innocents is something that's clearly outside the conceptual framework of any relatively comfortable human being.  In "Peace and Its Discontents" Said, while never justifying these acts, presents them in the correct historical, economic and political context in order to allow the reader a better grasp of the motivations that lie beneath them.    For a quality primer on the Palestinian plight one can think of no better book.  From an authentic source and distinguished scholar, Said gives the reader almost a first hand account of a struggle the Palestinians will no doubt eventually win 
 Dick Staub does a FABULOUS job of tying in the old teachings of the Bible with the very popular Star Wars Saga!  This is an amazing book and it is very insightful.  If you are looking to change your life and be a better Christian, this book is for you!!!    This book is also great for people following Jediism who are Christian.  I recommend with both thumbs up!  Just an eloquent writer gifted with the ability to reach out to both adults and youth!  A MUST read 
 Sometimes you see this book by Rosamund Smith, which is Joyce Carol Oates by another name! 
 The famous eccentric mathematician had a theory that God (who he liked to call the SF-Supreme Fascist) had a book with every mathematical theorem and that the book had the most beautiful and elegant proofs for the theorems. This book has that philosophy and presents great proofs for many beautiful theorems. It is a masterpiece. A book that shows why mathematicians love what they do 
 Banyai manages to capture the readers imagination with brilliant illustrations as he pulls away from a minute detail that becomes a bigger part of the picture. My 9 year old son and I read this masterpiece over and over and as we journeyed deeper into to pages, an overwhelming sense of the largess of the world came to mind. This is a must read! It is thought provoking and riviting 
 Now a book that shows two sides of slavery that all white people were not all for slavery .Like Dr.martin luther king was saying that slavery was not about black against white ,but justice againt injustice.Because if all men and women are not free then we are all in chains.Books like this one has giving us a balance look at one of america darkest sides. But men like Garrison showed us that their were men and women that were a light of hope that all men are created equal . And  being a black man I must say thank you to all the blackmen and women and white men and women of the past for fighting a fight that many of us still fight for today .And that is for an opportunity to live as we were when God created us in the beginnig as, a human being thank you 
 I tried to purchase this comforter locally but all the local stores either were out or didn't even carry them.  My four year old son absolutely had to have this for Christmas, so as a good mother I searched Amazon.com, I am sure glad I did.  |The comforter is just as described online and coloful not faded as sometimes happens in transit.  The designs on both sides are wonderful and I would order it again if needed to later on 
 but my eyes are getting to old to read the tiny print.  It is nicer than I expected 
 I have read so many books, and I am eager to call this one the best, followed by "Patrick Sskind - The Perfume". Patricia Highsmith created one of the best criminal novels I have ever read. Partly because off her unique way to describe, e.g. when Tom Ripley, the protagonist, murders somebody. These scenes are told so cool and distant, its like if she was talking about going to the supermarket on Saturday morning. It sometimes gave me a chill, because I could not let go off this masterpiece - I just had to go on reading and find out what this psychopath was going to do next to continue being "A FAKE SOMBODY, THAN A REAL NOBODY", as he justifies his actions! It has been a great experience for me to read this novel and I recommend it to anybody who has a brain to think and eyes to see 
 I kept seeing this movie on the shelf at my local video store, but -- although it starred two great actors, Rex Harrison and Charlton Heston -- as many times as I picked it up, I kept putting it back, not quite sure what the quality of the story might be. When I finally rented it, I wished I had watched it earlier!   The Sistine Chapel set is fantastic, and the ceiling paintings are vibrant and look identical to the real ones. Impressive! I especially enjoyed the simple yet moving scene in which a discouraged Michelangelo -- who has run away from Rome and gone back to cutting marble in the mountains -- sees in the clouds what he must paint on the ceiling:  God reaching out to Adam. Michelangelo stands in awe and quotes passages from Genesis.  The conflict between Pope Julius and Michelangelo is both humorous and poignant. They anger one another yet they push one another to do the impossible.  When the puzzled pope wants to know why Michelangelo left, he replies, "You beat me!" When the artist and the pope first interact on screen, the source of conflict is a sonnet Michelangelo wrote about Julius, quickly and simply setting up the push-pull nature of their relationship. There's a bit of reverse psychology that they pull on one another, too, which the pope employs better than the straight-forward Michelangelo, but the artist turns the tables on Julius, and rouses the pope from his deathbed with understated, serious humor (if there can be such a thing).  It's historical fiction, so purists will have to take the FICTION into account when viewing this film. Don't sit down with a biography of Michelangelo or Pope Julius and search for facts. Just enjoy the story! However, the people and the main events of the story did exist, did know one another, did happen. I especially like the prologue to the film, an interesting and moving review of Michelangelo's architecture and sculpture.  The DVD is enhanced, with the picture quality improved over the VHS version that I originally watched, so I definitely recommend the DVD.  Enjoy 
 I bought this for my son who is 2 1/2.  He loves it.  He had to show "peepaw", his grandfather who has a real one.  Anytime he's outside he gets it out to ride on.  He has several other "ride-on" toys and prefers this one over most of them.  He has the Little Tikes Police Car Coupe, and Step 2 Tricycle, the Zip N' zoom car, a radio flyer tricycle and a fisher price quad.  The only thing I found is if he leans too much to one side it will tip over.  It's pretty sturdy otherwise.  Put a little helmet on for safety (just like the adults do on our motorcycycles) and you little one will be just fine 
 EVERYONE should be forced to read this book concerning their health, regardless of their weight. It's about your health, and how what you don't know CAN hurt you. People need to know if their livers, kidneys, or colons are filled with toxins and are virtually breaking down their body systems day by day, for years, causing everything from cancer to depression and anxiety. This book is FULL of information, from MANY TOP ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE DOCTORS, all giving their opinions and experiences. I found it fascinating....and inspiring 
 Fumio Demura's basic books on Kobudo (I have Nunchaku, Bo, Sai, Tonfa) are good. They include some historical data, basic stances and grips, as well as useful drills to train grips, blocks and thrusts. This book on basic Nunchaku, however, does not present a Kata with the weapon, as the Bo book does. Some more on Japanese nomenclature would have been great, also. Still, I recommend it for beginners 
 I'm an electrical and electronics engineer, working for a governmental R&D Institution. I also study on Science and Technology Policy Studies for an M.S. degree. I found the book quite useful, especially in its aspect of analyzing the scientist and engineer in his own time, his own context, his own psychology... It is a well organized, fluent, clear book. It may not be a complete guide or a definitive study, but it is a good point to start. Recommended.. 
 This work is an extensive overview of christological issues and positions in the modern church while providing historical understandings, formulations and heresies.  Donald Macleod then provides an evangelical  response or critique to those positions that are not compatable with  mainstream evangelical thought and argues for those positions that are  associated with evangelicalism.        Macleod takes opposing positions  seriously and accurately portrays their concerns and central tenets.  He is  also willing to face the harshest critiques of his own positions.  He  answers those crituques when he can and acknoldeges the roles of  presuppositions in every party's arguments.     A very good introduction to  the issues that in his own words is "but the mere beginning of a  pilgrimage.&quot 
 The Yoga Sutras (thread of aphorisms) of Patanjali are one of the six darshanas of the Hindu or Vedic schools. "How to Know God" is a beautiful translation of those. The book is relatively short (pocket sized with just over 200 pages) and very readable. It offers one of the clearest explanations of the practice of yoga and meditation that I have read. It is surprisingly practical. I value it almost as much as I do "The Art and Science of Raja Yoga: Fourteen Steps to Higher Awareness: Based on the Teachings of Paramhansa Yogananda" and Osho's "The Book of Secrets: 112 Keys to the Mystery Within" as a practical guide to specific meditation techniques. For those who have a Christian background, the book references familiar Christian concepts, making the book all the more readable for the typical Westerner. While one can read the entire book in one sitting (and maybe this is a useful strategy for its first reading), I prefer to digest it slowly, contemplating and savoring each aphorism. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to enter into a deeper level of spiritual consciousness 
 The book was well written with a lot of info. Highly recommended 
 I too love her books and rush to get them when they arrive. Somehow I missed this one and so I just now read it. And I really liked it. I think it is unfair to expect the author to stay in the same writing style with each book. This one was different but so enjoyable. The thing I love about her books is that you live them, not just read them.  I could picture Michael, Grace and the Italian family. I could smell the food in the kitchen and loved the dialogue of the family. I think her books are a fun trip to another place. And I love that in a book. 
 Daringly forthright, this suspenseful story of blackmail (expertly performed by a great cast led by Dirk Bogarde) is a valuable time capsule of the pervasive homophobia that dominated all reaches of 1960s society.  There are great, timeless moments that remind the audience of simultaneously how far and how little we have progressed since then.  A 30 minute television interview from 1961 with Bogarde is also quite interesting, particularly for American audiences who may only be peripherally aware of his wonderful work on the stage, in film and as an author 
 There is so little a reviewer could say about a classic that has not already been said.   But, whether your interest is in travel literature, ancient history, military history, or anthropology, this book will excite and inspire you.   The writing is conversational, witty, and addicting.   Though the author repeats some stories, each telling seems to bring out nuances and connections that would have been missed otherwise and each telling takes you deeper into the Asian frontiers and its people.   A fascinating traveller's story that never grows old.   Must have for any serious student of history especially with regard to the Asian steppes and the empire of the great Khan.  Rediscover the wonder of the travels for yourself, not second-hand but from the traveller himself 
 How can something older than me sound so good? The recording is top notch. Dont be fooled into thinking it is "just stereo", the ambience of symphony hall comes thru as though it were recorded in surround. Exquisite detail and perfect tempo. Timpani has realistic impact. And all the other music with Pictures makes this a real bargain 
 Sword in the Storm by David Gemmell has again started off a riveting series entitled The Rigante. His use of real, flawed characters and swift action intermingled with magic is second to none nowadays.  Connovar, or Sword in the Storm, has had to grow up without his real father. It has been tough, but his flashes of kindness make him a character tough not to hate. His legend grows after he single-handedly defends his friend from a fierce bear. Surviving his near death, Connovar decides to travel across the sea to see the city of Stone. He has heard of their invincible army and needs to see for himself what he will have to face when they turn their sights on the land of the Rigante.  The magic of the novel stems from the land and the people who populate it. A magical people reside in the woods around the Rigante land called the Seidh and they feed off of the land's magic. After saving a young doe in brambles, Connovar gains the attention and help of the Seidh in defense of his land. Whether or not he can keep his promises, large and small, will ultimately determine the fate of the Rigante.  The new source of magic, the wonderful new characters, and the same fast-paced and descriptive action make the Sword and the Storm inventive and fun to read. I was not able to sleep or eat until the last word was read, so I know everyone else will love it. Enjoy 
 Director Wolfgang Staudte cowrote this fine film with his father Fritz Staudte together with Erwin Klein. Both Staudtes took part in Reinhardt and Piscator productions, and in Hans and Lotte's wedding entertainment American audiences may hear Brecht and Weill.  This powerful work was released three years after Staudte's "The Murderers Are Among Us". In contrast with that film's depiction of an educated paragon tortured by conscience, Rotation traces the lives of Berliner everyman Hans, his beloved Lotte, and Lotte's politically-engaged brother Karl from the depression and runaway inflation of the 1920s through the return of economic normalcy, the Nazi ascension to power, war, impending defeat, the battle for Berlin, and finally war's aftermath and reconstruction. Rotation opens during the fall of Berlin. Sheltering from the battle outside a woman hears the Soviets have reached the Moabit district and she immediately leaves safety to dodge the bombs and shells outside. Why? Our interest of course is immediately piqued. The film then flashes back to 1925, the year of Hitler's reorganization of the NSDAP. Hans strives heroically to provide for Lotte and their dear son Helmut. Hans is a good neighbor to the Jewish family downstairs. Karl the communist thinker and activist fights both capitalists and Nazis. Hans, Karl, and Lotte care deeply for one another and for toddler Helmut. Hans resents the class oppression which feeds children of the aristocracy cake while Helmut is sick and malnourished. Hans is jailed for labor organizing. While not endorsing the NSDAP he accommodates the party in order to secure work he desperately needs to put food on the table. Here Staudte and DEFA show industrialists solidly behind the NSDAP while Karl and Hans have only the backing of fellow workers. For years Hans refuses Karl's entreaties to join the struggle, citing his family responsibilities. Finally out of devotion to his brother-in-law as well as to humanity Hans commits acts of resistance and is betrayed by Helmut, who is now a committed member of the Hitler-Jugend. It is the ramifications of this act for Hans, Lotte, and Helmut in the context of their love for one another which begins and ends the film.  Rotation celebrates the strength and continuity of human life and love: love erotic, filial and fraternal. 
 Yesterday, I spoke with about a dozen of my co-workers -- most of them ten or even twenty years younger  -- and asked each of them,  "Who's Jerome Kern? -- does that name ring a bell with you?" None of my friends recognized the name of the `dean' of great American popular songwriters - the man whose melodies inspired ALL of the other great composers - especially, George Gershwin, Cole Porter and Richard Rodgers.   This sad reality confirmed a thought I had, the moment I picked up this book, and wondered, to myself, Is there really any market for a book about Johnny Mercer? --  a songwriter who died almost 30 years ago?- How many people today would care to read a biography - however interesting (and this one is simply superb) - that concerns an old songwriter? --- even someone who was, according to his peers, the greatest lyricist of the English language?   Here's a simple test:  If the following song titles mean something to you - then I can guarantee you will LOVE this book:  "Skylark," "Autumn Leaves," "The Summer Wind," "One For My Baby," "Something's Gotta Give," "Laura," "I Remember You," "That Old Black Magic," "Dream (when you're feeling blue) --- all of them, and many others, written by the same man, and celebrated here in "The Life of John Herndon Mercer," written by an old friend and fellow lyricist, Gene Lees.  ----  Mercer's best writing was to the music of the greatest composers of popular song - beginning with Jerome Kern in the early 1930s, ("I'm Old Fashioned") and continuing for 30 years, until the early 60s,  when Johnny wrote two, consecutive "Best Song" Oscar winners with Henry Mancini  -- "Moon River" and "Days of Wine and Roses."   We're reminded with many a poignant anecdote, that a golden age of great song writing died, years before Johnny Mercer left us, on June 25, 1976 - after lingering in a semi-vegetative state for eight months, following brain cancer surgery.  His widow, Ginger, presented Gene Lees with the only copy of Johnny's unfinished memoir, in the hopes that the author could develop it, into a book.  Lees uses portions of Johnny's insightful writings, interjecting trenchant observations of his own  -- as if conversing with the spirit of his old friend. Interspersed are conversations Gene had with Johnny, such as one from the late 60s, concerning the quality of contemporary song lyrics.  Said Mercer,  "A lot of people who can't write (songs) are trying to write . . . and it's based on (a combination of) Elizabethan structure and hill music . . . like Simon and Garfunkel and Jimmy Webb and Johnny Hartford, and the kids down in Nashville - they take the guitar and try to philosophize to a hillbilly tune with chords that come from 'way, 'way (long) ago . . . I think Webb is a superior writer, I didn't mean to classify him with the others, and Burt Bacharach is trying very hard to be different --- too hard (I'd say) but he is gifted."  Then, musing about the songs that were popular in America almost a century ago, Mercer (born in 1909) wrote, "I used to listen with awe and wonder to every kind of music I could get my hands on. Gypsy airs on the accordion or zither, harmonica blues, gems from Broadway, the yodels of Jimmy Rodgers, cowboy songs from the prairies, all reached my ears and touched my heart.  When I remember talking to the old timers as a child, I know that the well of our folk music goes deeper than I or even my grandfather knew. The traditional songs were brought over here in the holds of the immigrant boats and the slave traders, those that reached us via the islands, are only a drop in the bucket, so vast and deep is the reservoir that we have kept hidden in our heart.  After a man spent all day ploughing a field, or herding cattle, laboring on the docks or in the mills, poling the canals and picking cotton, he had no movies or phonograph to lighten his burden . . . but he had his family, his jug and his banjo or mouth organ or concertina, and he could sing the old songs to escape and remind himself of happier times and wonderful far-off places. . . These were times when Mama and Pa and Grandpa and Uncle Silas forgot their troubles, forgot to be stern, and were as human as the kids."  This is a passage, according to Lees, "that could never have been written by Cole Porter, Lorenz Hart, Dorothy Fields or . . . any of the other major lyricists Johnny respected. It reveals a deep identification with the American people, the so-called common folk. Of all the sophisticated, literate lyricists, only John Mercer had this quality.  On the very next page, Lees chides his old friend for expressing the hope, in his memoir, that it's never too late for there to be another generation of good, if not great, song writers.  As if in conversation, Lees writes tellingly,  "Oh John, you've fallen into the trap of optimism.  Since you died, popular music has only deteriorated further. In the age of Elvis popular music dispensed with interesting and beautiful harmony.  In the age of rap, it dispensed even with melody, beautiful or otherwise . . . . and radio (which made the career of Johnny Mercer) evolved in such a way that it is impossible to find anything by Jerome Kern on the air, and jazz has disappeared from commercial radio broadcasting.  In 2002, National Public Radio cancelled its jazz shows.  John, you may not have liked "Hair" the musical, or the Beatles . . . but compared with what is going on now, the songs of both seem like towers of taste and intelligence.  "Occasionally Shirley Horn or Natalie Cole will have a successful album of the great standards, and Diana Krall became a star singing them.  But there is NO circumstance to generate the creation of (great) new songs in your tradition."  ----  Near the end of this splendid biography, Lees quotes Mercer in a prophetic observation about his own legacy, in answer to a question posed by a BBC interviewer,  "I think some of my songs may be noticed, as individual pieces, but I think Gilbert (& Sullivan, and Lorenz) Hart, possibly (Ira) Gershwin - because of his brother, but mostly because of his wit, his sly sense of humor, and (Irving) Berlin and (Cole) Porter, going right on up into (Alan Jay) Lerner and (Frank) Loesser, will be studied . . . and collected . . . and forgotten."  After including the names of "a few more" Johnny forgot to mention - Dorothy Fields, Oscar Hammerstein and the Bergmans, Marilyn and Alan, among others, the author recapitulates that lyric writing, "at least when it is pursued to its highest level" is the most difficult literary form of all - matching perfect words to great melodies.   The author recalls a stranger asking him (Gene Lees): "Don't you think Johnny was MORE than a lyricist? - that he was a poet?" Lees replied, without hesitation, "No, he was more than a poet - he was a lyricist. 
 I really liked Antique Glow- it was so pretty and dreamy and gorgeous- but this new one is AMAZING. I just got it, but I'm totally overwhelmed by it. This record has so much in it, that I can't even figure it out yet- its got fantastic songs, shimmering/scary/beautiful sounds, crazy lyrics and just overall fascination. What I like best about it is how the songwriting on it is classic- like totally put together perfectly, scientifically, but the sounds on it, and the sudden breaks are just insane- its like a perfect fusion, like psychocandy or something (but it doesn't sound like psychocandy- its totally its own record. 
 this is the best cd by dmx.  very good lyrics and crisp rapping.  the beats are not the greatest but when hes rapping they dont need to be.  the best songs are ruff ryders anthem,damien, x is coming,stop being greedy, and look thru my eyes.  the skits could also have been left out like they always should but besides that great rap cd.  one of the top 3 that i own 
 This book is truly an achievement.  While not intended for true practitioners, the book is entertaining while though provoking at the same time.  I take it with me to my favorite coffee shop sometimes just to open it randomly and read a few pages at a time.  Not only does the author weave great historical moments with the progression of mathematical thought, he covers areas such as physics, art, music, and astronomy.  He has also renewed my interest in taking the subject up again after many years.  I have enrolled in a course in the Calculus based on this as well as other great math books 
 The Marvel Masterworks volume, "The Incredible Hulk, Volume 1" (2nd Edition) brings together the six issues from the original comic book of "The Incredible Hulk," which were published before Ol' Greenskin became one of the co-tenants of "Tales to Astonish" (first with Giant-Man and then Namor, the Sub-Mariner").  Unfortunately the Hulk always seemed to be particularly ill-suited to the 10-page story format since in pretty much every story Bruce Banner changes into the Hulk (or the Hulk changes into Bruce Banner).  For that reason, the original six issues of "The Incredible Hulk" stand out in such marked contrast.  In issue #1 we meet Dr. Bruce Banner, the brilliant scientist who has invented the gamma bomb.  Right before the big test a teenager, Rick Jones, drives out on the site.  Banner goes off to get the boy out of there but his assistant Igor does not tell anybody, thinking this will be a way to get rid of Banner, who pushes Rick into a ravine right before the gamma bomb explodes.  In the hospital Banner changes into the Hulk for the first time, in front of Rick Jones, who feels he should look out for the man-monster seeing as how Banner saved his life, which would tend to create a sense of obligation even in a teenager.  Of course, Rick Jones would go on to the side-kick for not only the Hulk but also Captain America and Captain Marvel.  Ultimately I think the idea of the Hulk is better than the stories, especially the ones being told in these first six issues. The combination of the Dr. Jekyll & Hyde transformation with the Frankenstein monster is inherently interesting. Those classic references also explain why the better stories seem to be those in which the army is going after the Hulk rather than the less than stellar super villains who pop up. Sure, the Leader would be rather ironic from the viewpoint of Dr. Banner, but the best conflicts with the Hulk involve not brains versus brawn but the one against the many. When "Thunderbolt" Ross has the U.S. Army go after the Hulk, then we are cooking with gas. Very few bad guys can go toe-to-toe with ol' green skin.  Issue #2 comes up with the lame Toad Men, #3 has the Ringmaster and the Circus of Crime, #4 offers Mongu the Gladiator from Space, #5 has Tyrannus, and #6 provides the Metal Master.  But not one of them slugs it out with the Hulk, who still finds ways to cause lots of damage to the landscape, buildings and furniture.  The lack of mano-e-mano fisticuffs probably explains why the soap opera element of the Hulk coming between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross are more appealing. That is actually what provides the continuity over the course of these stories.  The end result is okay, but certainly not the best Marvel was putting out in the early Sixties. The origin story is far and away the best of the six stories, and really the only reason to get this one unless you are a really big fan of the Hulk. Stan Lee writes all of the stories and Jack Kirby does most of the art, except for #6, which is done by Steve Ditko.  The stories are reprinted in color, but the idea of comic books being printed in a hardcover edition always strike me as being quite strange 
 Prime Cuts:  All This Love, The Only One, Simple Life  An ominous start preceded the Lost Trailers tenure at BNA Records.  A legal gaffe involving the writer of their vanguard single "Country Fried" refusing to license his copyright to BNA Records, resulted in the pulling of the plug on the single. Corollary to that, "Country Fried" stalled prematurely at the lower rungs of the Billboard charts and it was subsequenly excluded from the album.  However, such a faux pas has not derailed the Lost Trailers in releasing what is quite a sturdy collection of songs that allow these guys to rock with a macho assertiveness and croon with a southern down home charm.  The Lost Trailers is a five men band fronted by Stokes Nielson who has had a hand in co-penning or penning all but one cut.  Nielson, with some vocal nuances of Travis Tritt, also co-produces the album with luminary Blake Chancey (who has also helmed CDs by Dixie Chicks, Jeff Bates, Rockie Lynne and Joy Lynn White among others).  One significant signage that sets the Lost Trailers apart is their biographical songs.  Written after three of their trailers were stolen (hence the name of the group) and a failed record deal, "Why Me" is a lament of why bad things happen to good people.  Performed with a palpable sense of personal urgency that renders this churning rocker as compelling, "Why Me" has hit potential. "Simple Life," also a biographical tune written after Nielson felt sequestered by the urban foliage while living in L.A., is a ballad that pleads for simplicity. "Simple Life," with its scanty clad production of some gentle guitar licks, trumps on its understated performance.  While "The Only One," a track inspired by the damsel of Nielson's life, is a Roy Orbison-esque romantic mid-tempo rocker.  On the other hand, on their sophomore single "Call Me Crazy," Nielson drops his romantic persona for some down and dirty fun performed with youthful abandon.   The only song not penned by Nielson is "All This Love," a track inked by three of Nashville's finest tunesmiths, Paul Overstreet, Jon Randall and Gary Nicholson.  "All This Love," a slow grinding ballad about love lost, has a melody that rivets right to the heart. An ear and a heart opener, "All This Love" adds depth and dimension so often missing in country rock acts.  However, there are a few cuts that are far too predictable as far as the oeuvre of country music is concerned.  "Summer of Love" is your typical coming of age number that calls to mind Deana Carter's "Strawberry Wine."  While the self-declarative "I'm a Country Man" and the extremely busy "Dixie Boy Special" are just displays of blatant machismo without much substance or character.              Overall, the Lost Trailers' debut record for a major label shows promise.  Nielson's bluesy tenor packs a lot of personality especially when he sings of songs that emanate out of his own life.  Especially on the ballads, Nielson shimmers with great sensitivity as well as assertiveness.  However, the major weakness is the predictably of some of the lyrics.  Other than "All This Love" (with its heart rendering word-plays) many of these tracks deal within the safe confines of most country songs: the longing for the rustic life, love found and lost, first love and youthful emancipation.  Truth is there is nothing lyrically revolutionary about Nielson's paeans.  Nevertheless, this is just their first major output, here's hoping that the future will take a better turn for these five young men after their lost trailers and legal clinker.   
 This is a story about the love between people that transends death itself. It also shows that a person is willing to be condemned to hell forever just for the chance to be with the person he/she loves 
 The two standards on this set have Coltrane playing that is simply shocking and shockingly beautiful.  Outstanding Garrison and Jones 
 This was one of my first Sharon Sala books and I loved it! When litle Joey Rossi stumbles into neighbor, Molly Eden's backyard, she is not the only one thrown for a loop when Joey claims her as his mommy. Single parent Joseph Rossi is attracted to the beautiful lady next door, but can't decide whether she is attracted to him for the man that he is, or for the fact that he has a child, something that Molly can never have. As the two get closer, someone from Joseph's past, that he wants to have nothing to do with shows up to complicates things even more. Molly has to learn to trust and believe that the feelings that she and Joseph have for each other and little Joey can withstand anything. This book kept me glued to it for 199 pages nonstop. Short and sweet. It has made a Sharon Sala fan out of me. Now on to the trilogy of THE JUSTICE WAY 
 great watch! I have had mine for several years. very elegant and very lightweight. The only issue I had with the watch is that the black mesh wears off over time. Eventually the whole band turns a metallic gray/black. I recently lost mine after several years of trouble free use and plan on buying a new one even with the worn band.... 
 How can it be that the Schiff cycle is out of print? How does that concept even make sense in 2006?  The one review on the late sonatas by Schiff holds some clues as to why they are so special.  I know that years of listening produces version biases, but I really did try and look past that here, but the C minor 958 is so much less dramatic and compelling in this version. The Schiff version is very hypnotic. Kempff's tempos are totally different. It is interesting, during the runs, there is a tremendous sense of fluidity in Kempff's sound, but in the rest of the piece, it sounds too mechanical.  The same holds for some of the others, though in some of the pieces, for instance, 568, the results are less pronounced.  Ironically, I usually like the less embellished versions of pieces, especially when a composer like Beethoven is involved and performers reinterpret him as a romantic, but in this case, the opposite is true. 958 in Schiff's version sounds like one of the towering achievements of solo piano. Here, the elements are all there, but the overall effect is lost 
 Caddie Woodlawn is one of the best books a girl can read. It is like the little house books only better. I love this bok and recamed it to anyone 
 The Libertines burned bright... and then burned out, when uberjunkie Pete Doherty got kicked out for assorted bad behavior. And from the ashes came two bands, one of which is Carl Barat's new band, Dirty Pretty Things.  Well, it's not exactly a pheonix. Fortunately, the debut "Waterloo to Anywhere" proves that this no Babyshambles -- Barat turns out some wonderfully grimy, raw punk music, reminiscent of the Raveonettes with a blurry Britpop edge. And they even turn up for work on time.  It opens with a solid opener -- the blurry, bizarre "Deadwood," which has cheery vocals and a sort of ominous edge. "You got the world boy/This all you make it?/You had the choice lad/You wouldnt take it," Barat croons cheerfully over a powerful guitar riff. "And what will you do/When they forget your name?"  Well, every artist needs a message song or two, and this seems to be Barat burying his band demons.  With that catchy punk tune as the opener, Dirty Pretty Things rock out with unpretentious gusto in raw tunes like "Gin and Milk," power chords that stretch out into lazy drones, frenetic wild noise ("You f***in love it!") rough rock tunes, stomping punk, and tunes that can be rough and uncertain, or catchy and wild.   If Dirty Pretty Things have a flaw, it's that many of the songs take awhile to separate themselves. On first listening, many of the rockier, catchier sound very alike with all that blurry fuzzy guitar and bass, but as you listen to them a second time, little tune differences start to emerge.   Barat obviously has no musical pretensions, since there isn't really a moment on here that aspires to be more than it is. The production is left deliberately lo-fi and grimy-sounding, which adds a blurred edge to the razor riffs, solid drumming and hard basslines. It really does sound like it was recorded in a garage, which gives it character a lot of rock doens't have.  And Barat also sounds like he's having a lot of fun as he sings. His voice is a pleasant, slightly hoarse one that can jump over the music, and he can be flexible enough to yowl at times. His songs are solidly written, full of insomnia, grimy rooms, and tangled personal relationships. "And I know that she is wise/And she's the apple of my eye/She's my dirty pretty lover/And I want her at my side!"   While he may not get the press that his old bandmate does, Carl Barat shows his musical savvy in "Waterloo to Anywhere," a good debut for a good band 
 With life being so busy for our family and all of us being on the road often, i realized we were neglecting our bible reading. Now we can pick up a disc and listen in the car. I enjoy the Listener's bible very much. It took a little time to get used to the readers English accent but not long. 
 I used this book to design a pattern for a Doublet that I wore to a Mayflower Society function - it was a big hit.  I added my own ideas to it.  One of the members said it was the best they had ever seen.  This book shows pictures of original clothing, then drawings of the patterns of the originals.  Wonderful 
 I haven't read a book this good since "Where The Red Fern Grows". I liked the way it told the story of running away. Something that all kids think or dreama about. It pointed out the fact that whatever you look like is not who you really are. I definately would recommend this book to anyone. It was one of those books that I couldn't put down 
 I think   you should buy this book because its so funny and it is a good book. it is funny because she thinks she has amonster under her bed !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Bradbury's novel opens up with a wonderful prologue describing good months and bad months.  After reading this, I couldn't wait to delve into the novel to discover what other morsels of genius he had to offer.    The story of good versus evil, youth versus death, and love versus hate is timeless.  It will never get old.  It will be recycled in various formats until the day people stop telling stories.  Bradbury uses his story as a vehicle to expound upon these themes.    When a wicked carnival comes to town it tempts its inhabitants with youth and life.  It's hard to say no to your greatest wishes as Will, Jim, and Charles Halloway discover.  Some townsfolk cannot turn their back on their dreams.  Others discover that true happiness means accepting Life's twists and turns, no matter how cruel they may be.  This novel is full of exquisite figurative language.  Bradbury shows his prowess as a storyteller in this tale of good and evil 
 Moses Isegawa knows how to catch a reader with a powerful first paragraph;  While dissapearing into the jaws of a crocodile, a man remembers three  things, and with the capricious nature of memory, those three things are  very different from each other. Why the image of the rotting corpse of an  ox (maggots and all, showing the reader, from page one, what a dexterous  novelist Moses Isegawa is) would have a place next to the face of one  beloved? The protagonists' memories are the answer. This is a novel  narrated by remembrance, punctuated by glimpses so sensual (the ambience of  the coffee plantation of Grandfather when it goes to seed, for example)  that the vividness of this novel is in  close league to the stories of  Gabriel García Márquez, of Salman Rushdie and of Juan Rulfo. It belongs  with them too, in the sense of how the magical is interwoven with the  historical; we knew of the history of Colombia, of India, of México, and in  this case of Uganda, trough the fantastic realities created in these  novels, where the historical was more unbelievable than the magical. The  lushness, the cruelty, the outrageous, all combine seamlessly in a language  so terse and beautiful that the reader will be dazzled 
 It was great to be able to spend $12 to get most of the songs I wanted from this last year.  Between KT Tunstall, James Blunt and Keane on one CD--I couldn't ask for a better compilation. There really isn't a single song I didn't like on this CD and if you want a nice eclectic mix--this is a great one to add to your collection! 
 With fiction there is usually some distance between the reader and the action described.  After all, the reader is seated in a comfortable chair, one assumes, in pleasant surroundings.  But such is not the case with this novel.  The distance between this reader and the story disappeared almost from the beginning, and like the Wedding Guest in Coleridge's poem, I was dragged from Ohio to Mississippi in the heat of summer and forced to witness things I didn't want to see but could not avoid.  The book starts with an intense rape, described in detail.  A ten-year-old black girl is savaged by two cretins and left for dead by the side of the road.  When the girl's father kills the rapists, he is arrested for murder.  The book then focuses on his white defense attorney and the trial of a black man for murdering two whites--in Mississippi--although I suspect the tension would be little different elsewhere in America.  The plot is engrossing and the outcome is satisfying.  It certainly kept me reading late at night, long after I was tired.  The characters are extremely well drawn--diverse, individual, self-contradictory.  The atmosphere of a small county seat in the South is perfect.  After reading the book, I think I could find my way through the court house, the little restaurants and the defense attorney's offices.  The dialogue is just as excellent.  It is difficult sometimes to define exactly what the moral position of the author might be.  He seems even handed, understanding of all the parties and their positions.  That can be annoying at times, but it adds to the truthfulness of the book.  All sorts of people get into the action and not always for or against the defendant but rather for themselves.  There is the NAACP--the local ministers--the ambitious prosecutor--the defense attorney who dreams of fame from this trial--and lastly the ad hoc local KKK.  My only reservation would be in recommending this novel to the faint of heart.  The rape is not the only intense scene in the book.  The reader should be prepared for gasping a few times as the story unfolds.  Still, the trip will be worth it.  Brilliant--that's the only word to describe this. 
 This was a great transaction!  This book was exactly what I was needing.  Thank 
 Absolutely for all who have any interest in pirates.  Beautifully presented and full of interesting information 
 I bought this book by recommendation from other brides and have been VERY satisfied with the results! The exercises are easy to follow, challenging, and fun to do. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to tone up for any reason, but definitely for a bride-to-be! 
 The first time I did this workout, I made it through, maybe 30 minutes before I was DYING! It kicks your butt big time. I've always had good upper body strength, so that part was tough, but I made it through, but seriously, I could not walk down my stairs after the lower body portion, and I did not do all of it. I drink more water working out to my Firm DVD's than I do when I run four miles on my treadmill, 12 ,minute miles. Great Value. It's like having a personal trainer. ALso recommend Cardio Scultp. These Firm dvd's use circuit training to get you in shape. Non stop going, no rest in between except when you have to change your fanny lifter or get a new set of weights. Worth all the pain you feel day after, cause your body will show your hard work. Big Firm believer 
 This is the best compiler book I have read. I have gone through 4 different compiler books. All have clear problems. This one is totally different, it is easy to read and understand. Furthermore, it is full of examples and come with solution manual for instructors. IMHO, it is the most suitable textbook for an introductory course in compilers 
 I love me some Good Times if I am not reading a book. I am watching Good Times. This is my favorite season with Penny (Janet Jackson). I used to do my homework while watching Good Times. I thank whomever came up with the idea of putting it on DVD 
 This album was my favourite record of the 1989-90 season. We were fortunate enough to have Eurythmics tour Australia in December, and they played several songs from this album at the concert I attended here in Hobart, including the wonderful ballad Angel and the elegant, stylish pop of Don't Ask Me Why. Other choice cuts include the valedictory When The Day Goes Down , which for 10 years stood as a fitting coda to the group's terrific run of 80's songs, and the jaunty, lighthearted single Revival. This record has a professional pop sheen to it that marks it as being from the late phase of the band's career, and the quirky, ear-catching sounds of the Eurythmics' innovative early 80's records are missing, yet it's still a good album 
 I was so excited when I found out that Jet was putting out a new album.  As an almost 35 year old, I grew up in the Hair Band era.  I've taken a liking to straight ahead rock and roll, and these days it's hard to find any bands that simply play this type of music.  Bands today are either too soft or too heavy.  Until Jet came around, the only "newer" rock band that I still enjoyed was Collective Soul, and they're not exactly new anymore.  I always find myself listening to my AC/DC collection for the one millionth time, pulling out a Rolling Stones CD, or throwing in some hair bands for a little nostalgia.  Onto Jet...I loved Jet's first album.  The intriguing mix of AC/DC meets the Beatles fascinated me, and I listened again and again.  The new album, Shine On, is very good.  I had to listen to it a few times through before I began appreciating it (my expectations were so high, it was almost impossible to meet).  There are a great mix of rockers and ballads.  I don't hear, however, the same "radio friendly" tunes of Get Born, and I bet sales will be down.  However, if you enjoyed the first Jet album and like normal, classic sounding rock, you'll enjoy this one, too.  Best song..."Bring it on Back" 
 Obama is perhaps the most straightforward and candid as a politician can ever be without putting a spin on issues. It is ridiculous with the rhetoric laden political speeches and punchlines have become. Most politicians these days, spend more time looking ahead at their political future than at issues at hand. Obama, you have my vote.  Ibrahim Ajibode -- Author (Diary of an Immigrant; In pursuit of the American Dream  
 Very Good product easy to use 
 I read this book with the hope of understanding the direction in which History is moving. The historical analysis of the decline of the Hapsburgs or the travails of the Napoleonic era interested far less than did the last chapter devoted to giving some sense of the world at the time the book was written. 1987. At that time and even perhaps more so now there is endless talk and debate about the question of whether the world's only superpower is moving toward greater hegemony, or perhaps to decline and then disaster. One only needs to survey the attitudes of most nations to the United States today to see that it has never been more hated and demonized than today. Kennedy is more interested in analysis of economic, military and ultimately political relations. The implicit conclusion of his book made by most readers at the time it was first published was that he was really predicting an inevitable American decline. In other words all the historical chapters were really preparation for the speculative chapter on America's future. And this though Kennedy made certain to hedge and distinguish clearly between the historical analysis and the speculation.  Now as I write this in January 2005 a couple of days after President Bush's second inaugural calling for a new birth of liberty throughout the world I wonder what Kennedy surmises. The great US productivity boom that came in the nineties, the great prosperity, the total military dominance displayed by the US seemed to suggest that Kennedy's picture of US decline was mistaken. But today in a time of massive deficit budgets, with an economically revived and increasingly powerful Europe, with China growing at such a rapid rate there is the question of how long the superpower can hold on. The emeging great superpower China seems to be threatening US interests in many places, and perhaps will eventually replace it as leader of the world.  My own sense is that Kennedy aware of the place of surprise in history by no means expected his work to be taken as an argument for America's inevitable decline. However anyone who reads his book will have a strong sense of how the mighty have fallen in the past, and how their successors may fall in the future. And this raising the question of how American can be wise so as to not fall. And here Kennedy's suggestion seems to be the very opposite of what President Bush suggests. Kennedy warns against overextending oneself, and President Bush seems ready to extend and extend in a quest to defeat the terrorists who would topple the United States. 
 The ten short stories in this collection are definitely masterpieces. Neither too long or too short, the stories suggest whole worlds, entire lives (and deaths) with just the right number of verbal brushstrokes. Never preachy or self-righteous, they are yet infused with a deep, complex spirituality that seems to consist of an eccentric and compelling hybrid of Roman Catholicism's quiet mysticism and Southern Protestantism's revivalism and rigor. That said, this is not "chicken soup for the soul"...pretty much every story has a dark edge, and in most of them the author gets you with this impending sense of dread that things are going to go to heck in a hand basket, the only question is how (this makes the book awfully hard to put down, by the way). And she has an incredible talent of capturing the rhythms and characteristic expressions of Southern English without too much Mark Twain twang. In short, this is hands down a classic of American literature 
 Book was not long and drawn out.  It was very interesting and gave a very good perspective of the life of a WWII Fighter Pilot.  I enjoyed it very much 
 I have been a Christian over thirty years; but in recent months, I have really struggled with my Christianity.  Occasionally, I catch myself stacking rocks as the third brother in "The Parable of the River;" and I need a reminder of God's unfathomable love.  In the Grip of Grace is that type of reminder.  Emotionally gripping, Lucado's easy-flowing style guides the reader through the best and thankfully, most entertaining commentary on the book of Romans I have ever read.  The introduction to the endearing Billie Jack was worth the price of the book!  In the Grip of Grace is the literary equivalent of hot tea on a cold day; and I would definitely recommend it to both Christians and non-Christians 
 This box set is very good with the first two installments being excellent. The last Die Hard is just a good movie.  Bruce Willis is perfect in this role and Bonnie Bedelia is terrific as his wife. Speaking of Bonnie Bedelia she is not in the last installment of these movies. There in lies a huge problem with the movie. But still this is a great ride for all. I highly recommend you purchase this package. 
 This is one of the best books I have read on how the Biblical view of marriage and family fits into culture- any culture.  Since, this is based in Africa you would think that it the contents would be very territorial, but it transcends that.  I would recommend this book especially to people living in cultures foreign to their own as well as those who have questions about how Biblical principles (which are very ancient) apply in this present day 
 Mr. Russo has written a book that seems to say that a mob of Russian-American Jews really ran the mob activities during the last century. In this book, he mainly discusses the life of Sidney Korshak, a lawyer working Los Angeles that was called 'The Fixer.'   This was at a time when most of us thought that the Italians, especially those from Sicily, controlled the mob activities in most of the United States. And I don't see any references in this book to various centers of mob related activities such as New Orleans.   Mr. Russo presents an interesting survey of mob related activities, but essentially concentrates on the LA/Hollywood scene. And this could indeed have been the case. It's a ways to go however, from there to considering this to be the SuperMob over the rest of the country, the rest of the crime. Mr. Russo certainly seems to see a major conspiracy running the country. It makes interesting reading.   It is important to remember as you read the book that Sid Korshak was never arrested, never even got a parking ticket (unless of course the were all fixed) 
 A great opportunity to see two of the worlds finest Actors toe to toe in this gritty drama about the Army in post war (1945) Britain. Mill's portrayal of Stiff Upper Lip Barrow and Guinness's 'Jock Sinclair' is a masterpiece. The resentment of the two officers to each other grows until the climax of the film.  SPOILER BELOW  The most saddest moment is Guinness at the end supported by some his his fellow officers after breaking down following his animated version of the Funeral procession that will take place. 
 The last words from the gentle and loving pen of Yorkshire's beloved veterinarian is balm for the troubled soul.   Herriot skillfully manoeuvres the tight and narrow highwire between genuine humanity and bathos without a stumble, and with loads of kind and respectful humor, often self-deprecating, without being maudlin.   This is a must for all Herriot fans and would even serve to convert those animal lovers who have yet to discover this charmingly whimsical, yet so real gentleman vet and his lovely books 
 Reads like an adventure novel, but what an enjoyable way to learn so much historical fact.  
 David Berlinski certainly was not an English major; his book often rambles, he goes on lengthy side trips and his discussions with his editor and agent can be irritating to anyone wanting to understand the subject of his book "The Advent of the Algorithm."  Many reviewers have reason to criticize his eccentric writing style and digressions, which do not clarify as much as one would like.  Still, I found this book quite fascinating.  For that reason I gave it four stars, when I might have given it three.  For one thing (as noted by an earlier reviewer,) Berlinski's descriptions of Gödel, Turing, von Neumann and other logicians and mathematicians are very good.  For another I have to admit that I sort of liked the digressions!  The story by "Irving" (I think that he means Isaac- the editing is somewhat uneven!) Bashevis Singer certainly had little to do with mathematics or algorithms, but it was an interesting discourse on the difficulties of argumentative logic!  Now if Berlinski had only followed his editor's advice and made the book flow better!  He certainly has the knowledge of his subject to do so. Perhaps algorithms require a unique mind to really understand them!  Perhaps he is in some way saying this, but he does beat around the bush a bit in the process!  I do tend to agree with him about the difficulties in transferring human thought into mathematical formulae.  Mathematics can do a lot and it is possible that someone may find a way to develop such a perfect mathematical theory or description of the human brain, but I doubt it.  The same can be said of the universe itself.  That is the reason that there is some room for religion, even if it is not quite as grandiose a realm as early theologians might have thought. In addition I would worry that if such a theory is possible, humans could not be trusted with it.   This book is worth reading for the scattered gems, although the average reader may have a bit of a time finding them! Still with some effort they can be found 
 I mistakenly bought this book thinking it would teach me how to write travel articles.  Actually it might benefit aspiring travel writers to study the greats of the genre.  This analyzes in-depth Graham Greene, Bruce Chatwin, Mary Kingsley, James Boswell, Peter Matthiessen, and V.S. Naipaul. Along with studying them, you learn about types of travel writing (nature travel, modern psychological journey, vain travelers, Victorian women travelers).  This combination of history of travel writing and literary criticism makes heavy reading but should be useful to those wondering "what was Bruce Chatwin trying to say in Songlines?"  
 Ok, so I found myself saying this before - not really becuz Guilty Pleasures was my fav til this one.  NO - not because of the sex scene w/Jason in it (that whole deal actually ended up pretty gross).  Not because of the bath & towel scene w/Jean-Claude, although that was a mighty nice addition.  It's my favorite because it showed different sides to both Anita and Jean-Claude; vulnerable sides.  It showed Anita's weakness to memories of her mother and her yearning for those memories to return, even though she knows they're just memories.  And it also shows how she is susceptible to the power of an older vampire, Serephina.  In books like Circus of the Damned, she became Alejandro's human servant but she managed to kill both Mr. Oliver & Alejandro quite easily.  In this one, she shows resistance & also self-sacrifice for JC & Larry's well being.    What bugs me is how Anita says in each book that Jean-Claude hid his powers under the rule of Nikolaos & that he's much more powerful than he seems to reflect.  There's no denying he's intelligent since he's able to turn every situation w/Anita to his benefit & the fact that he's a very successful businessman.  But this human (ok, necromancer but still human) Anita has killed her 4th master vampire in this novel (sorry for the spoiler but you knew it was coming anyway, right?), each of which are centuries older than JC.  He couldn't go up against masters one-on-one.  Not w/Nikolaos, Mr. Oliver or even Janos.  Speaking of Janos, that makes Anita's count 6 master vampires including Janos & Ivy (regardless of the use of fire).  Sorry for the spoiler again.    Anita saves his butt yet again.  Although you could predict the bath scene w/JC was to up the volume on the sexual tension between the two, it was nice how LKH fit in a glimpse of JC's past.  Then there's Anita's internal struggle with her feelings/lust towards JC.  When they move to the bedroom, that must have been one of the best parts of the book.  NO - they don't "do it".  JC admits to Anita that he loves her as much as he is possible.  Then not only does he not hide his fear of what the sun can do (regardless of the centuries worth of practice) he even allows her to watch as he dies in his sleep.   LKH has an afterward that explains it as a transitional book.  I saw some of Anita's transitions in The Lunatic Cafe too though (her lack of sympathy to killing) which shines even more in this novel as Larry continues to remind her right from wrong.    Now I just have to prepare myself for the downfall of Anita (as other readers explain happens) as she give herself to lust novel after novel.  I will try to keep an open mind.  I don't mind the sex scenes but I'm not waiting for plots to falter either.  If it was a preference between shallow storylines or steamy love scenes, I'd prefer a good story line - hands down 
 I was about 10 years old or so when my father bought this album. I loved it from the very moment I heard it. Now ten years later I went out and bought my own copy because I remembered how deep and fresh it was. The vocal harmony is amazing even if Fred and Keith were absent. Not to mention to powerful message thats behind every track no matter who produced it.My favorite tracks are "They Must Know" "Crucified With Christ" and "Do You Still Love Me".I highly recommend this album to any and everyone if you don't already have it.You can't help but to be encouraged by it 
 I picked up THE BEAR WENT OVER THE MOUNTAIN because I ran out of books to read.   In addition, I failed to read any of the book reviews (like I usually do) until after completing it.  I'm glad I waited because if I did, I wouldn't have read this fairy tale.   I found many of the reviews overly negative.    However, I understand why.   Readers who have experienced "competitive" publishing would have a deep appreciation for the nuances and symbols within Kotzwinkle's work.  I can easily see how readers without such an experience would find THE BEAR WENT OVER THE MOUNTAIN too quirky at best -- and too stupid at worst.     As I was reading the description of how Hal Jam acquired his first manuscript, I began to think of a particular faculty member that has remained a tenured assistant professor for well over 10 years.   He's never been able to write or conduct research independently.   As it often goes, one thought leads to another.   I recall that during my own mentoring, senior faculty would constantly warn me to beware of sharing my ideas and work with other faculty.   Although I am a full professor, the ideas presented to me all those years ago didn't click until after I read THE BEAR WENT OVER THE MOUNTAIN.   Now I am conceptualizing assistant and associate professors as bears or non bears.  I have concluded that I am in a department with at least one bear.  A good novel has the capacity to induce a reader to rethink or broaden one's life situation.   To put it in another way -- to see old or familiar experiences within a new light (a paradigm shift).  For professors, THE BEAR WENT OVER THE MOUNTAIN offers a fresh perspective for an everyday event. 
 How do wars start?  This is an important question and one that historians throughout the centuries have spent exploring.  In the case of WWI, this Nobel-Prize winning work by Barbara Tuchman provides a simple, concise and well-documented answer.  The military leaders on both sides, Allies and Central Powers, thought they had the perfect plans for defeating the other side, and thought that if they threw enough men and arms at it from the get-go, they could convince the other side to back down within months of the first gunshots.  Consequently, the political leaders of both sides believed their generals and hence played up the public chest-pounding in the spring and summer of 1914, hence providing little political room for admissions of defeat.  But what happens when neither side decides to back down?  The result is a 4-year bloodbath known as WWI.  This is the cause of WWI.  Each side laid plans that provided a clear cut way to success, but neither side laid plans that provided a clear way to a tolerable, if not honorable, defeat.  So each side fought on, hoping for victory, and sacrificing everything to get it.    The author, one of America's top female historians, supports her thesis with plenty of references to primary sources from the period.  These include diaries of leaders, military plans, battlefield reports, etc, etc...  The result is probably one of the best case studies of war published in America during the 20th century.  I highly recommend this book 
 This movie takes one of Robert A. Heinlein's books and attempts to translate it into film. This film follows the general precept of the book that mankind is in a war with a race of insect-like creatures that have various castes. As with the book the movie does not attempt to resolve the war, but does intend on providing some hope.  Heinlein has been called the Dean of Science Fiction. Because of his phenomenal success he was able to write beyond the boundaries of many of his contemporaries to express his viewpoints regarding society. The novel on which this movie was based was laced with several political viewpoints as well as predicting a future for the military that we can be seen as the trend of our military today.  When Heinlein wrote this novel in 1959 he tried to convey the simple concept that citizenship in the most free society on earth was taken for granted.  Heinlein thought that perhaps one way of changing the definition of citizenship was to require that it be earned. Thus Heinlein advocated that all citizens should give two years of public service. Some people have narrowly construed this service to mean military service, but in his book Heinlein clearly stated that the service was governmental service and did not specify the type of service. In any case, earning the right to vote was central to the book. That concept was minimally discussed in the movie in favor or making an action-packed military monster movie.  Heinlein's future military was focused on the individual, with incredible weapons and training. Interestingly, our military continues to rely on ever-better weaponry with the individual soldier wielding ever more power and hopefully having better training as time passes. Again, the movie threw out this concept in order to make the movie move faster with multiple rescue scenarios. While Heinlein's bugs were not sympathetic, by having the bugs callously destroy a chunk of Earth real estate enables the audience to loathe them even more.  After throwing out two of Heinlein's key concepts, the result is a B science fiction movie with lots of gore and action. However, even with traditional science fiction themes, I liked this movie. The acting is only fair, much of the movie is "golly gee whiz" and salute the flag, and the plot has more holes than cheesecloth, and for all that it is a fun and exciting movie that I have watched at least four or five times. Some of the scenes are dramatic and scary, such as when the flying bugs attack and when the ground bugs spear people. The scenes with the tanker bugs are incredible.  I have spent too much time trying to figure out how their burning dissolving fluid works.  There are places in the movie that are likely implausible, and yet, maybe not. When Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) pilots a huge spaceship out of dock she does it by eye and barely keeps from damaging the ship and the dock. Clearly not standard operating procedure and had the ship been damaged she would have been fried (or should have) by her boss. However, she is cocky and overconfident and takes responsibility and authority, all traits that we try to cultivate in our military within the framework of standard military discipline. So perhaps parts are a bit far-fetched, but maybe not too far-fetched.  One aspect that I think Heinlein would have approved is the brutality of military training. People broke bones and suffered pain, just as they would in actual combat, though situations that cause death are clearly unacceptable. While the scenes of injury in training are initially shocking, medical technology in this future has the capability of repairing such injuries and being capable of handling the shock of seeing those injuries or withstanding them could give a soldier a combat advantage in the field; gruesome, but effective scenes.  The film was intended to be shocking, and it succeeds. This movie is not for children. I would not let anyone under the age of 14 watch this movie, even though there are a few video games with similar levels of violence. I think the movie is too violent for even young teenagers, and it deserves its "R" rating. There are a few scenes involving nudity and one involving sex that again may be shocking, but given the equality of men and women in this army of the future, the scenes make sense.  I have read the book and I still like the movie. This movie is not going to win any awards, but who cares? I think this is a great bowl of popcorn movie action film where you can relieve some stress as thousands of bugs are gruesomely terminated. There are times when you really want to root for the human race, and this one allows you to do so without guilt. 
 Ruth Galloway's simple yet exuberant color illustrations highlight her story of Fidgety Fish, a playful young fish whose excessive energy comes in handy when a much bigger fish decides he would make a nice snack! Fidgety Fish is an upbeat, simple, friendly and appealing story presented with charm and zest 
 There are a number of ways of reading this book. Philosophically, magically and on a practical level. Having bought it in 1979 I had to wait for the internet to be able to discuss the various aspects of this book with other people who have read it particularly since some aspects of it are not easy for the neophyte and one could not find Bardon readers round the corner. I started my own discussion group and a few months later a real professional group was set up so I dropped mine.Discussion groups also offered the opportunity to clarify some of its more obscure points while as it encouraged those who were more advanced along the path to write books on the matters discussed in the IIH in order to explain teh more obscure areas and adress readers questions. Thus the involvement in IIH can be total for the seeker. One progresses along the path of magic at one's own pace finding light along the way.  On a personnal basis, this book opened the gates of all religions. I realised but more importantly understood the basis of all religions as a result. There is an emphasis on the Jewish Kaballah but only as a base. By understanding the true meaning of religion and the world beyond this book has a direct philosophical influence. By teaching the art of magic, this book opens up possibilities for the seeker. And, by providing practical steps for the development of one magic's powers on a physical, mental and psychic level, one develops into a new human beeing.   With this understanding and the accompanying mastery and development one becomes a much better Jew Christian or whatever religion one is brought up in because one then perceives the religion from above as the real ray of light and not from below as some sort of dogma to be accepted.   Through this book, your heart enters in the world of religion and magic.  Highly reccomended even if you are just a passive reader and not an active achiever on the path of magic. 
 First off, I have four bookshelves from the floor to the ceiling covered with books about Alfred Hitchcock so I know it when I say it... this is the best book you'll ever read about Alfred Hitchcock and his movies. Notice I say his movies because the Grams and Wikstrom book is the book you need to read if you want to explore Hitchcock's television work.  For the most part, this publication is one long lengthy interview and is approached from a director's stand-point.  Truffaut explores every aspect and Hitchcok took the time to explore and explain why he did what he did in his films, from his cameo appearances to the trick shots.  You'll learn what movies Hitchcock admitted he wanted to do and couldn't resolve the problems (like Phone Booth).  This book comes highly recommended 
 I found this book to be well written and an excellent example of how it is possible to turn your own life around if you have the will power to do so.The previouse two books in the trilogy have to be read to fully understand the strength of character that Dave Pelzer must have 
 I love travel mags, and this one is like the magazine  Adventure, but adds more of a tourist bent without losing the original edginess  that is  adventure writing 
 This book includes the writings of the ancient Roman writer, Tacitus, as he follows the campaigns of Agricola into Anglesey and northern Scotland. He also follows closely the campaigns into Germania, a country as untamed as Scotland.   The reader is given a vivid look into an ancient world, but through the eyes of the conqueror and not the conquered. Still, this is a masterpiece of information about a lost time. The translation was done very well by Harold Mattingly and his introduction sheds light on Tacitus' life and literary career, the governorship of Agricola and Rome's political backgroud in an everchanging empire. The two maps of Roman Britain and Germania were an added surprise.    I was a little disappointed that Tacitus did not give more descriptions on the native tribes of Scotland in The Agricola. For this reason, I felt that The Germania stood out much more. His vivid descriptions of the German tribes and their religious beliefs was wonderful to read.   I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Roman history and/or the native tribes of Scotland and Germania.   
 I am really tired of all these people going around and giving one star ratings for every album of remakes just because it's an album of remakes!!!  I suppose they would give someone a bad concert review because their live vocals were not the original recording!  Judge each individual recording on it's own merits please (1) are the vocals good? (2) are the songs good? (3) is the production good? Ok, these remakes are not as an outstanding a production as the originals yet these are still very enjoyable tracks with Kitty singing remarkably strong well into her senior years. 
 For certain numbering systems, one must content oneself with either being consistent but incomplete or complete but inconsistent.  In his description of the uses and abuses of Godel's theorem Torkel Franzen adeptly discusses the theorem and its various misuses.  Along with a plethora of other recent books on Godel (including the Pulitzer Prize winning "Godel, Escher and Bach") Franzen's book testifies mightily to the great public interest that attaches to this unique brilliant man and his theorem.  With this much public interest, the attendant public confusion is all the more understandable.  Franzen has done us all a great service by producing a book to alleviate this confusion 
 I just purchased this new cookbook by Deborah and I am not disappointed.  Deborah Madison comes across as a teasured friend in all of her cookbooks.  You can't help but trust all of her tips and recipes because she is so passionate about fresh, healthy food.  In Local Flavors, she packs the book with so much information about shopping and enjoying farmers markets.  Buying and using fruits & vegetables in season is not only practical, but ensures you are getting the most delicious produce.  This book is for all who believe in "eating by the seasons" and for those who support locally grown foods 
 The auther is fantastic, the book is well written otherwise he wouldn't have got the 4 stars, the book covers the subject from A to Z literally speaking, a must have, BUT it is too much outdated 
 I have loved this movie ever since I saw it on television and watch it whenever it is on (it's been some time now) and I plan to buy it.  Waterston has never been better as the understanding and loving father.  I didn't realize when I first saw it that Reese Witherspoon was the daughter (that was before Reese Witherspoon became Reese Witherspoon).  A heartbreaking, beautifully acted and must-see film.  Rings true to life.  They certainly don't make movies like this anymore, and it's a shame 
 My method of judging a translation of the Tao te Ching is to immediately open to chapter 15 and read.  In this case....  Alert, like men aware of danger Courteous like visiting guests Yielding, like ice about to melt Simple, like uncarved blocks of wood  Can't get better than that.  I am probably in the minority in that I didn't care much for the photos.  Seemed uninspiring to me.  Hence, 4 stars not 5.  Buy for the text 
 Excellent cases.If you are an operations professional, you'll study, learn  and live by whats discussed here. There are a couple of examples that seem  dated here, but that is to get the fundamentals right and I dont complain!   I am a believer in HBR and this one again goes on to prove why 
 more informative issues of religion.. everyone should read these books. its about time the small minded wake u 
 This book is an excellent resource for someone trying to learn GIS Application development using ArcGIS. Material covers different topics in very detailed manner and the videos accompanied on the CD are very helpful in learning the software. One can start learning at one's own pace without much help from anyone else 
 This is the only book I've found that tells you step by step how to do the many tricks listed, but also how to use the steps to get your dog to perform anything you want.  My dog rolled over after 5 minutes on his 2nd try.  And his methods are not cruel, by "correction" he means saying the word "no" or tugging on the leash a bit.  No where in there does he mention slapping or beating the dog.  Very useful boo 
 I have previously owned another dog, but this is my first puppy.  This book taught me a lot about how to train a puppy correctly.  I recommend this book to any first time puppy owner 
 The filter is the make and size recommended by the manufacturer of the humidifier.  It works really well.  
 Annie Sprinkle has proven herself to be a true pioneer within the porn industry. She pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable and in doing so made people notice her. I witnessed her "Public Cervix Announcement" and it forever changed my thinking towards sex and sexuality. This book is a compendium in text and photo of her accomplishments. As a pioneer who pushed the boundaries of taste as far as sexuality is concerned, she loosened up Americas inhibitions and in doing so made a place for herself in the world of sex and porn. Annie Sprinkle truly is/was a post porn modernist in every sense. This book will let you vicariously see her career through her photos and words 
 When  Swiper  swiped  the friendship bracelets by  mistake,  he and  Dora are  teaming  up  to  travel around  the  world.  I  really  liked  it  when they  super  jumped  over  the  Great  Wall  of  China.  I  love  the  way  they  say  hello in  Chinese. My  first  favorite  part  was  when Dora  and  Swiper  traveled  to China.  My  second  favorite  part  was  when  Dora  and Swiper  saved  Friendship Day.  It  was  so funny  when  they  made silly  faces to  make  the  Troll  laugh.  My  favorite  sill  face was  when  Swiper  pulled  his  ears,  covered  the sides  of  his  head  with them, and crossed  them  under  his  chin.  That  was  so  funny. I  like  the  Chinese  song  Dora  and  Swiper  sang 
 I have been looking for a book just like this for a long time. I have always wondered why no one ever put out a watercolor book on negative painting. With this great book I believe I have found a path up the rungs of the ladder. 
 Nearly all of the movies made from Kurt Vonnegut's books are simply awful (HAPPY BIRTHDAY WANDA JUNE, MOTHER NIGHT, BREAKFEST OF CHAMPIONS). There is one delightful exception -- SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE. The makers of this film took the time and trouble to make their movie subtle. They accepted the fact that Vonnegut has never appealed to the loud, over-stimulated, self-absorbed, resource-guzzling masses. Kurt's books appeal directly to the depressed, quiet, suffering young men and women who are still in school and can still think deeply about life.  The hero, Billy Pilgrim, is pretty much carried along by the events happening around him. He finally sees the insanity of trying to take charge of his own life and learns to simply accept things the way they are. This is essentially a Taoist tale. Most stories told by Vonnegut are from a Taoist perspective. The hero is dropped into the middle of a meat grinder of a life and told repeatedly that he must not allow himself to be turned into hamburger. But, contrary to his most feverish and guilt-ridden efforts, he is turned into hamburger. When he finally accepts the reality of being a lump of hamburger, life becomes a little easier for him to deal with.  
 Of all the Bergman studies available, this is the most lucid and detailed. A good read as well! Recommended for Bergman scholars as well as for those wanting to learn more about the great director. Fine cross-over text 
 When you start reading a book and you can't put it down.  When you regret that you are not reading it because you have to do something else.  When no-part of the book is boring (here I have to accept that the last six or seven pages of the penultimate chapter (pages 370-376), after the hostage release, are boring, but you must read them to understand the book's finish).  When you can't guess what'll happen in the next page.  When everything you read could be true.  When you think that the book is already finish with a fairy tale end and you have to read 40 more pages to read an excellent end.  With all these points, the book deserves SIX stars.  And I almost forget that you'll learn very important things about the Deaf people

 I just finished reading The Coming Collapse of the Dollar and How to Profit From It By James Turk & John Rubino published in 2004. James Turk is founder of GoldMoney.com, the leading digital gold currency payment system. John Rubino is the author of How to Profit from the Real Estate Bust.  I've posted a lot about inflation and gold, the Federal Reserve, and the destruction of the US Dollar. I have read about the inflation that Germany experienced after WWII, the devaluation of the Mexican Peso and the Argentine Peso. If that is our future, I wanted to have some idea of what is in store for us and. The book is divided into four parts and is well written and difficult concepts are explained well:  Part One - Why the dollar will collapse Part Two - Money Then and Now Part Three - Wht Gold Will Soar Part Four - Profiting From The Dollar's Collapse  In part one we learn that we have a fiat currency, backed by nothing except a decree that the US Dollar is legal tender. Throughout history, in order for governments to satisfy demands without raising taxes, a government not only begins to debase its money, but inflates as well. Both are happening in the US and no government has been successful. We have a history of that in this country with the Continentals and the Confederate currency, both worthless.  Another fact that dooms our currency is that we have too much debt. Total unfunded liabilities of the US are in excess of $43 Trillion, as a society we owe another $37 Trillion and Derivatives are in excess of $200 Trillion.  Then we have a trade imbalance which just topped $800 Billion for 2005. We have been up in arms lately by the Chinese wanting to buy Unocal, then Dubai wanting to own our eastern port management companies and Dubai wanting to own some of our critical defense industry by trying to buy Doncasters Turk and Rubino point out on p31:      Foreign investors now own about $8 trillion of U.S. financial assets, including 13 percent of all U.S. stocks, 24 percent of corporate bonds, 43 percent of Treasury bonds, and 14 percent of government agency debt. By the end of 2003, about a third of Fannie Mae's mortgage-backed bonds were being sold outside of the U.S.   That was in 2003 and it has gotten considerably worse. What's in store for us:      Over time, the gap between tax revenue and the demands placed on government tends to grow, and spending, borrowing, and currency creation begin to expand at increasing rates. Inflation accelerates, and the populace comes to see the process of "debasement" for what it is: the destruction of their savings. They abandon the currency en masse, spending it or converting it to more stable forms of money as fast as possible. The currency's value plunges (another way of saying prices soar), wiping out the accumulated savings of a whole generation. Such is the fate of every fiat currency.   The government wants to keep this game going as long as possible by issuing phony CPI numbers, then by excluding energy and food, concentrating on a "core" rate. Phoney low inflation numbers keep bond yields down and "COLA" adjustments low. What is the housing bubble, but selling USDs for a tangible asset. Gold is a warning sign and a rising gold exchange rate is fought by capping and leasing gold, until the central banks are short 12,000 to 16,000 tons. And now one of the tools Turk and Rubino use, The Fear Index, to gauge where gold is going in the next few years will be handicapped by the ending of release of M3 data.  Turk and Rubino do an excellent job of instructing you in Part Four. Can you profit from your knowledge of an impending collapse of the dollar? How can you protect yourself? How can you protect your accumulated savings?  I highly recommend this book to professional and novice, alike 
   I just finished reading A World Beyond, it was the first book that I had read by Ruth Montgomery, it was loaned to me and it is changing the course of my life.  Before finishing the book, I ordered a replacement because it is not a book I intend to part with.  I have read several books on topics of this kind, since I started reading these type of books about 12 years ago;  I have kept an open mind to the possibilities of the things I've read being true.  Some may be and some may not.  I believe Ruth is one of those writers who wrote as an act of love and that all she wrote is true or at least was true at the time *.  I have also just received her book The World To Come, I couldn't put it down from the moment I received it. It is very important that these two books be read by as much of humanity as possible. * In The World To Come the guides have revised the information relating to when the earth's shift will happen and explain why the change has occurred.  The information in these two books alone will change your world if you are searching for the truth and our purpose here.  For people like one of the other readers who left a review of 1 star; don't just read a couple of chapters and dare to speak on a subject you hardly know anything about.  You are doing a disservice to some that otherwise would gain spiritual growth and preparedness for the continuation of our lives beyond this plane.  Ruth has mentioned Swedenborg in A World Beyond, after much research I have ordered several books of his.  It was the 1st time a had ever heard of him, come to find out he was considered to have an IQ perhaps higher than Einstein's.  Ruth has opened my heart and mind broader than I could possibly have imagined in such little time.  Read, study and share these books and our world will be a better place for our children and our future lives.  I would love to translate these books into Spanish just to be able to reach so many more people.  Because of these books, I have realized that we have an obligation to ourselves as well as the world to use all of our talents to make positive contributions to the world, which in turn affects us all.  Every good deed that each one of us contributes brings us a step closer to accomplishing our mission on Earth.  Each day, we must keep in mind that we set a goal for our soul before coming to earth to reach a higher level of progression and understanding of the Universal laws and we do this by thinking always of others and sharing our love and knowledge with them and always lending a hand, as well as concerning ourselves with helping others whenever possible.  
 This book is simply indespensible, if one is serious about his trading. I have been trading for about 4yrs now. And only purchased the book because its a pre-requiste for CFT exams.  I am amazed at how its has changed my prespectives towards trade managment.  Again an absolute must if you want to commit funds trading in a relaxed & profitable manner.   I am quite sure that the LORD, could have bestowed his Grace on Magee, and placed him in paradise because of it.   GOD REST HIS SOUL 
 My mother bought this album when I was about 10. Her, my sister, and I listened to it constantly in the months and years after my parents got divorced and it became an album of anthems for our new-found life together. We are now on our 4th copy! After hearing the rest of Paul Simon's career I feel it embodies the best of his solo work 
 I received this book almost right away.  It's a very good summary of the people of Las Vegas written by someone who knows, John Smith 
 I am a Reiki II, but I found that this author's insights regarding the intelligence of the power and the accessing of the energy itself, and especially, the discussions regarding the use of ritual to be incredibly on the mark, and matching my own experience.  
 With an album produced exclusively by DJ Premier, you can't lose. Primo's production has been known to take lyricists to the next level - a level some of them don't even deserve to be on. Jeru holds his own on these Primo tracks. His lyrics run deep and his delivery is on point throughout. Basically, though, I find that the beat determines whether I felt the tracks moreso than the rhymes did. Tracks like "The Frustrated Ni**a", "One Day", "Scientifical Madness" and "Me Or the Papes" would be good regardless of who was on them. Jeru does them all justice though. Not every song is a banger, but this is an album that I can listen to all the way through. Solid production and good rhymes. Bordering on classic status 
 Dr. & Mr. Doris Haggis-on-Whey are headmasters at the internationally renowned school of scientifically silly wits. As thought leaders, the headmasters offer Giraffes almost as a page-turning version of Monty Python 
 Call of Duty 2 puts you in the role of three different people - Vasili, John Davis, and Bill Taylor - during three highly intense but different WW2 campaigns.  You see the war through each of these soldiers eyes, so in otherwords, its a first person shooter. Anyway, you get a lot of authentic WW2 weapons which include Panzershreks, MP40s, M1 Garands, Thompsons, etc and you get to shoot and blow up things like Halftracks and Tiger Tanks. Ontop of that, you get smoke & frag grenades to toss around at will. There is a multiplayer which is pretty fun - you pick a team (ie: British, Nazis, Americans..you get it) and go toe to toe with a friend or friends in random places that has WW2 history.  The objectives in each level sually require you to either clear out houses room by room, snipe out mortar teams, fend off a massive German counterattack, or place a bomb on something. Its pretty fun and intense because you'll be fighting off wave after wave of Nazis and artillery while trying to achieve your goal, but it becomes sorta repetitive during the later levels..  I want to stress the word "intense" on this game. You will always be on your toes, always firing at hordes of enemies. This game isn't easy, even on the easy difficulty, and is ridiculously hard on the Veteran difficulty. The hardest in my opinion is the American campaign during the battle of Point Du Heuc... if you think Medal of Honor: Frontline's Arnhem Knights level is difficult, wait till you see this. Also, this game is pretty long so don't try rushing it hah.  Moving on, you'll be fighting in very detailed and wartorn areas such as Egypt, France, Russia, and even Germany. I was impressed with the beautiful looking enviroments when up close, and the character models look amazing. However, the levels feel kind of linear. You are pretty limited as to where you can go, but I guess we can look past that.  The sound effects were great - I really loved the explosions. The voice acting was great, and actually helpful because your allies would be like "Kraut on the 2nd floor, black building" and basically point out enemies to you.  What lowered this game from being a 9? Well for starters its in a genre that has been basically played to death. Ontop of that the guns weren't very accurate nor did some of them seem very powerful. I felt ripped off when I shot a guy with the BAR and he just sort of kelled over, got up and shot me again. Meh. Also, like I mentioned, the objectives started to get repetitive.  The ending was kind of a rip off at first - a simple news reel explaining how the Allies won - but once the credits roll, the real ending begins. It shows a bunch of troops battling it out in some destroyed city againt tanks, nazis, and airplanes. It was like watching a movie.  To sum it all up, if you got an X-Box 360 then you need to play this game. It isn't the best in my opinion, but it sure is a lot of fun. Go buy it 
 I loved this book.  The other two books in the series are available on amazon. uk site.  I couldn't wait for them to be released in the USA.  I ordered and paid international shipping.  Jacq also has another series listed on the UK site that has not been release in USA

 Forza Eros!  May you live to make much more great music! Whether you  understand Italian or not, I heartily recommend this CD. In Ogni Senso  lives up to its billing- it delights each and every one of the human  senses, in ALL "sense" of the expression. This is a must-have for  any true music lover 
 When I read this book I was surprised that it was so moral and that it points out some problems we have in real life. After I went to read the authors bio I noticed that most of the things he has in his books are something similar to his life and I was not surprised his favorite books are ones he can relate to. That being said if you want an action book this isn't your best pick but if you want something that will make you think then go for it. 
 In Sophie's Choice, William Styron does a masterful job of telling a horrific tale in bearable way.  Sophie is a Polish Christian who survived 18 months in Auschwitz before the camp was liberated by the Allies.  Of course her story is heartbreaking.   But Styron unfolds the tale in a way that allows the reader to take it all in without being crushed by the sadness of it.    First, instead of marching out the story of Sophie's capture and imprisonment in chronological order, Styron layers it on, each layer building on the next.  When the 22-year-old narrator, Stingo, a Southerner who moved to Brooklyn to write novels, first meets Sophie in the summer of 1947, she gives him only the briefest of versions of her experience in the war.  It is only as they grow closer as friends that Sophie, through a series of drunken encounters, provides more details to Stingo, each time admitting that she had lied to him before in earlier versions of her tale.   By presenting the horrifying particulars bit by bit, Styron seems mindful of the warning, and even quotes Stalin as saying, that a "single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic."  The reader sees the tragedy of Sophie's experience because, by offering just a little at a time, Styron allows the reader to digest her story, along with a great deal of information about the Holocaust in general.  If Styron had presented her story in full from the beginning, the awfulness would be numbing.    Also, Styron balances Sophie's tragic past with her tragic present in Brooklyn.  In love with Nathan, a brilliant drug addict subject to violent fits of jealousy, Sophie has no chance of building a "normal" life in America.  But, given her experiences in the concentration camp, it is impossible to imagine how she could.  Rather than present an unbelievable fairy tale of survival, Styron uses the tortured relationship between Nathan and Sophie as the catalyst for her revelations to Stingo, as well as the vehicle of her ultimate, and well-foreshadowed, undoing.  Finally, for all its sadness, there is plenty of humor in the book.  Some of Stingo's failed romantic adventures are downright funny, as are his self-deprecating descriptions of his writing efforts.  Again, without these side stories offering a respite from the main narrative, Sophie's story would be unbearable.  Sophie's Choice is going in my Top 10 favorite novels of all times.  I don't know yet what it is bumping off the list, but it is definitely going on.   
 I am impressed with the quality of photos with this camera. Occaisionally when I turn it on the lense doiesn't slide out, which is a little disconcerting. However, if I tap it, or turn it off and turn it o n again, it comes out to the operational position. I enjoy using it, amd wouldn't hesitate to purchase another one 
 This rock 'n roll hall of fame group has recorded many classics.  Since Sony could not include them all in their first "Best of" compilation, volume two gives us many of the tunes they missed.  With tracks like "Persuasion," "Se A Baco," "Hope You're Feeling Better" and "Everything's Coming Our Way" you get some of the early tracks that belong in any Santana retrospective.  You also get their cover of "Stormy" (which hit the top 40) plus a couple of awesome live versions of two songs from the earlier compilation (these are better than the studio versions).  Once you get this CD you won't need the "Greatest Hits" any longer (this is the 70s compilation originally released on vinyl with the bird on the cover).  If you purchased volume one ("Best of") then you got to get this one to complete the set.  Order now 
 If you hate Catholics or Catholicism, read this book for understanding. If you feel unfulfilled by your Christian faith, read this book to see what you're missing. If you are unsure of which Christian denomination you want to join, read this book to see how other non-Catholics have found truth in the Catholic Church. If you're considering becoming a Catholic or leaving the Church, read this book! It might help lead you to the truth.   Rome Sweet Home is a touching testimonial of how two VERY anti-Catholic, bible-slinging Protestant seminaries (husband and wife) reluctantly opened themselves to, discovered, and finally accepted the Catholic Church as our Lord's original and apostolic Church on earth. This book is truly inspiring for cradle Catholics and converts alike. It portrays a realistic, thoughtful, and often difficult journey to the Catholic faith by two very intelligent people who had been solid in their Protestant convictions, and never in their lives EVER considered becoming Catholic. Each point of Catholicism that they previously contended is thoughtfully, and biblically researched and challenged to support how they came to change their innermost Protestant beliefs, even at the initial expense of career, marriage, and alienation from family and friends 
 I thought this was a great book, but some prior knowledge about North Korea would be helpful for the average reader.  I consider myself a Koreafile and hunger for firsthand knowledge of the Hermit Kingdom.  
 Not long after Martha Stewart's Hors d"oeuvres Handbook was released in 1999, her friend who had a connection to Kmart and her own daily talk show, Rosie O'Donnell, called this book "the eighth wonder of books."  Rosie questioned how Martha could make money on this book as it looked not only gorgeous but very expensive to reproduce.  Although I didn't know Martha Stewart from Betty Crocker and my idea of "entertaining" was chips and Lipton's onion soup dip, I trusted Rosie's recommendation and bought Martha's handbook as a house-warming present for my neice.  This book lived up to Rosie's hype.  It is both beautiful and expensive looking.  Best of all, my neice and I put it to immediate use preparing good things for her house-warming party. While we cut up veggies, my neice told me about Martha Stewart's pioneering success in business. This Xmas, I gave my neice Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook which she used to bake some herb bread as a gift for my New Year's Eve party.  Martha Stewart's handsome handbooks as gifts:  Perfect 
 This was a very expensive movie to make, authentic in every way as to detail of the time the story took place and its surroundings.Very good movie.I would recommend this to everyone who likes history of times long passed. 
 Undead (The Speirig Brothers, 2003)  The last thing I was expecting from the surprisingly-heavily-promoted (and unsurprisingly-narrowly-released-in-America) Undead, based on the big, murky promo posters, was comedy. But that's exactly what I got. Better yet, we got a zombie flick that has pretensions of being a fifties sci-fi B movie-- imagine crossing Night of the Living Dead with The Day the Earth Stood Still with the script being written by Broken Lizard and you've got a good idea of where the Speirig Brothers are coming from here.  Rene (the stunning Felicity Mason, recently of Hollywood) is a small-town beauty queen who'll do anything to get out. She is, in fact, on the verge of doing just that when things go horribly, horribly wrong-- a meteor shower bombards the town, killing hundreds of people, all of whom rise as zombies and start attacking the other townspeople (as zombies, of course, are wont to do), turning them into zombies as well. Rene flees into the home of Marion (Inspector Gadget 2's Mungo McKay), a reclusive fisherman with a taste for weaponry. Other survivors congregate in the house, and the stage is set for a protracted siege between man and zombie. Except those aren't the only two species coming to the party...  The surprising thing about Undead is that it doesn't play its comedy straight, the way Slither or Return of the Living Dead do; there's always something slimy and uncomfortable just beneath the surface making you feel dirty as you're laughing at this. You know you're not supposed to be laughing at the stuff you're laughing at. If the Spierig Brothers, who are also responsible for the twisted, twisted script here, were attempting to simulate the unintentionally-hysterical factor of fifties B movies, they have succeeded in such a way that Undead may end up being remembered as one of the great satires of all time; a lot of movies have poked fun at the genre (and at themselves) by parodying that brand of humor, but few, if any, picked up on the ugliness that often lies beneath it. Here it is in spades.  The more I think about it, the better this movie was. You want to see this. **** 
 This is a Heal Thyself book. In a gentle, caring, and lighthearted voice, Ms. Hutslar shines a light on the mysteries of our everyday relationships.  To welcome the concept of these relationships as special gifts (especially the challenging ones!) is a miraculous eyeopener! I turned from page to page, as if I was reading a letter written to me personally by my best friend. Once finished with the book myself, I have talked about it and shuttled it lovingly from friend, to family, to co-worker (I have an extra copy I keep safely at home!).  This book is a gift you deserve to give yourself.    
 In NORTHANGER ABBEY, Jane Austen satirizes what for her and her late 18th century readers was the Gothic novel. Even before Ann Radcliffe published the enormously popular MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO in 1794, the novel of sentiment was all the rage.  In such stories the heroine was likely to cry, swoon, and moan at the drop of a hat. Radcliffe in her book added the other Gothic ingredients of fear, ghosts, haunted houses, and other paranormal phenomena.  Austen looked down on writers who had their heroines engage in such unseemly behavior even though she was later to treat seriously the same trait of sensibility in SENSE AND SENSIBILITY.    The heroine of NORTHANGER ABBEY is Catherine Morland, who seems unlike what will later prove to be a typical Austen protagonist.  Catherine at the start of the book is much more closely allied to the "sense" half of the push-pull sense and sensibility dichotomy of all her works.  She is the daughter of a prosperous clergyman who travels to a resort named Bath, where she meets and falls in love with Henry Tilney.  There are the usual romantic plot complications of an Austen novel which normally allow the heroine to be attracted by her male counterpart and encounter suitable obstacles, all of which are neatly resolved after both parties undergo some serious soul searching which in turn leads to a higher level of moral vision. In this case, Austen has great fun with Catherine by first showing her as full of sense, then later shifting gears by morphing her into a standard "sensible" female of the Gothic genre, finally whirling Catherine back to a position of reason and logic.  It takes half of the book before Austen gets to the Gothic satire for which it is well-known.  When Catherine arrives at Northanger Abbey, she inexplicably is affected by the conventional Gothic trappings of the place.  Where the earlier Catherine would see an occurrence that might have seemed spooky to other more stereotyped Gothic heroines but not so to her, the newer Catherine now could see that same eerie event and be filled with unfounded terror.  It is only now that Austen makes clear the target of her barbed satire.  She was plainly disgusted with other writers who purposefully filled the empty heads of their heroines with Gothic terror, but when she did the same, it was excusable since satire, not stereotype, was her aim. Later, Catherine's grasp of sense returns as she is able to exonerate in her own mind General Tilney from the suspected charge of the murder of his wife.  By the end of the novel, the reader has been introduced to the theme of sense versus sensibility or unstructured emotion versus stifling reason. In Catherine Morland, and later for nearly of all of Austen's female protagonists, Austen suggests that in having to choose between the two extremes, one might seek a middle ground so that each one can complement, rather than supplement the other.  There are simply too many examples of extremes who end badly in Austen's works for one to ignore her implied advice.   
 This comprehensive, smart book gives you the basics on how to get a job interview, perform well at the interview, end the interview and even negotiate the terms of your benefits if you're hired. The authors raise and provide answers to several hundred questions - some of them painfully obvious, but some of them pretty tough, like "Why do you have that felony conviction?" We from getAbstract have the 202nd question: If you're applying for a job, why haven't you already read this 
 Michael Goldman's Imperial Nature is a wonderful introduction to the methods, practices and history of the World Bank.  It is well written and very easy to read and comprehend.  It is arranged logically and most questions that a reader with little prior knowledge of the bank would have are answered early on.  The book uses both general history and contemporary examples to explore the evolution of the bank's purpose and methodology.  However Goldman tends to make generalizations without expounding on examples he casually mentions, or after providing only one detailed example.   Imperial Nature is excellent at explaining how the bank creates and controls information, exploring an area of power often overlooked. Imperial Nature documents how the World Bank, ostensibly a "development" organization can in fact further impoverish a borrowing nation, leave many of its people destitute and then manipulate the data so that it appears to have in fact accomplished something good. Goldman's exploration of the process by which the Bank produces information and regulates what information is published, both before a project is begun and after it is finished, is the best feature of this book.   Despite the title environmental concerns seem rather peripheral. The book is a promotion of social justice and an exploration of the bank's imperialist control over nations and peoples, but environmental effects are rarely mentioned, excepting how they directly affect native peoples. Overall the book is a good and easy to understand overview of the World Bank in the world today, but it would not provide a great deal of information to someone with prior knowledge of the bank.   
 This works fine - got it in the time promised.  The only difficulty is that there is not much of an instruction manual 
    That toss of the hair & the "strip". Rita Hayworth had them first. Actually,  "the strip" consisted of taking one glove off. It just was so sexy it seemed like more. An in your face performance by an absolutely gorgeous Rita Hayworth. She took my breath away for a moment when she first appeared.  No doubt in my mind this is her best performance. She is so hot in her scenes with Johnny played by Glenn Ford. He is at his best also. The plot is convoluted & a bit improbable. She marries Johnny's boss but it obvious they had a thing before & still have it.   She is wild & slutty but it is just to get Johnny jealous. The opposite of hate is not love but indifference. The emotions of love & hate are razor thin close. Johnny & Gilda hate each oher so much it hurts. But they love each other so much they can't survive without the other. This is referred to by some as noir but I didn't see that. It is a fine, almost great, top shelf star power movie.  
 This is one of those rare books that can actually change your whole view of the world. Despite being written in a somewhat dry manner, with exhaustively researched data listed and explained, piece by piece, a glimpse of pre-industrial society emerges that does not necessarily conform to our stereotyped view of "traditional" society and family. In some respects, this book offers hope for our own times by putting our problems in perspective. For example, we often decry the high rate of divorce and remarriage seen in today's Western societies and compare today's fractured families to the "stable" families of long ago. The information in this book reveals that in pre-industrial England, at least, families were splintered by death and desertion at a rate that approaches our contemporary rate of divorce. Rather than being a modern source of stress, remarriage and stepparents are a long-standing tradition in our culture 
 This was, by far, my favorite book growing up.  I loved trying to figure out how to say the strange words and eventually, I could almost recite the entire book from memory.  I still can the first few pages.  I don't know that I was helped psycologically, but it sure was and is a fun book 
 I apsolutely LOVED THIS BOOK! I think it's the best book I have read out of the Heartland series I own! Ty and Amy belong together and I love their relationship!!!!! I give this book 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!! 
 This book definitely sharpens your thinking on how profit happens - the reason youre in business in the first place. Many managers and "business designers" would do well to read the parts on how a too  single-minded focus on things such as market share and revenue growth  actually might lead to value being destroyed rather than created. This book  shows how value does get created: how innovative thinking and business  designing will induce your present and future customers to pay for your  profit 
 I found my copy of this small but elegantly written gem of a book in our local second-hand bookshop. I had long been intrigued by Calvino's writing, and snatched up the copy with delight. I was not disappointed.  The short note at the beginning of the book, by the author's wife, tells about the choice of title, the preparation of the material by the author for the Charles Edward Norton Lectures at Harvard University in the US, and its translation by Patrick Creagh. Calvino completed writing only five of the six lectures, and these form the chapters of the book - Lightness, Quickness, Exactitude, Visibility, and Multiplicity. The sixth, which was to be called "Consistency", he intended to write on his arrival in Cambridge, but Calvino died before making that journey from Italy to Harvard University.   Calvino draws on areas as diverse as mythology, poetry, art, science and history to illustrate his theses, and brings fresh insights to, for example, the story of Perseus and Medusa. A few small extracts from the chapter on various aspects of Lightness will serve to illustrate this diversity of supporting material:  First, from poetry. "... there is a lightening of language whereby meaning is conveyed through a verbal texture that seems weightless, until the language itself takes on the same rarefied consistency... Emily Dickinson, for instance... A sepal, petal, and a thorn// Upon a common summer's morn-// A flask of Dew-A Bee or two-... "      Then, from computer science: "It is true that software cannot exercise its powers of lightness except through the weight of hardware. But it is the software that gives the orders, acting on the outside world and on machines that exist only as functions of software and evolve so that they can work out ever more complex programs. The second industrial revolution, unlike the first, does not present us with such crushing images as rolling mills and molten steel, but with `bits' in a flow of information traveling along circuits in the form of electronic impulses. The iron machines still exist, but they obey the orders of weightless bits."   Despite the fact that this is a work of non-fiction, Calvino's skill as a master storyteller is evident. The chapter entitled "Quickness", for instance, begins with a fascinating and very concise story of necrophilia and magic. His exposition on the technique of Jorge Luis Borges, near the end of this chapter, reads like a story itself. For anyone interested in the craft of the short-short story, or flash fiction, this chapter should prove edifying.    Several passages from works of European writers are used as examples throughout the book. I was grateful that these were always accompanied by their English translations. For example, extracts from the writings by Leopardi, Musil, and Valry were presented in the original Italian, German, and French, in the chapter entitled "Exactitude" together with their English translations.    In the "Multiplicity" chapter I encountered the notion that every object, no matter how apparently insignificant, is the center of an infinitely expanding network of relationships. Wow - what an immensely powerful antidote to writer's block.  This is a wonderful and thought-provoking book.   
 Cardio Dance Blast is a fun workout to throw into the weekly mix. You'll break a sweat, but I wouldn't call this a difficult exercise routine by any means. The hip-thrusting and shimmying is a bit distracting, but once I got into it I started to enjoy it. If you don't have that "funky edge" you might find yourself kicking your husband/significant other out of the room - some of the moves made me feel just plain silly! The instructor is friendly, the music is typical synthesized aerobics fare. Overall I found it to be a nice addition to my collection. 
 Released in 1979 just as UFO were about to become huge and recorded at The Chicago Amphitheater "Strangers In The Night" is considered by many rock afficianados to be one of the best "live" performances to be put on record. The band was red hot, especially guitarist Michael Schenker, who's blistering  guitar licks are simply amazing. The songs speak for themselves "Doctor Doctor", "Rock Bottom", "Let It Roll", "Mother Mary", "This Kids", "Out In The Street", "Shoot Shoot", "Natural Thing", "I'm A Loser", "Too Hot To Handle", "Lights Out", "Love To Love", and Only You Can Rock Me". By the way this re-issue for 2006 does not include any bonus tracks and the songs are in the exact sequence that were on the album. In 1999 "Strangers In The Night" was remastered and expanded, and included several bonus tracks (from an entirely different concert) tacked on at the beginning, totally ruining the album's original track sequence and alot of band chat was added between songs. If you want the original "classic" performance then this is the version to buy. It's also remastered and includes an expanded booklet with liner notes 
 The is a tragic but very true to life depiction of the degradation caused by addiction to individuals, families, and society. The film is graphic in its depiction of addiction, but as an addiction counselor, who is an addict and alcoholic in recovery, it is very close to actual tragic events I have seen in the world of addiction. The emotionally disturbing events that take place in the lives of the main characters are exactly the very real things that addiction counselors are seeking to prevent. These events are the end of untreated or unchecked addiction for far too many. Unfortunately, even though some of the content may be offensive to some, it is a starkly true depiction of what the reality for some addicts becomes. Even though the film may leave one emotionally upset for a time, it is a worthwhile film to break through false pretenses about addiction's final results and the glossing over of the degradation addiction can and does lead to in real life. Watch and learn the truth about severe addiction

 Having read Kent Week's book "The Lost Tomb" I was impressed with his accessable writing style. So, seeing this book was like waving a red flag at a bull. I have been to many of the sights featured in this book and could not afford to visit all. To my joy, on opening this volume and seeing the quality of the photographs I realised now that I could! It is the next best thing to actually BEING tere and in some cases .. better! I know that sounds odd ... but in reality a lot of the KV paintings are covered with glass to prevent damage ... or you are not allowed to take a camera in ... even if you can, you may not use flash. So your own pictures always fall short. THIS is professionally lit, photographed and documented ... with great care taken to render the Theabian west bank in all it's glory. Bravo 
 Enjoying it very much--Jim Henson was a genius! Delivery was ahead of schedule, too! 
 There is something about Anne Tyler's novels that is magic. She is one of the best writers able to bring light from the ordinary lives of common folks. Probably that is why most readers have a lukewarm response to her books. People are expecting to read about the glamorous and rich -- and these are not the center of her books.   To fully appreciate an Anne Tyler book, one most be totally open to accept that her characters could be our parents, ours friends or even ourselves. It is rare to read one of her novels and not feel that one or two characters are just like us. Her Pulitzer Award winning "Breath Lessons" is not different. Her main characters Maggie and Ira Moran could be anyone's neighbors.   Throughout the narrative readers have a glimpse on one day in their lives from morning till dawn. It is a Saturday when they will travel to attend a friend's husband's funeral service. Not an ordinary Saturday in their lives although the most ordinary things happen -- with no ordinary meaning.   Maggie is the type who interferes in everybody's lives -- always for good, at least, so she thinks. But not everyone (mostly no one) is willing to have his/her life changed by a stranger. She tries to comfort her widowed friend, she tries to bring her son and daughter-in-law back together and she tries to please her husband. She fails and succeeds in different levels in different tasks. What Tyler is exploiting with that is hardly that the road to hell is paved with good intentions --as people say. The writer shows that no matter how good are our intentions, they can be relative. What Maggie thinks is good for her husband, for one, is not necessarily what he thinks is good for him -- and they both can be right.  With her simple style Tyler can achieve much more than many elaborated writers attempt to. The story is told in a very matter-of-fact fashion, and even the flashbacks pop up smoothly. There aren't many digressions or flights of fancy -- in this way she is very realistic. And funny. There is a very bittersweet sense of humor in her words. She is not trying to be funny, or pushing her characters to be funny, the laughs come naturally from the strangeness --or commonness-- of the situations. Take the second part of the novel, for instance. It is impossible not to laugh tenderly at Meggie's behavior and guilty.  "Breathing Lessons" is an ode to life and to the chances and opportunities that life brings and we accept or decline. There is always the aftermath and the consequences one must face. In the end of the Saturday Meggie's life seem to be not so different. Maybe it is not. But certainly her --and our-- soul has changed.  
 I am a PhD level graduate student who has never had a matrix algebra course.  I got this book to help with a Linear Models course I am currently taking.  The book is very helpful, and provides a solid background in the first few chapters before building on them for more complex results.  Definitely a good reference to have nearby 
 Elia Kazan has touched me deeply in many of his films.  The Arrangement is not the most effective of Kazan's films, but he certainly tried very hard with this one to reach towards some important truths.  I really dislike much of the technical side of this film (the poor process shots, the somewhat stilted acting, the sometimes quite silly sets poorly lit way too bright), but there is something moving about the film, rooted in the raw exposure of what looks to be his own soul.  Imperfect films that reach so high should be respected 
 When I was about eight years old, a family friend gave me Mille Bornes.  I loved it immediately!  It was fun and easy to learn.  The rules are easy enough that kids can play and yet the strategy is challenging enough for adults.  This is truly one of those games that the whole family can play.    The original game I was given some thirty years ago now had long since been tossed accidently by mom!  Aw... but just this weekend my husband and I found Mille Bornes again and had a lot of fun playing.  A bonus if you can purchase the game with the original artwork from the 60s 
 I ordered the book on CD for our Small Group Bible study and we just finished it.  One marriage has been drastically changed and the other three - God is at work there.  The women loved it and the guys totally got it.  One of our men even said "this guy is RIGHT on the money!"  I highly recommend the book and especially the book on CD for those who dislike reading or just can't find the time to sit down.  We have three A-type personalities in the group and they totally appreciated being able to listen in the car or at work on their computers.  
 This is an excellent book.  It has a logical progression and thoroughly describes option strategies from the conservative to the aggressive.  My only suggestion to enhance the book's practicality would be to have an appendix showing profit and loss worksheets for each strategy.  His website, The Option Strategist, has some useful option market commentary.     
 Business Communication: Process and Product has been the best textbook I have worked with. Everything is presented in a clear and reader-friendly manner. Of all the books I have had to purchase for my courses, this was well worth the investment. Even though I recently earned my degree, and am no longer taking classes, I am still benefiting from owning this book 
 This is a book written by a woman in love with oysters, and her love can be contagious, through her luscious recipes and well written interesting commentary.  Each of 185 recipes brings out yet another facet of these succulent savory delights. She starts with oysters on the half shell, with lemon and black pepper, and quickly introduces 6 sauces for raw oysters:  Mignonete, Spiced Chili Sauce, Tomato and Horseradish, Dill, Remoulade, and Remoulade -New Orleans Style.  It gets better, as Oysters with a Splash  are accented with citrus and vinegar, and are served with iced vodka. The naked oysters get covered as Spinach-Oyster Rolls with Mustard Sauce, or beneath a creamed mushroom sauce as Oysters Forestiere.  There are canape recipes, 20 oyster soups, 6 salads, numerous vegetables even grace the oyster's presence. They are deep fried, stir-fried, sauteed, baked, and broiled-grilled.  This leads up to over 20 main courses, with such oyster preparations as Polenta Torta, Conchiglie, Hangtown Fry, Turkey Croquettes, Oies, Stuffing, and with the Noble Oyster accompanied by even Veal Rouladens, Scallops, sole and in Jambalaya.  Rarely does a "Single Ingredient" cookbook reach such excellence in simple clear instructions, and a selection of recipes that nost home cooks can readily make and enjoy.   If you have wondered of ways to serve oysters, or are just curious about this delicacy, buy this  book now, and  get cookin!  
  When I first got this, I didn't like it near as good as Happy Trails, so I didn't play it much. Once I really started paying attention, I couldn't quit listening. This brilliant debut is now one of my very favorites out of a large collection. There is a depth and maturity in this album that alot of better known 60's acts lacked. This album truley gets better with each listen. Sure, the sound quality could stand remastering, but don't let that get in the way. There is so much atmosphere in this music. It transports you like great music should. Yea, there's better lead vocalists out there, but there's nothing bad about this record. The song quality is top notch. Pride of Man is more relevant today than when it was recorded. I've heard several versions of this song, but Quicksilver's will always be my favorite. Dino's Song puts a smile on my face everytime i hear it. Gold and Silver is awesome! A real gem. Light Your windows might just pass as another ballad by someone else, but there is a depth and atmosphere here that only repeated listenings bring to the surface. It's Been Too Long has a sort of 50's feel, without sounding like nostaliga. The Fool: this is the masterpiece! I still get shivers up my spine with every listen. I just wish it was longer. This song was influential on alot of other groups, more so in Europe than here. I wish I could put into words just how much better this album gets with every play! I have alot of 60's albums, but there is something subtle here that many of Quicksilver's contemporaries lack. It is a steal at the low price it sells for. I think I'll listen to it again right now. Get it! It's one of the best 
 I narrowly missed attending a Seven Sisters College, but this play shows me everything I might have missed--for good or ill.  It's a time capsule, most forcefully, of the 1970s Women's Movement Early Days--thoughtfully and comically presenting relationships between women, personalities and choices, while probing the question, "What does success really mean? When is enough really enough?"  --Janet Grace Riehl, author "Sightlines: A Poet's Diary 
 I was new to the topic of automated trading systems when I purchased this book. If it is your case, I can tell you that this is the place you want to start. why? Because it will teach you the truth about system development and give you a scientific perspective on the topic. No promises, no blabla you will be rich in 2 weeks. You will realize that there is a lot of work to do to get there, and the book will help you enter this great subject with smooth. In short: no promises, only scientific realities on how to take out profits from the markets. 
 This book pulls no punches on the minute technical details that go unnoticed but not unexperienced in the director's craft. It's like taking a great class in the technical structure of directing. I haven't had this much fun reading a film book in a long time. 
 We can dispute who got the most play time and focus, but the dvd is worth its price for Oistrakh's performance of the Shostakovich Aminor Cadenza.  My taste and loyalty is usually with Heifetz, but Oistrakh's performance was out of this world 
 Mr. Beaudette is a retired accomplished electrical engineer who dedicated his mind and free time to investigating this field for years, as I have done.  This is a book I would have like to have written because he has put  the strange events surrounding the birth of this science into a form that  is accessible by anyone with a basic understanding of science.  Without  evoking the spectre of conspiracies, one can understand how normal human  behavior, distorted by the intensity of media attention, mixed with the  proprietary requirements of private research, protection of research  grants, and other questionable motives has gotten the field into the  present situation.  Beaudette leaves no room for doubt about the reality of  the effects, in a simple way, by focusing on the simplest evidence,  reproduced by the best of laboratories.  It was truly a pleasurable reading  experience 
 Everyone, including Amazon, has this as the documentary Imagine, which I don't believe it is.  This is the "video version" of the Imagine album, with each song having it's own video, and includes a couple of Yoko's from Fly.  It was released in 1986 and, at the time, was pretty cool to have, as it was digitally remastered really well and had a lot of then unreleased footage, mostly shot at Tittenhurst.  Time, technology and the releases of John Lennon: Imagine and Gimme Some Truth have rendered this pretty much obsolete.  Even the excellent sound has been upped by the 2001 remaster of the album.  But I still pull it out once in a while.  It's got a few clips that aren't in either of the other videos and besides, any self-respecting Beatle fan should have it 
 If nothing else, it makes one's own life seem not so tragic 
 This book is a really easy-to-read, practical book for those who want some fun ideas on how to share leadership qualities with managers or up and coming leaders in your organization.

 If you were lucky enough to buy the soundtrack when first released in 1987 on Enigma Records, hang on to that out of print gem!  Straight To Hell is back on CD as Straight to Hell Returns, and may have a lot more tracks this time, but it also deleted two tracks from the original release and shortens another track.  Not appearing this time are: "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly" by The Pogues, and my personal favorite "Money, Guns And Coffee" by Pray For Rain.  The track "The Killers" by Pray For Rain ran 2 minutes 55 seconds on the original, but on this new release was shortened to only 2 minutes.  This is rather perplexing considering Straight To Hell Returns runs a total of 55 minutes 7 seconds, which would have left room for those other tracks to be included (since CDs can run a total of 79 minutes 59 seconds).  I'm deducting a point from my rating of this CD because the missing tracks should have been included!  On the plus side, this new release contains a lot of short instrumental tracks from the film that were not on the original CD release in 1987, as well as some brief dialogue excerpts.    The film was a misunderstood classic, and the soundtrack of spaghetti western-style rock is wonderful: The Pogues, Joe Strummer, Pray For Rain, Zander Schloss, Elvis Costello's MacManus Gang, and even dialogue excerpts from Courtney Love before she was, well, I guess the word is "famous."  If you're a fan of any of these artists, you'll love this assortment of songs...those not familiar with the film may not be able to absorb the atmosphere these songs and instrumentals create, so get the film on DVD and you'll appreciate the works of these artists so much more.  The liner notes claim this CD is to be considered the "official" soundtrack, while the first release of it back in 1987 was basically a "souvenir."  I enjoy both releases immensely, but since I was listening to those other deleted tracks for nearly 20 years now, it's sad to not hear them this time around 
 This CD is for everyone in the family.  It is upbeat and relaxing at the same time.  I never thought I would enjoy listening to children's music this much.  
 This book is important because it is survey of the real estate market as of now, i.e. a period where certain investments (especially residential real estate in particular markets), are becoming high risk.  However there is also timeless advice in the book, and she also touches on subjects that are not frequently discussed, ie. alternative real estate investments from international to condo-hotels to commercial.    A lot of information can be learned from this book.  I recommend it for anyone considering buying any kind of real estate.  
 "I never read anything my mother reads," said my best friend Tom when we were college students.  Although that was a long time ago, I still remember his response when I offered him a copy of a Barbara Pym novel.  Such is the far-reaching reputation of this very entertaining writer.  However, I vouch for the fact that Pym's novels appeal to a much wider public than our mothers.     Take Jane and Prudence.  Jane is a frumpy but bright vicar's wife who would, in another age and novel, enjoy a profitable career in Human Resources Management.  Prudence, her close friend from schoolgirl days, is a single woman living in a modest flat in London and working in a dreary office but whose life is anything but dull.  She likes fine things, makes up her face artfully and fantasizes about her married employer.  Jane and her husband the vicar have recently relocated to a village vicarage where the locals are hard pressed to accept their new neighbors.  Prudence comes to visit and is courted by the local Lothario who is ultimately swept up by his rich neighbor's hired companion, leaving Prudence slightly bereft and impelled to dally with her pale, lean co-worker who enjoys hiking.     That's the plot as best as I can describe it, leaving out the small but pretty byroads of church decorating parties, council meetings and office lunches.   Within this precious story is great high comedy, full of irony and wit.  The office scenes are hilarious, depicting an inpenetrable hierachy that had me laughing away.  The village characters are all distinct and never reduced to stock rustic characters, therefore I was fascinated.  The very industrious woman who lands the local but lazy Lothario gives a firm example of "setting one's cap" to winning a mate.  Pym likes to depict characters who study anthropology and it's fitting that her people in this story are quite a tribal study in themselves 
 After reading many books throughout the years, I have finally found one that is very outstanding to read.  In reading many books, they seam very boring, but C is For Corpse is a very interesting read.  It is part of a series that starts with A is for Alibi, and is currently at R is for Ricochet.  It is a murder mystery that goes way beyond the normal mystery that viewers see on T.V.  This book gives an in-depth look at all the people involved.  From the sister who is either smoking, doing drugs, or drinking, to the actual victim who was committing adultery before his death this book has a wide range of people. The part of the book that really makes it above and beyond the normal read is that it has real life people.  Kinsey Millhone, who is the detective, is an average middle aged woman who is concerned about her weight, and has a polite side to her.  She finishes the case even when Bobby is dead, when easily she could of stopped caring, and stole the money.  She lives in a very rich town, yet she lives in a trailer park, which further adds tot the fact that this book is full of diversity. The only negative part is that there is too much detail, but if a reader doesn't mind an excessive amount of detail, then this is a good choice.  With taking this all into consideration, I would recommend this book, and give it a score of 4 stars out of five.  It is worth the time, and I once again strongly encourage people to read C is For Corpse.    
 those who will find this book helpful are college majors and dabblers, these are also the individuals Benson has written this text for.  It will also help those of us who need to brush up on our basic grasp of these figures and their additions to questions of religious speech and truth.  if you read this book, you will be able to score chicks at bars... 
 Almost 4 years since his last solo, Krayzie is back with probably his best solo album (close with "Thug Mentality 1999"). A lot different then his other 2 solo albums, being much shorter (14 songs) and guests are on only 3 of them and they're his fellow Bone Thugs. Of the 14, 1 is a classic, 1 I skip, 3 are ok, the rest are good, but not great. Lyrics are the same formula, some deeper/personal songs, a few upbeat ones, some to smoke to and some thug $h!+. Production is decent and handled by a lot of different people (most he hasn't worked with before). Lil Jon, 5150, and LT Hutton each do 2 songs, Krayzie, Dillio, Fredwreck, Femi Ojetunde, Platunim Bros., Rush, Wunda Twins each do 1 song. A nice album for his fans to have or fans of Bone.  #1 - 8 #2 - 8.5 (f/ Wish Bone) #3 - 7 (f/ Wish Bone) #5 - 8.5 (about the old school rap) #6 - 8 (about how all the radio/video play is garbage and teh same) #7 - 8(one of his nice deeper songs) #8 - 8.5 (a nice short interlude) #9 - 9 (nice story) #10 - 8 #11 - 6 #13 - 10 (CLASSIC! - about what happened to Bone through the years) #14 - 9(nice beat) #15 - 4.5 #16 - 7.5 (f/ Layzie Bone, Wish Bone, Bizzy Bone)  Anthony Henderson -- b. 6/3/74 -- Cleveland, OH Check all my reviews 
 I'm probably the only person in the world who hadn't read a Stephen King novel, and am so glad that I started with this one which is a writing gem. Dolores Claiborne is a plain woman who has had to work hard all of her life to support herself, her three children and her violent, lazy, drunken sot of a husband.The entire book is Dolores' narrative to the police chief and a police stenographer, with only her words being recorded. She had worked as housekeeper to a wealthy old woman, a recluse who became more and more difficult as she aged, so Dolores' work and caring for her children was her entire world. I found this slim book to be a marvel of pithy condensation, without a wasted word and well able to tell a life story of great drama and to hold the reader's attention for a good one day read 
 I'm not the typical audience for a "business" book.  A number of business books have been given to me over the years, such as "Who Moved My Cheese" and "First, Break All The Rules."  I mostly found that those tended to remind me of bad self-help or get rich quick type pitches.  The guru comes down and tells us proles how it is.  My interest in *this* book however sprang from Rushkoff's fascinating blog.  Douglas Rushkoff writes from the perspective of a netizen, a cyber enthusiast, and above all, a member of the silly, fascinating, innovative and always moving culture that has been made possible by the Internet.  Get Back In The Box captures that sense of play and optimism that I've always found online but never in a standard "business" text.  Although he does occassionally cross over into almost over-hyping the change in thinking, the illustrations of what makes innovation possible are fascinating and inspiring.  His example of satellite radio, of how Sirius has spent $$ on marketing and big names all the while losing money while XM has focused on solid ground-building support with the music coming first, was one of my favorite sections.  I wish the higher-ups at my company would read this book.  I work in IT, as server support for a large company (very large).  When I started, we used to do support of one business unit, with a great deal of in-depth knowledge of how our systems worked to support that unit.  As years have gone by, we've taken on more and more systems to the point where now most of us don't really have any idea what these systems actually do.  And now, as we're slowly being segmented by function into more "efficient" units, any unique value that we used to be able to bring to help our clients, is basically lost.  And at that point, there really is no difference between any of us and someone with the same general tech skills in India, who's willing to work for a lot less $$.  I found Rushkoff's optimism at times a little over the top but the general premise was so right on.  I did a lot of "hell yeah" and "amen" while reading it.  Made me want to run to the window and yell out, I'm madder than hell and I'm not going to take it any more.  ;-)  Rushkoff gets outside the box by getting back in, and by taking us along for the ride, and using grounded, real world examples, he illustrates how important this is.  As companies race to outsource and offshore work, I wish more business leaders would read this book.  And remember.... you get what you pay for.  This book is $$ well-spent 
 This is a great product my dog loves it, plus it keeps her out of my bed at night 
 I received this book over 20 years ago, and I can't begin to tell you how it ignited a fire within me to draw. This is a great book for those who wish to draw superhoroes, but don't have a clue where to start. There are very few books that we remember as we age, but for me this is one of them 
 Ordinarily, I wouldn't think letters would be that interesting. But Thomson's style and sense of humor are so outrageous, I find myself laughing out loud every few pages or so.  But it's much more than humor. The letters overlap the period of Martin Luther King's Assassination, Robert F. Kennedy's Assassination, the Democratic National Convention of 1968 (which he attended), etc.  I was struck at how he tried to convince his younger brother to stay in college for at least another semester, because by then, we would probably be out of Vietnam. It was apparent to him at the time that we would leave. And yet...Saigon didn't fall until April 1975.  He also has a particular revulsion for Nixon, who has always been a fascinating figure for me. And of course,there are letters to his fans. He clearly has fear and loathing for some of them. His letters to and about them are hillarious.  A great read. 
 Defcon One is written by Joe Weber, the author of the book Shadow Flight. On a scale of 1-10 I give this book a 9.5, not a 10, due to the fact that the book skips between all the events happening at any given time. For instance the point of view goes from an American submarine to the Russian ship that is pinging it on the sonar to a US aircraft carrier and finally to American bombers that are going to assist the submarine, so it is somewhat easy to get lost if you dont pay close attention. The author, being a former Marine Corps pilot, uses vivid imagery and real pilot lingo to make you feel like this is real happening events. The detail and description of the events makes you feel like it's you in the seat of the roaring F-18 or manning the submarine not the author 
 I really like this bible.  There are definitions at the bottom of each pg. for the hard to understand or rarely used words.  Also footnotes for nearly every verse to help understand the meaning.  I prefer the KJV over the NIV (although the KJV is written in an older style text) because the NIV takes out certain parts of verses or changes words altogether which change the message.  If you want to know what I mean check out Romans 8:1 for one example.  "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." Rom 8:1  The NIV leaves out the last part which says, "who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."  Which is a very important part of the message.  As cross-references would agree.  We are definitely saved by grace through faith as written in Ephesians 2:8,9.  "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast." Eph 2:8,9  However putting this altogether as briefly as I can works do not save us but is the outward representation of our faith.  James 2:17 says:  "Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone." James 2:17  If you have a bible continue reading that in context from James 2:17-26.  Sorry for making this long, I hope this review has helped.  If you are looking to purchase a bible I definitely recommend the Life Application Study Bible (KJV).  The footnotes will help you understand the message in context if you have a hard time with the meaning.  God Bless 
 Great book. I can't believe that I never read it or remember reading it as a kid. I found it very entertaining. The only reason that I bought this book was because I was reading Lost in the Wilds, the true story about the kid that disappeared to Alaska by himself and ended up dying of starvation. He brought different books along and one was Call of the Wild and the other was Walden Pond. I read both try and figure out what he was thinking. 
 This album was released three years after the New Pornographers awesome debut album. This album is similar, but has a more glossy feel than the previous album. The album is definately more polished. Great synths and percussion throughout the album. Electric Version is an enjoyable and easy listen, chock-full of hungry hooks and brimming with indie rock's classic humility 
 testing it for weight and resiliency, loving it as one who loves potential. He taught me that "Reality begins in the dream." What an odd man, to know these things in an age when the pride of knowing belied its limitations 
 Another great grilling book addressing ribs this time.  Looking forward to another summer of grilling experiences with Steve Raichlen 
 I finished a very good book around eleven thirty, wasn't quite ready to go to sleep, so I started Tangerine Dream, stayed at it till about one, then fell asleep right after Dylan's sad funeral. That made for some sad dreams and I wanted to see what happened next, but I had to get up early and maybe go to work. Well, work I didn't have to go to, because we were snowed in in just about the worst winter on record, so I got to spend the day with this book. I knew it was going to be steamy and I wasn't disappointed.  But I didn't know I'd fall in love with the story so much. Haley and Taylor were perfect characters, as was Gina. I love they way they went after their dream. They weren't the only dreamers though. Taylor's father is a United States Senator from California, who is running for president. That's a big dream, but he's got big problems, of the Bill and Monica variety. Bigger problems actually, because he's got a lot of Monica's and they're all very young. So when an enterprising newsman finds out, well then you can just imagine what happens.  Anyway, I'm sure you can tell that I really liked this book. The love scenes weren't over the top, the sailing scenes (part of the book takes place on a sailboat in the South Pacific) were very stimulating and the ending was a surprise that reached right out and made me cry. 
 I have had this for almost 6 months and I like it a lot.  Right off, it looks great.  Black leather, blue piping going around the edge.  The blue is that vivid color that one of those exotic/expensive fish tank fish have:  neons or tetras?  Whichever it is, it is very sharp looking.  I keep i860 cell phone in the 'Glove all the time.  It does not add much bulk/size/weight to the phone.  It fits it, after all, like a glove.  When I am taking a photo, I simply unsnap the half that is on the flip-up half of my cell phone which is where the camera lens is, take the photo, and slip it back on.    Before I used to know about this, I used to press down a little strap on it that would get in the way, like a wayward lock of hair.  Turns out that futzing with the strap is unnecessary.  They designed it so you can just remove that half of the case, take photo(s), and snap it back on.  Smart.  In fact, the reason the strap is there in the first place is so you can easily remove the other half.  Look what is on the end of that strap before you curse it, guys.   It's a snap!  Snaps unsnap; that is what they are for.  The glove is well named.  It makes the phone much easier to grip in your hand.  I can easily pivot it around in my hand, flip it around, pick it up, and basically not expect it to skid around.  Without the 'Glove, you have a bare metal or plastic case.  Smooth looking and - well, maybe too smooth for something small and costing hundreds of dollars!  I like the fast release for the belt hook.  So far, it has not failed me.  I think it is at the bottom, not at the back the way some people have said, but I cannot remember for certain. I know it goes off and on easily for me but has never come off on its own yet.  I don't use it that way much though.  The i860 is not much bigger than one of those little matchbox cars from the 1960s. I easily fit it in my pocket.  With the glove on, I know it is probably not going to get scratched too easily 
 This is an excellent movie that warms your heart.   Very much like a Hallmark move but better.   Each character portrays their character wonderfully.   It really touches on life from birth to death 
 Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story is the type of over the top comedy that will always either be great or suck so bad that it is almost unwatchable. Rarely is there a middle ground with these movies. In this case, they got it right, I nearly wet my pants several times.  Globo Gym wants to buy out Joe's to turn it into a parking deck for their carb counting clientele. White acquires the mortgage and Average Joe's finds itself needing $50,000 in a month or face the wrecking ball. They soon find themselves entered in a $50K dodge ball tournament with the fate of the gyms hanging in the balance.  The boys from Average Joe's are a bunch of uncoordinated spaz's, which makes for some hysterical scenes. But they get some help when they find a coach. The coach they find is former dodge ball champion Patches O'Houlihan, played by Rip Torn. One of his theories is if you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball. So he likes to hurl huge pieces of some of Craftsman's finest products at the teams' heads. He also utters such words of encouragement as "you're as useless as a poo flavored lollipop". All of the characters are funny, but Patches was by far the best quote machine in the movie.  There's something hilarious about seeing grown men hurl a rubber playground ball into one another's groin. But if that isn't enough, there are some great cameos and surprises in this movie. For once, the studio got it right and did not give away the best laughs in the trailer. And Dodgeball is one of those movies you're going to want to see at least twice because there are so many small touchs in the background that you cant possibly catch them all in one screening. I will give this one 5 stars, it's a must see, and I think a movie this funny is best seen the first time with a crowd. You wont feel as silly howling about the nut shots when you see the rest of your buddies is also rolling in the floor too. 
 This is a great great eyeliner! I have been on a quest to find an eyeliner that can last a whole day without smuding or clumping in the corners of my eyes and I have found it! It's not too pricey, either. If they ever discontinue this product, i'll be a very sad camper.....it's GREAT 
 There is something about Anne Tyler's novels that is magic. She is one of the best writers able to bring light from the ordinary lives of common folks. Probably that is why most readers have a lukewarm response to her books. People are expecting to read about the glamorous and rich -- and these are not the center of her books.   To fully appreciate an Anne Tyler book, one most be totally open to accept that her characters could be our parents, ours friends or even ourselves. It is rare to read one of her novels and not feel that one or two characters are just like us. Her Pulitzer Award winning "Breath Lessons" is not different. Her main characters Maggie and Ira Moran could be anyone's neighbors.   Throughout the narrative readers have a glimpse on one day in their lives from morning till dawn. It is a Saturday when they will travel to attend a friend's husband's funeral service. Not an ordinary Saturday in their lives although the most ordinary things happen -- with no ordinary meaning.   Maggie is the type who interferes in everybody's lives -- always for good, at least, so she thinks. But not everyone (mostly no one) is willing to have his/her life changed by a stranger. She tries to comfort her widowed friend, she tries to bring her son and daughter-in-law back together and she tries to please her husband. She fails and succeeds in different levels in different tasks. What Tyler is exploiting with that is hardly that the road to hell is paved with good intentions --as people say. The writer shows that no matter how good are our intentions, they can be relative. What Maggie thinks is good for her husband, for one, is not necessarily what he thinks is good for him -- and they both can be right.  With her simple style Tyler can achieve much more than many elaborated writers attempt to. The story is told in a very matter-of-fact fashion, and even the flashbacks pop up smoothly. There aren't many digressions or flights of fancy -- in this way she is very realistic. And funny. There is a very bittersweet sense of humor in her words. She is not trying to be funny, or pushing her characters to be funny, the laughs come naturally from the strangeness --or commonness-- of the situations. Take the second part of the novel, for instance. It is impossible not to laugh tenderly at Meggie's behavior and guilty.  "Breathing Lessons" is an ode to life and to the chances and opportunities that life brings and we accept or decline. There is always the aftermath and the consequences one must face. In the end of the Saturday Meggie's life seem to be not so different. Maybe it is not. But certainly her --and our-- soul has changed.  
 Heaven forbid, but this album makes Bob Marley sound a little bit whitebread.  It just sounds entrenched in root reggae.  If you consider yourself possibly whitebread, I say that I probably am too, but I've had this album for about fifteen years and I still love it.  It is melodious--it has catchy tunes--and it has a deeply authentic sound to match the heavy lyrics of "Marcus Garvey" or "The Invasion."  There is no doubt this is bona fide reggae and musicianship, but you don't have to like anything besides good tunes to appreciate this album.  It stands up over time 
 While I enjoyed the unpredictablity of the book, I was disappointed in the ending. As someone else stated, it seems as if the author found himself in a place of not knowing how to end it, and so he went beyond the realm of realism. Although I surmised from the beginning that the plane would come into play for the outcome, the way the story ended was beyond reality and possibility...which is really a shame since the rest of story is so terrifyingly plausible.  It is almost as if the majority of the story was written by one author and the last few chapters by another. Also, the conclusion of the book is too open-ended.  Did the wife survive her gunshot wound?  Were charges brought against the doctor for endangering everyone on the highway and violating FAA and military orders?  Was Hickey's wife convicted?  Was Huey institutionalized?  What happened to the money? Otherwise, it is definately a page-turner, the dialogue keeps it moving, and the book was hard to put down 
 I have read the whole ender series, but with a strange sequence which may have affected the way I view the different books in the series. The first book I have read was the Shadow of the Hegemon, thanks to a tourist that had left it in the library of a hotel in Skiathos island. This book got me hooked, but it confused me also as I didn't know if I should start reading the next books or the previous ones.  The general pattern in the whole series is: The beginning book is Ender's Game. Then we have two subcategories, one the Shadow series (which, with the exception of the first book, take place on earth and are more within military strategy) and one the Ender series (which take place in space and are more into new sci-fi ideas). Shadow series probably can be read from everyone, while I guess that the Ender series (especially from Speaker for the Dead onwards) would be read mainly from sci-fi fans. Below are my comments for the books of the series, in the order I have read them and a marking (10 is the highest mark):  Shadow of the Hegemon: The first book I have read, and which I could not leave from my hands. I finished it in 2 days. It was fast paced action, very smart plot and after reading it I believed that Orson Scot Card (OSC) has invented/re-invented a new genre of literature. That of military strategy and adventure combined with brilliance/mind games and hidden portions of romance. Such books always existed but this seemed to be THE book. It was like the way Dan Brown re-invented books with trivials and puzzles, together with fast paced adventure. I strongly recommend it to everybody that likes such type of books. (mark: 10)  Shadow puppets: The sequel to the above. I found it interesting but somehow boring as the above story developed little and the focus was on the characters (maybe too much focus so that it seemed to me that it was slightly mumbling jumbling. Strategy, brilliance and adventure seemed to be very low here. I would not recommend it for anybody to read it in isolate, unfortunately you have to read it if you want to go to the next book. I really believe that OSC made a mistake here (deliberately or not) as this book should have been told in 50-60 pages and be included in the previous or the next book. (mark: 6 but you will read it because you will want to read Shadow of the Giant)  Shadow of the Giant: (see below)  Ender's game: A really great book to read, probably the best of the series, however, as I had read its sequels first, when I reached the 80% of this book, I had predicted the end. However, it's at the highest standards of sci-fi, military strategy, adventure, brilliant mind games and very good depth in the human aspect of the characters. In comparison to the shadow series, it is more "space" sci-fi, while shadow series have much lesser sci-fi elements and are more down to earth. (mark: 10)  Speaker for the dead: Another great book, but different style. Less adventure, more human aspect, more maturity. Brilliance yes, but not military, sci-fi yes (some great ideas) but not spaceship style. (Mark: 9)  Xenocide: A good sequel of the previous novel. In certain points more brilliant, in other sections more boring, however is again a very good sci-fi book. The only flaw in these series (Speker for the dead, Xenocide, Children of the mind) is the idea behind one of the alien species described which I found outrageously extreme, however if you ignore it becomes first class reading. (Mark: 9)  Children of the mind: I think that OSC has wrapped up his case pretty badly in that one. It's a fair book except the fact that I felt that OSC mumbles jumbles for one third of the novel not having decided how to end it. In other critiques I have found it described as nice approach to moral dilemmas, however, moral dilemma is when you describe it once and make your choice, while here the dilemma is repeated and repeated... I felt like I was watching a movie worth 10 oscars and the end did not worth to be included even in a cheap video movie. And again, many open ends at the end (for possible sequels). (Mark: 7 but you will read it as you will be hooked from the previous ones).  Ender's shadow: Having read Enders Game and Shadow of the Hegemon, I found this book probably the best of the series, which of course is my subjective preference. I could characterize it as probably the best book I have read ever! Not to repeat myself, it has all that Shadow of the Hegemon and Ender's Game have, and even more...(Mark: the absolute 10).  Shadow of the Giant: When I read shadow puppets, I said, "that's it, OSC has lost either his talent or his appetite for good writing...", so I was pretty unwilling to read it. Fortunately I decided to, as it proved to be a good one, were I believe that OSC has nicely wrapped up his story, with two small flaws.  *	The one is described below (its end needed to be slightly more complete) and, *	The other is the fact that although he describes certain smart battles, he does not focus enough on them as it seems that he is in a hurry to wrap all things up. It had all elements to become a masterpiece but it ended up being a good to read book (Mark: 9)  In general, both series have three categories of good stuff: 1)	Some great sci-fi ideas (battle room, battle games, fantasy game, ansible, aia, Jane, in/out travel, raman varelse etc) 2)	Great military strategy, mind games etc combined with adventure 3)	In certain books, depth of characters, moral dilemmas etc And two main bad stuff: 1)	Mumbling jumbling in certain books which was completely unnecessary (either OSC wanted just to produce and sell another title - see shadow puppets- or he could not decide how the story will continue-see last book of Ender series). 2)	One of the alien species described in the Ender series was so too outrageous even for sci-fi that made it look ridiculous. The idea behind it was brilliant in sci-fi terms, but he could try a different living organism... Finally, OSC has left open ends in both series (probably for next sequels), however I believe that there are two things missing. a) the story of the Hive Queen and the Hegemon, told in a metaphorical manner so it means much for humanity. b) In ancient theatre, a story should end in a way that brings "katharsis" to the story, and the souls of the readers. I believe that the end of the shadow of the giant may be smart for commercial purposes but it was very unfair to the reader as it did not bring full "katharsis". 
 This can be a very easy to use camera. Simply by using the auto mode and composing your pictures properly you can get very good JPEG images. It also can be about as complicated as you want to make it. It has many advanced features on it. I have been shooting 35mm for about 32 years. My most recent before this one being an Elan II E about 7 years ago. It's still working also. The 30d is my first digital and I absolutely love the camera. I generally work in the aperture priority mode with a tripod at 100 ISO when shooting landscape. But, the camera is very capable in auto mode as well without the tripod. I like to shoot RAW so that I can tweek things a bit, but the JPEG images are very acceptable. It also works extremely well for portraits. It actually is better than the 35mm to me because it has very low noise even at higher ISOs. 1600 looks about like 800 film to me. This is a very good value for the money in my opinion 
 Ray's treatment of these classics is unique and could only be done by him. Ordinarilly, I don't even like "The Little Drummer Boy" but when the pedal steel kicks in along with blues vocals and big band horn refrains, I have to say "Wow, what a great song". Ray Charles could make ANYTHING sound good 
 I loved this book!! It's a well written story where you feel all the emotions of the characters. Reader: bare with the story because it is something really worth thinking about in the end. Does our soul really bounce back from one lifetime to the next until it fulfills its duty to stop the reincarnation? This story will help answer that. I love the angst-love deprived story between Celia and Stephen. Celia (de Bohun) 14 years old, and Stephen Marsdon, a Benedictine monk. Yes, they fall in love despite Stephen's vow to the Catholic Church; they just fall in love, and as a result of their love affair that took place four hundred years back, their past  catches up with them at the current time where only Stephen (Richard Marsdon) and Celia can resolve.  
 As an avid follower of mountaineering and whitewater rafting, Krakauer captures the frustration, helplessness, and disorientation of a disaster out of control. I could not put the book down, though I knew the outcome. Spectacular weaving of fact and emotion 
 The best teachers aren't in the classroom. They are in the real world where the rules are subtle, the game often a mystery, and winning doesn't come in a formula. Gail Evans has her insights and beliefs, and she is one of many executives that have some real-life experience to which they speak about 
 Greg Brown is unafraid to tackle the important issues of our day - baseball, fishing, a laughing river and the wind, along with the timeless theme of L-O-V-E. It all  goes down might fine thanks to Brown's froggy  vocals, spare but never dull guitar work, and the well-observed details of  his lyrics. And while so many singer/songerwriters concentrate so much on  the lyrics that they forget that you might want to tap your toes, not so  Brown, who adds colour to his songs with a number of sidemen, various  percussive instruments, and a variety of rhythms.  "I Don't Know That Guy"  and "Dream Cafe", with a lilting spanish/latin feel, are standouts 
 Nothing I say about this record will ever do it justice, and that's saying something cause God knows I always have a thing or two to say about everything. Let's just say that I can't wait to see Feeder live! After listening to this record non-stop for the past 2 months, I am addicted to this band and anything they do.  This is really not a surprise since I am always a huge fan of anything British, especially British music! They produce the best music hands down (come one! Duran Duran, The Killers, Oasis, Coldplay, The Cranberries, K's Choice, Snow Patrol, Keane, Pet Shop Boys, Queen, George Michael, Ronan Keating, Mark Owen, Daniel Bedingfield, Sting, Seal, Aqualung, David Grey, ... I know I am forgetting some!)  The tracks that literally take my breath away every single time I listen to them are Morning Life, Pain on Pain, Tender, Dove Grey Sand, and Frequency. Unbelievable harmonic melodies with great, touching lyrics to boot! No band or artist had quite this effect on me since Tori Amos' Winter back in 1991.  The shock of all of this is that this record isn't released in the US domestically. You have to buy it as IMPORT for triple its price or you can always buy it from Amazon.co.uk.  I don't care how you get it, just get it. You'll love it 
 I bought this novel from a bargain bin (because of the cover design), put it on a shelf, and didn't open it for over a month.  When I finally picked it up, I read only twelve pages before I grabbed my highlighter...  The writing style is deceptively simple and highly structured--breathtaking, actually.  And the story is fantastic (and well told).  Highly recommended 
   I just got to say that Falling Leaves is one of my absolute favorite books ever! Readers out there, who enjoy reading about the life of an author, then read Falling Leaves! This fabulous memoir is about the author, Adeline Yen Mah, and what she went through in her life. From her childhood to adulthood... every single line from every page draws you in, and you just can't stop reading!     Adeline Yen Mah had to fight through her entire life to survive from her family. After she was born, her mother died giving birth to her. Her father got married to an Eurasian woman, who treated Adeline so unfairly and uncaring. Because her mother died giving birth to her, Adeline's siblings also treated her like dirt. It felt like Adeline wasn't loved at all from her family. Because of her courage, intelligence, perseverance, love, and kindness, Adeline Yen Mah struggled for her own independence and survived a lot of obstacles and events throughout her terrible life.    I loved the beginning to the end of this spine-tingling memoir of a Chinese daughter who was unwanted from her own family. (Like it says in the title.) I truly felt how courageous and how really scared Mah was because of her awful childhood. She is obviously a role model and an inspiration to all the children who are unwanted and unloved from their own families like Mah was with hers. Mah can totally relate to those children.     Readers, now I think you can see why Falling Leaves is one of my favorite books of all time. Now it's your turn to read about the tragic childhood of Adeline Yen Mah. Enjoy! :) 
 Caregivers who live with a severely ill family member or friend receive a guide on how they can handle life-threatening and life-changing illness. From how to help others heal using one's presence and support to understanding differences between healing and curing, this is packed with advice from the author's own work with cancer support groups, and provides a solid foundation for understanding and growth 
 Couldn't find the darn thing anywhere so I finally bought it in Germany, of course in German, and I worked hard for three months to read it with the dictionary. I enjoyed it even so, 'nuff said. Congratulations to Amazon for  finding an English version ;- 
 I don't read "The Cat Who..." books for mystery or thrills. I read them for their charm and warmth, to visit old friends again, to walk down the streets of Pickax and browse the shops, to admire Quill's reserved intelligence and thoughtfulness, and to play with Yum Yum and Koko as they race up and down the ramps in the apple barn. By that measure, "The Cat Who Went Bananas" is a wonderful and thoroughly enjoyable addition to Braun's series.  Some reviewers have criticized the ending as vague or unclear, but I found it more realistic than endings where everything is wrapped up neatly. In real life, nothing is wrapped up neatly. If you view these books as character studies of idealized small town life, then the ending was more appropriate, more fitting, and more satisfying.  If you're looking for a comfortable, cozy reunion with your friends in Moose County, you'll enjoy this book 
 Reading Robert Quinns book and follow his recommandation could lead yourself into a new dimension of thinking about yourself. I strongly recommend this book for everybody, it's never to late start building.  
 This book can be viewed as either a repository of interesting knowledge or as a way to one up people in conversation at cocktail parties.  There are chapters to correspond with the major departments in a liberal arts college (art, literature, economics, etc.)  This is a guide to everything that you learned in college and forgot (or everything you should have learned but skipped out on).  If you are still in high school, read this book--you will be able to easily impress your teachers with college-level knowledge.  I cannot wait for the new edition to be released 
 This book illustrates how it feels to be a deaf child growing up in a hearing world. Even though the character isn't 100% deaf 
 WOW!  I just finished reading "The God Code", and found it to be one of those books that's just so interesting and absorbing that I didn't want to put it down.  It's also one of those books that leads you to ponder, wonder and think about the world as it is, and the world as it could be...    "The God Code" speaks about a code that was discovered in our DNA, and the implications of such a code.  While using the science called "gematria" (which involves converting words/letters back to either of 2 of the most ancient languages, and then applying the number values associated with the letters of one or both of these languages to find words that are "related in nature"), the code "God/Eternal within the body" was found.  This means that in every one of our bodies, God's signature, or reminder to us, is shown in each and every one of our cells - how wonderful and incredible is that!!!  This book also discusses the idea that this code could be used as a reminder to us that our sameness is more important than our differences - as we all have the same code within us.  In a time where we humans tend to look for the differences between us, and then use these differences to ignite all sorts of negative feelings and reactions (including war), it would serve us well to look for what will unite us - for that which would bring us together as the family we all are.  As the author so poignantly shows, during times of extreme strife (like Sept. 11 and the many major disasters of our time), we tend to forget our differences, and jump into a mode of helping one another without even thinking about it first - it's as if these times are a demonstration of who we "really" are.  But, how can we demonstrate this level of caring for our fellow man without there having to be a disaster - what would it take?   Overall, I found this to be a very interesting read.  And as such, I would recommend it to anyone interested in the idea of unity vs. separatism, as well as those who are intriqued by the idea that our Creator left us a sign to remind us that we are more than the bodies we are currently in 
 Anthony Rapp has a reputation amongst his fans and peers as being open, geniune and purely Anthony.  His album is no exception.  Anthony puts his heart on the line with his lyric, and bares his soul through his voice.  His sound is unique, fresh, purely Anthony.  This album is a must buy.  
 Thanks to late Edi Biukovic. Too bad the same cannot be said of the cover (or rather, too bad Edi didnt do the cover too) 
 I read this book a year or so ago, and it really drilled home the important disciplines of the Christian life. Easy to read, but it will take some effort to live it out! Highly recommended 
 I have read the first 3 of the 4 books listed in this archive and they are all excellent books.  David DeCandido's book has an obvious shortfall but I would never spoil that for a reader.  The first book is a great tie in with novels done by Richard Knaak and I highly suggest you take the time to read those when you can because from his perspective is where the  world of Warcraft come from. The best book in my opinion is the 2nd book, concerning the birth and raising of Thrall.  It probably, more than any of the others lays out the epic problems facing the Alliance and the Horde.    The only true problem that I would have with these books is that they don't coincide.  The characters are different in each book and there is not necessarily a continuation from book to book (not direct continuation, there are subtleties).  They are completely different points of view from different authors.  I think many people will find they enjoy this, but it was a bit misleading to me.    However, don't let that detour you from getting this if you haven't read the novels.  You will be HOOKED and find yourself pouring into the novels on a near daily basis.  Finally, for the price Amazon is offering it, you would be very unfortunate to not purchase this collection. 
 I saw this movie in 1977.  Catherine was played by Susan Saradon and it was one of my favorite movies.  If it is out on DVD or video, I would recommend checking it out 
 As I read this fast paced political thriller, I kept thinking of those periods in late Republican Rome and then during the Empire when assassination was one of the political tools.  I don't have any idea if Vince Flynn thought about it along those lines but the Praetorian Guards' murder of Caligula was carried out by professional soldiers, skilled in the deadly arts, much like the characters in "Term Limits".  The Mike Nance character brings to mind Catiline, the Roman politician and conspirator, who would probably feel right at home in the current  Washington political environment that Flynn portrays.    This story works well with the premise that modern Washington is the direct descendant of Rome, leaving aside arguments of weather it resembles Rome at its early Republican best or more the later decadent imperial periods. 
 Kids love Franklin the turtle and so if they have to go the hospital, this book will really help.  Franklin's shell hurts when he's trying off after having a bath. He learns he'll have to have an operation. He shows his friends a book he got all about the hospital and all his friends think that he's very brave. But he worries that he might not be as brave as everyone thinks.  I think it's neat that this book teaches on two fronts --- both technical stuff about the hospital and also about courage and feelings.  Note that while this book has the names Paulette Bourgeois and Brenda Clark on the cover, an examination of the title page reveals that it is actually written by Sharon Jennings (who has also done many of the TV storybooks) with illustrations by Shelley Southern. It's still a neat book though 
 Perhaps the long shadow of Francis Parkman has discouraged historians from writing about the French and Indian War (Seven Year's War).  Whatever the reason it's good to see from the publication of several books that Americans are taking a renewed interest in the pre-revolutionary period when the British were triumphant and the Indians still counted as a political force.    It's past time for a thorough revision of Parkman -- who was ungenerous with the Indians although I thrilled as a young reader to his descriptions of their ferocity -- for example, the "insensate fury" of the Iroquois.  Actually, the Iroquois were less insensate than they were astute.    Calloway omits the bloody details and vivid writing of Parkman but he gives us a thorough picture of what happened in the wake of the English victory over the French in North America.  In particular he focuses on the frontier and the built-in conflict of American settlers, British policy, and the Indian tribes who either went down to defeat with the French or were betrayed by perfidious Albion.  They made their point, however, in Pontiac's War and by clearing white settlers from the frontier. But their  numbers were declining and they would soon be overwhelmed.           This is a good book about the issues of the frontier between Whites and Indians.  In addition, there's a good account of the French movement from Canada to Louisiana and the Spanish rule in Florida and the trans-Mississippi.    Smallchief  
 I wanted to access my Okidata Laser 5200n with wireless notebooks and my HP desktop.  I have the Belkin PreN in a room that is quite far and I get good reception in the Den where the Desktop and printer are located.   I did as instructed in the Wizard but the printer was not recognized.  I called Tech support and they were nice but ultimately after their instructions, the computer did not recognize the IP address and I got nowhere.  "Send it back" was the tech's solution... "it probably doesn't recognize the Okidata".  I tried one more instruction with the Wizard before I gave up.  I connected the server directly to the router and the computer recogized the IP three rooms away.  I disconnected, took the Server to the room, connected the printer to the Belkin and all worked just fine.   Once I did one computer, I loaded the program on two others and now I can access the Okidata with an HP, a Toshiba Notebook, a Sony Notebook, and a Compaq notebook.  Now I will try my daughter's MAC and see.  Ralp 
 To say this is a great film is probably an overstatement, but it certainly is a great idea for a film. Gibson looks good, Weaver looks good, Hunt acts good, Weir directs good, and the script is better than good. Much. It's a movie about ideas, which earns high marks these days, as so few flics can make that claim. Sure, it stumbles a bit, and the ending is purposely frustrating, to carry forward the theme of White Guilt and "What then shall we do?" Beyond all that, it's sensual, and unpredictable, and pretty damned intelligent. Seen anything lately in the multiplex that fits that bill? I ain't. See it for yourself. 
 Product and service perfect, everything was exactly as promised. I will be back 
 First issued in 1975, this book captures the magnitude and the magnificence of Chicago's architecture that has been destroyed (by nature and man).  Today Chicago is widely regarded as an architectural jewel (and it is, I live there!) but after reading this book you won't be able to stop imagining how much more amazing the city might be if the Urban Renewal movement of the 1960s and early 1970s had never happened.  If you are interested in architecture, Chicago history or urban design and planning, read this book 
 I liked this book a lot. It was very helpful, though it did make a lot of refrences to sex. All in all, I don't regret buying it 
 Sharpe is very sharp indeed with Porterhouse Blue.  He captures the atmosphere of English academic conservatism at its very funny and ironic best.  And the best that can be said about PB is that you won't want to put the book down until it's finished - definitely a one-sitting read!  So many plots and counter plots that will keep you guessing and wanting to turn the page. Go buy it immediately, before you have a Porterhouse Blue.. 
 I'm a confirmed baby-boomer and usually buy only 60's and 70's music, but after I got XM radio in my new pickup truck I started hearing a few newer songs that I liked and almost all of them were sung by "Maroon 5".  I didn't even know who they were.  I do now!  "Songs About Jane" is a great CD for playing over and over on a long drive or a boring commute.  It will keep your foot tapping and (weather permitting) you can roll down the window and slap the side of your door!  There are a couple of soft jazzy ballads mixed in to get your heart rate back down to normal.  The beat is usually relentless, the chord and key shifts beautiful and often unexpected, and the high vocal harmonies (wish there were more of them) are as precise as Lennon-McCartney or Heart.  Each week, a different song from this CD will find its way into your subconcious and refuse to leave!  OK, so a few of the songs do have a "Motown" aura to them...after Motown got mowed-down by rap, we need someone to revive the original Motown sound anyway.  Way to go Maroon 5 -- there is some hope for the music of the "X" (or is it "Y"?) generation 
 rioritizing Web Usability by Jakob Nielsen and Hoa Loranger can best be described as a more 'strict' approach to web usability. If you have been in web development for any extended period of time it is likely that you have heard the name Jakob Nielsen. He offers great insight to web usability and has for many years. Some may view him as strict, some as normal, and still some as WAY off his rocker. No matter how you view him, he deserves much respect for his time spent in usability studies and the (somewhat timeless) statistics and information he brings to the table. I just finished reading this book, coupled with "Don't Make Me Think" by Steve Krugg, and appreciated what all of the authors could present through statistics, screenshots, and customer insight.  The first part of this book focused on revisiting early web usability findings. This dealt with discussing the aspects of web usability that have progressed since his first book. He went through each of them and re-evaluated their score. His scoring method was based on 1-3 skulls, with 3 representing major problems and 1 as not as problematic. He goes through each of them and asserts why (or why not) they received their specific rating. Many of these deal with the basics of web development such as underlining links, using animation or other intensive use of graphical elements, and the structure of pages. I found this section to be a great resource, but the best of the book was still yet to come.  The middle chapters (I would break this book into thirds), discussed assessing your website and potential usability problems. The chapters focused on such things as: Search, Navigation and Information Architecture, Typography, and Writing for the Web. Each of these chapters plunged deep into the root of HOW users interact with each element.  With search, it included such things as where the search box is placed, how it is worded, and how easily results are returned. He examined several sites and their search results - giving feedback to their listing and usefulness. The concept of Search Engine Optimization was also discussed here, giving you insight on how to optimize your internal website to interact with the larger search engines. Navigation and Information Architecture was interesting, but I don't believe much as changed in the past few years. Users are accustomed to many different elements when browsing a website (a standard, if you will). Many times when this is broken it causes the user to have to stop, spend time THINKING about the site, and then interacting (if they stay in it that long). Typography was discussed in detail, and I found this to be an informative chapter - even if you are not a designer. It lets you know what fonts are common for web browsers, the difference between serif and sans-serif and its effects on users and their reading pattern, and using case and spacing (and color) to present your content. These are often the little things that are overlooked when developing a website, and he gives several examples of typefaces in page structures. Writing for the web is somewhat of an art. Many companies rely on marketing `fluff' to get content in place. This strategy is more harmful than helpful as people are in search of your content - and if they get fluff or can't find what they are looking for, they can instantly go to another website. Through this book, and others, I have found that the key to successful copy on the web is `Keep it Short.' The last part of the book discussed e-commerce, product page structure, using technology that works, and finding design that works. Again, I don't feel that there was anything earth shattering or new mentioned - but re-inforced with up to date websites and common mistakes.  When discussing technology that works, he made mention to accessibility. He states "An accessible site is one that removes obstacles that get in people's way; removing the obstacle overcomes the disability." In design that works he emphasizes the `practice of simplicity.' He makes the analogy of interior decorating. He states that "An amateur decorator might pack a living room with a jumble of furniture styles, patterns, and textures in a misguided attempt to dazzle. In contrast, skilled designers carefully select items that support their clients' needs, ruthlessly eliminating those elements that do not serve a real purpose." . Basically, assessing each element of your design and asking if it simplifies the user experience or adds value. If it doesn't, then remove it!  The steps to finding a design that works involves evaluating new technology. "There will always be new technology, but setting your sights too high backfires. Early adopters are a minority."  This book is an invaluable resource for anyone doing web development and is highly recommended if you want to really understand your users and their habits. It is a fairly quick read and is packed with up-to-date screenshots and statistics 
 ***** This is an upscale designer water bottle, top of the line, and so much fun. The designs Of Sigg's water bottles are gorgeous, from the plain, solid color bottles, to the ones with intricate designs. They are simply beautiful! I switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns, thinking it take more work to maintain. These do necessitate regular cleaning (I clean mine every day), but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning fun. Sort of like my rings, glasses, and watch, I now consider my Sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory, reminding me to drink more water, making a statement about my values, and expressing myself with a special design. Yes, all in a water bottle!  Sigg of Switzerland water bottles are very high quality, made of light aluminum on the outside, slightly insulated, and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever, unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles. They are light, durable, and perfect for any activity. Well water tastes spectacular in these bottles, just like from the tap.  I bought this particular top because I don't like sports tops, and I don't mind unscrewing the top when I want a drink. It is totally leakproof, which is important to me. The top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabiner. I like carrying mine, though. I get comments on it all the time, "What's that? I love it!"  Sigg makes their personal water bottle in .6L and 1L in this style. I have both. I use the .6L for sports activities because they are smaller. When I won't have to carry the container, I like the larger bottle.  They are expensive, but they are so durable that you can plan on them lasting many years. I consider them both an accessory and an investment in my health, so they are well worth it value-wise for me.  Highly recommended. **** 
 You can lose yourself in this book.  A long epic tale that keeps you interested from beginning to end. 
 Loretta Lynn is a wonderful singer. These songs are classic country. The songs on this CD are so much better than anything that the new country artsists can do 
 Hi, Boston.   Loved your book. Will keep this brief:   By using a standard, legal passport, how traceable am I should I  decide to leave the US? If I get a round-trip ticket (to avoid suspicion), then go to an intermediate country before then going to my true destination, does that cover my tracks somewhat?  I would not be comfortable faking ID.  Thanks for any guidance you can provide.   Take care, Joh 
 All The Right Moves was the film that discovered Tom Cruise.  Tom plays a high school football superstar looking to get out of his steel mill town via a college scholarship.  Craig T Nelson plays his coach. (This was before he was TV's Coach!)  He also thinks a winning team could get him a job at a college.  Lea Thompson hadn't gone Back to the Future yet, but plays Tom's girl.  The movie is light weight but still fun to watch.    A must have for all Tom Cruise fans.  DVD EXTRAS: None 
 Thomas Kuhn's book has provided comfort for me personally.  There is no need to go into the details of his arguments.  For example, whether the old generation has to die before paradigm shift can take place is not the issue.  The issue is whether scientists resist anything new that cannot be fitted into the existing paradigm.  Whether it took ten years or a lifetime for people to accept the theory of the origin of ulcers is irrelevant.  I am disagreeing with the review by Peter Hobson (Groton, CT USA), 12/25/2005].  What's important is the initial reaction of the community to new ideas.  I have evidence to support the observations and analysis by T. Kuhn. Revolutionary ideas and theories gain faster acceptance if the new paradigm can quickly lead to economical and social benefits.  I believe this is why the story of ulcers so quickly received the recognition of Nobel Prize in Medicine.  If the idea leads to more effective treatment, who could hold up its consequences?  Even the opponent would embrace it immediately because he would not want to suffer from ulcers.   The problem is that sometime the benefit of making a paradigm shift is not immediately obvious.  The defendant of the old paradigm simply resists changes to protect his reputation that is merely built on perfecting the old paradigm. It is difficult for most to appreciate the point of view expressed in Kuhn's book because most readers are not involved in a process of scientific revolution.  As someone solely responsible for a scientific revolution occurring in a sub-branch of physics, I can verify based on my experience, i.e., on the reaction to our work that Kuhn is right on the money.  Let me quote three remarks by the member of the community, first on my published scientific article, second on a rejected manuscript, and the third on my declined proposal to the National Science Foundation:  "To say that the conclusions drawn by the submitted article are controversial is an understatement of Herculean proportion....While scientific advancement often requires the disproving of established thought, the authors of this work attempt to do so without sufficient proof. The material responses described in this article could be ascribed to other physical processes, including those that adhere to the traditional school of thought...The urgency to abandon conventional wisdom without sound basis is disturbing." "The Comment by xxx (two of whom are xxx Medalists) makes a very strong case for dismissing the main results of xxx (the present reviewer).  Unfortunately, the Reply makes ZERO valid counterpoints and consequently should not be published.  If  xxx (the present reviewer) want to admit their mistakes and explain how they fell into the trap of publishing erroneous results, this might be useful so that others do not make similar mistakes in the future." "Overall, the PI needs to calm down considerably.  In this proposal and his recent papers, the PI tries valiantly to sell his work as the single most important breakthrough in the history of science! In fact, both the proposed and recent work is reasonable, but the overselling done by the PI irritates people."  I hope that people like Mr. Peter Hobson would in the future interview some people involved in scientific revolutions before making comments that could be misleading.   It is very sad that the phenomena described by Thomas Kuhn are real.  I have learned to be patient and more tolerant after reading the book. I am also very intrigued by his definition of Science as well as his statements regarding textbooks that present science as absolute truth without offering any historical perspective and describing where it comes from and who is chiefly responsible for creating it.  I hope to write about these issues at another time 
 I thought this was an excellent book and it certainly describes how to achieve power but only to a limited extent.  In the final analysis you must ACTUALLY know what you are doing and you must have the support of others.  Every star sets just as it rises and anyone who thinks that they will never suffer reverses or need the support of others lives in the dream world described in this book.  All of these techniques are real and based on my experience and observation they work, but what is missing from this book is any word of caution.  At least Machiavellie gives you some of the downsides, which this book lacks. This is the "law of the west" and just like the old west, there is ALWAYS a faster gun and the person who has practiced these techniques will find himself in real trouble when he meets that faster gun.  With over 30 years in the corporate world I know first hand that ruthless people get ruthless treatment and in the end all you have is your reputation and the support of those who believe in you.  If you use these techniques without regard for others or your reputation in the end it will cost you.  However, these techniques are real and they do work, but I think they should be applied sparingly 
 The Thailand Handbook gives you valuable background information on the culture and history of Thailand. As far as places to go are concerned, it is refreshing to see a guidebook that covers not only the major attractions but also the attractions of smaller towns you might pass through on your journey 
 I really enjoyed reading this book.  The author is very witty and gets straight to the point.  He is very direct and very practical.  The book is also very easy to read. I truly enjoyed his humor and I refer to it often.  I carry it with me to "keep me on my toes".  I recommend it to anyone who wants to change their lifestyle for the best 
 Cissik did a very thorough job researching Olympic-style weightlifting - in fact, this text reads like a research paper/thesis.  Having said that, the text might be a little too formal for some.  
 This is a superb performance by Madonna as Evita (both ultra egos). Acting and singing are superb. Goes to show Hollywood can still produce good stuff when they try, but this never got the recognition it deserved.  This is a must see!! 
 very informative and detailed. infact its too detailed in parts. but this book is certainly worth the time and money to read 
 Another great album from a true superstar! My personal favorites off this album are "I've Seen That Look On Me A Thousand Times", "Haven't You Heard", "In Too Deep" and most of all  "Lefty's Gone". Crank up the CD player and enjoy over and over!! 
 Prince Carrick of the fae (farries) is cursed to live without his ladylove, the human Lady Gwen, until three people can fall in love.  The first is Aidan Gallagher, owner and operator of the local family pub, and keeper of his artistic absent-minded brother, and lovably shallow sister.  Jude Francis is an American ex-psych professor who wants to write a book on Irish fairy tales. She moves into her grandmother's cottage, the very one Lady Gwen dwelled in, and where her ghost still haunts.  Aidan is a very fatherly character but still tall, dark, and sexy. Jude was hard for me to relate to (I read this when I was only 20) as she's a little older than most romance heroines (other ones about her age and maturity are usually widows falling for their husband's best friend).  Roberts creates very believable sexual tension without blinding conflict, just uses human frailties to keep you guessing about the fate of Aidan and Jude, and she interweaves a masterful tale of Carrick and Gwen. The secondary characters are rich, the scenery beautiful, and the set up for the next two in the series (Tears of the Moon, Heart of the Sea) excellent.  A sure fire page turner for every romance fan, and another smooth tale for Nora Roberts' fans 
 Butler's writing was always elegant and humane, even when describing inhuman subjects. In this case, it's a culture of modern-day vampires, living quietly with the little flocks of humans that they feed on. But, as always happens when people (in the broad sense) are involved, emotions both drive and hinder the people involved. And, as happens also, even people who are very close aren't always driven in the same direction or at the same time.  This, like many of Butler's stories, is about close groups, the kind that look equally like large families or small villages. They're assembled from disparate parts. The parts don't always fit well, at least not at first. As a result, the groupings often change the people involved, not always in ways that they want to be changed. There are other analogies to her earlier work, too, but this novel stands wonderfully well on its own.  In fact, it gave me a reading experience I haven't had in years. Once I really got into it, I just couldn't put it down, no matter what else demanded my attention. The central characters are complex and largely believable, even with a few unbelievable premises to get the story going. And, despite some very tragic events, there's a core of strength and optimism deep inside - another thing I see far too rarely.  //wiredweir 
 Elly St. Clair and Cooper Boone are engaged-until Elly finds out that Cooper has fought a duel over her. It's not the dueling she minds so much, as the reason for it-control of the Aurora Springs Guild. Elly had hoped Cooper was at last showing a bit of passion toward her. Instead he was only concerned with his rival's attempt to worm his way into Guild leadership by marrying Elly, whose father sits on the Guild council.  And Elly naturally suspects Cooper of the same motive-especially since he has always wanted to head the Guild. So she breaks off their engagement and moves to the big city-Cadence City-where she starts her own business. But Cooper has no intention of letting her go.  Taking us into the world of Harmony, a planet settled by earth's descendants, who have begun to develop psi powers after a few centuries there, Jayne Castle, AKA Jayne Ann Krentz, AKA Amanda Quick pens yet another winner for the reader to enjoy.  Mix action, suspense, drama, hot romance and plop it down into the middle of Castle's lush and intriguing world, and you have the author's usual can't-put-it-down-`til-the-last-page success. Castle's imagination has carried us through many incredible and riveting yarns, and it doesn't fail us here as she skillfully draws us into Elly and Cooper's hunt for a psi killer who is peddling an extremely dangerous new drug.  I enjoyed this book as I always enjoy Castle's work: way too much. But when Castle/Krentz/Quick has a new book available, the rest of the world will just have to wait. Recommended.

 A must have book for any Thomas the Tank Engine fa 
 All of my questions about Hell were addressed in this simple book.  In an upfront, honest, clear, and useful manner Emanuel Swedenborg tells of the conversations that he has had with Devils and Evil Spirits.  He does not try to impress, or persuade, he just informs.  This book was such a relief.  I expected a series of unbelievable encounters, but instead I found accounts of situations that are exlemplary of real interactions.  This book is understandable.  It is very true.  It is helpful and uncomprimising in its integrity.  I reccomend it.  No matter what you believe about the afterlife, it will help you to understand many of the reasons why life is the way that it is 
 Very nice product.  Holds lots of things - especially able to put full size pieces of paper in a zippered compartment, which is very useful for me.  
 o Lang Lang. German Echo Klassic 2004 Award Winner. Best Pianist.  http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_Klassik  o About this Carnegie Hall recording? The one given some pretty bad reviews from the peanut gallery? Well, the recording won a 2005 Amadeus Austrian Music Award. And a DVD of this recital with documentary footage won the 2005 "Music DVD of the Year" Echo Klassik Award.  Music has always been interpretive and a vital mark of virtuosity is having your own voice - Lang has his own voice and he masterfully distinguishes himself with it. Lang is a refreshing draft of fresh air in a typically stagnant arena. Technically, the kid can flat out play. Period. Interpretively, he is bold, unafraid, and lets it all hang out.  Nuff said ...  Cheers! 
 Our church chose this book as a theme for what we call Faith in Action seven week study in the fall.  St. Francis' prayer is my all time favorite prayer and it is interesting to study about the man and his beliefs.  We are concentrating on that portion of the book so far 
 Fly Fishing the Rocky Mountain Backcountry is a very comprehensive guide to backcountry fishing.  Rich Osthoff gives the reader a generous portion of his extremely comprehensive understanding of backcountry fishing.  He delves into different backpacking styles, reveals his theories of alpine lake fishing, recounts numerous fishing experiences, and motivates the reader to get on the trail, ready to trek for Trophy Goldens, Rainbows, Cutts, and Brookies.   His information on the Goldens of the Wind Rivers alone is reason enough to buy the book.  Osthoff should be commended for sharing what he has learned during his 25+ years of backcountry fishing.  If anyone wishes to seriously fish for big backcountry fish, this book must be purchased, read and re-read 
 We haven't had any of the problems that other reviewers have.  We have regular square tile on our bath walls.  The basket holds several floating toys, plus a cup for dunking water, shampoo, wash cloths, etc.....  We love it 
 WHAT CAN YOU SAY?  ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL AND IRREPLACEABLE!  IF YOU LIKE THEATER, YOU MUST HAVE THIS 
 The lid fits perfectly, unlike the 4 canister set. Just the right size for about 2 dozen cookies. I'm very pleased with this purchase 
 I bought two sets of these so that I would have a backup set to put into my Canon S3 IS when the first set ran dry. Last year, on a trip to Portugal, Spain, and London, I was quite pleased at how long these batteries lasted before having to install the replacement set. I was able to take the majority of 500+ photographs using just one set, fully charged 
 If a friend told me that he was flying to a deserted island in the South Pacific to start a new country, first I would tell him he was crazy.  Next, I would give him this book, insist that he read it, and use it as a  blueprint for a successful society.  Mr. Mueller's book is an excellent  defense of both capitalism and democracy, the twin pillars of our American  society.  The author points out that while neither system is perfect, both  are superior to any other economic method or political institution.  His  book is filled with interesting facts and fascinating insights.  For  example, Mr. Mueller insists that capitalism, far from extinguishing  virtue, actually encourages it.  This is because businessmen who treat  their customers and co-workers with fairness and compassion have an  economic advantage over their brooding colleagues.  This seems  counterintuitive but is born out by evidence.  Service was especially poor  and rude in former communist countries.  Today, American companies from  McDonald's to K-Mart, much maligned by the press, are teaching benevolent  business practices to Third World nations from Africa to the Orient.  Mr.  Mueller also makes the interesting point that economics is approaching a  level of sophistication similar to medicine at the turn of the twentieth  century.  Today, for the first time ever, economists can offer truly  effective remedies for policy makers.  Such a development, if true,  promises an era of truly spectacular growth.  The author also makes the  sobering point that capitalism is a poor tonic for increasing personal  happiness.  Money has never substituted for family, faith, and meaningful  work.  Nor will it in the future.  When it comes to democracy, Mr. Mueller  believes that we expect too much from our political process.  The 1994  health care debate, to some commentators, is an example of our failed  democracy.  In contrast, Mr. Mueller suggests that this episode proves the  resiliency of our institutions.  Legislation was proposed and debated,  constituencies were mobilized and addressed, and the outcome was largely  favorable.  Democracy can be messy but it is incredibly responsive and  self-correcting.  It is the only political system that provides the average  citizen with the instruments of political power.  As more and more nations  embrace the virtue of capitalism and democracy, colossal progress can be  made in alleviating poverty, ensuring human rights, and achieving  self-actualization.  There is no realistic alternative to democracy or  capitalism on the horizon.  Nor should we want one 
 I loved this book, as I have loved all of the Vampire Chronicles.  It pains me to see the harsh, judgmental comments that people feel they need to share.  I believe someone else said this quite well, Mrs. RIce didn't write her books for us, so they'd read the way WE wanted them to.  She wrote them for herself, so that she'd be happy with them, so SHE could choose how the story developes.  Those of you that act personally insulted because the book didn't end up like you wanted it to need to rethink the purpose of the READER in this relationship.  The author writes, and you, the reader, read the book.  If you don't like the book, then don't read it again.  But don't you dare tear apart the book because you want to rewrite it.  If you want a new ending, write it yourself.  Mrs. Rice doesn't allow fanfiction of her work because she wants her work to be her own, in all aspects.  Many authors have done the same, because they don't want angry readers like yourselves to write a book based on their work and totally ruin the idea for the rest of us. I, personally, have only read The Vampire Chronicles; none of Mrs. Rice's other works.  I probably won't ever read the rest of her books, but its because the topic doesn't interest me.  The vampire chronicles interested me, and still do, and I will never stop reading them.  I have absolutely no complaints about any part of the series.   Thank you Mrs. Rice, for writing these, and ignore the comments of the fools and buffoons who would try to shape your work in their image.  
 Ford paints the past and the present of that midwestern phenomoenom, the hollow eyed drifter with the soft spoken voice and two coats of dust on his boots. Ford's prose is deadpan and its power is cumulatitve, as opposed to immediate and lyrical like Denis Johnson. Ford has no fear of letting his tales mosie along and take their sweet time to get where they are going, which is usually a place of muted pain and forlorn prospects. Gambler's out of luck, casualties of the waste land, Ford's character's are tough, but not without enough scars that we feel for them. All in all, Ford out Carver's Carver, and takes the Midwest of Hemingway into the desolation of the 21st Century 
 The boy's a genius and the book's seductive, haunting, wise, and funny to boot.  A terrific ride 
 This book is currently the bible for taxonomic nomenclature in CO.  There is a significant amount of discussion when it comes to assigning names to various plants, but Dr. Weber presents a balanced approach that combines mainstream scientific thought with his own extensive field experience.   If one criticism could be made it would be that this flora only covers the Western Slope area.  Hopefully Dr. Weber's publishers will see the value in supporting a more comprehensive volume that covers the Eastern slope as well 
 I was curious about how a follow-up to Beautiful Tomorrow could achieve relevance without sounding dated. Beautiful Tomorrow, in effect, I think was a vicitim of it's own success with the Naked Music sound in jeopardy of being "copy-catted" to death.    Aquarian Angel is the remedy. It's completely unique and exactly where sophisticated house needs to go next . . . Standout tracks include "Tropicalia" and "You Just Can't Stop" - the vocals and lyrics on the latter track are quite profound and delivered with just the right amount of heartache, wisdom, and soul by Catherine Russell.  Stunning!   
 This book is a pretty good read in that it outlines some of the issues surrounding being an artist in today's society. It is more cursory than comprehensive.  Basically it points out the issues but doesn't really delve into them very deeply. If you are already an artist it won't give you that much more insight than you probably already have, however it will serve to point you in thinking in the right direction.  For the price I guess it's worth reading. I cannot recommend it as a 'must buy' but I also cannot say stay away from it 
    This is one of my favorite Michael Douglas films of all    time! Douglas gives a superb performance as a young,     ambitious, and intense judge who strongly desires to do    right for his fellow man. However a series of loopholes    manifested by witty attorneys force him to let savage     criminals go free without punishment. Enter fellow judge    and mentor Hal Holbrook who senses Douglas's frustration    and reveals to him a shattering secret. Holbrook's     "father figure" performance is very enjoyable and      probably makes him the most likeable character in the     movie.     The other actors are just as convincing. Yaphett Kotto,     who never disappoints gives an excellent performance as a    cop trying hard to solve a series of child murders. James    B. Sikking gives a extremely dramatic performance as the     distraught father of a murder victim. However, the ending    could have used some improvement. Never the less, this film    delivers an entertaining display of flaws in the judicial    system. 
 Timeless. The story's still powerful, the performances still splendid in spite of the passage of time since the film's first release. That's quite a treat. This is an historic drama with wit, intelligence and a refreshing lack of heavy handedness.  On another note it's great fun to see "early editions" of some of the cast. Leo McKern (Cromwell) was Rumpole even then and who could have imagined Robert Shaw (Henry) as the shark hunter in "Jaws"? Come to think of it, fortry years ago who could have imagines "Jaws"?  Too often seeing the re-release of an old favorite has left me wondering what I liked about it in the first place. Not so A Man for All Seasons. Great flick then, great flick now!

 L. Gregory Jones gives us a serious, meaningful, and deep study and dialogue with the Christian call and struggle to forgive.  This is no simple forgive and forget just because you know you should type of writing.  Instead, Jones wrestles with the idea that pain and evil are realities that cannot be simply glossed over with a cliche' of Christian words and piety.  Anyone who is interested in the battle against evil and the answers that the cross of Jesus offers over against this struggle against evil, need to read this book.   Jones engages many dialogue partners in his writings and in so doing tells the stories, biographically, of people who have had profound stuggles with forgiveness in the face of extreme brutallity, violence and pain.  For example Jones shares with us the life and struggles of Bonhoeffer against the evil's of Hitler and the Nazi's.  This and many other stories are taken up and examined.       Jones maintains that forgiveness is not easy, but what we as Christians are called to embody in practice.  One story which he quotes that illustrates this is the story of the Turks who oppressed the Armenian's.  This powerful story illustrates the position that Jones essentially takes.        "A Turkish officer raided and looted the Armenian home.  He       killed the aged parents and gave the daughters to the                    soldiers, keeping the eldest daughter for himself.  Some       time later she escaped and trained as a nurse.  As time        passed, she found herself nursing in a ward of Turkish        officers.  One night, by the light of a lantern, she saw        the face of this officer.  He was so gravely ill that        without exceptional nursing he would die.  The days passed,       and he recovered.  One day, the doctor stood by the bed        with her and said to him, 'But for her devotion to you, you       would be dead.'  He looked at her and said, 'We have met       before haven't we?' 'Yes,' she said, 'we have met before.'       'Why didn't you kill me?' he asked.  She replied, 'I am a       follower of him who said "Love you enemies." (265-66).  Jones wrestles through various stories, but the one above depicts his own position and that is that Christins are following the one that said for us to love our enemies.  We are called to this and Jones suggestion is that we embody forgiveness in life and in practice.  This is not a light read, but worth every bit of the struggle.  In a day when the so-called Church in America has voices that are crying for war and preemptive strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, we need to not only hear the words of Jesus, but build our houses once and for all on the rock, and put his words into practice 
 amazing. wcwis one of me favorites and all his  poetry from stated years are here. splendi 
  I LOVED THIS MOVIE. I SAW IT WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT AND IT WAS SUCH A GOOD FEELING MOVIE. I NEVER FORGOT IT AND I AM SO HAPPY THAT I NOW HAVE IT FOR MY OWN. 
 My first time into a Terry Blackstock book has me reading everything she has written.  She writes the kind of book you have to stay up and read because you can't put it down.  This series is terrific but maybe not quite as good as the series she writes with Mrs. Lahay.  What a great team they make. God is good and Terry leaves you happy that you know and are known by Him 
 If you have an interest in Marine training, especially this very challenging drill that young men in boot camp must master to graduate, then this is a very informative read for you. I have a son who is a Marine and I wanted to understand the 13 week process that they go through in their training.  By studying the training schedule and reading this book, I had more of an understanding of what he had gotten himself into.  This is an incredibly grueling 52 hour "march" and training regimen--this Crucible.  The author takes us through the very beginning of the march, what the recruits are thinking, feeling, their fatique, all the way to the long march back to bootcamp. We actually finally see a human side to the drill sargents, because they are participating in this as well.  I really liked the way that the author took the reader from station to station and explained how each challenge was named for a particular Marine who had given his life and the valor behind the story.  That is something you will not forget after reading this book.  Another point is that there is so little contemporary material available concerning Marine training for readers such as myself, and this is so fresh and fairly easy to understand.  
 Back when I was in high school David Bromberg was one of my musical heroes.  I first heard David's magical performance live under the stars of Central Park, NYC in August 1973.  I bought most of his albums and heard him perform live several times over the next few years.  I have drifted to other music but pulled out the old DB lp's every once in a while.  Now he's back, just him and his guitar giving the same kind of straight from the heart performances he did back in the day.  His wry irreverent humor may have mellowed a bit but is still present.  He still has his guitar chops, and though he may not be a great singer, he certainly is a great blues singer and great performer.  If you like acoustic country blues, don't miss this one, highly recommend.  David Bromberg is still one of my musical heroes 
 Though CSI:NY is most least favorite of the three CSIs, they still manage to make a good one sometimes.  This is one of those good ones 
 In my opinion this was a very intelectual book it takes a lot of time and understaning in this particular item. i have read a variety of hunting books, magizines,etc and this was by far the best hunting book ever published .I would definetly recommend this book to all of your custumers. The reason i have issued five stars is because this book has the all the new moderen styles of hunting 
 Another reviewer said this collection of stories changed their lives. It changed mine as well. It elevated my understanding of gothic literature and art and made me think critically about the popular manifestations of "goth" culture. And the most shocking tale, the one about "Countess Dracula", just happens to be true. But as Angela Carter's wonderful story "The Lady of the House of Love" shows, the gothic legacy has less to do with death and brooding and more to do with a totally different view on the world and living. 
 Doris Lessing has led such an interesting life, and writing a diary all the time. She writes of a time completely foreign to me, living a history of the changes in Southern Afica. I find her autobiography a great read, and prefer it to her novels. Interesting and moving, and explains much about her 
 i am hoping to do an intricate performance art piece based on the novel "the name of the rose;" however, many of the lush details and layers were lost on me, because i am not a historian or a scholar well-versed in semiotics... the task is still daunting, but i feel more confident having this "hint book" to fill me in on the background information.  it renders the novel much more accessible to a lay person, and makes the story even MORE fascinating than it already is.  i suggest that anyone reading "the name of the rose" should have a copy of this to help them along... also, there is a text that does this same task for dante's "divine comedy" (dante has a large influence on the novel, so reading dante will help the reader to understand the apocolyptic attitudes of the characters).  joseph gallagher wrote "a modern reader's guide to dante's 'the divine comedy'" which you may also find helpful 
 This book had me from the first line -- a perfect example of real life being more enthralling than fiction.  Two stories are told side by side, one about the fair itself and another detailing the crime spree of a serial killer who makes Jack the Ripper pale by comparison. The result is a book that is almost impossible to put down. It left me with an appreciation of the energy, talent and sheer will it takes to put on a world's fair and the genius of inventors like George Ferris.  
 the look is shiny and retro and it stands out in my friends' kitchen.  works well, the bagel and warming functions are much appreciated - 
 Primarily, it's a collection of Schwarcz's rather entertaining columns on chemistry.  Focusing mostly on food chemistry, Schwarcz presents bite-sized chapters of the perfect size for commuters.  He's a master at breaking down complicated chemistry into understandable pieces for those without a degree in chemical engineering.  (Those with such a degree will likely find the book to be child's play...)  Plus, he has an eye for history and the most important element in any good writing, human interest 
 This is the first "universal" case I've gotten, so I have no experience with any other cases. It works great for my needs. I was looking for something fairly compact that would help keep my mp3 player and accessories (Which include the headphones, docking cable, charger and armband) organized during trips. This does the job very well, although does not leave a whole lot of room for much else. The Koskin ("leather") look is part of the reason I bought the case. The spine and sides of the case seem to be made of a durable cardboard that give good structure to it. The sides do flex a little, so although this case will protect what is in it to a degree, it will not keep things from being crushed. I bought mine directly from the Case Logic website (Which seems to have stopped selling them for some reason). When it arrived, it was in great condition. I find it unfair to down grade this product due to Amazon's or others' storage practices, and find nothing wrong with the product itself. 
 Once again Jim Loewen applies his vast skills as a sociologist and historian to document the mostly silent history of "sundown towns" where people of color were either driven out or never allowed to become residents of many towns, most of which were located in the North.  Dr. Loewen's research is, as always, outstanding in its' accuracy and throughness, which is all the more difficult because this topic faces the problem of somewhat limited primary sources.  The author relies on the written record, newspaper accounts, oral histories, and census date to bring this issue to light.  For anyone who feels that racial segregation occured naturally or by individual choice in this country, this book is essential.  It is another important work by Jim Loewen along with his previous books.  
 Genre: Historical Fiction/War LION OF THE BALKANS AUTHOR: VLADIMIR CHERNOZEMSKY War stories are not usually my fist choice for fiction, but Vladimir Chernozemsky's newest novel, "Lion of the Balkans," is no ordinary war story.  It is a wonderful and exciting read, filled with action, intrigue and romance.  From beginning to end, it captured my attention, and left me wanting to read more by this prolific author. 	Using renditions of the events gathered from family members, diaries, and letters, Vladimir Chernozemsky vividly describes the conflict between Bulgaria and Turkey, and the devastation that results. He brings out the true horrors of war, seen through the eyes of those on all sides.  Giving this novel a unique quality is the fact that the politics, though certainly crucial to the plot and circumstances, become secondary to the complexity of human relationships, entwined during a time of such turmoil and contradiction. 	The very long list of characters at the front of the book, with unfamiliar names and complicated titles, may at first appear intimidating, but it is these characters that give the story its amazing richness.  From the moral struggle of childhood friends, one the son of a freedom fighting Bulgarian, the other the son of a Turkish officer, who both must choose between the bond of friendship and patriotic loyalty; to the greedy Tzar, so consumed by his own thirst for power and glory that he would rather have all his countryman slaughtered than to admit his mistakes.  Opposing him, a patriotic but humanitarian lieutenant colonel, who would risk his life for his country and the men under his command, to become a hero and martyr to the Bulgarian people and his faithful and kindhearted wife, whose work with the wounded men brings her the treasured friendship of the Tzar's beautiful mistress.  Add to this multiple romances, trysts, and betrayals, and you have an enthralling, realistic story, that comes highly recommended!  	Author, Vladimir Chernozemsky, was born in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. He came under intense political scrutiny while working as a documentary director in Sofia, after which he made a harrowing escape to the west. The author of 44 novels, plays and screenplays he has been hailed "an exceptional literary talent."

 If you enjoyed the movie - this is the second book from the series that started it all. Beware, you will get lost in the naming of the sails and the various terms. Its bad enough that they have a chart in the front of the book - which is useless, because the sailors have a nick name for every sail too!  I am almost finished with my third book. It is very interesting with regards to debtor prison, English laws and the funny games that went on in English society.  I would recommend that you read Master and Commander, first, and then Post Captain!  Cheers and good sailing

 Way back in the 80's I used to grab this book from our small, quaint library at Steeple Valley Middle School. I renewed the book frequently and would have a mild heart attack when it wasn't available in the library for me to check out.  Edward Emberley, among other artists, put me on the course to my semi-successful cartooning career. In hopes of passing on the cartooning torch, I'm purchasing these books for my two nieces so they can continue to create vast worlds and numerous creatures on a simple notebook 
 i only like half this cd, the views i like most the beats don't fit on half these songs, my favorites are still got love, and stereotype, kam's views are amazing, ice cube produced this he was improving on his producing skills, not as tight as lench mob 
 I like the fact that it included diff sized containers, and 2 of those were tumblers with handles to boot. I have read reviews where people have burned out their motors, and I will have to say that, yes, it's possible, but only if you didn't follow the directions. The manual indicated a recommended time of usage so you should be patient, expect to shake things up once in a while between blends, and this unit should last you at least a year :D I think some people have the wrong expectation that you can just turn on the switch and leave the unit alone to do it's thang. Gee, if that was the case, I'd let my car drive me on auto pilot. 
 This movie is a gem. IT goes away from the old cliche of "expert investigator with a novice investigator".Instead of it, both Gousset and Silverman has solid roles and the chemistry between them is amazing. Madsen plays a terrific bad guy, also withou customary cliches. All in all, it's a simple and atisfying movie that does not try to be more than it is 
 This was actually a really good book. I didn't expect too much of it when i bought it. But i really enjoyed reading it. It's short and sweet 
 This camera is basically the norm in disposable cameras, and it isn't too hard to see why. If you just want a cheap camera that works well and very reliably, this is the one for you. If only this camera could have zoom, but that is asking far, far too much from a disposable. Also, try smacking the bottom of this camera to set off the flash without taking a picture; just a useless tip 
 this is his best book.  I am a pro cook, and have met and talked to Martin on several occasions at professional conferences. He says this is his best cookbook. I have used it, as well as a couple of other of his cookbooks. I agree, it's his best.    Besides, who am I to argue with Martin 
 Although it has an unfortunate title (who the hell wants to write sitcoms? - aren't they supposed to be dead?), this book is one of the better resources on the subject of television writing in general.  It paints a very realistic picture of the business and acknowledges some of the changes that are taking place within the industry.  This is a good book for someone who already knows how to write a solid script, but who'd like to learn more about the TV biz 
 This music has a lot of historical depth, reflecting Roy Haynes' long  career and multiple associations.  There are songs dedicated to (or written  by) Sarah Vaughn, Chick Corea, Thelonius Monk... The drums are front and  center:  I love Haynes' popping snare drum sound and his unusual rhythmic  conceptions.  Perhaps if I weren't a drummer I would have given the album 4  stars instead of 5, but as it is I have to give it its due 
 My 2 1/2 year old loves this book!  We have taken it out of the library so many times, I have finally decided it is time to own it!  I think she identifies with the sweet kittens who get into trouble but then make amends  and get to eat the pie after all.  Both toddlers and preschoolers will love  this beautifully illustrated book

 This conditioner rinses well and does not weigh down your hair.  The herbal scent is an added bonus for when you are trying to relax in the shower 
 I liked the first couple songs that Rodney Atkins released, but the song that really got my attention was "Watching You." I love that song! I bought the CD for that song, if nothing else, but I was in for a real treat. There were many other awesome songs on there, including my other favorite- a very classic country song- called "A Man on a Tractor",and    the first single off the CD (the title track) called "If You're Going Through Hell." On Rodney's second CD, you can also find songs about where he grew up (Tennessee to be exact, as he mentions in "In the Middle" and is evident in "What I Love About the South" and "These Are My People"). Although he sings those incredibly well, he has a talent for singing slower-paced songs too, such as "Angel's Hands" and "Invisibly Shaken."  Overall it is a wonderful CD from who I would predict to be one of the next big acts in country music. 
 I've been issued two patents using Pressman's book.  The patent office issued an office action on the first patent and I used an attorney to overcome the action.  The second patent was issued on my first submission.   I am in the middle of prototyping a new product and cannot find my old copy of Patent It Yourself.  My original copy was the 3rd or 4th addition so I will update to this newest edition. If you are a technically inclined writer and use Pressman's step by step process doing it yourself is fairly easy.  But remember, getting a patent is easy, getting your product to market is the hard part. 
 This is one of the most impressive books on entrepeneurship and business that I have read. As we grow older, we focus more and more on the immediate. We often lose touch with our larger goals - goals that may have lead us to our chosen profession and path in the first place. For most of us, we may not even sense the inner void and lack of direction that this creates. Randy's book is a timely reminder of the importance of higher level goals. It tells us we can work for what we care AND be successful. Highly recommended 
 I have never written a review before but always read them before I buy a product.   I started reading this book during spare moments at work and by the end of my shift I had to race home to finish it!  Which I am glad because as a typical Sparks novel, it's a tear-jerker.  Yes the story is a little predictable but what story isn't?  If you love sappy stories you won't be disappointed.  
  it's hard to talk about ted dekker books without giving things away. this is the final book in the circle triology (start with "black") following a character flipping between two realities when he sleeps. this final book continues to thrill to the last page..seriously. it's a consistent series with each book being equally thrilling. if you can handle ted dekker's style (usually involving detailed violence, and someone with mental problems) you'll find the series to be among the best books written in awhile. i find myself awake many late nights unable to put his books down. this final book i read in one day burning through the pages. so if you don't want to lose sleep or challenge the fluff you're used to, don't read ted dekker 
   Contrary to the other reviews that found Kasparov's writing "vindictive" towards Fischer, I thought it was very even-handed. Those critics seem to want the same blind hero-worship of Fischer that has come before.    I am a great fan of Fischer's. I come from his home borough. I know people who knew him, being only a few years younger. So any criticsms in this book kind of sting me. But they are true.  Let's face it. He didn't play Karpov because he was afraid to lose. Kasparov states it bluntly (as is his style), and it's about time somebody did. The fact is, Fischer would have crushed Karpov had he been active in 1972-1974, but, as Kasparov implies, one can't sit out for three years and expect to retain the championship.    In fact, I found Kasparov overly generous in his book, especially considering the blistering and outrage insults Fischer has thrown at him. I thought this was very classy. To be truthful, I didn't expect Kasparov to show such restraint, but he did. Again, I think the book is very fair towards Fischer.    Chesswise, I think Kasparov has given Fischer his positive due throughout a large part of this book, acknowledging Fischer as a true pioneer of chess in the 60's. It's only fair to write the bad with the good.    As far as the analysis, I am only a 2000 player, I don't delve deeply into the extreme accuracy, nor do I apply the computer to such analysis. I'll just say that the book is certainly good enough to me to learn from.    Oh, I left out how extremely entertaining this book is. Any chess fan above, say, 1500 rating, should enjoy it.    
    Cat's Claw is the 4th book in the 24: Declassified series and is starting to close in on season 1 in the 24 timeline.  The story starts with Jack and his now-teenage daughter, Kim, at a protest of the G8 summit being held in LA.  Christopher Henderson, notorious villain of season 5, is one of the main CTU personnel in this story, and still Jack's friend.  So, it's pretty cool to see their working relation in a time before Henderson's turn to the dark side.  The story shows plenty of foreshadowing in good subtle ways.  We see more of Jack and Teri's marriage troubles and the fleshing out of Jack's personal troubles.  There are some great Jack Bauer moments in the story, and there are some great plot twists, too.  24 fans should enjoy the new prequel story.  I still can't wait for the rest of the series to be released.  Jack Bauer still rules 
 I just wanted to say, I'm sorry to those who gave this book a low rating.  you really have missed out on some amazing things God can tell you through this book.  I have read this book and it changed my life - reminded me of the real order of things and led me to a deeper listening for God's voice.  The more you listen the more you will recognize and hear it. I also have 2 other friends who's lives changed after reading this book as well.  I'm talking major changes 
 Bello did an amazing job with her book. I support and respect everything she sponsors and represents in the marijuana community 
 Being a joint owner of a steel spray for 10 years, I was delighted to read Bruce's new book. It is full of photos and information, and I recommend this book to anybody, owning, buying or contemplating building their own steel boa 
 There's something heartbreaking about listening to people with no sense of humor explain, with resolute logic, why something isn't funny.  Unless you're unapologetically homophobic, in which case you don't deserve to have fun, there's just no reason why you wouldn't be delighted by this minor masterpiece.  Forget the movie, all you need is the premise to start laughing.  In Australia, widely known as the most macho place on earth, three drag queens go on an epic journey inland in an ancient bus named Priscilla which routinely breaks down at the most inconvenient times.  While lip-synching Abba tunes blaring from a boom box hardly strikes me as art; the combination of costumes, wigs, make-up, attitude, and dancing required to create a drag show for a group of aborigines is impressive at the very least, if not heroic.    It seems to me that Mrs. Doubtfire, and Tootsie for that matter, projected a level of awareness scrubbed so clean it would have been at home on Love American Style.  Priscilla, by contrast, strikes the perfect balance.  It is madly over the top and hilarious, reveling in the sheer absurdity and outrageousness of it all.  But it is also warm, never patronizing, the more the characters get to know each other the more you get to know them and like them in the process.    There are difficult choices at the end of the movie, and loss.  By then you really do care.  All three leads are terrific, but Terrence Stamp is the standout here.  With invisible craft he delivers the bravest performance of his career, it has real nuance, not easy to pull off when you look like Cher.  Certainly the kind of film one would qualify as a "cult classic," and well worth owning.  Just the thing to take off the shelf when you're starting to take yourself too seriously.  Y-Abba-D-Abba-Do 
 I have had many textbooks over the years and this is one of the best I have had.  Some textbooks I have not even bothered to read but this one clearly explained the concepts it presented and was a great addition to my instructor's lectures.  It gave a lot of real life examples in order to show applicablility and I actually didn't mind reading the chapters.  The key learning objectives were really good as well as the questions at the end in order to meet educational needs.  The online tools available with this book were also essential to passing exams with good grades.  It was worth having to buy for my class 
 William Whyte, who was an editor at Fortune magazine, argues in this 1956 bestseller that some people not only worked for an organization, but sold their psyches to them as well.  These "organization men" willingly subordinated their personal goals and desires to conform to the demands of corporations and other organizations. This is different than modern-day workaholism -- the  "organization men" of the 1950's hoped to gain loyalty, security and "belongingness" in exchange. In their view, the organization is a friend, not a foe; it's should be co-operated with, not questioned.  Whyte argues that the ideology behind the organization man is a "social ethic." Its core beliefs are that the group is superior to the individual, and individuals lack meaning and purpose outside of that group. "Belongingness" is assumed to be the ultimate emotional need of the individual, and to achieve it society should not hesitate to use a bit of social engineering. The result, however, is an ethos of over-conformity at any price.   As Whyte looked around the world in the mid-1950's, he saw the ethos of the Organization Man  everywhere. He saw it in college graduates who joined big corporations, pledging their loyalty with visions of a safe stable life in exchange. He saw it in corporate executives who willingly pulled up their roots every time the company wanted to transfer him.  He saw it when educators were asked to teach kids social skills so they could get along, rather than teaching academic subjects that forced kids to think for themselves.  He saw it in engineering companies that said  that there are "no geniuses here; just a bunch of average Americans working together" (although studies show that innovative engineers and scientists are fiercely independent, thus the direct antithesis of the company-oriented man).    So what to do? Whyte says we must realize that although we need the organization, we must know when and how to resist it. We must tread the fine line between self-interested cooperation and psychological surrender. We must realize that although the group can be a friend, it can also be a tyrant.     Even though this book was written about 50 years ago, many of Whyte's messages still ring true today. Yes, times have changed, and worker loyalty to corporations is passe'.  Yet this book is worth reading, if only for its historical perspective on the mood in the 1950's.  Also, it's well written - after all, Whyte was an editor at Fortune.  Recommended.   
        Ginger Jolie, jessie capelli, Jamie lynn and "Pet Of         The Year" Martina Warren look amazing in what can        only be described as one of the most sensual and        seductive "Softcore" DVD's available.        Direced by Bert Rhine, and Filmed by Lester Wisbrod        (makers of the classic "CITY GIRLS" series in the 1990's)        Set in very high class surroundings, this is high gloss         entertainment at it's best.         Each girl does a solo striptease, plus there's two         girl/girl vignettes. Ginger Jolie and Jamie Lynn         (wearing some very hot lingerie and stockings), plus         Jessie Capelli and Ginger Jolie in a sizzling stairs         scene that gives some of the best rear veiws of these         two girls that you could ever imagine.             With flawless picture quality, excellent close up shots        and four incredibly hot models, it surely rates as one        of the best "PET OF THE YEAR" shows to date.         Very highly recommended 
 This case is really good, it fits my 1034D Brothe serger very nicely. The only thing I wish it has, is a compartment below the sewing machine, like with a little trap door or something. but other than that, its great, and it does its job wel 
 If you're one of King's constant readers you will agree that The Talisman was all King.  Black House seems all Straub.    The narratvie reads like a screenplay, which at times is drudging.      You look and look and sometimes you find King, buried in a sentence here and there ... here and now.  But (and here I'll use Black House style of narrative) as we float over Straub's neighborhood, and as we float over the Safeway, which  seems to have a sale on toilet paper, we reach Mr. Straub's home.  He is scratching his head with one hand while the other tentative hand is resting on the keyboard of his computer.  He's stuck.  He can't seem to come up with the next sentence.  Then he 'flips' and there is King, next to him, and he whispers into Straub's ear, and Straub has the next sentence.  So as we read Black House we know it's Straub, but the haunt of King is evident throughout the novel.  It's Straub's writing style, but it's King's imagination.  Oh, and the DT tie-in's are executed masterfully 
 The ideas presented by Professor Sen is beyond any research already made in the area of development. It's not only about economic development, but it's a new and wider approach to the concepts, theories and values that other scholars had made only superficially. Mr. Sen's development is beyond the general and simplified thought related to a so strict concept like economic and/or social development

 Okay you guys have amazing, cool, and sweet videos on Amazon. My favorite though is Avatar and I have bought every single episode you have so far. Your episode downloads are magnificent to see on my creative zen vision: M. I had a quick tip though: Can you get more Avatar the Last Airbender Digital downloads. Please! 
 A slender 65-page compendium of pioneer era recipes, Log Cabin Cooking by Barbara Swell also offers tips on hearth cooking, food insults, pioneer dining etiquette, kitchen provers, cake superstitions, jump rope rhymes, and "Biscuit Sayings". Readers will learn how to make a "squashaphone" and "Make-Do Cooking". Enhanced with period photography, the recipes in this little gem of a cookbook range from Sour Dough Bread, to Dandelion Salad, to Poor Man's Pudding, to Dried Sweet Apple Schnitz. Also very highly recommended are two other old-time cookbooks by Barbara Swell: Take Two & Butter 'em While They're Hot!: Heirloom Recipes & Kitchen Wisdom (1883206324, $5.95) and Secrets Of The Great Old-timey Cookbooks: Historic Recipes, Lore & Wisdom (1883206375, $5.95). 
 I just purchased my first house. I wanted a good book to learn how to take care of it.  This book is so easy to follow and gives so much information.  It is an excellent starter for people like me 
 So far so good.  Skates and pads appear sturdy.  My 3.5 year old fits them but they are fully extended.  She didn't take the skates off for 2 days :)  I'd recommend these, but not sure about the sizing as my little girl is small for her age 
 Firstly, this isn't a book that should be relied upon. It's not a reference book in the vein of a dictionary. It's more like something that should be read and considered, but never as a definitive source. How can I explain the best way to use this book and why I give it a 4?  If you're a writer of fiction, then you know that creating believable characters is essential to crafting a decent character-driven story. Knowing what motivates a character is something a writer must know in order to proceed that character along during the story, and not knowing could be tragic to the flow of the plot. In other words, poorly thought character motivations could interrupt a good story. However, having characters so typical and predictable, not matter how convincing, can also be damaging. The problem with this book is that it offers typical solutions to creating characters. That's why this book shouldn't be used as a primary source.  But, and this is huge, I love this book for creating secondary characters. You know, those characters brought in to advance the plot along. Giving life to such simple characters is hard, and a typical character-type is still better than having no type for characters that will fill possibly a page or two of written material. Quick bad guys, chance sexual encounters, neighborhood children, whatever you need, can be found within these pages and I think it helps to add a little extra depth to stories.  Though the gold in this book could be found in one section--"Adult Styles," which explains the character types of males and females and common traits they have--there is still a lot of other useful information dealing mostly with psychological problems and developments. These sections--"Psychological Disorders," "Criminal Styles," "Sexual Styles--are great for creating motivation for characters, whether they be main protagonists or bit-characters. Another good section, though, is the "Nonverbal and Verbal Communication," which helps a writer to show rather than tell what type of person your character is by showing body actions or facial expressions, as well as other human mannerisms and idiosyncrasies that could reveal a character type.  Though, as I said, this isn't an essential writing reference, it still has loads of information that could help in breathing life into your characters. I'd definitely recommend creating your own main characters, but some of the suggestions or character types found here could help in crafting those believable people needed for your stories. If you want to add some depth to your stories, then this is a good, informative book for you 
 I remember some years ago spending hours looking through Herb Ritts:Work in a bookstore, wisjing I could afford it. I still can't afford that book, but decided to buy this book instead. I am very glad I did. This is a beautiful book, with every picture presented in rich black/white. I also found the interview with Herb Ritts fascinating, as I can't remember having read an interview with him before. As for the images; They are simply perfect. Favourites images: Bruce Springsteen, and Anjelica Housto 
 This is one of my favorite books and my appreciation of it was only enhanced when they made a movie of it.  Patricia Highsmith has a dark sense of humor about her villains.  She also makes you put yourself in Ripley's place and though he is somewhat of a psychopath, you can see how one thing leads to another as he gets deeper and deeper into trouble and mayhem.  The book group I lead at our local library will be reading this book this year and I am expecting them to have mixed reviews of it.  Not everyone wants to suspend moral judgment for such characters and not everyone enjoys being manipulated into sympathizing with a killer.  This is the first of a series of "Ripley books."  I've read them all and would recommend them highly 
 This projector works as advertised.  The incorporated DVD player and sound system make it easy to watch widescreen movies without running cables all over the place, and it comes with a cloth carrying case so you can take it to a friend's.  Ours sits on the floor under the coffee table about 80" from the screen.  The machine is designed to project up about 13 degrees above horizontal, so it makes a widescreen picture about 70" wide with the lower edge about 4 feet off the floor.  We use a 6-foot wide screen we bought at a commercial photo shop for $150.  Our eye-to-screen distance is about 11 feet.  I think 13' would be ideal.  The picture quality, both color and focus, is excellent, limited only by the inherent resolution of DVDs.  You do need a dark room, so unless you have heavy curtains, daytime viewing is poor.  The sound depends somewhat on the quality of the DVD soundtrack.  A few are only marginally loud enough even with the volume set at maximum.  Others give beautiful sound that has the lively action similar to a 5-speaker system.  The sound of the projector cooling fan is audible in quiet moments, but you tend to tune it out pretty quickly.  The instruction booklet covers the basics but is a little skimpy when it comes to hooking up to external sources or sound systems.  The remote unit works by reflecting off the screen to a receiver on the front of the unit.  Two annoying behaviors are 1) if you use the "Format" button (to shift from 16:9 to 4:3 for instance), the on-screen menu continues to show for a minute or longer, right in the middle of the picture, with no way to cancel it until it finally times out on its own.  (You can't always tell before you start viewing a DVD whether it's widescreen or not, so there you are with the movie running and the stupid menu planted in the middle of your picture even after you've fixed the format.)  And 2), whenever you change the volume, the on-screen volume level display shows up.  It can be distracting in a dramatic quiet scene.  There should be a way to disable the level display.  Who needs to "see" the volume level?  Overall, we're very pleased with the projector.  For a small group in not too big a room, it works quite well -- and our relatives are envious.  For viewing by more than a few people I think you'd want to add an external sound system 
 Arthur C. Clarke's "Childhood's End" is a chilling science-fiction book that at first seemed quite ordinary. When I first started reading it, the boring cover made me think that it would not be very interesting, but as I started to read, I was really drawn into the plot. I enjoyed reading "Childhood's End" very much. The book is very well written, and has an interesting and original plot. It talks about mysterious aliens, the 'Overlords', who land on Earth and bring lots of peace, prosperity, and joy with them and their changes. However, the Overlords have a dark purpose, and life on Earth is about to change once again. I thought the book was exciting. It used lots of clear words to draw interest and the plot is fast-paced and exciting. Although the plot may seem very unbelievable, the way the book is written makes you believe it is really happening - and there is a chill of prophecy to it. It leaves you wondering - what if this happened to us today? The descriptions are very clear and creative, so I could really picture the Overlords and the events that happened in the book in my head. The huge twist, where they revealed that the Overlords were not as nice as they seemed to be, really surprised me but made the rest of the book much more exciting. I highly recommend this book to others, especially those who are big fans of science fiction and have read other books by Arthur C. Clarke. It is definitely a book worth reading 
 Being left handed and having been forced to write with my right hand since a child, I can sympathize with the author's experience as a left hander. His one year quest to learn more about this subject is very illuminating. I agree with many of the assertions and conclusions. For example, I was a fencer in College Varsity and I definitely agree with the fact that there is a distinct advantage in some sports for a left hander. I always thought the condition is based on genetics but I learned that it was not as simple as first appears. I recommend this book for all people to learn more about the complexity of life and to accept and celebrate our differences. 
 A ship that was supposed to transport some crates from South America to a museum seems to have a crew that lost their heads. The crates finally get flown in. One full of goodies the other just leaves. The museum's Dr. Margo Green (Penelope Ann Miller) is suspicious. Everyone else is happy until a guard seems to have misplaced his hypothalamus. Looks like Dr. Margo Green is about to be consumed by her work.  This is a pretty spiffy well done formula movie. As with many contemporary movies they completely ignore the book and add all the standard clichés. We have the ruthless rivalry, missing scientists, and mysterious crates.  Naturally no one does what they are supposed to do and you start rooting for the, lets just call it a, relic.   
 "Heretics of Dune" is the fifth novel in the "Dune Chronicles" over continuing thousand years after the previous book.  The detailed writing style is superb with a fine mixture of politics, warfare, and individual introspection.  The drastic planetary changes found in the prior novel have returned mostly to the original conditions.  The influence of the Golden Path by Leto II relentlessly affects the universe.  The installment contains many engaging characters (largely Atreides descendents), beginning with a new ghola Duncan Idaho.  Improving on the previous Duncan models has continued with some amazing results near the story's end.  Sheeana of Rakis displays fascinating powers over Shaitan in the desert.  The best addition to characters vaguely similar from previous books is the Mentat Bashar Miles Teg.  This brilliant military mind interacts well with Duncan and manages the Bene Gesserit calmly after returning from retirement.  Not as much prescience as seen in the past, which I found relieving.   As with the planet formerly known as Arrakis, the series has evolved.  Spice addiction has fallen into the background, although the sandworm is not as common as millennium past.  Brief sexual content finds its way into the chronicles for the first time, I didn't care for specifically but is crucial motivation behind certain events.  No appendixes conclude the novel but still a glossary would have sufficed.  A detailed map of the significant terrains, especially with the climate transformation of Arrakis, would have been useful.  I highly recommend the series to any fan of the science fiction genre.  Thank you 
 Since I was about 6 years old, I've had all the music memorized from the broadway musical 'Phantom of the Opera', and maybe a year or two later I saw the silent version of the film... terrifying! I think that the phantom from the silent film lived under my bed for several years.... he still might, and maybe a year or two after that I saw the version with Nelson Eddy in it.But when I finally got around to reading this book just this year, I was astounded! I didn't expect for it to be such a good read... it was a page-turner, and I already knew the outcome! As I turned every page, I kept saying to myself: why haven't I ever read this before? I was so pleasantly surprised by this book. So this is why they call it a classic.. 
 Crude language, Wild philosophy taken to an extreme.  The attitudes and language are what makes this movie rated R.  Even though it may seem like all fun and games, and you may not want to say otherwise, you know it's more than that.  Looking at the title, it sounds like it could be another comedic happy go lucky film.  Right about the comedic part, but so wrong on everything else.  There are hearts broken in ways you wouldn't have imagined, two Huckabee models and "everything else Huckabees."  Jason Schartzman plays the main character, and I found out that he's the drummer in Phantom Planet, a great pop band!  (I hear he's arrogant though, and this fact only would enhance it.)  Dustin Hoffman and Jude Law are in it.  Mark Wahlberg is truly convincing in this one.  If you like South Park, Daria, or any kind of toilet humor, this movie may just be for you 
 I wasn't a big reader until recently after finishing my Master's degree and not having anything to do with all my free time. I heard about A Child Called It from a friend and read it in 24 hours. It was a horrifying tale and I can't even begin to imagine what it would be like to go through that kind of abuse and neglect as a child. Within the hour of finishing that book, I drove to the closest bookstore to pick up The Lost Boy, but I couldn't find it!!! I ordered it from Amazon and the wait was somewhat painful. I just had to know what happened next and I couldn't stop thinking about little David Pelzer until my book finally arrived!  I was so happy that David had been rescued in the first book and that he was fortunate enough to find a few foster parents that showed him the love that he missed out on as a child. The book describes an incredibe adventure and vividly tells of a continued struggle that no one should have to go through.   I would recommend this whole series to anyone! I almost didn't read the 3rd one, because I was pretty satisfied that David Pelzer was okay after the second book... but Pelzer had sucked me in with his incredible life story and I just had to know how everything turned out. I honestly recommend all three books to anyone and everyone.   It truly broke my heart to read these books, but I feel like a better (more enlightened) person for knowing about David Pelzer and his tragic childhood which turned into an incredible, amazing life. I'm sure you will too 
 When I ordered the item I wasn't given any expected date of arrival or any option on shipping speed.  I had 10 days to get the item before the event - and it arrived well after date needed.  I realize this is an outside vendor, but usually Amazon items come quite quickly. Thanks, Debbi 
    Clearly a book for all package designers' bookshelves and as it is rather nicely designed and printed the rest of us could well keep it somewhere. The foibles of the English language make an obvious trap for the unwary foreign brand-manager, why is a French butter called Noisy or a Dutch beer called Slag? Of course many of these products just use the language of the country (like a Polish sugar called Wars) that is spelt the same but has an entirely different meaning in English.  The book does look rather good though. The 113 packages are displayed mostly one to a page (with perhaps just a bit too much white space surrounding them) the page numbers are created from those little sticker price tags and the index is a handsome spread with a small square photo section of each package. If I have a criticism it is that turning the tiny type captions sideways in the top left corner of each spread makes them awkwardly unreadable.   So, a fun title for creative professionals who can ponder on why a Ugandan body spray (page 129) is called Prison.  ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.   
 This is the best book on integrating psychology and spirituality that I've read, written in both a clear and heartfelt way.I'm truly moved by the great depths that the author has touched. His ways of discussing how healing happens and the warmth and brilliance and range of his insight are quite inspiring. His way of discussing the ground of being is the clearest I've read, and he writes of it in many different ways that will reach a wider range of people, both in the healing professions and in ordinary life. I felt that everything he discussed came from his own realization. He shows how spiritual work helps us discover how "the ground of our being actually holds us up" and how the essence of healing lies in learning how to let be. Can someone heal who doesn't learn that whatever emotional states they have can be held openly and unconditionally in awareness? This book shows how in both psychotherapy and spiritual work, it is being awake with thoughts, feelings, and sensations, without separation and distance, that heals. Then the mind can "self-liberate" when we stay open right in the middle of what's coming up.In Welwood's words,"unconditional presence is the most powerful transmuting force there is, because it is a willingness to be there with our experience." Each one of the therapy examples in the book moved me and focused on the larger field of how we are with our experience.This book will undoubtedly by a guide for brand new ways of practicing therapy. Let me share one of my favorite quotes (among so many). Welwood describes a client whose fear of nothingness was a symptom of being cut off from herself. As she began to open unconditionally to "being nothing," her inner division fell away "as she stepped out of the fixed stances/attitudes/associations she held toward 'being nothing' with their long history dating back to childhood. In becoming present in a place where she had been absent, she experienced her being, rather than her nothingness. 'Being nothing' transmuted into the empty fullness of being--where the fear of being nothing no longer had a hold on her."  For me, this is the crux of healing and the author describes it so wisely and compassionately that it has opened up many new vistas for me 
 There is probably little to say about this book that will be useful to the reader of this review.  If you are considering reading Book 5 of the Wheel of Time saga, you probably have read the first four.  In that case, I can assure you that this book is more of the same - well written, engaging, and deep.  There are some specific details that might interest a reader of the series, which I'll include here.  The plot: of the "Original 7" that set off from the Two Rivers in Book #1, only 6 are included in this book.  Although Perrin is probably my favourite character, his absence from this story is welcome because it also means the most annoying character (Faile) is also absent.  Of the other 6, five are clustered around Rand, as he brings the Aiel (the desert-warrior race) across the mountains to invade the kingdom of Carhein and add it to the countries that have pledged allegiance to his cause.  Along the way he battles Forsaken, his own demons, and the mechanations of his so-called allies.  Meanwhile, Nynaeve and her group learn of the coup in Tar Valon and attempt to locate and join with the rebel Aes Sedai.  Jordan is clearly becoming a better writer (or he had a better editor?) with this book.  Much of the annoying repitition of previous books has been eliminated, so we only have Nynaeve blaming Rand (or Lan) for everything 10 times instead of 100 times.  Similarly, the story is more "plausible" because it doesn't rely on a series of cooincidences to get everyone back together at the end - the Original 7 are in 3 groups at the beginning, and are still in 3 groups at the end.    Finally, there has been little suspense in previous books because the Original 7 (and the other main characters) have never been in danger of dying.  As a contrast, I point to Tolkien, who killed Boromir about 1/3 of the way through, which made the rest of the books more suspenseful because you never knew who might be next.  Well, Jordan has finally killed someone of importance (I will not say who, obviously) in this book, although the manner of the character's death leaves open the possibility of a return (sort of like Gandalf's "death" in LotR).  Even with the possibility, it should make subsequent books more interesting since Jordan has finally given us a shocking development to nudge us from our complacency with the series.  To sum up: Jordan fans are likely to be pleased with this effort.  I found the writing to be better than in the previous books of the series, and the annoying characters are written in a way that makes the characters annoying without annoying the reader when reading about them. 
 This book is very informative and draws on the work of many of the most well-known and learned persons in this field.  As a graduate student writing a dissertation on child abuse and its effects on adult survivors this book has proven to be a rich source of information, data, resources, and references.  
 The same brackets from the Bose store(6 for $188.00) but for way to much less and fast delivery.  Thank you 
 I read this book for a history of child welfare class and found it impossible to put down. Humes clearly illustrates the problems with the U.S. Juvenile Justice system in Los Angeles. He follows several teen-agers through their trials, mis-trials, time in the California Youth Authority, and rehabilitation. Even though these children are often convicted, you have a chance to see that they really are just children. This book inspired me to pursue a career in juvenile justice 
 I've wanted to take up yoga for a couple of years now, and this was the book that finally helped me to get started.  It is very comprehensive in its exposition of the fundamentals of yoga, and the numerous illistrations  really help you feel sure that what you're doing is right, which could be a  concern if you are practicing by yourself.    However, I would have liked  to see a longer section on yoga diet.     Nevertheless, I recommend the  book to anybody that is even remotely interested in yoga.  The pieces of  yoga history, proverbs, and inspirational thought will give you insight  into that teaching, which has survived ancient times and has reached our  modernity as relevant as ever.     And even as you become more  knowledgeable and proficient in yoga, and buy other readings, this one is  bound to remain a good companion of yours for years 
 To: Rat After spending my entire adult life as a working single mother, I find your whining about mothers as "the most priveleged class" uninformed, if not downright ludicrous.  You feel you have to do all of their work for them while they lazily sit around the house?  I have never personally spent "years on leave".  Although, I have covered countless shifts for my hungover or broken-hearted, childless co-workers, and have only stayed home with a sick child about 5 times in 13 years.  I have taken on more [...], covered more [...] and put up with more bull than I deserved, because as the sole support of my child, I couldn't risk losing my job.  I have been an employer's bargain!  Furthermore, Rat -- you clearly do not understand the concept of flex time.  Flex time doesn't mean somebody works less hours than you.  Flex time means there is an inherent flexibility built into EVERYONE'S work schedule, so that work gets done, but life can happen to.  You are probably familiar with this concept in reality -- have you ever skipped lunch so you could leave early to go to the dentist?  In the future, please try to wrap your brain around the bigger picture before you jump to such conclusions 
 This product is amazing. I know a few people with little ones that use these and they LOVE them!! Super easy to clean and use. When ordering these, I was under the impression that there were 2 per package...FYI-they're not!! Only one per... 
 Peter O'Brien's outstanding commentary on Ephesians completes his trilogy on the Prison Epistles (see his commentary on Philippians in the NIGTC and Colossians-Philemon in the Word series) and, in my judgment, ranks as first among commentaries on Ephesians. Writing from a solid Evangelical stance, O'Brien defends Pauline authorship and wrestles honestly with Paul's majestic, but often complex, letter. While Harold Hoehner's commentary is broader in its coverage, O'Brien brings an amazing depth of insight to the table, and interprets Paul with skill and clarity. I especially appreciated O'Brien's keen eye for biblical-theological connections, which helped draw out many of the Old Testament references which lie behind Paul's letter. O'Brien is excellent with the Greek (though all Greek words are transliterated in the actual text of the book - actual Greek words are in the notes) and almost always has good reasons for his positions. Also, unlike Hoehner, O'Brien doesn't seem tied to a theological system (like Hoehner's dispensationalism, which occasionally slips in) and lets the text say what it says. I've read most of this book as I've preached expositionally through Ephesians over the course of nearly two years, and it is the main commentary I would recommend to others. Hoehner is a close second. The two commentaries together will serve an expositor well. But if you can only get one technical commentary on Ephesians, get O'Brien. 
 I have been a fan of Leon Russell since he had a band in high school - I had the records but needed the CD 
 I read "The Surgeon" then "The Apprentice", then "Body Double" and now "The Sinner" and I am so hooked! All were the kind of books that made me want to take the phone off the hook, not answer the door, call in sick to work and just be left alone to read my book! I cannot wait for the next edition! Her earlier books were too girly for me, but no more!! 
 My wife and I receieved this book as a gift when we announced her pregnancy.  It is by far our favorite pregnancy book.  The week-by-week format is perfect for following along with your progress and also makes it nice to read together.  There are even helpful hints for dads along the way.  My wife found that the book answered her questions and concerns as they arose.  Should I be feeling the baby move?  When does morning sickness start?  Is my weight gain normal?  The timing of when this book discusses what is happening to a pregnant woman is good.  What we like best about this book is that the information is up-to-date and, unlike MANY of the pregnancy books out there, it isn't just filled with negativity.  Yes, there are a lot of things that can go wrong and there are things you need to know.  But, this book presents that information in a positive manner and doesn't go overboard.  There is much about pregnancy that is positive and this book celebrates that and is reassuring.  But, it isn't purely platitudes.  It also gives you information to help you when you prepare to see the doctor.  That balance, we have found, is very rare in pregnancy books 
 This is an excellent video for a new puppy owner!  Even though I've had dogs all my life, it's been a long time since I had a puppy and wanted to make sure I did it right.    The video is like taking a "puppy kindergarten" training course, but without the other puppies.  You will learn a lot from watching, and re-watching, the positive training methods used.  It is especially helpful to see how the owners each overcome unique difficulties with their dogs (a slow malamute, a shy Westie, a hyper Golden, etc.)    The only downside to the video is that it is designed for puppies under the age of 18 weeks-- once they hit adolescence, while you can still use positive training methods, you will probably also need some corrections 
 I got this book from the library when my daughter was 22 months old. She loved it immediately and asked me to read it 5 times in a row! We have other Dr. Seuss books but somehow she likes this one most. Now she is 23 months old and she "reads" this book by herself. Great book and I recommend it for children under 2 
 The Black Jacobins is a timeless classic in both the  history and practice of liberation theory.I enjoyed the distinct pleasure  of taking undergraduate work with CLR James in the early eighties. His undimmed  passion and clarity shaped me deeply. He was quite arguably the greatest  unabashed dialectical materialist of the Harlem Renaissance. I heartily  recommend that you treat yourself to this,his signature creation 
 This compact, economical book (at least for bioinformatics) covers the usual basics of bioinformatics (Databases, alignments, phylogeny, gene prediction, structure prediction, transcriptome analysis, proteome analysis) but is unique in its approach.  Recognizing most life scientists need to understand basic bioinformatis, but lack extensive mathematical modeling, computer command line or programming experience Jin Xiong has written a text that describes common bioinformatics tools to perform each of the above studies. Using diagrams and figures in lieu of complex mathematical formulas, Xiong explains how the tools work.  Each task in bioinformatics has many comoputing tools - the strengths and weaknesses of each, and guidance in critical evaluation of the output are explained.  There are capstone problems at the end of the book that are extremely helpful in enhancing understanding of the tools. The text is easy to read.   In the preface. Xiong describes that the book is a compilation of notes from several years of teaching bioinformatics. Therefore they presumably have been revised based on student review.  However, this is a first edition -  there are a lot of typos, misspellings, and some figures have errors.  Hopefully these will be fixed for this is a fine introductory book.   The text is for those new to bioinformatics. Unlike many bioinformatics books, there is no coverage of programming (PERL or SQL for ex,).  Therefore, those who are already skilled in this area will likely not find this particularly useful.  Familiarity with the UNIX operating system will help readers do the problems.   
 Like every other edition of Greene's Protective Groups, this updated version is concise with reliable references and schematics.  All researchers need this book 
 I have been extremely inpressed with In Style's large print, large volume, hard back books and this one does not disappoint.  I personally am not someone who wears a lot of makeup or spends a lot of time taking care of my looks but generally that is because I am of unsure of how to begin. I now have great notes to take with me when I go to the store the next time.  I was also pleased that the book did not simply serve as advertisements for overpriced prodcuts. They did mention exclusive salon type items but I also found that Clnque Turn Around Cream and Fructis Conditioner (which I already use) are perfect for me.   This is a great resource for such a wide variety of people but I think it would be a terrific gift for a young lady. I would have loved to have had more details then just how to apply blush when developing a daily "beauty" regiment. I think the sections on skin care would be essential for young teenagers who really need to take care of themselves for life.  I highly suggest this item as a great reference too for any woman.  
 I love cardio kickboxing, so of course I had to try my favorite workout guru, Jillian Michaels', new cardio kickbox DVD!  I went through it once and was sweating, so I decided that 30 minutes just wasn't enough for me and went through it again!  I had to get a towel, I was that sweaty!  A great, easy to follow cardio workout that can easily be done without any extra workout tools...no weights, steps, resistance bands required...just your body and your energy!  Jillian suggests doing this workout once per week in the middle of the week to break up resistance training, however I think it's a great before-work...don't have time to go to the gym workout to get motivated for the day.  I agree with some of the other reviewers...the music could be much better and the workout could be much longer!  The downloadable exercise logs are a great bonus.  However, the 3 recipes are a little lacking 
 I saw this once on AMC when one of the Batman movies was playing at the theater,I think it was Batman Forever.I was singing,Kiss From A Rose when Batman and Robin serial was on.I would love to have it on DVD 
 "Five days in Paris" has to be my favorite book of all time. Peter, the main character works for a pharmesutical company, he deals with many issues. His wife wants him to be some thing that he is not. and he is frustrated with her. While in Paris, he Finds out many things that were unknown before. 
 Because there are exceptional attachments of sons to mothers and visa verse, it's safe to suggest that just like there are different kinds of moms, there will be different kinds of sons. Although society does not necessarily appreciate that fact, and illustrate it well, women have long known that one size does not fit all with respect to manliness and that men should feel free to be the ideal persons they want to be, and appreciated for that decision. Finding a mate who is symbiotic enough to cultivate a relationship with such a man would provide the potential to have more long lasting relationships than currently exist in many cases. Since attitudes and phychological differences are likely to be as important as gender differences, compound insensitivity is necessarily a higher risk. With that knowledge, it's possible to return to the era of individual appraisal of individual qualities rather than to attempt to congregate and rate ideal qualities in each human being. It's also more fun 
 Laughter echoes into the chilly city air as a collection of musician delicately stroke their instrument to the beat of the party. Glasses click gently together, while men in black ties and women in luxurious dresses drown away life's problem under the elaborate mansion. In the Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the story depicts the Jazz Age in the 1920s, while it revolves around the drama in the East and West Egg Village. Jay Gatsby, a self-made man, is hopelessly enchanted by the beautiful and married, Daisy Buchanan. Holding on to bittersweet memories, Gatsby hopes to rekindle the flame between them five years ago. As he desperately holds on to a lost dream, corruption and deception wiggles into the life of the upper classes.  	Set in the 1920s, Fitzgerald gives the reader a deeper understanding of the conditions and fast paced lifestyle of the Jazz Age. In a descriptive and easy to read manner, he guides the reader that one can have everything in the world, but true happiness lies within things that are not tangible. Masterfully Fitzgerald displays this through Jay Gatsby, whose obsession and only happiness lies blindly with the conceited Daisy. Without holding back, Fitzgerald explains the flawed nature that exists in every human being rich or poor. The story is filled with symbolism and unique imagery of the glamorous Jazz Age. The Great Gatsby is an instant classic and respectable piece of literature because of its refreshing viewpoint about the flawed American Dream, which illusion and chaos spur from.   
 I read this book by when my grandmother was living her last days in a nursing home. There was so much I didn't know about older people -- what is important to them, how they think, what their needs are, how they approach death. Simone de Beauvoir, the celebrated French thinker and writer offers an in-depth study of older people as individuals and older people in society. She also looks at the treatment and psychology of older people across time in western civilization. Anyone who is a caretaker of an older family member or friend, or cares about understanding older people will find this book remarkable and thoughtful 
 I had read somewhere that "The Woman In White"  was the original mystery novel and was the classic to measure all later ones by.  After a slow start I became very engaged with the subtle clues and flowery vocabulary.  The book is a chance to experience a Victorian past that adds a special touch to an interesting story. 
 This is one kick-ass carafe! It's pyrex & plastic at it's finest. I highly recommed this kick-ass carafe 
 A first rate biography should include a good description of the important achievements of the subject, give a good sense of the subject's personality, provide the appropriate historic context in which to view the subject, be well written, and have good documentation.  Westfall's biography of Newton is first-rate in all these dimensions. Newton is arguably the most important person in modern history.  His work inaugurates both modern mathematics and modern physics.  His achievements as a physicist set the pattern not only for physics but also for the other natural sciences. Newton's impact in larger culture extended also beyond the world of sciences.  The historian of religion George Marsden wrote that Newton was the most important individual in the founding of the 18th century Enlightenment.  Though Newton cannot be considered a member of that movement, his example of demonstrating universal natural laws understandable by human reason was immensely influential in European intellectual culture.   Westfall provides a detailed chronological account of Newton's life that covers all his major (and minor) achievements and is simply excellent at integrating the relevant historical background information.  As Westfall writes, we regard Newton as a scientist and the emphasis in on Newton's career as a working scientist and mathematician.  But, this is described very clearly within the context of late 17th century Europe. Westfall, for example, devotes ample pages to Newton's study of alchemy and theology.  Since Newton spent a large fraction of his life working in these areas, it would be imposing an anachronistic perspective to minimize attention to these topics.  Westfall is excellent at describing both the intellectual and social milieu in which Newton functioned.  The sections detailing the history of mathematics and physics of Newton's important predecessors and contemporaries are first-rate, particularly his analysis of the impact of Descartes analytical geometry and mechanistic philosophy.  His descriptions of 17th century Cambridge, with its concentration of pseudo-academic placemen, and of the generally patronage driven world of Caroline Britain are excellent. Never at Rest provides a vivid impression of the nature of scientific work in Newton's time.  Westfall does not shirk from presenting complex mathematical and physical topics.  These sections are tough going for those who don't recall a lot of math and physics but very worthwhile because they give an excellent sense of Newton's transforming effects on these disciplines.  Westfall delineates Newton's difficult personality very well and is fair in dealing with the numerous conflicts in which Newton became enmeshed, particularly the famous priority dispute with Leibnitz.  Some of Newton's behavior is shown also to have stemmed from unexpected sources.  Newton's theological researches led him to the conclusion that much accepted Christian theology is wrong and he had to conceal his Arianism and anti-Trinitarianism for much of his life.  Some of Newton's achievements are shown as stemming from unexpected sources also.  Westfall shows that Newton's alchemical researches, with their rather mystical element, probably contributed to freeing him from dogmatic mechanistic philosophy and facilitated his development of the idea of a universal, intrinsic gravitational force.  Newton is a fascinating figure and this biography will remain the standard for the foreseeable future.     
 Richard Holmes has collected many of published and unpublished essays from the past, added new introductions and created Explorations of a Romantic Biographer (as per sub-title of his book, Sidetracks).  The journey encompasses many centuries and many delightful figures of the literary past, from John Boswell to F. Scott Fitzgerald, from Lord Lisle to M. R. James (in a wonderful section on Gothic shadows).  The two best chapters concentrate on the death (and life) of Thomas Chatterton and the life (and death) of Mary Wollstonecraft and William Godwin.  This book will be enjoyable for those who are not familiar with all the discussed writers' work (such as myself) as the writing is so clear and beautiful and the personalities examined so fascinating.  This book examines biography writing as an art form and thoroughly proves its case.  A charming read 
 I loved Closing Time and now Jim Fusilli has written the second in the series! It's great, completely living up to and surpassing the first. I can't wait for the third. This series would make a really good movie-in the right hands-but who could capture Fusilli's superb style on film? A must-read 
 GREAT book and great series (all the Pottery Barn Design Library books)!  I have an interior design background, and this series is the best I've ever read --- great design and storage ideas that are easy to do and the ideas are multi-faceted, so you could use in another room, etc 
 The Strategy Paradox provides one of the few traversable bridges between strategy theory and practice.  The book's theoretical foundations are solid and presented cogently by Raynor.  While Raynor's theoretical discussion and empirical evidence are reassuring, his book's most important contribution is a very usable strategy development framework.  By introducing the concept of risk and real options formally into the strategy development process, Raynor provides managers, like me, the much needed toolkit for strategy development in dynamic and uncertain markets.  Raynor has provided clear guidance on how, when, and who from various organizational levels should be engaged in strategy development.  The book also highlights how unwavering commitment to a strategy can lead to overconfidence, over-commitment, and higher risk.  Raynor has shown how a firm's adaptability and strategic evolution needs to be monitored regularly to keep pace with the market's changing risk and opportunity profile.  This book has made me rethink how we approach strategy development, question what we truly know about our markets, explicitly acknowledge the market risk, and highlight the mutually exclusive choices we're making as we put our strategy into play 
 Lara of Xy, a Queen in her own land, has given up everything to accompany her Warlord, Keir to his home.  Along the way she has fallen in love with his people and more importantly she has fallen more and more in love with Keir.  However, some of those among Keir's people fear the changes that Lara brings with her strange ways.  Considered a great healer in her homeland, the ways of treatment that Lara uses are not always welcomed.  Now she and Keir find themselves being judged, Lara as a worthy Warprize and Keir as not only a leader, but as a Warlord who is fit to be a mate to the Warprize.  Can Lara and Keir overcome the obstacles and find a way to spend their lives together?  I have been waiting for Elizabeth Vaughan's final book in The Chronicles of the Warlands trilogy since I turned the last page of Warsworn.  As soon as it arrived I tore into it, banning my children from my office and read it in one sitting.  Warlord brings a stunning conclusion to the trilogy that Ms. Vaughan so brilliantly started with Warprize.  While giving the reader more than enough romance to keep the most dedicated romance fan hooked, Ms. Vaughan also tells an engrossing story that thoroughly draws you into Keir and Lara's world.  Although I am sad that Lara and Keir's trilogy has come to an end, I am anxious to see what more stories Ms. Vaughan will create to keep me enthralled!  Melissa Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewe 
 It must have been a hard book to find. Once I finally received it it was in great condtion. I have no complaints. I took off one star because it took so long 
 In a world where no minority can be discussed without someone being offended, where all special interest groups boycott books and publishers for offensive language, where every conceivable component of society cries and complains of an ism of some sort (e.g. sexism, racism, ageism), it is nearly impossible to convey a message, and even more impossible to retell stories of historical significance.  The Language Police shows that political correctness has a strangle hold on textbook publishers, and the grip is slowly restricting the educational airflow necessary for the broadening of young minds.  The Language Police is the real-life sequel to Fahrenheit 451, and proof that much of what Bradbury warned has come true.  What's interesting is that despite the burning, discarding, and trashing, regardless of how powerful the perceived influence may be, the negative effect of literature becomes inconsequential when ubiquitous mass media consistently provides a much less "refined" product.  It's truly frightening how this book displays the gap between actual freedom of speech and the eroded pacification to which America's society now abides.  When passages are eliminated from classic literature like Macbeth and Huck Finn, the censorship renders literature impotent.    The one negative to this book, despite the fact that it made me weep for the American education system, is that, at times, much of the book felt repetitious.  Perhaps it's the nature of the book, the vanilla topic, but finishing this book without feelings of deja vu was difficult.  Nonetheless, it's no wonder why American education is in shambles, and The Language Police perfectly uncovers the erosion.  I highly recommend this book to all educators, and to anyone interested in the future of American education 
 A better subtitle to this book might be "Understanding Symbology," but then you would miss the "lively" and "entertaining" part of the current subtitle, and that shouldn't be thrown away. This is probably the best book I've ever read about the ugly task of decoding literature, and I would highly recommend it as a graduation present for any high school student who plans to attend college. It's that good. Foster is no dry academic, although his taste still runs to the rather mundane type of literature that doesn't do anything for me personally. What Foster is good about, though, is explaining exactly why he finds that type of literature exciting and how one can decipher it to understand what those darn professors find interesting about it, too.  This is a nice companion piece to Jane Smiley's Thirteen Ways of Looking at the Novel, especially her chapter on how novelists play games when writing. Smiley comes to the novel as a practioner; Foster looks at the novel as a cartographer. Smiley explains how to play the game, while Foster shows how to understand what the game was that the novelist was playing. Do all novelists play games? No, only the better ones. It's not that novels that have nothing going for them beyond the plot are bad per se, but like a movie that goes from one chase sequence to showdown, a plot-only novel is one-dimensional.  The only thing missing in Foster's explication here is an understanding for novels of ideas, which often get short shrift from the academy, sometimes rightly (when the novel has no plot or characters and only presents the ideas) but often overlooked because the novelist eschews symbology for prognostication. It's only a slight misstep, and one easily forgiven for most college classes where this book will come in handy won't be covering those kinds of books anyway 
 This is an excellent book about understanding what you do best, how that best makes the world a better place, and a bit about how to reach the public with what you do best. This is a point made on every page of the book. I highly recommend it to folks who want to take what they do very well, what they do better than anyone else, trust it, and devote oneself to doing it even better while bringing one's offering to market.   There is, however, one important qualification to my praise. Which is, that while the author contrasts the limitations of the "first" Renaissance, with the virtues of this "second" Renaissance" he also makes a great case for the value, insights gained from, and need for the competency of "pattern recognition," by upper corporate management. He makes the point that each company should have the ability to recognize the patterns associated to its core competencies and offerings, and I assume with how those patterns resonate with their customers. This was the essence and sine-qua-non of the "first" Renaissance; the re-birthing of the eternal patterns first made known in the classical Greek period. There is a great deal to learn about patterns and their recognition from the first Renaissance, much more than Mr. Rushkoff's excellent book has to offer, or gives credit to.   Our current obsession with "Brand" and "Branding" and "Brand Management" is not anything more than a less adept striving to create what the Greeks understood about the worship of their gods. How each divinity was a constellation of psychological forces that formed patterns of thought, feeling, and behavior that were expressions "from" the culture and not imposed "on" the culture. During the first Renaissance this was recognized and was employed as a way to speak to and create for its own people. In this way, by understanding the first Renaissance a time of "pattern recognition," one can learn to create value for people from their lives and not impose it on their lives.   I love this book and at the same time, this significant lapse has me thinking about how much the author has sacrificed of his own considerable and core competency for research in chasing the gods of "compare and contrast" so overly worshiped by those in-the-academic-box.  But, let me also say that this is an amazingly useful book for those who want to embrace the patterns of collaboration, generosity, and approaching one's work as play, which are the shinning patterns of this "second" Renaissance, that we live in today and which Hermes, Aphrodite and a sense of Philia can teach us all about as well.  Once I began reading this book I could not put it down. Nothing is perfect, however, which is another point he makes in the book.  
 This series is fascinating.  The book is beautifully researched and Iggulden does a fine job of making what could be dry history very interesting reading.  This is the third in a four book series and I've enjoyed all of three very much 
 One "word" for this album......BAD (as in GOOD)!!! I have several Peter White CD's, and none are disappointing. I first heard him about four years ago in Detroit,MI.(with Dave Koz & Rick Braun), and was quite impressed. The man can deal! His music usually contains a fine blend of good sounds, "original, old-school, top hits, up-beat, smooth,etc." Sounds to fit any mood.  The sounds from this CD do much more than "GLOW". Staying power comes to mind 
 It's been some time since this film first appeared at Sundance at the end of the 90's but it does not lose it's power... Many will shy away from it's difficult subject matter. It is not a family film. Neither is "Twin Peaks" and that is an indisputable masterpiece.  Watch the acting. These actors have much to offer. It's apparent that like most indie films, they need some script-tweaking but that not withstanding, it is worth your time.. 
 Read it in 1990 at the age of 29 and was not yet ready to be convinced. Reread it in 1999, older, humbler and still ailing, and found it to be a work so absorbing, so obviously true, that I became depressed at how entrenched medical orthodoxy has been and may continue to be. This book rethinks virtually all aspects of human maturation science, paying crucial attention to the simple observational facts of birthing and how they vary individual to individual in contributing to a staggering range of lasting psychopathologies. The result is one of the essential speculative works of the 20th century. It became the key to my own discovery of long harbored and misunderstood neuroses, and marked the beginning of a long campaign of recovery and personal transformation. This is a massive, clinically-worded text for the advanced psychology reader that testfies to the fact that events of lasting developmental significance happen to many people before the dawn of ego and conscious memory(age 3-4). If you've exhausted all other modern medical strategies for healing without finding whats wrong with you, and are ready to open the door to the huge new world waiting, this is the book. Grof is a caring, brave voice that always allows room for every imaginable personal particular. While it does not provide any firm mechanisms which relate transpersonal phenomena to the biochemical level of functioning, it poses many questions crucial to further investigation in the realm of pure consciousness.  The one book by Grof that enters the deepest, most complete account of his thought 
 A thorough textbook covering breadth and depth of organizational behavior. Solid research methodology, pertinent real-world application examples, interesting, applicable case studies, excellent student materials.  A new edition is due within the next year 
 Some artists make CD's that have two good songs and lots of filler.  This ain't one.  I bought it mainly because it had "Cry On The Shoulder Of The Road," but there isn't a song on here I really don't like.  You can't help but like her version of "Two More Bottles of Wine" because she's one of the few in country with the voice powerful enough to get the emotion right.  No collection is complete without this CD 
 Some artists have a decade of definitive work that they tour for the rest of their lives( if their lucky,and talented enough to produce it in the first place.Outside the the guys Rudy Van Gelder recorded,only Bob Dylan ,Donald Fagen and his co-defendent Walter Becker inhabit that frame it's not what you want, it's what they do .You pays your money .Is this record any good ?,yeah . This is'nt a lifestyle accessory,before or after the fact. So what is it ?. I could tell you about contrapuntal cadences,City Lights lyrical resonance ,arrangements that give up their flavours of the Blanton/Webster band with focused detail,are you any the wiser ?.Could you do better than "A Harlem Airshaft "?. No,but you could buy "Morph  The Cat".P.S. contained within these grooves lies the elixir of hipness  
 I hate people who complain that films don't have enough of some element, some band who they want to see. There are enough Oasis, Blur and Pulp videos out there to catch up on. There is John Harris' Britpop book. Britpop WAS a media invention. It is a tired subject. But it did happen. It is essential to talk about the Blur vs. Oasis thing at some point. I feel that this film succeeded at some point. There are another hour of interviews with the bands as a bonus. If you don't like this film, make your own. It will probably suck. It will probably have a thousand close shots of Jarvis Cocker. That is just fandom. That is monomania. That is not narrative filmmaking 
 While the material on "Gold" is uniformally outstanding, you shouldn't buy it.  It's just another example of Mercury Records mining their rights to Rush's first 15 albums for a few more bucks.  "Gold" is (with the exception of one switched song) actually a compilation of the 1990's-era "Retrospective" best-ofs, which in turn were a slightly-expanded version of the earlier "Chronicles".  Somewhere in between, Mercury also squeezed out "The Spirit Of Radio," a single-CD compilation.  All of these various repackagings had one thing in common:  the musicians who created the actual music had no say in putting them together.  Don't reward the Mercury suits for yet another lame repackaging of old material.  If you want to get into Rush, go buy to the actual albums instead (every Rush album is still in print).  They'll be worth it 
 That quote from "Bitch" (from "Sticky Fingers") perfectly sums up "Exile on Main Street". This album is the Stones' loosest, raunchiest, murkiest and sloppiest effort and I mean that as a compliment. The lyrics are often unintelligible and some of the songs sound like little more than slightly rehearsed jams. Recorded in the South of France in Keith's basement studio (among other locales), this sprawling work encompasses the Stones' usual rock sub-genres such as boogie-woogie, country, gospel, R&B and blues in addition to pure 'rawk'. Highlights for me include the sex-drenched "Rocks Off" built on one of Keith's classic riffs; the catchy hits "Tumbling Dice" and "Happy"; the gritty, country-tinged "Torn & Frayed" which also has some sly references to sex; "Sweet Black Angel" with its sometimes embarrassing, somewhat racist lyrics (though I'm sure they weren't meant to be); "Loving Cup" with its clever alcohol/sex analogy; the swaggering "Ventilator Blues"; the dark and lovely gospel of "Just Wanna See His Face"; the raucous "All Down the Line"; the remake of Robert Johnson's classic "Stop Breaking Down" and lastly the rousing "Soul Survivor".  Though not quite up to the standards set by their best three albums which include "Beggars Banquet", "Let It Bleed" and "Sticky Fingers", "Exile" comes pretty damn close. As with the Beatles' self-titled album otherwise known as "The White Album", some editing would have made this another perfect, classic Stones effort. Sadly, "Exile" would be the last essential Stones release. "Goats Head Soup" would follow "Exile on Main Street" and that lame piece of crap makes "Exile" sound positively brilliant. By the time "Black and Blue" was released I had lost all interest in this formerly great band 
 This study guide was extremely helpful to me. It gives you all the main points and helps you understand the text better. I wish all study guides were this good!  
 We're using this book as our text for a psychopathology class.  It's really easy to read, is concise, and it offers logical & pratical OT interventions for each dx presented.  Even OT students who have already completed a course in abnormal psych will find that this book is relevent and useful 
 The book is a bit slow at the begining, but you will not be able to put it down once you hit the last 100 pages. There is a hint of a love story but mostly it is a book about friendship. 
 This book is outstanding. If you are looking for some of the most beautiful and pristine places to camp in the U.S. this is a great resource. We traveled around the U.S. for 3 months and used this book to help us determine where to go in each state.  We were never dissapointed.  The information is clearly presented and the editors choose the best of the best in terms of natural beauty 
 I am currently reading this as part of the curriculum for a History of Furniture class.  Rybczynski puts some heart into an otherwise academic study.  He looks at the way in which houses were organized within the  cultural and economic scope; yet digs in deep as to the evolution of the  HOME.  It is very thought provoking as to how I am organizing and using my  own home, very beneficial in the development of my business consulting in  "Smart Home" design, and has made me look at the end of the  century expectation of our homes in a whole new light.  If he reads this,  thanks for your approach.  It has broadened my horizons (if not improved my  spelling!! 
 Once more, Stephen King facinates me with his incredible creativity and unqiue character development. We see the story of a group of otherwise strangers trapped in what appeares to be an inescapable hell, only to find strength in one another and overcome the obstacles. But it isn't that easy... King places a number of twists and turns in this thriller that make it hard to put down after beginning to read it. You'll find yourself obsorbed in the pages and brought into this world of King's after the first line. You absolutely will NOT regret buying this book and I cannot wait until the DVD is released in August 
 This is an excellent book. It offers fresh thinking supported by field research on issues that go to the heart of economic, political, and social change in Libya. Based on a survey of 500 students at Garyounis University in Benghazi, Libya, the author concludes that the revolutionary government headed by Mu'ammar al-Qaddafi has enjoyed considerable success since 1969 in reproducing its values among the younger generation. Regime success is most notable in the area of gender issues together with policies on Arab nationalism, Arab unity, and the Palestinian issue. The regime has been much less successful in its efforts to create politically participant citizens and to develop acceptable alternatives to kinship ties. These are very significant findings that challenge the thinking of many observers on the construct and impact of the Qaddafi revolution 
 I only gave this book 4 stars because I bought the book yeterday,and I just started reading it.I've skimmed through all the chapters,but it seems like a wonderful starter book and I think it has good information for anyone who has worked with the Fey for many years too.I've been blessed to see and hear them again after being taught that they were "not real"......just because most adults cannot see them with their physical sight does not mean that they are not "real". Unicorns,dragons,faeries,and all of the other  wonderful beings are patiently waiting for those who want to befriend them......but you must respect them as you would a good friend. Blessed B 
 In Doomsayers: Anglo-American Prophecy In The Age Of Revolution, Susan Juster (Associate Professor of History at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor), provides a perceptive and informative survey of the apocalyptic prophets of the 1790's and early 1800's. Visionaries (or perhaps simply deluded individuals), used the era's budding proliferation of newspapers, corresponding societies, penny pamphlets, voluntary associations and more to spread their predictions and prophecies. The foretellings of several hundred men and women in Britain and North America are deftly reviewed to give a general impression of how doomsayers' stories were formed, challenged, tested, and often ultimately discarded. Presenting the struggle between would-be prophets and their critics as part of a larger shift in societal norms in the age, Doomsayers is a thought-provoking, meticulously researched, accessibly presented and highly recommended account of an historically influential social and cultural phenomena 
 My husband and I bought two copies when it was a Gold Box featured product so he could install it on both of our computers. He is a computer consultant and rates ZoneAlarm at 4 stars because, after using it for a few weeks, we find too many spurious alerts for items that ZA should have had on their "safe" list, particularly the "suspicious activities" of the OS Firewall. This program is puzzling for a casual user such as myself to navigate alone. I would still rather have more protection than I can handle, rather than a dummied-down version that I would understand better but that might not provide the virus protection we need, but he says he wouldn't recommend this to his novice clients unless they wanted a lot of hands-on control of their systems.  
 If your a fan of the black and white mysteries of the 30's and 40's, like Charlie Chan and Sherlock Holmes, you will want to add the Mr. Moto series to your collection.  I just watched them for the first time, and enjoyed all of them 
 Similar to the movie "The Haunting" Rose Red is about a house which comes alive, based on the hauntings of its previous owners and family heritage. The effects in this movie are so mesmerizing, that you're on the edge of your seat the whole time, thinking that you might be the next victim of this evil house 
 I was very pleased with the Sony ECM-F01 Boundary Effect Microphone.  This product works great for the meetings I attend and the clarity and volume are the best.  Even though the size of this product is small, the range and pick-up is exceptional.  Very good product and a very good price for the features it offers 
 The reader can avoid about the opening 26 pages in Notorious C.O.P., as Derrick Parker mentions that he was the NYPD'S "hip-hop cop" so many times that it ruins what could have been a good introduction. But putting his ego aside - or at least dishing it out in smaller doses - the compelling book becomes hard to put down.  Parker took his affinity for the music industry and his concerns about its expanding linkage to organized crime to eventually spearhead a "hip-hop" unit. He is careful to explain that he was working for the safety of the artists - which was not always the goal of other police officials - while also taking steps to clean out the criminal element that made victims of the artists, neighborhoods and others who innocently got caught up in the drama.  What I found especially interesting is the normal, daily manipulations that you may hear about, but really don't see in print; the politics from his bosses that oftentimes came from a media-hungry and -savvy City Hall, the department jealousies, the ignorance & corruption, along with the bitter racism.   Parker's growing disenchantment with the NYPD reached a boiling point when he was brought up on bogus departmental charges due to others who wanted his "hip-hop" post for all the wrong reasons and when a superior ordered him to compile a dossier on hip-hop artists that had all the trappings of COINTELPRO-styled abuse.   The sensationalistic subtitle sets those chapters up for a letdown, and that is what happened in the cases of Tupac and Biggie. Parker really adds very little to what has been made public over the past decade, but does justify his findings with credible evidence.   Though retired from the NYPD, Parker's private investigation of the Jam Master Jay murder, his attempts to get his former colleagues engaged into a solid investigation with a prime witness and the games played that has now made solving the crime virtually impossible brings the book to an apt conclusion.  Organized crime has been in the music industry for many years; the original gansta was probably Frank Sinatra, who reportedly had some "assistance" in the early 1940s to get out of his contract with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra to start a solo recording/touring career.   Parker shows - through a text unfortunately marred with numerous typographical errors - that the vicious game in a multi-billion-dollar industry is still being played, but with oftentimes much greater tragic conclusions. And those with the power to help clean things up refuse to do so for a variety of reasons that are as much racial as they are political 
 If you don't have Sade's "Diamond Life" or even if you do, this "Best of" CD is a welcome addition to any music collection. This unique singer continues to haunt me like the girl from Ipanema. 
 This is the Brahms Symphonies set to get. Every performance is great, and the sound is pretty high quality. I do not notice any problems with the acoustics. Highly recommended 
 Yo, The Comrads haven't been noticed by too many people yet but I say that they will become big if they stick with Mack 10 and keep on making cd's because this cd was tha bomb and once people listen to it they will be big 
 Todd Snider is probably as close to Woody Guthrie as we're gonna get in this generation. The songs are clever or heartfelt or whatever, but they're always real. All of his CDs are great, this one especially 
 This book is for the striving 'want to be' loan officer.  It fully covers the mathematics involved in calculating loan processes.  It is easy to understand and provides the reader with plenty of sample problems to work out 
 While "Ragtime" received great reviews when it arrived on Broadway, it was, unfortunately, completely overshadowed by Disney's "The Lion King".  Headed by an excellent cast (Brian Stokes Mitchell, Marin Mazzie, Audra McDonald), the beautiful score includes several memorable songs, including:  Ragtime Your Daddy's Son Wheels Of A Dream 'Till We Reach That Day  Also available is the full double-disc score, but I prefer the single disc highlights 
  Little is discussed regarding 'Islamic art' its meaning and message other than in the works of this author, F Schuon and Titus Burckhard.  There are plenty of books regarding the tools that were used, the colours and shapes but little on what actually motivated those who designed the great Mosques in Iran, Turkey and other parts of the world, who composed works of literature and works of art.  This book goes some way to answer those questions it also includes an exellent study of Rumi based on some traditional sources that are little known in the West.  It should be pointed out regarding Rumi that the vast majority of literature published concerning him is not based on original sources but simply re-writes of Nicholson, Arberry or Iqbal.  Apart from Nicholsons notes to the Mathnawi wich is based upon the commentary of Ankaravi I am not aware of any available translation of a comentarty of the Mathnawi (something that is badly needed)  Profesor Nasr goes some way in this book to explain the true meaning of Rumi and another great Persian poet and Sufi Farid ud-Din Attar.  There is also an exellent chapter on music, the concept of space in Islamic art and the concept and understanding of painting and minitures in Islamic art (a form of art that has been misunderstood in recent years) 
 A high-powered, lady realtor whose star is on the rise disappears and a John Doe's body is found in the last place she was seen, along with her personal possessions. To the cops investigating, none of the scant clues add up in any way that makes sense. Where did she go? Who is the body? Where does her husband fit in? Complicating matters is the fact that one of the detectives finds himself attracted to the vanished woman's sister-in-law, jeopardizing their investigation with a conflict of interest. None of them could have foreseen how complicated everything would become though.   **** Ms. Breton without fail brings her readers intense character driven stories that draw you in from the outset and don't let you go. Her words paint a vivid portrait that comes alive, like a movie for the mind. You will not be able to guess the outcome of this mystery, no matter how clever you are. *** 
 the author reveals the work and task at hand involved in castle building ( and a small township nearby).... i loved following the progress of the construction from the chosen site... to the tools used... especially the fortificatons and defense structures... its as close as i can get to actually living in the ages of castles... a highly recommended read!!!!!... 
 Garrett has an eye and an ear for authentic Texas.  The story is told with great depth by a flawed but charming narrator, a man who unflinchingly shows us his heart, even when he doesn't understand its longings himself.  A really wonderful book 
 I am so happy this book was written! I have a 5 year old daughter and I was having a hard time finding a book about adoption which she could relate to. My daughter loved the book and colourful drawings of the animals. The text was easy for my daughter to understand. After reading the book my daughter and I had an open discussion about adoption and the "notes for parents" at the end of the book helped me tremendously. My daughter now has a better understanding about adoption and feels comfortable talking about it. This book should be part of every childs library 
 This is a good resource on the Revolutionary War.  It not only has good pictures but it also has great activities to make the history that you are learning come alive 
 This is undoubtedly the finest book on Bin Laden/Al Qaeda out of the countless I have read over the last several years.  It is concise, clear, and absolutely terrifying as it makes clear that Al Qaeda is led by an able and charismatic genius who has been able to gather and focus the Muslim world's collective hatred of the United States and our one-sided foreign policy.    The thrust of this treatise is simple.  Al Qaeda is smarter than we are (they don't have to win elections and they are not beholden to special interests), they are tougher than we are (aren't you afraid to die?), and they don't care how long it takes to win (Allah is infinitely patient and will be pleased with victory whenever it comes - why does my microwave dinner take so f*&*&%$#$ long to heat up?).    What I found most compelling is that the book is HEAVILY footnoted, quoting Muslim clerics, bin Laden, and other relevant Muslims.  So, in other words, it is not some pedantic, crusty  white guy lecturing me about why Al Qaeda is evil; rather it is Al Qaeda telling me in their words why they hate me and why they are going to kill me and how all of that is supported by the Koran and driven forward by the ridiculous and inarguably anti-Muslim foreign policy of this, our once great and now downward-trending country.  Whew, what a book.  And what a world we live in 
 The premise of the book is the wrong place / wrong guy scenario's where the lead character is going to be on the run a lot.  It takes place in and around New York and paints a complete suburban nightmarescape of bad neighborhoods surrounded by not so bad neighborhoods.  The story is told from a narrative point of view which really servers to draw the reader into the frantic world of the protaganist.  I've got to say that I really enjoyed living through the eyes of someone who is just in the wrong place at the wrong time.   It's a fun fast read 
 This batteries are a godsend! I was frustrated with my camera (d580 zoom) because the batteries didn't last at all. I used these on my tour through Europe - they lasted over 2 weeks of CONSTANT photo taking, reviewing, turning the camera on and off... They were great. I also have the rechargable AA's, but I would rather pay for these because they last so much longer. Worth the money. 
 John 'Duke' Wayne (real name: Marion Morrison) may have done his best work ever here. He plays P.I. in Hawai'i (or is he 'just' Gov. Anti-Com- munist agent? See it; I don't want to give it  away) trailing commies giving away US military secrets, et, al, a-la the Rosenberg shysters that a courageous jewish-american judge had fried. Great film of the genre! Out long be fore either Hawai'ian Eye or the even better Hawai'i Five-0! Wayne was also offered the 'Dirty Harry' role by Director Don Siegel, before Clint Eastwood 
 My name is Rob please listen to my tale Of how owning your feelings will help without fail.  I was sad, my mother had to die I was so closed up I couldn't cry.  To a Florida motel my dad and I went to stay But that did nothing to help my sadness go away.  For a long time for a friend I had to search Then I found Sistine named after a church.  At long last I had finally found a friend I felt my sadness was coming to an end.  We found a tiger filled with rage He made his home trapped in a cage.  Sistine thought we should set him free But I was not as sure as she.  To set him free I did agree But the results were tragic don't you see?  The tiger is now quite dead It was my father who shot the lead.   We knew we had to tell the tiger bye So a funeral was held by Sistine and I  Through all this sadness I did learn To let my true feelings return.    
 I was pretty wary when I picked this book up, as I have a history of finding media tie-in novels to be poorly written and uninteresting. This one especially seemed surreal, because it was a book written about a TV show that was based on another series of books that I happen to enjoy.  I had some trouble drawing the line at first between TV-Tempe and Book-Tempe, but once I put aside the multitude of differences that had nagged at first while reading about Tempe in print, I was able to view it as an extension of the TV show and enjoy it as such.   The prose is clean and the story moves along at a quick enough pace to keep readers interested. I wouldn't nominate it for any literary awards, but it's a book meant to entertain, and it did just that. 
 The Incredibles is a fully-fleshed out and developed computer animated story that isn't just another summer kiddie flick. The Incredibles family members aren't cookie-cutter cartoon characters but real people who just happen to look like something out of a cartoon. :-) The intelligent and well written script won the writers a best script award and along with the amazing special effects they combine to produce the best animated film in many years. The action scenes are entertaining as well as spectacular, and after a while you hardly remember you're watching an animated film because the plot and characters seem so realistic and true to life. Overall a great effort from Pixar and they'll have to work hard to top this one 
 This great book shows you how to lead not drive and explains the difference between leaders and mere bosses. Great foreward by the great Jim Rohn.  The Master Motivator is an instructional manual for success packed with scenarios and specific steps. You'll want to refer to The Master Motivator again and again.  
 After reading The Big Sleep, I was weary about picking up another Chandler book.  I was told that his writing style matures and is easier to follow and grasp in later books.  And yes, that is true in his second book.  Farewell My Lovely is a novel about a hard nosed L.A. detective name Phillip Marlowe.  Marlowe is the master and snappy one liners and sarcasm.  Chandler brings Marlowe to the L.A. area and delves him into the world of 1940s noir crime, with excellent description and tons of ambiance befitting the genre.  At first, Marlowe encounters a murder by near accident, and without giving away the plot, he is entwined in a much deeper scandal with many different type of characters throughout the area, from a curious woman, to psychics, corrupt cops, organized crime leaders, and crooked sanitariums.    Near the end, the book become a little harder to follow, and the plot turns and twists become a little too much, but all in all, it's a great detective novel 
 Noisy Nora is just as much fun to read today as it was when it first came out. I have been teaching second grade forever, and at one time, many years ago, a fellow teacher and myself wore out a filmstrip of Noisy Nora. Our students saw it over and over again. Recently, we used it as the take home book in a Book Bag program. Today's students love it as much as those almost 30 years ago 
 As one who has often said "Football players? You can tell their intelligence by the size of their necks," I have passed a pleasant lifetime mocking sports in general (and hockey and NASCAR in particular). Which is why, I guess, my man kept casually propping this volume up on my nightstand. Okay, I'm no stranger to the fine art of compromise, so in I dove. No one is more surprised than I am to report that this breezy, hip primer actually makes sports interesting, especially the profiles of the star players. Given my particular predisposition, I have to credit the author's conveniently bite-sized factoids and witty observations on the battle of the sexes, the sugar that makes this medicine go down, and I totally agree with her assertion that a little sports knowledge can help you as much in the boardroom as the bedroom. So if you want to join in--or at least be a little less lame--keep a copy of THE SMART GIRL'S GUIDE next to the remote control and in no time at all, you, too, will receive admiring glances upon uttering things like "Darnell Hillman? Didn't he win the 'Biggest ABA Afro Award' at the 1997 reunion?" You go, girl. 
 This book was recommended to me by my grief counselor.  I was a bit skeptical at first, as the author had a stillborn child, while I lost a 2 year old to Pediatric Cancer.  However, it turned out to be one of the most helpful books I read.  Lorraine Ash helped me heal, even just a little bit, and I am grateful to her.  Reading a book actually written by a bereaved mom was infinitely more helpful than all of the books I read written by therapists who have not experienced the same kind of loss I have.  I have copied quite a few exerps from her book, and read them from time to time when I need a lift.  I believe I may actually get to meet the author, when she is in NY for a Walk to Remember children who have lost their lives.  I hope so!  I am truly sorry for all of you bereaved parents who are searching for a book to soothe their soul.  I hope you find this book as comforting as I did.  
 I picked up Cat's Eye because I was so consumed by the characterization in The Robber Bride.  Imagine a novel which could transport me beyond my strong emotions for the characters in The Robber Bride.  Our heroine, Elaine, was a drifter in early elementary school, until she become involved in a clique of girls lead by Cordelia.  The pain Cordelia inflicts on the young Elaine is insufferable (but Elaine desperately wanted her approval), and in many ways, it will remind most readers of at least portions of their school-years experiences.   The story of Cat's Eye is told in the present tense, when Elaine is a successful artist, and the school-year times with Cordelia are told as flashbacks.  This helps the reader, because they know that Elaine survived the torment to make something of her life.  Personally, I adore Elaine as an icon, because she sees her works as pieces of art, not as the feminist icons that her fans want to define her by.  I wonder how much of Elaine's sentiment about being a reluctant feminist icon reflects Atwood's true feelings about how her literary works are interpreted.  Overall, this is a brilliant literary masterpiece, especially for any woman who experienced elementary and junior high school at the hands of a clique of girls.  Highly recommended-this is powerful stuff. 
 When it comes to understanding and explaining why some companies develop and launch new products better than their competitors, Mike Robert truely has no equal. In preparing to help overhaul the strategic planning process  at a major publishing firm, we read countless books on strategic planning  before choosing Mike's "Strategy, Pure and Simple" as our guide.  We couldn't have made a better choice. Mike's tell-it-like-it-is style and  clearly defined process served as a guide through numerous planning  sessions. This is Mike Robert's third book on the subject, and it is every  bit as powerful as the first two.  Whenever a client asks me to assist them  on their strategic thinking journey, Mike's principles are a guiding force  and his books are must reading.  Adam Lefto 
 The Boyfriend List was an excellant story about a girl whose life has been shattered to pieces.  Each chapter is about a boy who she has had some sort of relationship with and a little bit about her life.  I was a little disappointed however that when you got to the book there was only a few pages about the boy and it might have been at the end.  I loved the footnotes, though, it was really creative.  I recommend this book to any preteen or teen 
 This book finally allowed me to be able to hire the right people, unfortunately near the time I sold my business. I only wish I had found it when I went into business, however that was before the book was published 
 This series with Penelope Thornton McClure and her ghost of a dead PI Jack Shepard is truly unique, and the stories are good also.  In this book Penelope and her aunt Sadie are given a rare collection of Edgar Allan Poe books, and Penelope begins noticing that deaths and attacks seem to be happening to anyone that is connected with this rare book collection.  She sets out with some help from Jack as well as her live friends to find out what's happening.  The mix of cozy with the hard-boiled genre again occurs in this book, and it's an appealing combination.  I also enjoyed the Edgar Allan Poe trivia that is found throughout the book.  It would be safe for me to say that these books are addicting.  I can't wait until the next one comes out 
 This book might be simple to read, but the meaning goes very deep.  Like one of the readers said, the kids will get different meaning out of it at different ages.  I read the book with my kids when they were very young, and this has been one of our favorite books.  My kids are 14 and 15 now, and we are still talking and discussing about what the book teaches us about our lives 
 Ms. Lippman's best Tess story to date.  No need to rehash the plot but there are many things happening at different levels and trying to understand how they all fit together makes the book that much more interesting.  One warning however, if you haven't read any of Ms. Lippman's books before, this a spoiler for an earlier book 
 The Stamina is definitely not a Bowflex, but then I can't afford a Bowflex.  I really like the sliding seat for doing rowing type exercises.  The Stamina wasn't too hard to assemble, but there were some quality issues with the parts that I had to correct to get everything to fit together.  My main complaint is the difficulty in changing the resistance bands.  Much of this was taken care by cutting off the plastic safety clips -- they really aren't needed.  There were also quality issues with the length of the ropes not being even, which I had to correct by knoting one.  However, overall I'm pleased with the value 
 This is a great read for someone trying to refocus their marketing efforts.  Very thought provoking 
 Learn everything you need to know about sailing knots and splicing in this sailor's handbook.  You'll also learn plenty of other interesting things to do with a rope 
 This is really a bible-level handbook of javascript. The contents are very comprehensive and look professional. The best thing is that the examples in each chapter really help understand the boring syntax and functions 
 This is as close to perfect as it gets.  A MUST HAVE for starting out and goes really well with 78 Degrees of Wisdom and Paul Foster Case's book A Key to the Wisdom of the Ages.  (Three best books on the market.)  Readable, concise, extremely insightful and keywords perfect for internalizing meanings.  NO OTHER BEGINNERS BOOK IS EVEN IN THE BALLPARK!! 
 Lewis' unmistakable profundity is not lost in his most personal work. He recounts how his twin pursuits of atheism and joy eventually parted ways when their inherent incompatibility became inescapable. His is an amazing story of, as he puts it, "the most dejected and reluctant convert" in all of England. Skillfully told and remarkably insightful, Lewis reveals the footpath that led him to the depths of life without God and the ensuing journey that took him to the heights of a joy he once thought unknowable. His warning to young atheists is a classic: "A young man who wishes to remain a sound atheist cannot be too careful of his reading. There are traps everywhere--'Bibles laid open, millions of surprises,' as Herbert says, 'fine nets and stratagems.' God is, if I may say it, very unscrupulous." Surprised by Joy is a masterpiece that fittingly encompasses Lewis' story as well as our own 
 I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys fairy tales.  Liam Aiken does a fantastic job of acting and the movie is touching and warm hearted and funny! I definitely enjoyed it throughly and am glad I own it on DVD 
 Sue Grafton continues to keep the reader entertained in her alphabet series with H IS FOR HOMICIDE. Her unique writing style is more like someone telling his/her favorite story and you only have to sit back and enjoy the tale.  In this book Kinsey Millhone is hired to investigate the death of a claims adjuster and uncovers an insurance scam in the process. The trail leads into Los Angeles on her pursuit of a violent individual who may be the murderer. Kinsey is not afraid of following the suspect through the seedier side of LA and even into a bar adequately named "The Meat Locker" (gee, can you guess what kind of bar this is?). This is the fearless Kinsey Malone that we see in this saga.  Yes, this is the insurance world's underground and Sue Grafton leads us through it with humor and a very biased opinion. Who else could come up with a singles bar named "The Meat Locker" and get away with the reader chuckling about it? Her books show her very funny sense of humor and nothing is immune to her wit.   In H IS FOR HOMICIDE, Grafton shows us that no one is protected from corruption and does this in such a way that not only do we find it funny but disgusting at the same time. As always, her characters are, well for lack of a better description, characters. They continuously encompass a wide variety of people from every walk of life that is one of the reasons people can submerse themselves into Grafton's books.   Her continuing books revolving around Kinsey Millhone are interesting reading and not the type of books that are a cerebral exercise, but more of a story being told by a master storyteller. They are definitely books to be enjoyed. 
 DBC Pierre's ManBooker Prize winning novel "Vernon God Little" would have grabbed me more if it had not been for the somewhat pedestrian plotting. Pierre is beautifully sarcastic and I love his characterisations and observations of people, but having a bit more of a story to hang them on would have curtailed my impatience. That said, it's an extremely quirky piece of fiction and has taught be a lot of what I've always wanted to know about cursing. I want to share some of my favourite quotes with you, in no particular order. "Parents succeed by managing the database of you dumbness and your slime, ready for combat." "Famous Actors put toothpast under their eyes to help them cry. Did you know that? I'm just telling you for court, in case you look too impassive. You know how impassive you can look." "A receptionist with spiky teeth and a voicebox made from bees trapped in tracing paper sits behind a desk in Dr. Goosens' waiting room." "I end up watching these useless brown moths that thwack around the light in my cell, felty splinters torn from nighttime, lost and confused." 
 This book is clear and simple. It covers everything without being complicated. It is easy for kids to understand without talking down to them.  I highly recommend this book 
 Dawley packs this book with pertinent facts.  This is a real page turner.  There is not alot of published information about this particular area of the Industrial Revolution. So, the extensive research presented is greatly appreciated 
 Wolfgang Puck is the pioneer of east-meets-west cooking and successfully introduced creative oriental touches and flavors into his otherwise immaculately french style. Puck is a no-nonsense chef, and this is a no-nonsense cookbook that will allow you to create some quite stunning dishes. I have always found it clear and well-written, the recipes are easy to follow, and with good results. This cookbook is not meant for the beginner, if you need pictures with your instructions, do not bother. This is also not one of these all-inlcusive how to cook everything under the sun books but rather a recipe collection that is meant to introduce the educated enthusiast to this style of cooking. You will take away new techniques and a broadended palate 
 This John Wayne Western movie is great. I intend to make it a part of my DVD library including other Western classics.  
 This movie is such a 'feel good' movie!!  Truly a classic!  Grab a bowl of popcorn and a soft drink and get ready for some good laughs!!!!  I LOVE IT!!! 
 Samuel Beckett's, soon to be classic, drama about two men, Vlad and Estro, transcends stage-play drama. Beckett's relatively short story is a pioneering foray into the mixture of a dramatic, literal story.   Most drama should be seen on stage, so that the performers can give their characters shape, bring in an audience, and produce a night of dramatic arts. That is not how this story seems to go; not at all, indeed.  Beckett's story can be seen as a naturalistic look at the life of the poor. Here are two men, both obviously at the end of their ropes, but each keeps this asinine hope that "GODot" will show up. But, he never does. Extra characters, like Pozzo and Lucky, simply add to the intended confusion.  As several previous reviewers have taken note--there is not action. While this idea is spurred by "The Threepenny Opera," Beckett takes postmodernism another step further. The characters' are so disillusioned the question becomes, Godot isn't coming, so did he ever care? Could Godot actually exist he allows these poor fellows to exist in such a state.   A fantastic read, and one of the best dramas ever written. This fairly short play should be read by EVERYONE. 
 I'm a collector of DVDs from Criterion to mediocre "original" Studio Productions (WB e.g.). This Taiwan-Copy of "Balls of Fire" is first rate quality, picture and sound and anything you can wish for in a remastered DVD. If you want THIS movie, get it at it's low price. If you are a snob or real freak, get it at its "English Original" price. If you don't know what I'm talking about, get something else. Well, I prefer the remake with Danny Kaye to this first Howard Hawks-movie, but then I prefer American Jazz to dated American slang. Gary Cooper against Danny Kaye? impossible to chose. "Ball of Fire" has more bite, "A Song is Born" too much schmalz, but then there is the music and Danny Kaye.  I have both of them, on DVD and VHS. Best of two worlds 
 I agree with the singing comments mentioned by other reviewers, but still liked enough to recommend to you. I think the concert is well shot, very relaxing, and has good sound quality. It's one that I could see putting in every so often to enjoy over and over, unlike many others of mine. They sing all the greats and put forth a lot of genuine effort for a good show. Gerry's voice is palatable after it gets warmed up. I'm not saying he's Dennis DeYoung, Jeff Lynne, or Paul Rodgers, but still decent enough to enjoy throughout the entire concert. I just wish that he wouldn't have mopped up 2/3 of "You can do Magic" before getting more on track, as I really like that one...I thought Dewey actually sounded pretty good though. You'll like this DVD if you like America's hits 
 All I have to say is that this film used to be a seminal part of the build up to my nights on the town. Re-discovered it again recently and still love it! It isnt a complex film but you feel part of the build up, part of the craziness and the slow comedown at the end. It even takes the odd pot shot at the drug culture that makes up the core of this film. The whole soundtrack is fantastic and seems to pick up on the moods so well. Finally it manages to pull out all those great and pointless thoughts and conversations you have on a night out that make that always seem spot on! A film that for better or worse will always have pride of place in my collection. 
 Just perfect. Music is very, very nice. I love ENIGMA. You think that all songs are the same but you are wrong. It is some of energy that you can be given after horrible day at work, for example. I recommend to all of You 
 This book was received in the condition and timely manner that was promised.  I am very satisfied.  Thank you! 
 After recently reading the Raj Quartet, I wanted to see again the Masterpiece theater production from the 70's.  At the time it originally aired I missed the first crucial episode, and then occassionally another, and so always felt like I didn't know who was who. Yet I still just loved this amazing, detailed period piece, a representation of life and politics in India in the 30's and 40's, the final years of England's rule.  This show has held up well, with fabulous acting, sets and script. The quality of the picture isn't as crisp as it might be, but still I have an eager group of friends who watch it with me.  At about 15 hours we are taking our time, but I just can't wait to watch the next episode.  Merrick, the man you love to hate! It's still a gripping and rewarding tale 
 I'll be brief:  If you liked Without Remorse, you'll like Rainbox 6.  In my honest opinion they're two of Tom's best works.  They both focus on John Clark, rather than Jack Ryan.  I love the Jack Ryan books too, dont' get me wrong, but the Clark (or Kelly, depending on which book  you read first) character is so deep.  Jack Ryan gets into a lot of stuff and gets lucky quite often.  John Clark doesn't take unnecessary risks, and those he does take he executes with ruthless precision :)  Kind of blowing it out of proportion a bit, but trust me, any fan of Jack Ryan is a fan of John Clark.  They stand for the same things, its just John's earlier years were....well, quite interesting for those who haven't read the previous book.  Pick'em both up and you won't sleep for a month, because once you've read'em both you'll want to go back and re-read all the previous novels looking for hints of Clark and paying more attention to his parts 
 it had to happen sometime...this book took me sometime to get through and when i got to the end i felt as though i had been violated..this book had major promises and then it had the potential to be dissapointing. i actually want to give this book 3 and a half stars for good merit, but i cant and have to stick with the 4. how would you like it if, from the very get go of meeting a boy, him and his family had the propheltic plan for you to save their island from tourist hell. a conspiracy in fact, that has been going on for quite sometime, and "if you are here reading this right now, then you have failed and all is lost" .. how would you like it if you were used as a recepticle for a baby and then only to find that your husband was......hah, cant tell you that... the book, overall, is worth the read for any fan of chuck. 
 This album just makes you feel good.  From the lyrical content, the flow of Kazé on the mic, the dope beats by 9th Wonder (One of the best in the game right now), and the guest production is fire as well.  Buy this if you want some uplifting, intelligent content and ill beats.  Kazé is gonna' be big on the eastern side 
 Easily read in a few hours. It is so enjoyable. The characters are all likeable so you actually care to read on. There is humor. There is sadness but it isn't dwelled on for too long. I'm on Amazon looking up the sequels. This isn't heavy stuff but our own lives are full of heavy stuff so who needs that? :) I truly think this book would be of interest to young and old of all ages. 
 This book is phenomenally crafted, written with heart and sincerity.   I cannot recommend it strongly enough.  I learned about it through the recent New York Times "top fifty" recommended list, which included several authors I'd never heard of.   Frankly I was concerned that the list would have a couple of weak entries as happens.  "Independence Day" reaffirms my faith in reviews, polls, awards (Pulizer) and I'm glad to know that this is just the second installment of an iconic series.  To say the language "Independence Day" is poetic is an understatement.  Ford exercises control over both the vernacular and the estoric (on average I didn't know a word every five pages, but that's a good thing - the language is rich and sincere as is the engrossing narrative).  The word "Angstrom" appears in the book, perhaps a footnote to Updike, who knows?  Frank's sale to the Markhams is one of those protracted dramas, no, comedies, that weaves through like a Wagner liefmotif.   Wait, that simile strikes the wrong key, because the Markhams, as you get to know them, and you will, in richly parenthetical passages, represent everything you the reader and Frank dislike about pure unadulterated dumbasses.  Ok, I can go on and on about this book, it's subtleties, it's heartwrenching passages about love and divorce, but no, go read it 
 I have to say, growing up my marshmallow Cream always came out of a jar, so half way through the jar you'd have to put your hand inside and get it all sticky.  Now with this tub with a wide mouth, my hands aren't sticky.  PLUS because it has no carbs or sugar, I can eat more straight then I ever could... without having to worry as much either 
 I noticed this bag at lunch with a colleague. I immediately ordered. It arrived today and all I can say is it surpassed my expectations. I used to carry a small backpack when traveling but this is stylish and light enough to be used daily as a purse. Excellent exterior if you abuse your bag. Wipes off no problem. I ordered the extra small because I'm short but definitely would consider the small if you are taller than 5'2 
 If you want the best greatest hits collection from one of the master's of modern music, then look no further! This collection proudly displays some of the greatest tunes that were ever created alongside some of Mike's newer creations. Whether you like vintage MJ or his new music, this CD is a must-buy! Worth every penny, and guaranteed to bring back memories of the good ole days when MJ was getting the respect he still deserves. Long Live The King! 
 My husband of 1.5 years but my soul-mate of a lifetime passed away a year ago. I have read so many books of grief, but only Seven Choices helped me find hope. This book is an honest account of a difficult journey, and like all things that are done with honesty - it touches the core of who we are. 
 This books uses common sense to help people lose weight for life.  The plan makes it easy to make a few simple changes in your life, such as drinking more water, eating more vegetables and moving your body more often.  Once you start to feel empowered by your weight loss you'll want to adopt more "thin choices" into your life, helping you to reach your ultimate goal - a healthier lifestyle and even weight loss.  Jill also writes like she's having a one-on-one conversation with you so the book is a quick and enjoyable read, rather than another "boring diet book".  Thanks Jill 
 Outstanding. Superb pacing, plausible plot and a wonderfully flawed protagonist. Establishes this author in the same league as James Lee Burke, which is about the nicest thing I can say 
    As the previous reviewers have already stated, this story encompasses many plots; all of which are interesting and somehow tie to one another.  Callie Dunbrook, archeologist, out on a dig of a lifetime with a surprise addition to her team - her ex-husband/anthropologist, Jake Graystone.  Not only do Callie and Jake discover each other and the remnants of a lost settlement in the town of Woodsboro, MD, Callie has a bigger surprise in store for her - the discovery of a birth mother, father and brother that could possibly be more fact than fiction.  This story plays many different angles, but Nora ties them all together with some really lovable characters - Doug, Lana, little Ty, Suzanne, Jay, Vivian and Elliott as the parents and siblings as well as the team, and I especially like Digger!  Definitely a Nora book you won't want to miss - Birthright is a great find.     
 I had just finished reading Barry Hughart's Bridge of Birds last night and now I consider it my other favorite fantasy book right next to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. From page 1 to 248 this small but epic story of the strong and fearless Number 10 Ox and the drunken but nevertheless intelligent sage with a slight flaw in his character, Master Li, and their neverending quest searching for the great root of power in order to save the sick children of Ox's village of KuFu. And to fight The evil, twisted, immortal, power hungry Duke of Ch'in from keeping them on conquering their goal. I could'nt believe some of the things I was able to find in this induring fable: Action, lots of Adventure, Drama, quite a bit of comedy, Good v.s Evil, and no fantasy is complete without romance. Number 10 Ox I've come to find in the story is beautiful women magnet who has a fling with the lady lotus cloud who's greedy girl with a surprising secret. None of the romances however really compared to Ox's childhood friend called scented hairpin or mouse, who died in his village of fever who periodically visits Ox in the world of the dead.   Enough about the small stuff, there is a mystery that ties into Bridge of Birds that not only involves the sick children of Ox's village but something much more. The Duke of Ch'in stole something valuable from heaven that manages to upset everything in the balance including 3 faithless handmaidens that refuse to die.  It is up to Number 10 Ox and Master Li to find out what's afoot and fix it before everything around them and all of China falls apart.  This book was just a wonderful experience for me as it was for everybody else and I'm sure if you give it a try you won't regret it either. It was probably the only novel let alone fantasy that made me laugh and weep for the characters at the same time. love this book and is definetely my favorite fantasy next to The Lord of the Rings. I have a rare 1st edition hardcover copy of Bridge of Birds and it is now one of my most prized possessions on my shelf and glad of it to because it was such a beautiful book that I even feel like going back right now and starting it again. Maybe I'll do just that. When I grow up, get married and have kids, this is the book I'll read to my children for sure. Amazingly Beautiful  10 stars: **********  Enjoy 
 Managing Generation Y is a wonderful guide for managing the newest population in the work force.  I personally am a young Generation X'er and could relate with most of the topics discussed.  Many of my friends and family members are apart of this new cohort.  My experiences with this generation align perfectly with the descriptions in this book.  I highly recommend Managing Generation Y for managers, supervisors, friends, and family members in contact with Y'ers.  For members of Generation Y, this book will surely lead you down a path of self discovery 
 I loved this book. It is wonderful for beginners as well as others. It's written for the younger witchs out there, but I think  that is why I liked it so much. It was easy to read and even gave you assignments like homework. It is one of the only beginner books I have read that wasn't a drag. The only problem I had with it was some of the color & word meanings; they were not the same as any of my other books, so watch out for that 
 It was hard to read because the issues remain emotional.  The author gives one much to consider and many possible regrets 
 As the hostilities between Israel and the Arab world grind on with ever-greater loss and blame, it's not difficult to see how the perceptions of an outsider can often fathom both the broad and intimate gestures of a raging civil and cultural conflict. Most who do glimpse the relentless insanity rampant across the present-day Holy Land (with the additional complications of Lebanon) either recoil in horror or exploit its afflictions with cheap and incendiary journalism. Another suicide bombing in the news; today a restaurant, tomorrow a bus, next week...who knows?  In THE ATTACK, which viscerally details the prolonged detonation of just such a bombing, Yasmina Khadra has taken the brave (perhaps even brazen) approach of turning the wretchedness of generations-old enmity into very personalized fiction. He --- former Algerian army officer Mohammed Moulessehoul, who until recently used a female alias for protection --- leaps the cultural and geographical gap between North Africa and the Middle East with little awkwardness, compared to the immense challenges of accompanying and revealing the deep psychological trauma of his protagonist.  Dr. Amin Jaafari, an eminent surgeon, is among more than one million Arabs who, in real life, are full citizens of Israel. They rarely make news headlines, for they live in a peculiar kind of shadow land; never fully accepted by Jewish society, but accorded all the rights, privileges, resources and opportunities that their brothers and sisters on the other side of the cultural (and now very tangible) Wall both admire and envy --- and for which all too many are willing to die seemingly senseless deaths. Jaafari represents those who (like some dear friends of mine) have worked long and hard to attain skills that make them grudgingly indispensable to the Israeli infrastructure.  Jaafari comes across as a convincing composite of many such unsung heroes of this long war, who routinely stitch up Israeli and Arab alike, making no distinction between them when it comes to preserving life and doing no harm. His patients, even in extreme pain, don't always feel the same way, but he's used to that too.  By the time the scenes of yet another suicide attack at an Israeli restaurant begin to resolve into distinct visual and statistical elements of death, dying and survival, Khadra has set up the intense emotional context for an abrupt left turn that takes us into the deepest hell an individual of Jaafari's profession can imagine. His own Palestinian wife has been identified by police as the latest suicide bomber to randomly kill dozens of Jewish men, women and children.  From that point of numbing disbelief on, Jaafari becomes an intensely empathic study in the tortuous journey of human grief. And grief, as any good pastoral or religious counsellor can attest, is perversely messy. Despite its famous "stages" as defined by luminaries like Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, this particular form of spiritual agony follows no textbook ordering, no predictable degrees of intensity or duration. As difficult as it is to follow Jaafari's descent into a maelstrom of self-hatred, denial, anger, confusion, fear, apathy and myriad other shades of emotion that assail the human psyche in the wake of catastrophic loss, this is the real substance of Khadra's story and he handles it with brilliant pathos. (Translator John Cullen must have been tested to the limit in capturing the passion and color of Khadra's original French text.)  Khadra uses the distance of his outsider's eye with sensitivity and intelligence to portray the individual and collective personalities that ebb and flow around Jaafari's erratic quest for understanding, making THE ATTACK a surprisingly even-handed treatment. Both Arabs and Israelis are shown with their due proportion of graces and failings, and both are allowed to reflect on the evils of war and subjugation that have been the story of Israel and Palestine since their modern beginnings.  It's almost redundant to comment that there is no happy ending to this story. And Khadra has offered only the most tentative threads of hope, doling them out at painfully long intervals. Like so many clear-eyed observers, he appears to see few avenues to any long-term structural solution --- at least, not the kind imposed from without --- in this bleeding pocket of the Middle East.  But by focusing on one victimized individual, he has illuminated a few patches of the spiritual ground on which people of vastly different ideologies can (and do) still walk together. They are the ones, Arab and Israeli alike, who work side by side to pick up the pieces, even as bombs and bullets rain around them. Unfortunately, they don't make many news headlines, but Khadra has told their story with unforgettable power and immediacy.  Memo to George W. Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Ehud Olmert, Tony Blair, Stephen Harper and that whole gaggle of folks "at the top" who still seem to think there's a fast, simple, one-size-fits-all solution for a situation of gargantuan complexity and sadness: get a copy of THE ATTACK now, and set aside an evening to read it cover to cover. I'm not kidding!     --- Reviewed by Pauline Finch (paulinefinch@rogers.com), an Anglican seminary student who has traveled in Israel and Palestine.

 As a beginning alpine climber and a somewhat experienced rock climber, I found the anecdotes in this book to be inspirational.  If you live in the Pacific Northwest, you'll particularly appreciate the many local authors.   Even if you aren't a climber, it's great to read about women's experiences  in a very demanding sport

 I was already familiar with these philosophers after taking a course in philosophy, but the way in which these authors eluciate the ideas of these thinkers makes this a five-star book. In order of their greatness I'd have to place Nietzsche first, Scophenhauer second, Kant third, and while Hegel was profound, his worship of history was a little too much for me to swallow, so I place him last 
 Professor Randall's work seems to have created quite a stir, with a significant number of reviewers.  I think this is rightly so, since she has written a work on physics beyond the basic relativity and quantum physics reviews.  In Warped Passages, Ms Randall takes the reader through the basics before jumping into the more exotic world of small particle physics and ultimately into the venue of extra dimensions.    While the notion of extra dimensions is not a new one--it actually dates to the 19th century--in its present form and with its present potential for testability as the LHC in Europe approaches completion, it is an active field for theoretical physicists.  Superstring Theory and the author and her associate's Brane Theory are both poised to do-or-die when this new center tests for particles suggestive of other dimensions.  Dr. Randall does a superb job of bringing to the public attention the activities and contributions of female theoretical physicists.  She herself is an active role model for young women interested in the "hard" sciences.  One of the more interesting aspects of her style is her ability to bring more feminine illustrations to the description of physical findings and theory.  Things look like "Pringles" chips, smell like perfume, have a symmetry like a shirt, etc.  Her short stories at the beginning of each chapter use social interactions and human behaviors to illustrate some points as well.  I hardily approve of this, since it makes "women's interests" and abilities "acceptable" in a public domain.  The author doesn't stick to male interests for her descriptions, despite the fact that she apparently enjoys many of the activities that men do, mountain climbing for one.  We don't all have to think in terms of football.  If anything, her literary style and the lovely photograph of her make it apparent that "real women" can do and do do physics!    I also enjoyed her amusing approach to what many people tend to think of as a "serious" science.  She freely admits that scientists are sometimes as baffled by particle physics as the lay public is.  She also makes it apparent that scientists are people too, when she points out that one may chose to go to conferences simply because they're held "in such spectacular locations that they are just too good to miss (p.336)."  In fact, she makes the entire life style sound very inviting.  The author's practice of giving a thorough history of discoveries including the names of all workers on the theory is also commendable.  It gives credit where credit is due, and provides an accurate background for individual theories.  Much of the progress in physics is only apparent through this type of narration of individual contributions, many of which while they may have been at least partially in error, have provided leads for others to pursue.  If nothing else, her method of communication points out to the young person considering a career in physics that science is in fact a continuous process, and that even a "wrong" theory can be partially right or at least helpful. The thinking process gets lost if the only thing that counts is the end result.    Of the information in the book, I found the mis-match between the theories of relativity and of quantum physics more understandable than I have in the past, particularly the importance of the weakness of gravity.  The concept of sequestration of forces, especially of gravity, providing a "distance" component to the situation was very interesting, as was the notion of branes and the "bulk" area between them.  The discussion of the various possible models of the brane theory was also very lucid.  I am not a math/physics person really, but I felt the author was very competent in providing the reader with a sense of how a multidimensional universe might answer key questions.   The only thing I really didn't care for about the book, a small enough thing really, was the author's tendency to repeat individual words and phrases to the point that I simply had to put the book down or go crazy.    This is a book I will keep--something I almost never do--to re-read in an effort to solidify my understanding of modern physics.

 The book "Locomotion" is about how an 11 year old kid called Lonnie Collins Motion and his sister Lilly Motion lose their parents in a tremendous fire while they were going home from a family reunion they had gone to. Then as soon as the bodies are sent to the hospital in an ambulance then once the people in the hospital find where to call the grandama answers the phone and wonders why the hospital is calling the house they tell her that two adults have died in fire that had been started by someone else. Then after the kids grandma had found out she told the kids that their parents had died in a terrible fire. At first the kids felt bad but then afterwards they thought that whoever had done this to their would get caught sooner or later. This is what the book "Locomotion" is mainly about.  I think this book is a very interesting and at the same time sad because first the kids lose their parents in a fire but what is intersting is that the police does not know who started this fire and also they don't have any information about that person aswell. I definetly recomend this book to people who like reading books about kids and what has happened to them and their family throughout their lives. This is what I think about the book "Locomotion" 
 From the moment Snow Patrols song "Chasing Cars" played over the final minutes of the season finale from Grey's Anatomy, I have been hooked. Since I bought the album "Eyes Open" it has rarely left my media player of choice. From the heavy handed pop rock tracks like "Hands Open" to the bitter sweet "You Could be Happy" the album is a complete package of radio friendly hits. Though it has yet to be seen if it is completely thrashable.  It a rare treat for me indeed to be completely sold on a whole album instead of a couple of excellent singles. So needless to say, if you haven't already guessed it, I highly recommend this album 
 This is a beautifully made book. The quality of the construction, the maps and the illustrations, make it a treat to read. The story, of a man who re-discovers some islands (the Auroras) between The Falkland Is and the South Georgia Is is secondary. The first part, about the ideas of going there, and the second, the voyage, are not really all that compelling, but the third and fourth, dealing with the attempt by Hippolyte to prove the truth of his story, and Marie's disbelief, are more like a real novel. If you get a chance to buy this, do so. And savour it 
 Like many of the books in this series, this is a great supplement if you are taking a history class.  If you are just interested in history and want to hit the highlights--this book is also worthwhile.  It is arranged well, is easy to read, and priced very reasonably.  I liked to use this to supplement my notes from lectures while I was in college.  In addition to organization, you may find this book helpful for the bibliography that follows each section to help with further research 
 A great book.  Perfect for a day by the beachside or a serious moment to reflect back on your roots 
 This cd is packed with timeless music. Rollins' performance on this classic from 1957 not only solidified him as one of the greatest tenors of his generation, but, along with all of the other material from his illustrious fifty plus year career, has stood the test of time to make him one of the all-time greatest musicians regardless of style. Backed by a duo of legends in bassist Ray Brown and drummer Shelly Manne, Rollins cooks from beginning to end. He is in prime form, still a relativly unknown tenor when this album came out, he plays like a man ahead of his years. Sonny's tone is hard, percussive, rasping, and even playful, a full spectrum of colors and moods. What makes this a truly great album is that every single note Rollins plays is a highlight. His soloing stands up to repeated listening and rewards the effort with something new each time through. Manne and Brown contribute fantastic performances of their own, matching Rollins by producing phenominal solos of their own. Even the usually aggravating practice of  sticking alternate takes behind the originals hardly makes a difference. Rollins, Manne, and Brown are so brimming with ideas, the longer alternates offer the listener just that much more of a good thing. This is one of those albums that needs to be in every jazz collection, even the cover photo is a classic. Buy this cd if you do not already own it, you will not be dissapointed 
 This edition is wonderful!!  It lists absolutely everything you could possibly eat at home and at restaurants.  A great way of becoming aware of what you are eating each day 
 This is the most eagerly discussed book in my Philosophy in Literature class, because it raises questions of human identity, because it displays the complexity of race and culture, and because it is so very beautiful. It is an American masterpiece, standing beside and even above Bellow's "The Adventures of Augie March." 
 Excellent book! My children and I both love it. Well written, especially since the topic is sometimes difficult to explain to young children.  Illustrations are top-notch.  An EXTREMELY necessary subject for children to learn about and understand 
 "I know where I'm going,  I know who's going with me,"  A young lady (Windy Hiller) pretty much knows what she wants in life.  On her way to her wedding on a remote Scottish island she is delayed long enough to experience a different way of life and a reality that she was never exposed to. Here she finds different values and the difference between real nobility and the early version of plastic money. She is overwhelmed by her new discovery and the man (Roger Livesey) who introduced her to it. Now she must desperately escape or be lost forever in this different world.  I was surprised to find that a young girl in the movie was Petula Clark.  There are advantages to having a movie with a story that is not based on a book. You can enjoy the story for what it is and not have to compare. However this may make a good play. In the Criterion extras you will find speculation on the pro's and con's of remaking the movie.  This film is impressive on its own but the Criterion treatment adds many fascinating dimensions that make you have to re-watch the film just to se the parts that you missed while paying attention though the plotline and scenery.  There is a commentary track that covers the entire film. A behind the scenes stills that even has a commentary. Home movies add to the information about the designers of the story and producers. There is a section from "The edge of the World." A great insight and a different way off looking at the story are found in "I Know Where I'm Going! Revisited" a 30 minute making of. The location photo essay allows you to see if the color is what you imagined (maybe better). 
 Adorable is the only word for this book. Barrico so skillfully evokes the the sea it's as if one could hear it sighing between the pages, emitting a salty aroma. In Barrico's world the sea is a source of horror, power, healing and mystery.  In short, the sea is rather like life and becomes a sort of reflecting board for the various ailments of his cast of delightful but unwell characters who congregate in a spooky inn;  wise little children, invalids, tortured artists and thwarted lovers.  His language is charming - fluid and musical, but the structure loose at best. The book exists in some hinterland between potery,  song lyrics and the novella. Not that this reader minds because the enjoyment to be had here is in the pure atmosphere and magic of the language  -  it's repetitious, fragmented, unhinged, open ended, filled with ellipses and sighed little fancies. And all that shining through the translation from Italian. When not engaged in his enjoyable but indulgent linuistic tangents, Barrico can write a killer scene - from the utterly depraved to the heartbreakingly erotic. And somehow,  after his own minimally plotted and fanciful fashion Barrico worms his way to the heart of things.  In his own words: "It's hard to believe, but that's the way it is 
 In my opinion, one of the greatest athletes to come along post-1970s (that generation had Ali, Wilt, Alcindor, Hank Aaron, Jenner, Hamill, Franco Harris, Evelyn Ashford, Archie Griffin, Bjorn Borg, George McGinnis ... some of the biggest names in sport!).  Fast. Big. Strong. (Did I mention Fast? Big? and Strong?)  This dude had all the physical gifts and the "can do" mentality of a super hero come to life!!!  Never seen anyone like him and probably will never again.  It's ironic that this two-sport All-Star, seeminly indestructible had his career hobbled to a stutter that fateful Jan. 1991 day on a football field.  This book gives you the inside on how a young Bo Jackson (aggressive and physically awesome even as a young kid) came all the way from Bessemer, Alabama, rose through elite football and baseball ranks to become the late-1980s megastud on the same dais of Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky before his injury.  It's an interesting tale with behind the scenes looks at how teammates and competitors in both the NFL and MLB interacted with him -- or should I saw competed in awe -- how Jackson came to hate Steinbrenner and how his family kept and continues to keep him grounded.  Here you had an athlete with ...  Carl Lewis' speed Herschel Walker's size Reggie White/Ray Lewis strength Jim Brown's physical toughness Barry Sanders' explosiveness  ... and a "No feat too great or too tall" mentality ALL HIS OWN.  Bo was a champion who's athletic career was cut short too soon, leaving fans to always ponder "what if".  This book celebrates memories and reflections on "What was. 
 This book was short, easy to read, and was so informative and uplifting! What a help! The info put me on the right track for getting God's gift (my body & mind) back into shape 
 This is my favorite DVD.  I had seen this movie when it first came out and I remembered how I felt watching it.  Loved Olivia Newton John & her duets & dancing.  The cartoons are cute too 
 Michener's compilation of short stories arrayed around the dreamer in all of us who lust over south seas lore, whether we have lived there or perhaps never even visited. These are stories rich in visual majesty, and the human ambition, drive, and misadventure, which the lucky few of us have actually lived 
 I miss my whole house water filter now that I'm renting.  But the PUR works very well.  It was a little bit of a challenge getting the filter onto the faucet -- especially if you have big fingers.  Careful not to strip the threads or you'll be buying a new faucet.  Tighten as much as you can with your fingers and use plyers for the rest.  The water tastes great, and now that I have to make ice with trays again, even the ice pops out easier than using regular water.  My imagination?  I still would like to send the water out someday to get it tested to see if this thing works like the water tastes -- says the "prove it to me" side 
 The new self titled effort from 18V is exactly that, new. In No way shape or form is any of the band that recorded 'Until the Ink Runs out' represented on this, as the band has decided gone more in a rock direction. While they have attempted this on 'Vanity' with "I don't Mind" and went more Boldly with 'Obsession', I feel here they have definetly accomplished what they set out to make, a great rock and roll record. Lots of solid songs more dedicated than on 'Obsession', which in comparison seemed like more of a failed attempt to achieve this. There really isn't a bad song on this cd. And it's very well produced, sounds very sonically tight. However, if you've stuck with the band this long, you may be extremely dissapointed with this release, after all there is basically no hardcore elements on this, and the metal isn't really meant to heavy at all. But as a fan that has watched the band progress, you really can't be too suprised that they've gone in this direction. With each release this band has changed, and you as a fan have to ask yourself if you can put aside the fact that they made some death-metalled-grind-hardcore, you'll find that this really is one of the best rock records out this year, better than the Lost Prophets cd, and more in league with Velvet Revolver and such. I give it a 4 
 My granddaughter is almost 3 and has been playing with this playset everyday for the past 2 weeks. She becomes totally engaged with her dolls and the playset. We haven't had any problems with it coming apart; don't know if were are one of the lucky ones. I would highly recommend this for anyone with a child with a great imagination 
 If you love Miles, not for just for his tradional stuff and not just for his later stuff, but for everything that the master created, this is a must listen. It really is an amazing example of a near perfect bridge between rock and jazz idioms. The first track, Stuff, is outstanding.  I have listened to it a hundred thousand times and still find something new every time I play it.  It breaks new ground, led by Tony Williams who seems to play without boundaries, changing times and sycopation aggresively but with direction and intelligence. If you like this particular Miles line-up, this one is a MUST.  Every musician, of course is outstanding and the beats are infectious. I find it much more interesting than In A Silent Way. It is a real gem 
 Very easy to use. My four year old knows how to use it. He takes it with him on long trips. The rechargeble battery is a life saver.I would recommend this product to a friend 
 In the beginning, after a two page introduction (to this day, the most innovative and striking introduction or prologue I've read), we find the main character, Finnegan, sitting on a sidewalk with a man, a millionaire. Neither character remembers how they came to be there, nor what their names are. The reader is being pulled in through fascinating, occasionally funny dialog, and an economy of description, no doubt inspired by the literary work of James Joyce himself, like the name of the main character, Finnegan. At the same time, Lafferty works succesfully and ever so subtly at creating a certain mood, a feeling of something being wrong. Soon, Finnegan ends up on a voyage around the seas of the earth.  Raphael Aloysius Lafferty, one of the few writers whose books have made Arthur C. Clarke laugh out loud (according to Clarke himself), invites the reader onto the voyage as Finnegan. The destination: reality, or a better dream? And yes, there's humor, too, the zany, Laffertian kind you never get tired of, and the kind that prevents the voyage from becoming too dark to enjoy.   Lafferty writes in the prologue: "Put the nightmare together. If you do not wake up screaming, you have not put it together well." The advice is useful enough for the reader stumbling along the whirlwinds of metaphor Lafferty conjures up to shake Finnegan, him, awake. In addition, it hints at Lafferty's view of reading and interpretation: you either get it, or you don't. To Lafferty, there's no "fruitful misunderstanding"; nor is there to Lafferty, as there is to no logical thinker, "purposive accident", which, as Lafferty writes in one of his short stories, is the logical continuation of the former.  The Devil Is Dead is R. A. Lafferty's sixth novel, as far as the order of publication goes. It was first published in 1971, and remains underappreciated, as well as unique in literature.  The Wildside Press edition (paperback or hardcover) is, as always, worth the price, and infinitely superior to decades old pocket book editions (unlike those old paperbacks, the Wildside Press paperbacks, although of varying sizes, are always pretty big, there's always lots of space around the image area, the pages are of superior quality and open well, the backs simply won't wrinkle, and so on).  PS. For some reason, in all editions of The Devil Is Dead there is a two-page Interglossia missing from between the chapters 10 and 11 ("--Absalom Stein, Notes on the Finnegan Cycle"... Absalom Stein was one of the main characters in Archipelago (as was Finnegan), a book which Lafferty wrote before The Devil Is Dead, but which was published years later), also missing is the final chapter. These were later published in "How Many Miles to Babylon?" and in "Episodes of the Argo", both books now unavailable even used. If you e-mail me, I will send you the Interglossia and the last chapter through e-mail 
 This is the second pair of these sandals I have bought for my kid. They are great, he can wear them with shorts or jeans and he is able to run with them 100% safe.  The material is great and soft and the first pair still looks new even after months of use. I had to buy a new pair because his feet grew. 
 excellent stuff. what can i say about it to sell this to you. its southpark. its hillarious, its politically incorrect, it rocks. buy it, buy it now. captain chaos rules. in fact why are you even reading a review - your wasting time, it could be in the post to you right this minute... 
 Cuts like a Samurai blade quality, and doesn't need to steel as frequent as the Henckels/ Wusthof knives. It has excellent weight for a medium sized hand. However, the handles get quite slippery when wet, so keep your hands clean and dry while using this knife for safety. Also, if you plan on saving money on getting a cheaper steel, DON'T, because this Global blade is much harder than the Henckels/Wusthof blades; a qood quality Diamond coated or ceramic steel is a must, or if you really like the steel design, get the Global steel which can cost quite a bit. Overall, this is a good quality knife with proper care and attention needed, just like a Samurai would do to get use to his sword 
 This is some good electronic music, along with Chemical Brothers and Aphex Twin (Im just a n00b in electronic, although I want to get into it because the genre rules).  This is a lot better than all the ____ on the radio and what people call techno (i hate the usual mass techno, like We like to party, that really stupid and annoying song on the Six flags commercial).    My only real reccomendation is to listen to the samples.  Slim's music is catchy and cool, but it's not for everybody.  DO some resarch, because I know music is not cheap these days.  Check it out now.  The cd is not always listenable through the whole thing, it depends on the mood you are in, but hey, it's good.  The ______ oinlt thing would be good would be some rap, along with an instrumental version.  For no reason, Dr. Dre also did this with his 2001 record.  IF you can't figure out what I am saying, you are an idiot.   This is one of my first reviews I did without trying to be sarcastic and sturpid.  ____, it works so much better.  Un less your reviewing Paris Hilton ____ 
 As with many institutions, the FDA servers a perceived needed purpose. This book is a history of why the agency was needed and its design. It is filled with horror stories and how the FDA came to the rescue. Some of these stories even scared me as I recognized the products and or brands. The chapter "Capitalism in Crisis" reads more like a political statement against capitalism than a "FDA is out to help" statement. What they do not say is that the FDA is the Government to the point that they can carry guns and badges. Now with the fast pace of drugs and device invention the FDA is needed more than ever. The other side of the coin is that thy have become an unwatched agency that can and does set its own rules to how a business can do their job down to describing the data field that are to be stored in their computer. Their regulations read like a phone book of conflicting statements (with no recourse). And you can be shut down on a whim if you do not follow the regulations as interpreted by their agent as they are the law.  The book contains an excellent set of notes. They are divided in to chapters. And there is a fair index. For people that like pictures there are eight pages of monochrome photographs. The author has written several articles on medicine for various periodicals.  
 In general, Sterlings' books are great. They have a coherent plot and a lot of interesting and inventive details (e.g. post-apocalyptic futuristic customs and technology). I find it difficult, however, to understand the motives and drives of a lot of the characters. Occasionally I wonder why they bother to do what they do. Maybe it's just me. Read it -- time well wasted 
 This new expanded edition to Couldn't Stand the Weather includes 5 previously unreleased bonus tracks including a really good version of Come On (Pt.3), and Give Me Back My Wig. This 1984 follow up album to Texas Flood really proved how good Stevie Ray Vaughan really was. This is filled with more experimental blues songs including The Things (That) I Used To Do, and Honey Bee. Their is also a really good long studio version of Voodoo Chile(slight return) that is real amazing "truely great"!!!! Couldn't Stand the Weather would reach #31 on the Billboard pop charts and by the end of the year it was certified GOLD, and today it went double platinum. Vaughan's guitar playing is really a step up from his previously released album Texas Flood....This is one of Vaughan's best!! 
 I'm of the belief one should never pass up the chance to read anything Mr. Robinson publishes. His prose is like the crispest poetry, but without poetry's pretentiousness.  This essay, like his fiction, presents theories without shying away from the difficult task of giving the reasons why they're worth considering -- even when it means explaining concepts from paleontology, climatoly, and other similarly unglamorous sciences.  It is an engaging read that will help those eagerly awaiting "Fifty Degrees Below" bide their time until that novel's release while also helping to understand the author's motivation and thought process.    Even if you've avoided Mr. Robinson's works because you're put off by books that get called 'Hard Sci-Fi' in reviews, this essay is a perfect example of what sets his writing apart.  Frankly, aside Robert A. Heinlein, I've been bored to tears by most writers who pick up that tag.  Mr. Robinson, like Mr. Heinlein, has always held my interest because he has a strong moral voice and his fiction makes an argument that is organic to whatever story he is telling.  Anwering the question, why another trilogy?, Mr. Robinson writes: "Some stories just need lots of pages to tell right. I wanted to describe what such the experience of abrupt climate change would feel like, from the point of view of a number of individuals. I wanted also to describe how science works in the real world, today, and how it relates to the worlds of power politics, capital, and daily life. I wanted to explore some ideas about how certain Buddhist concepts might apply to the situation, and help us think our way through it. Because in the end this environmental crisis, and the possibility of catastrophic abrupt climate change, is being brought on because of the way we live now; and the way we live is formed by the values we share."  The connection he points to between cultural values and their impact on individual lives as well as on the world as a whole, is intensely compelling; it is his ability to weave scientific and moral investigation into an entertaining dramatic structure that makes him, I believe, one of the most important writers of end of the last century and the beginning of this one.

 The world of security lurched to insecurity in Zweig's lifetime.  In the secure form there were insurance schemes for every eventuality.  People believed they were barricaded against fate.    The author's father, a Moravian, had been a careful capitalist, the owner of a weaving establishment.  He clung to a private anonymous mode of existence.  Zweig's mother was a Brettauer, a member of an international banking family.  The desire to be of a good family was one of the secret desires of Jewish life.  There was a tendancy there to elevate the intellectual to the highest class.  The drive toward cultural ideals was particularly passionate in Vienna.  Love of art was a communal duty in Vienna.    Schooling to the author was wearisome and boring.  The Viennese coffee houses provided intellectual stimulation where traditional education in the gymnasium did not.  The Viennese had intellectual mobility and international orientation.  All the new painters, the poets, and the musicians were young.    In middle class families where early marriage was not permitted, there was inner disharmony.  Theodor Herzl was the feuilleton editor of the Neue Freie Presse.  When the author moved from Vienna to Berlin, Berlin was just becoming a world-class city.  There was a Prussian sense of orderliness.    In subsequent sections of the book Zweig covers his experiences in Brussels and Paris.  Paris stood for a freedom of existence.  The inheritance of the revolution was still present.  Although a German poet, Paris calls to mind Rilke.  Shy and retiring, he seemed most receptive in Paris.  Rilke and Zweig went together to see the grave of Andre Chenier.  At age twenty-six Zweig was not bold enough to start a novel, and people he had met inspired in him inpired high standards, hindering his productivity.  Two different early plays were not put on for reason of the death of actors.  Zweig became hesitant.    Walter Rathenau suggested to Zweig that he go to India.  The author was shocked to see all the emaciated bodies there.  He saw India as an admonition that disaster loomed.  Next the author traveled to America where he experienced extreme solitude since he knew so few people.  He hit upon the rather good idea of pretending to be a job applicant and was struck by all of the opportunities available.    Friendships with Freud, Verhaeren, and Romain Rolland were terribly important to Zweig.  Even at the time of World War I Zweig was able to take an international view of things.  By 1939 it was known that war was not romantic, it was barbaric.    After World War I Austria was a mere shadow of the imperial monarchy.  There was famine.  Hard money, currency, disappeared, as it was hoarded.  Austria, pillaged and desperate, escaped disintegration.  The years 1919, 1920, 1921 were the hardest.  Gewrman inflation ended in 1924.  The years 1924 to 1933 were comparatively peaceful.    The author spent a fortnight in Soviet Russia.  Tolstoy's grave was magnificent.  When Salzberg became the summer artistic capital, Zweig found himself in the heart of Europe.  He shared the fate of the Mann brothers, Werfel, Freud, and Einstein of having his work banned after the Nazis seized power.  Zweig spent 1934 to 1940 in England.  He led there an anonymous life.  Stefan Zweig and Elizabeth Zweig died in Brazil in 1942.                 
 The only lisp I ever knew was scheme and I'd long meant to dig into Common Lisp, so I finally got around to it. I am not sorry that this book was my introduction. Let me start off by saying that there are two kind of people in the world - the kind that like to read a tech book straight through and then start doing and the kind of people that like to do while reading the book (ok, so maybe there's a few more kinds of people...). I am of the first sort and the organization of this book was perfect - I don't know that I've read a book better suited to the way I like to learn a language. It is targetted to an experienced programmer, but one w/out any experience in LISP. I think it'd be a tough book for a complete newcomer to programming to start working with.  The book is divided into 2 sections, the first (slightly more than half) is the language reference and the second is the practical part. The language part was the perfect model for me, it works you from basic to advanced. Beginning from the very beginning it gives you suggestions on the environment in which to work with LISP and where and what would be good to install. It moves to through all the basics, syntax, functions, variables then spends a little bit of time on macros (a very key and subtle feature), moves onto numbers and strings, collections and lists (spends some time really covering these to give a true understanding), and then pushes on to I/O, OO in LISP and then a good look at FORMAT, exception handling and loops.  These were not cursory overviews of language features, but were in depth coverage. As such, it is inevitable that in trying to show you how things work they need to use some more advanced constructs that they have not yet covered. They, however, tell you that you don't know about this feature yet and explain just enough about what it's doing that it's no impediment to understanding the example. They are very thorough and concious when this happens. The alternative, confining yourself to only what you've covered traps many writers into showing only trivial examples that are unable fully display particular concepts.  There are a couple practical examples in this first section that demonstrate ideas covered up to that point. The examples themselves are excellent, showing how programs are built up and refactored. It is a really clear view of the expressiveness that LISP allows.  The second half of the book is dedicated to putting things together in a diverse set of projects. The first, kind of standalone is the Spam Filter. The rest are parts of the elements needed to create a streaming music library from parsing binary files, extended to reading ID3 tags of mp3's, to working with AllegroServe (a lisp web server), you build a database of music, learn how to build a shoutcast server and tie it all together with an online mp3 browser.  There's a good amount of coverage on working with the web, generating html and the like. These practical topics are not the lightweight fairly trivial examples that you most often see in books, these are in depth and very diverse examples of what you can do with LISP. To me this is the advantage the book gets by its organization, by first letting you learn all the basics of the language, they can show you how a real program is developed using the full expressiveness of LISP.   I gave this book five stars because of the great way it was organized, the in depth coverage of it's features and it's friendly and readable writing style. It did have some flaws, sometimes it didn't give examples on some topics that might have been more easily explained through a little show and tell, a couple minor typos caused a little bit of confusion. But these are minor nits that don't detract from the overall goodness of the book. If you are interested in learning LISP, I can whole heartedly recommend this book 
 As I listened to this album for the first time tears came to my eyes. Milton's music, lyrics & voice paints the colorful picture of Brasil I remember and know.  If you are really a lover of Brazilian music and of jazz this is a definite MUST HAVE 
 Befitting his reputation, Hamel provides some powerful catalysts for one's gray matter. Unfortunately, several revolutionaly firms he cites have, since his publication date, placed highly among the leading corrupt wealth destroyers in a corruption plagued market crash. Fortunately, much of what Hamel says remains sound. Especially with illumination from spectacular failures at hand, readers can position themselves well to exploit the innovation ideas while avoiding some bold and foolish mistakes committed in the name of innovation. Read, pan for the gold among the rubble, think about the gold, and adjust your personal model about what a business does 
 When you have every Dylan record put out, plus over a hundred bootlegs, it's kind of hard to pick a favorite. It's easier, I think to pick out your top ten, or maybe fifteen faves. This record certainly makes the cut. The lyrics delve deep into Tarot, Christianity and Astrology even as they harken back to the psychedelic style of "Blonde on Blonde." I have to admit that I didn't like this record when I first heard it so long ago. Those Motown girl singers are not a bit like Emmylou Harris. who I so easily accepted on "Desire." However, after listening to this record several times over the years, it's kind of grown on me. I find myself playing it quite often now. So do my girlfriends, well my Dylan loving girlfriends who are participating in this review writing exercise. They like "Street Legal" and I think  you will too. If like me, you didn't like it at first, come back to it, give it a try. I think you'll change your mind 
 A very well written, well thought out book.  This is probably one of the most difficult decisions I will have to make and reading through this book has really helped me to sort out my thoughts and feelings.  It gives you permission to have a difficult time, to be comfortable with the complexity of feelings and to help you to make a choice that is right for you, whatever that choice might be.  
 I have loved everything that Rebecca York has written in her "Moon series" and althought this is not my favorite book in this series ......it is still an excellent, well written love story with a bit of suspense thrown in. A++ 
 It is a good movie for young elementary students.  It was very good 
 The movie deals with an evil man known as Rebi Ra, who has summoned demons to help him conquer the world and destroy Shinjuku, a part of Tokyo with and earthquake. Ten years later, the city is a demon-haunted wilderness when Rebai attacks the World President 
 I do not know Russian. I cannot comment on whether or not Elaine Feinstein has captured or missed completely the supposedly brilliant aural qualities of the original verse.  What I can say is that reading these poems I have a sense of true poetry. There is a depth of feeling and a passion, a soul being revealed in depth, a life in its sufferings and straining for beauty.  Perhaps more words are irrelevant, and I shall just give a few excerpts from the book.   From ' I know the truth'  'The wind is level now, the earth is wet with dew, the storm of stars in the sky will turn to quiet, And soon all of us will sleep under the earth,we who never let each other sleep above it. '   From 'What is this gypsy passion for separation'  'that no one turning over our letters has  yet understood how completely and  how deeply faithless we are, which is  to say: how true we are to ourselves.'  From ' You loved me'   You loved me. And your lies had their own probity. There was truth in every falsehood  Your love went far beyond any possible boundary   as no one else's could.  Your love seemed to last even longer  than time itself. Now you wave your hand- and suddenly your   love for me is over! That is the truth in five words." 
 "We live in the flicker."  Need I say any more?  As much meaning as can be packed into just over 100 pages.  Best read in a quiet place with a good bottle of red wine at your side.  Not for the weak of mind or heart. Be prepared to discover.  
 I got the fortune of watching this movie when it was reraned on Showtime. I never liked anything I seen that had Nicolas Cage, but watching this movie made me change my mind about the guy. This movie is excellent from beginning to end. Another solid 1990s love story, where wins and loss of lottery doesn't change a person's attitude 
 Awesome read! During the spring 2002 college semester I attended a film class where we, the students, had the opportunity to study Alfred Hitchcock the whole semester length. This was one of the books my teacher had us use as a resource book for our reports for the class. The book is well written and in depth. It covers it's bases through different perspectives/aspects of Hitchcock's life from birth to death. It's a good solid read for anyone. As Hitchcock would probably love to hear -- it's torture to give up such a good book 
 Coming back from the problems Kit and Nita encountered on their 'sabbatical' in the last volume, the two discover that problems have been brewing on Earth.  And not just locally.  The universe is expanding at an increased rate, dark matter is appearing all over space, and the rules and workings of wizardry are failing.  In very little time the older wizard's of the universe have been badly weakened, and not Nita and Kit find themselves as senior wizards of a world that is looking entropy right in the face.  Dairine and her alien visitors are also part of this.  In fact, all the wizards we've met and Ponch the wonder dog are on the front lines as they search for a new anomaly.  Somewhere a new version of the Lone Power is coming into existence.  This time without the character defects of the old one.  And all the crises of the universe are the old version's fight to prevent the realization of new.  Dairine returns to the computer world of her first trial, and Ponch leads another team on a search for the answer.  What they find stuns them.  Diane Duane pulls out all the stops as the young wizards battle to turn a world where the Lone Power had already won.  This is a complex story that places its emphasis on oppressive societies and the importance of independent thought.  Duane has a talent for dealing with these issues in such a fashion that readers don't feel that they are the recipient of lectures.  As imaginary as the adventures of Kit, Nita, and Dairine are, they live through the events in very realistic fashion.  This book is one of the best in the series, and it's effect on future books will take a while to work out.  Several story arcs come to an abrupt end in 'Wizards at War,' but others have yet to resolve.  I have to admit I would like to see a book or two where the young wizards really do get an opportunity to simply heal and have some less overwhelming adventures.  In any case, I'm looking forward to the next volume

 This is a great book for any guitar player who wants to go beyond the standard chord catalog and delve into the more advanced area of harmony and how chords fit together.  There are a lot of useful hints and tips in here, primarily for jazz players, but any player can benefit from what Ted has to say.  He explains some of the more confusing topics of music (e.g. chord substitution and reharmonizing chord progressions) in a clear and concise manner.  It takes some time to get used to the chord diagrams, which were done by hand, and much of this book appears to have been typed on a manual typewriter, complete with Ted's handwritten notes.  I would hope that eventually the publisher would consider typesetting it and producing the chord diagrams in some other fashion--but then, it would probably lose a lot of its charm; it'd be like removing the pictures of barefoot hippie Ted playing in the garden surrounded by his guitars.  This book will require a certain amount of experience with the guitar, and a lot of patience, but it's the perfect book for someone who has graduated from "Here's a C, here's a G, here's an F#m7" and is ready for a challenge 
 I just finished reading Book Doctor.  It's an amazing novel, both funny and touching, and I already miss all the main characters and wish I knew what the next few years would be like for them.  If they weren't just part of this author's wonderful imagination, I'd figure out how to meet them, because I know I could be friends with them---especially Arlette Rosen, the book doctor, because she has a great sense of humor and is open to making changes in her life and also Harbinger Singh, because he has a very adventurous spirit----and I would love going out for coffee with them or taking in a movie and dinner and talking about what's really going on in their lives.  Esther Cohen's characters are so compelling, so believable and charming, you just don't want the book to end. 
 Groome has some very practical ideas which can easily be implemented in the classroom, I have found, without too much effort.  An excellent book with some limitations, it has helped me in my Masters of Religious Education to acquire a new approach and has synergistically taught me that the purpose of education is to teach the student to think and evaluate all things, being equipped to come to better conclusions, the better the process of thinking works in the individual.  I highly recommend the work 
 Boyle shows rather than tells, like all good writers should. He takes it a few steps further by providing a morality play with a number of interesting juxtapositions. Some are obvious, others are more nuanced. One of the more nuanced ironies is that Delaney is a nature writer who lives in what becomes a walled-in community that is built in area where houses should never have been built (the area that is prone to natural disasters such a wildfires and mudslides). The immigrants by contrast are in direct contact with nature. When natural disaster occurs, the immigrants are able to adjust better then the nature writer. Boyle's writing is full of these subtle gems, which help the book transcend the story 
 From the moment I read the first page, I have loved this novel. I have read it several times and each time the characters come to life and I find myself caring about them. Hall has to deal with so many issues--least of all, is Ruth the woman he truly loves or should he be with the evangelist? Arthur-the gay gospel singer who sometimes would just as well have a drink or a man than sing the gospel, but who sang it so well when he chose to. Then there are the complex lives of their friends and parents that seem so real and yet so tragic. Baldwin created a masterpiece 
 Elleston Trevor honored me with a rare author's proof and I have a particularly soft spot for this Q caper, not least because it demonstrates his nom-de-plume Adam Hall's  absolute determination to give readers full value, starting with each story sending Q down an even more suicidal hole than the one before.   Of all the adventures, 'Solitaire' is the one that most resoundingly drives home a lesson taught by 9/11, namely that you can wire and bureaucratise your spook setup all you like, but it counts for naught unless you have the requisite 'ferrets' working the dark side and able to deliver the right intelligence for the automatons to crunch.  This is an assignment Q wants - badly. He owes a man a death and he'll get it.  Mission: thwart a terrorist group, for which (as so often) Q needs to be drawn into the opposition's den.  The 9/11 connection takes the form of Quiller aboard a jetliner with only seconds to defuse a bomb.  My opinion is neither here nor there: everything this spymaster poet delivered was exquisite and brutal and this is one of his best.  With book trade heros like Otto Penzler doing their thing, we'll perhaps see Hall recognized for the master he is, and a new generation of readers flock to the Quilliad.  Full marks to Amazon's editors of these reviews to permit the link to the fine homage page to Trevor's work.   Anyone who enjoys top-rate thrillers and hasn't yet discovered Quiller is in for a major treat.     
 I LOVE this product. It is reasonably priced when one considers each packet can be reconstituted to equal one cup of broth. The broth is organic with a rich flavor of chicken( I also use the beef broth & it is delicious as well) but my favorite feature is one may store the equivalent of 6 cans of broth in less space than one can takes up. A definite 5 stars from me. "Savory Choice" broth concentrates are the best!!!! 
 To Velikovsky goes the dubious honour of being one of the most flamed authors of popular science literature in modern history. Not half of these flamers deserved their turn. While it is highly unlikely, particularly in hindsight, that Venus several millennia ago was a comet that was sent a-drift in the inner solar system, I believe Velikovsky's Venus theory has been used chiefly as scapegoat.   What makes up the book's core and focus is the element of science and validity in ancient myth. Any modern reader who picks up the Bible and leafs to Exodus will wonder about the events being described there. If it was not a series of actual divine intervention, than what was it? The account is too similar in detail with the symptoms of a great natural disaster to be wholly fabricated.   More importantly: what caused the fairly obvious similarities in myths from all over the world? A language-like trade and distribution? Are their rough contents features of human subconsciousness common to us all? Nobody has the answer. In fact many still stubbornly persist there is no science here at all: myths are made-up stories and wishful thinking.   Velikovsky's "error" was drawing his major conclusions from myth and folklore alone. There was no geological or astronomical evidence to back him up. Instead, he called for these sciences to adapt to his theories. Nevertheless, his method had a logic and clarity that was rudely ripped aside by critics, who wanted to put him on display and eliminate another threat to mainstream scientific thought.   And thus leaving the actual question unchallenged: where is the science and the truth in myth and folklore 
 I thought that this movie should have been a little longer. Actually I wished that it had been a little longer.    This movie marks more of the heroic deeds done by African Americans that went unmarked and ignored by  this "Glorious Country".    This movie takes place after slavery  had officially  "ended". Many, African Americans desired to head  out west to find better lives in the open country.     But, they were often  harrassed, beaten, and, sometimes, killed along the trail by racist whites.  Many had no ideal or sense of direction how to get where they wanted to go.  There were African American "wagon masters" that knew the  countryside well and often lead fellow African Americans to their  destination regardless of the  possible death that lie ahead. Native  Americans proved to be very important allies in the struggle.   Excellent  job by Sidney Poitier, Harry Belafonte, and Ruby Dee. Great job on the  video and audio transfer for a movie that hit the big screen in 1971.   I  also liked the menu audio which was done in dolby digital 5.1. However, the  soundtrack for the movie is 2 channel dolby didgital. But, it is ample and  satisfying.   If you are a fan of African American westerns and or cinema,  then this is a good movie to sit down and enjoy on a sunday evening 
 Even if i've loved their last album more than the previous two, this has been a good start for these singers. Obviously, while you're listening to these musical arrangements you can easily guess the period when the album has been released. But considering what kind of disks we found currently on the shelfs of the music stores, i truly can't say that Changing Faces deserves some of the very negative reviews that i've read here. I disagree about every comment not strictly related to the artistic contents, because i think that this is the main problem of the modern music low quality. We often forget that the best judge for music are our ears, not our eyes.. 
 We tried several other phones, including another Uniden, and were disappointed with quality and performance.  The other Uniden (sorry, I don't remember the model #) worked OK, but had static in a couple of rooms in our house, which isn't huge (2000 square feet).  This phone, on the other hand, has exceeded our expectations and we are absolutely thrilled.  Best phone we've ever owned.  It's obviously well thought out, and it has a few features that we really enjoy (besides the fact that it has worked flawlessly out of the box).  Caller ID and voice mail can be accessed from any phone, so you don't have to go to the main unit to get your voice mail messages.    Anyway, highly recommended, and a great deal for four phones for the price 
 I bought this to add to my collection of ' Classics of Western Spirituality '.  E. Allison Peers would be my only other choice for St. Teresa 
 Darrow takes the reader through some of his most famous cases and explains the philosophy with which he approached his career and the law in general. Any reader interested in the history of the period should find his accounts fascinating: Eugene Debs, John P. Altgeld, the MacNamara Case, the Loeb-Leopold murders, and the famous Scopes  "monkey trial" case are just some of the points touched upon in the Darrow autobiography.  Darrow is a clean and competent writer, if not an artistic one. The prose is easy to read and understand. In places, the book can get frustrating because he leaves a topic well before the reader has lost interest. Future publishers would do well to publish this book together with some pointers for further reading.  The Da Capo Press edition is published with a very strange little introductory essay by Alan Dershowitz. In it, he seems more interested in rehabilitating the memory of Bryan than he does in introducing the book. The reader may want to skip it until after finishing the main book itself.    Beyond the obvious lawyer/law student audience, I would also recommend this book to readers interested in labor politics, the early history of the 20th century in the US, and social justice 
 Contrary to what another reviewer said ... this album is nothing like Radiohead. If you've heard Ivy ... it is much closer to that sound. Try "Walking On Moonlight" ... it's got a strong hook, violin interlude, all sung in falsetto. It's truly a sort of liquid sound. Some of the tracks have a light jazz element like "Sample from Heaven" with a light voice-over that sounds like humming. If anything the album is much like a lighter, more romantic, less pedantic version of David Sylvian. Or Joe Henry or some Pinback -- but better. Often I hear shades of the Beatles lighter stuff. The singing complements the music well ... it is sung over the top of easy chord changes and soft trumpet fills many of the spaces between. In one song the chorus is a lightly sung, "I like the way you are. You shine like a shooting star. Shine till there's nothing left of you at all." If you like that kind of lyrical style, you'll love this album. It's not Shakespeare ... but hell ... it does seem heart-felt. There is no stilted feel to the lyrics. It is an album of sparse, aching guitar, heavy sensual base beats, light lyrics, resonant piano, whispy vocals and heavy hooks 
 I really enjoyed Paul Feig's "Kick Me" -- a laugh-out loud tale of elementary, junior high & high school woes.  My favorite chapter was definitely the one on his olive green Elf Costume, patched together from his dad's army/navy surplus store, and the attention it receives at the school's Christmas pageant.    Feig has a great 'voice' -- the events of his childhood in their own right are humorous, but ultimately it's his hilarious descriptions, word choice and literary comic timing that make the text come to life.  I was literally laughing out loud (or stifling the laughs) while reading "Kick Me" on my daily subway commute.  What I also appreciated was that the other people who populated his book seemed real...funny, foible but *real.*  Though someone else's review compared him to David Sedaris on a lesser scale, I'd disagree.  Sedaris sometimes takes creative license (he acknowledges this as a technique used to disguise people) in describing people he's met on his various jobs and adventures, which can ultimately create cartoony caricatures.  Feig's book avoids that...and his memories are more heartwarming and fun because of it.    I recommend it as a quick, fun read 
 Hello!  I have been a faithful fan of Antigone Rising for 7+ years.  They continue to evolve and create amazing music together.  From the first show I saw, I was captivated.  They are able to capture the crowd like maybe no other band I have seen.  All of their songs have deep meaning and allow the listeners to meander through memories of the good, the bad and the ugly.  Antigone Rising's music is an eclectic mix of Rock, folk, country and ROCK!  If you have never seen this band perform, your life is not complete!  I highly urge each and everyone reading this to pick up a copy of FROM THE GROUND UP at your local Starbucks, ASAP.  As Well, you can purchase TRAVELLING CIRCUS from the bands website, www.antigonerising.com.  This album captures the amazing stage presence the Women of Antigone Rising possess.  YOU NEED TO HEAR AND SEE THIS BAND!!!  You will not be dissapointed...and its only getting better from here! peace and platinum albums gre 
 Given the recent hurricanes Katrina and Rita that hit the United States in the past year, 'Stormy Weather,' by Carl Hiaasen, seemed like a timely read.  This novel tells a story of tourists, native Floridians, scam artists, and insurance adjusters as they interact in Miami after a Hurricane strikes.  Max and Bonnie Lamb are honeymooning in Disney World when the hurricane hits Florida.  Bonnie just wants to resume the honey moon festivities, but her husband, Max, an advertising rep, sees an opportunity to impress his bosses and drags Bonnie down to Miami to get footage of the destruction carved out by the storm.  Edie Marsh has been roving Florida in search of a Kennedy.  Her plan has been to seduce one, and then blackmail them on her way to easy street.  The plan never bears fruit.  After the hurricane, she sees an opportunity to work another scam and sets off for Miami with a partner named Snapper, who acquired his nickname after an unfortunate childhoot incident left him with a deformed jaw.  Edie's plans go awry when Snapper turns out to be more difficult to handle than she thought.  Augustine took a plane trip one day to discover he had spent months in a coma after the plane he was riding crashed.  He also found wealth in the form of an insurance settlement.  He no longer works, and spends his time dating the wrong women and juggling human skulls.  Just before the hurricane strikes, he learns he had inherited his uncles exotic animal farm.  After the hurricane, he has a problem:  although the weather passed, the animals are loose.  Finally, there is Skink.  This crazy wild man has great teeth and a protective streak for Florida's wilderness.  He trusts one man, Jim Tile (one of Florida's few black highway patrolmen).  He has been waiting for just the right hurricane to hit Florida, and is disappointed when this one doesn't do all he hoped for.  However, when he spies a tourist taking advantage of the destruction to shoot home movies, he hatches a new plan.  These are just some of the characters that fill the pages of 'Stormy Weather.'  Throughout the novel, they end up running into each other and confounding one another's plans.  It's an incredibly twisted plot, but Hiaasen pulls it off perfectly.  This is more than just a spirited novel.  This book allows Hiaasen to take swipes at many Florida institutions from Disney World and high rise developments to crooked politicians that sell out the environment and scam artists preying on the desperate after the hurricane.  Still, the novel is a great read and to borrow a cliche, a real page turner.  I recommend this novel to anyone that wants a fun and entertaining read that falls on the edge of crime fiction.  Elmore Leonard and Dave Barry fans should enjoy it immensely.  Existing fans of Hiaasen will delight in getting more adventures of Skink.  Overall Grade: 5 stars 
 I couldn't believe how entertaining this book was.  I was really just expecting a book full of putative facts, sleeping material. Not so!  As cliche as it sounds: "I couldn't put the book down." I was really impressed with all of the resources that were used in compiling this book.  One phrase that sticks in my head even after reading this was the "controversial," mantra : "Keep Christ in Christmas," to which he commented to the effect, "They were having a hard enough time keeping Christmas in the first place." I recommend this book to anyone who "insists" on putting up Christmas lights in the middle of October, and, "Mary Xmas!&quot 
 THE WAR COMPLEX is a wonderful book--disturbing and illuminating, historicallly rich and politically timely. It begins with a startling and sweeping observation: the history of the twentieth century is a history of almost continuous war; "modernity" is virtually always "wartime"; and the accelerated violence of World War II, directed against military and civilian populations alike, is the centerpiece of our shared past. To understand the modern mind, then, we have to understand how it has been transformed by exposure to mass killing. We have to remember not only the storming of beaches and the liberation of capitals, but also the concentration camps, the firebombing of homes, the eradication of whole cities by atomic bombs.   One problem, of course, is that we remember World War II too much. It is invoked, for instance, as a justification for more war, as when politicians and media depicted 9/11 as a repetition of Pearl Harbor--at attack on America that demanded an old-fashioned, full-scale military response. Violence, experienced and remembered, begets violence. This is a symptom of what Torgovnick cals "wartime consciousness": overexposed to mass death, we organize the world according to antagonisms. It's always "us against them."  Torgovnick's daring and imaginative undertaking, in THE WAR COMPLEX, is to try to think her way through and out of "wartime consciousness." Some hawks and dullards will complain that the book is too personal, too meditative, that it turns to the imagination and the study of art when war is a matter of politics, when mass death is a matter of statistics. They will miss the point. When wartime is all the time, when our societies and our minds are built to be combat-ready, moving beyond these dominant patterns requires some unorthodox thinking. Therefore THE WAR COMPLEX considers, for example, "the kind of imaginative projections that novels can provide, their opening up of a space based on social realities, but not determined by them." And therefore, in her unconventional book--moving elegantly among the spheres of history and psychology, politics and the arts--Torgovnick adopts a personal, sometimes even confessional mode of writing. It's the opposite of self-indulgence. It's an effort to discover some grounds of "identification," some pattern of human connection beyond wartime 
 I'm suspect to talk about this stuff... I got almost every tracks, with the original players or not, and I was looking for this CD. Now I will listen to it til it be on the memory of my player.  Go ahead people and buy it too... then you'll feel what I fell when listening The Peanut soundtracks 
 This books is an excellent introduction to negotiation.  It talks about negotiating in a principled way, but not in a weak way.  When I was a director in business, I bought a copy for all of my managers and challenged them to operate this way.  The advice is practical, the ideas well presented and the model something that has proven itself over time.  While the concepts are simple, the application isn't.  It takes awareness and emotional intelligence to do all of the things in this book well.  However, the book raises awareness of what's really critical and in that sense it is invaluable.  This is a business classic for good reason.  I think the most important thing this book emphasizes is separating out the emotional factors from the substance of the negotation  and working with them separately.  While this may seem like common sense, a lot of people go forward with a negotiation without getting the emotional issues on the table and resolved first.  I also found this book hard-hitting.  There was a lot of good, well-organized information in a short space.  If you don't want to become an expert at negotiation, but you are looking for something short with solid principles, this is your book.  If you are looking for books on conflict resolution, there are better ones out there.  If you click on my profile, I list some of them under a listmania list and have written reviews under each one.  Perhaps one of these books would be better for your specific needs.  I think it is useful to master the principles in this book so they can function as a roadmap to hang more complicated ideas on as your skills grow in this area.  While the book doesn't address some of the more difficult or complicated areas of negotiation, it is a great concise introduction that will point you in the right direction for the challenges you are facing.   I also like the strong emphasis on ethics in this book.  I think it's a misconception that one needs to compromise principles to be a tough negotiator.  This is certainly not true and this is a great book for people who don't want to win a particular negotiation at the expense of an important relationship.  Therefore, it's also a nice roadmap for couple's, dealing with teenagers, etc.  
 A young woman and her son are murdered and their home burned down. The man who did it gets caught in the fire and ends up in the hospital. The woman's brother, Joe Lassiter, a professional investigator, begins to probe into why his sister and nephew were killed. It all leads him to 17 other women and their young sons, all conceived at the same fertility clinic, who have been murdered in the exact same circumstances.  The man who killed Lassiter's sister, escapes from the hospital with the help from members of a strange sect of Catholocism called Umbra Domini who appear to be behind the killings. Lassiter must go to Italy and investigate the odd doctor who conceived the children and what he was trying to achieve.  The Genesis Code is a quick read. The pace is fast and non-stop. It's an interesting plot although this territory has been mined in many other novels. And after you read about the doctor and consider the title of the book you know the secret pretty much from the beginning. Despite this, if you like fast-paced thrillers, The Genesis Code is a good one 
 I had not read much of Frost since I saw him give a reading at Dartmouth College in the last year of his life. This September, I went back to New Hampshire for the first time in 39 years, visiting my old campus -- and Robert Frost's farm near Franconia Notch. In my bag was Louis Untermeyer's delightful selection of Frost poems, interspersed by his lucid, but unobtrusive commentary.  Frost is a poet who has a very distinctive "voice" in his works. It takes a bit of ferreting out to see how it changes from one poem to another, sometimes substantially, from wry and folksy all the way to devastatingly ironic. To help us with the process, Untermeyer groups several like poems together between blocks of commentary. Each group acted as a separate unit to assist in breaking the text into readable chunks.  Especially with a book of poetry, that is no mean feat. It helped that Untermeyer knew Frost as well as any man alive. The selection is superb, including my favorites: "After Apple-Picking," "The Sound of the Trees," "The Death of the Hired Man," and "Mending Wall."   For the price, there is no better collection. It is Untermeyer's special gift to make it more fun to read. 
 I don't buy CD's, but when I heard about this one advertised on tv, I just had to have it. I'm so glad Amazon had it available & that I got it. It's like having a CD that I would put together myself if I had the choice. I loved all the songs & each singer. It was very inspirational (though most of them are NOT religious-type songs like you'd think). I still really liked it a lot and my husband listened & liked it, too. His favorite song was the title song, "Three wooden crosses". A lot of songs for your money.          
 This book was like a loyal companion as I experienced my own struggles as a woman artist.  I commend Judy Chicago for sharing her experiences, personal decisions, and insights.  Reading this particular book helped me to finish my most recent exhibition of work.  Thank you, Judy 
 If you doing any sort of organic chemistry in the lab, you will really get your hands into this handy reference on protecting groups.  The book neatly organized into functional groups and their protecting groups.  A Primer for organic chemists.  It will save you zillion hours of researching for papers/references on the appropriate protecting groups used in reactions 
 I bought these shoes for my husband. I ordered them on a Monday and they were at my house by Wednesday! I have owned a pair of "real" Birks before and these look identical to them. My husband loves them and they wre more than half the price of the real ones

 I loved this book, I am a young adult female with ADHD and this book helped me understand myself and my actions better. This book highlighted which actions and feelings are normal and which actions or fellings are "ADD things". This book has helped me a lot. I also liked how this book touched on the positieve aspects of having ADD also 
 "The Machinery of Freedom", by noted market anarchist ecnomist David Friedman, is said to be one of the must-have books on the topic. Friedman is well-known for his creative approach to markets drawing from real life and sound theoretical chops. Friedman is not afraid to state that his approach is utilitarian for the most part, unlike "For a New Liberty" by Rothbard which is more principled (as well as the next book on my reading list).  The book is divided in four parts. Part I: In Defense of Property examines the economic arguments against statism. Part II: Libertarian Grab Bag or How to Sell the State in Small Pieces is a self-explanatory list of political changes Friedman thinks should happen. Part III: Anarchy is not Chaos is a basic explanation of the problems and solutions of anarchy. Part IV: For Libertarians- An Expanded Postscript is a grab-bag of topics including Iceland, foreign policy and G.K. Chesterton. The parts are about 50-70 pages, and they are divided in very small chapters of 2-5 pages.  I found this book dissapointing. Friedman is an excellent economist, but he doesn't do a lot of economy in this book, and he is a piss-poor theorist, and he unfortunately tries to do a lot of it. His reasoning is full of false premises. His whole foreign policy and defense conundrums are easily undone if we drop his premise that it is "the country" that needs defending (instead of private property). His insistence in analyzing justice as a system fo punishment betrays a groundless bean-counting utilitarianism. His ony good piece of reasoning is his demolishing of the NAP and other libertarian axioms.  I have nothing against his economy work, but what he presents here is basic- what a price is, how the market works, artificial monpolies. I cannot recommend this book as either an economy reference or a philosophical reference 
 Simply one of the most exciting recordings in years. New, and vibrant, performances by dearly beloved. Joe Henry continues his blessed mission in producing fresh work by great soul era artists overlooked by an increasingly homogeneous music industry. Enough grumpy old man, I Believe To My Soul is the rare thing that puts one at risk of stopping people and boring them about it. The juice produced by Henry's matching of Solomon Burke with songs by contemporary writers brought the great man to Australia; Bettye LaVette appeared on Letterman (would that she appear in the footsteps of her contemporary Betty Harris at the Prince of Wales venue in Melbourne). Henry has brought together, in alphabetical order, Ann Peebles, Billy Preston, Mavis Staples, Irma Thomas and Allen Toussaint. If even one of those names stirs, a treat awaits. Everyone is in great form. Mavis Staples is alight raising her voice in praise on album opener You Must Have That True Religion,  relentless on Keep On Pushing. Irma Thomas reaches higher and higher on Loving Arms, Ann Peebles heartbreaking on When the Candle Burns Low. The album was recorded in June last year. Then came Katrina. Toussaint became one of the refugees in the Superdome and Thomas was among early hurricane missing. So it was a delight to happen upon the two closing the Grammys telecast with a musical blast for the battered Gulf Coast and the lately lamented Wilson Pickett. Too late, but what sweet noise Pickett and Joe Henry might have made. For those who like that sort of thing (salutations), Allen Toussaint is on piano throughout, arranged the horns, sings three. That he is thanked in the notes for ''unfailing generosity'' is nice. Is it worth going grumpy because the notes are a strain to read by dint of marrying magenta and black into gloom? Sigh. Ah well, overreaching design never silenced such heavenly voices. 
 I began using Guidelines (the first edition) in 1995 when it was essentially prescribed by an EFL colleague using it to teach another section of composition.  I found it to be one of the best texts I've ever used for a comp class. The readings are genuinely engaging and students really felt motivated to reply in writing and with in-class discussion.  Many years later, I'm no longer teaching composition, but keep this book on my shelf anyway since I never know when I will want to refer to one of the readings.

 A Tribe Apart offers the results of Hersch's six year project to enter the "tribe" of American adolescence and learn its secrets. Not all the adolescents are confused and conflicted, but they share a changing sense of what "normal" adolescence is. For a couple, drugs are a normal and expected aspect of being an adolescent, something they simply do. Hersch's strength is that she largely lets her subjects speak for themselves, free from her judgment or censure. This "She says...She thinks..." approach can become tiresome, but more often it reveals. Statistics and the voices of adults help add perspective to Hersch's account, but, even then, it is not Hersch herself who is speaking. The general effect is to evoke the world of adolescence while recognizing its broader context. A reader feels empathy for all of Hersch's teens because she presents them as innocents, unaware of their own contradictions and their manipulation by forces around them. The book is more horrifying because we like these kids who do these horrifying things 
 I find that the new version 7 of Adobe Acrobat loads faster than version 5, both stand-alone and within my internet browser.  Also, the new version is better integrated with the browser and with Microsoft Office.  I believe Adobe heard and responded to the complaints about version 6.  There are many other features which I have yet to try but certainly look worthwhile.  Kudos for what I see as a substantial improvement.  I recommend 
 Very well written and accurate of the times; brought back many memories 
 This book is an excellent tool for beginners, and intermediate level programmers.  The way it reads is as close to being in the classroom as you can get without paying tuition 
 This box set is great for anyone who is a Barry White fan or of romantic,sultry 70's R&B/disco."Never Ever Gonna Give You Up","I'm Gonna Love You Just A Little More","You're The First,The Last,My Everything","Love's Theme","It's Escatsy When You're Laying Next To Me","Your Sweetness Is My Weakness"...if you love any of the songs above,this is the place to get them since they are presented in their full-length glory with excellent sound quality,informative liner notes,and beautiful cover design to match.So don't delay...get "Just For You" for someone you love 
 The product was in perfect condition and came in the time that it was supposed to.  There were no issues with any of it!  Very satisfied! : 
 I would have given this CD one more star if there were more tunes but I can't complain too much because the price was just right for the range of music that can be had on one cd.  I can agree with another reviewer in that "grunge" was completely overlooked here in favor of the pop stuff (Hanson?  Come on!) but there are other 90's compilations out there that have plenty of grunge on them (and plenty of songs that no one heard except when they were in the middle of turning off the radio at 3 o'clock in the morning).  Regardless, this  compliation is pretty representative of the range of music that was big in the 90's - pop, rap, even theme songs from TV shows.  That's what made the 90's so much more better than the 80's - no one type of music dominated (whereas, in the 80's, the cheesier the better) and, best of all, they were the Clinton years.  This one cd blows Billboard's 90's compliation out of the water ... and then some.  Good deal for great music 
 Group Home's 1995 debut album "Livin' Proof" is a gorgeous and beautiful hip hop album that is certainly very underappreciated. This album teams the MC duo Lil' Dap and Melachi the Nutcracker, two talented and unknown teenage rappers from New York, with the legendary DJ Premier on the mixing boards, arguably the greatest hip hop producer of all time. The result is a truly special and unique masterpiece. The majority of the enjoyment in "Livin' Proof" comes from the production, which is the most diverse and my favorite of his entire career. His sound is very focused, and the theme of "low budget environment" is played very well. Premo's beats sound less polished than on a Gang Starr record, and instead of his usual horns and instrumentals, he often uses heavy, creative sampling, and a simple drumkit and keyboard to make simple, beautiful beats. His music has a very nostalgic feel to it, and this production is experimental without sounding at all futuristic. His music really is capable of evoking a lot of feelings and emotions. Lyrically I am impressed with Dap and Melachi, and I really can't begin to comprehend the three and four star ratings bashing these two rappers. I guess in 1995 people were only used to hearing Guru and Jeru the Damaja over Premier beats, and granted Dap and Melachi are not quite on their level, but they really do a phenomenal job on the mic. Despite their young age, they have a very worldly intelligence, and they speak of life in an often depressed, downcast tone that comes from living in such abject poverty. Despite their tough situations, though, they continue to look forward. "Livin' Proof" is an amazing rap album that is really unlike any other I've heard, and I recommend it highly to all types of music listeners.  The album begins with a 40-second intro that displays why DJ Premier is one of the top producers of all time. With just a piano and drumset, he makes one of the coolest little beats I've ever heard, and it just eases you into the album so well. "Inna City Life" introduces Dap and Melachi, both dropping some raw philosophy gained from years in the ghetto, and Premo's simple, staticky beat is hard and gritty. The beat to "Livin' Proof" is raw but attractive, simple and ear-catching, and Melachi and Dap establish themselves as new young truth-kicking rappers. The chorus samples Wu-Tang and Nas in Premo's signature two-bar fashion. "Serious Rap S..." has an electronic, ultra-funky beat that will make your head bob instantly, the raps show great flow. A highlight of the disc is "Suspended in Time," a very nostalgically and thoughtfully produced track with verses to match. "Sacrifice" has cool guitars on the production, and harder raps than usual. "Up Against tha Wall (Low Budget Mix)" has bouncy vibes and my favorite lyrics on the album, expressing the depressed and pessimistic view of inner city life. "4 Give My Sins" has some muted horns and a simple beat, with introspective lyrics. Premo steals the show on "Baby Pa," making not one but two completely dope beats on this track. I love "2 Thousand," with its winding deep piano and great chorus ("95 is yours, 2000 is mine, and we walkin' through the ghetto and the feeling is fine..."). It's followed by "Supa Star," another classic single. My favorite song on the whole album is "Up Against tha Wall (Getaway Car Mix)." It's another mix to the song earlier on the album, but Premo's slower, simple piano lined-beat is absolutely perfect, and he engineers a nice chorus for this mix. The album ends with the tough song "Tha Realness."  "Livin' Proof" is an album so exceptional and musical that I don't think you'd have to be a rap fan to enjoy it. In my mind, it showed the world that the legendary Premier didn't need Guru or Jeru to make an awesome record, and I think this is maybe his greatest musical accomplishment. It is really unlike a Gang Starr album in every way, but Gang Starr fans will probably enjoy it immeasurably as well. I could not praise or recommend "Livin' Proof" any higher, this is really a one-of-a-kind type of album 
 This book was required reading at our office and at the time I wondered why, after all we had a great team! After taking the assessment test I realized we had lots of room to improve! The story was a quick and easy read but very effective. We implemented many of the ideas in the book and work much more effectively today than we did a year ago. Thanks for a great book 
 When I needed her most, Sobonfu surfaced. The majority of us are so very confused about intimacy and what it really means. This book will answer your questions 
 The second book in the post-Asimov foundation series is by one of my favorite SF authors--Greg Bear. This book picks up after Gregory Benford's Foundation's Fear, but does not come chronologically right after the end of that book. Rather, what has been done in this new series is that spots not filled out by Asimov are now filled in, so Benford's work takes place just as the main character, Hari Seldon, takes the post of First Ministership, while Bear's book takes place after that time and what we were left to think was the decline and death of Seldon (that impression made in Asimov's Forward Foundation.   Bear is really great at picking up a genre that is not his own (as I liked in his Star Trek and Star Wars novels). Foundation and Chaos is more like Asimov's style than Benford's, but Bear still manages to fill out some details not covered before, especially about political strive among the robots. The idea that the robots have differing opinions and political groups working against each other is really amazing. Loved it all 
 This CD is my favorite, I love all the songs.  This band has so much talent, they have a very funky sound.  I have yet to here a song I don't like, they all rock.   When the House Man sings it is the best 
 If you're one of the legions who found comfort and joy in the wisdom of Simple Abundance, you won't be disappointed by Moving On, Sarah Ban Breathnach's meditation on creating a home that truly reflects your spirit.  Though homekeeping was also one of the topics of Simple Abundance, Moving On is a deeper exploration of what it means to belong in your own environment.  Both thoughtful and revealing, Sarah tells through her own story what we know in our hearts to be true: money, fame, and external success will never bring the peace we want and need from our surroundings.  Houses don't become havens by accident -- Moving On is a blueprint to help you start the process of creating your sanctuary 
 This book is one of the most emotionally powerful books I've read in a long time.  It made me want to cry at times.    The story is basically about a woman who loses her husband and son in a horrific fictional terrorist attack in London (ironically, the book was released either a day before or a day after the London Subway attacks).    The book chronicles her pain and suffering as everything she knows falls apart and she piteously tries to hold on to something, anything.    This book will seriously tear at your heart as you read it.  
 This book, like many of Harris's, is anthropological popcorn: It is delicious stuff that you can quickly devour.  This collection of essays is very important and interesting.  It includes his very influential expanation of the sacred cow in India, as well as analysis of European witchraft, cargo cults, and more.  The most amazing thing in the book is his argument that Jesus was one of many messianic revolutionaries running around Israel during the Roman occupation.  Read this section, and then watch "The Life of Brian."  Monty Python got it right on the nose.  The parallels are amazing, rival bands of revolutionaries all seeking a messianic figure...really great stuff 
 Like other reviewers have said, this book tells a great story of a guy who grew up poor, had all the cards stacked agaisnt him and used the doubt people had about him to feed his thirst for success.  By comparison, the basic plot of this story reminds me A LOT of "Million Dollar Baby," except Papale doesn't have one person doubting his ability, he has the whole world doubting his dreams of playing football.   I thought the book was well written and would be enjoyable for probably any football fan, since the majority of the story does not revolve around Papale playing for the Eagles, but rather tells his whole story from childhood when he played sandlot pickup games to playing organized games later in life 
 Wonderful! Welcome back Tramaine!!  This is a very inspiring CD.  
 This National Book Award winner and treasure trove contain all 41 of Eudora Welty's short stories, including: "A Curtain of Green and Other Stories," (1941); "The Wide Net and Other Stories ,"(1943); the seven interlocking narratives of "The Golden Apples," (1949), "The Bride of the Innisfallen and Other Stories," 1955, as well as two previously uncollected works, "Where Is the Voice Coming From?" (1963), and "The Demonstrators" (1966). Miss Welty also wrote a Preface especially for this edition, in which she says: "I have been told, both in approval and in accusation, that I seem to love all my characters. What I do in writing of any character is to try to enter into the mind, heart and skin of a human being who is not myself."   The intricacies of human relationships is the primary theme in this collection of short fiction. Eudora Welty's works combine wonderful humor and an astute perception of human psychology. Her ear for dialogue is superb and her prose lyrical and nuanced.    Eudora Welty was born in Jackson, Mississippi where she spent most of her life. From the moment of publication, her collections of stories won wide critical acclaim, as did her novels, "The Robber Bridegroom," "Delta Wedding," "The Ponder Heart," "Losing Battles," and "The Optimist's Daughter," which won the 1973 Pulitzer Prize. Her autobiography, One Writer's Beginnings, won both the American Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1984. In 1996, Welty was given France's highest civilian honor, the French Legion of Honor Award.   This is a remarkable compilation of short fiction by one of the most gifted writers of our time. This volume enriches any library it graces. Highly recommended. JAN 
 bought this one in audio book form and truly enjoy listening to it as I drive to work but I won't listen to it when I'm driving alone at night  :- 
 The actual trading methodology is not really of interest to me. As a matter of fact, it's ironic that in the first half of the book statements such as "there is no magic system" and "all mechanical systems will fail" are made, then in the second half of the book a rather mechanical trading system that is referred to as "automagic" is described.  I suppose for a beginning trader looking for some kind of method to employ it's not a bad one to pursue. Allow me to suggest that the second half of the book should be given perhaps 10% of your consideration while the first half should be given 90%.  The first half of the book is revolutionary, and makes it a classic. It should be removed and marketed separately. In fact, I like your chances of success better if you only read the first half and then develop your own trading method based on what you notice happening in the market. Concentrate on developing a winning mindset and getting in tune with the market you trade. The first half of this book should be kept and reread regularly.  [... 
 I loved this book! A perfect get away from the world. If you love David Baldacci's writing, this stays true to his form. A very good twisting and turning, who done it novel 
 I found it very usefull in learning japanese. It's a very versatile tool 
 This is a truly remarkable book. Findley offers a well-written introduction to the entire history of Turks and Turkic peoples to the non-specialist reader in this very interesting work. The book is composed of an introduction, five main parts and a conclusion. It takes the history of Turks from the very beginning (the appearance of Xiongnu in the Central Asian steppes) and brings it up to the recent electoral victory of AKP (Justice and Development Party) in Turkey. I found the book especially strong on its chapters about Turks' conversion to Islam and after. On top of all the remarkable scholarly qualities of the book, Findley is a very good writer and he carefully explains every point, which may be difficult or unknown to the lay reader. I highly recommend this book to everyone.      
 Have you ever read the book Smoky the cow Horse?

This book is about a horse named Smoky and his life from birth to death join him through all his experinces good or bad 
 my kids loved this movie and were thrilled to get this book. In english and japanese. lots and lots of wonderful pictures. one warning first book in a series of several 
 This is an absolutely fantastic read for simple-minded people.  If you are a simpleton, parrot, sheep, or otherwise unable to think for yourself and would rather have someone else do it for you, then you need this book.  I give it five stars for its appeal to base, primitive, thoughtlessness.      
 This album was tremendous! A lot of emo and more screaming! "The Latest Plague" and "World War Me" are the best tracks in this album.  1."Mothersound" 10/10- Yes, a ten of course, with really nice solo at the end and great chorus! Usually, in From First To Last's songs, they usually sing then stop a while, but in this song, Sonny sang for a long time and then there came some  guitar works.  2."The Lastest Plague" 11/10- I had to give this 11 out of 10, first of all, the chorus was amazing, so catchy! Love when he first whispers, and then he screams out "so don't you PLAAAACE!!" The drumming was good, and so were the guitars.  3."... And We All Have A Hell" 10/10- The intro was amazing! I heard that this song was about rape or being raped. I love when Sonny sings fast in some parts.   4."Afterbirth" 9/10- This was a beautiful song, sounded sorta sad since he's singing that he just figured out that he was adopted. I really love how the ending sounded.  5."World War Me" 12/10- I just had to give this 12 stars out of 10, there were more screaming than in any other songs they've ever made. This had the catchiest chorus. The drumming was amazing at the ending.  6."Shame Shame" 9/10- The intro was great! But the chorus was kinda boring.  7."The Crows Are Coming For Us" 9/10- The chorus was okay, the intro had drumming in it. Love when they go "you walk on water, you sing that lovely tune".  8.'The Levy" 9.5/10- This song was OK too, but I don't understand why sooo many people love this song?! This song is like everywhere where you check out From First To Last. There's nothing special, Sonny barely sings in here, many parts were soft and silent, it's just the ending that got my attention.  9."Waves Goodbye" 2/10- This was the world's worst song in this album!! I HATED THIS!!! This album would be better without this song. this sounded more of techno and more like pop.  10.'Waltz Moore" 9/10- I really like this song, this was kinda addicting, and the chorus was good too.  11."Heroine" 7.9/10- This was so-so, Sonny's voice sounded louder and slower in here, it's just the chorus that I only liked.  This was a great album, sometimes it could get a little boring, the drumming was amazing! The guitars were great! Love Sonny's singing! I just love this band!          
 I really thought this book was helpful. I bought this book to complement another book I had trouble understanding. I finished this book in a couple of days in time to complete a research paper. You can't find many easy  reading books like this one 
 One of my favorite five books in the last five years, and I read a lot of books!  I'm going to try to be brief, which will be a challenge, because I loved it.  First, the concept behind this book is pure genius, especially for an autobiography.  Because he didn't release his life story until he died, Twain was able to be completely honest.  It's true- everyone on earth must restrain their tongue somewhat.  But when we read about a great person from the past, we want to know the real deal.  I won't go too much into how great Mark Twain was. I'm sure that subject has been covered quite well.  But as a public speaker, writer, and fledgling humorist myself, I found many of the vignettes priceless.  He tells us what the 'Lycium',the 19th American speaking circuit, was like, how one good writer failed miserably in front of an audience, how he (Twain) turned an old tired joke into a new exciting one... and on the subject of fame, he talks about how inconsequential was a particular woman who had become famous simply for having opinions (and because she happened to be the wife of a newspaper man).  Indeed, except for Twain's ridicule, this woman has been utterly and appropriately neglected by history.  We are thereby warned of the worthlessness of fame without substance or purpose.  At times Twain sounds pompuous or narcissistic, but it fits his humorous style.  We forgive him because we know he was great and because condescension is a great position from which to heap ridicule and satire.  And you have to wonder- don't some great men know they're great even while they live?  Twain had the fortune to be celebrated within his lifetime, and remains one of the most important Americans.  He is the deep root from which modern humorists such as Garrison Keillor and Dave Barry spring forth.  He is an example of the gruff and almost crotchety American intellect.  His story also demonstrates how not to run your writing business (by letting suspicious character run it for you and steal your money).  And he provides touching accounts of both his awkward courtship, and the exceptional character and intelligence of one of his daughters.  What else?  They say in public speaking: Begin with a laugh, end with a tear.  Twain's autobiography does the latter - it's sad to see how quickly he went from the apex of life to lonely grief as most of his family died within little more than a year.  Before we know it, before we want it, the book is over, and the great life is done.  We are reminded of the temporary nature of life, and as this famous and delightful personality recedes again from our consciousness, perhaos at least for a little while, because of his example, we seize life with more vigor 
 Never before had a novel pushed my emotions to the brink before I read Jefferson's journal entries late in Gaines' novel. Literally feeling Jefferson's pain, my stomach couldn't help but sink as I imagined the horror he must have felt during his last days. Extremely moving and driven by a bold plot laced with racial questions, this story is certainly a powerful glimpse into the heart and soul of man--black and white alike 
 SASS HAS A GREAT ROCK VOICE!  NO WONDER SHE HAS SO MANY ALBUMS.  I WAS JUST CHECKING SOME OF THE ROCK TUNES OUT AND WAS PLEASENTLY SURPRISED WHEN I FOUND ANOTHER STAR I REALLY LIKE (TONES OF JANIS CHAPLIN) 
 Having just seen the motion picture, I thought I now had seen the "true story" of Iwo Jima, when, in fact, I had only experienced the overture to the opera which was the battle of Iwo Jima.  The film ignited a curiosity in me that prompted me to go immediately to Amazon.com to buy the book.  Had I known what I'd find in its pages, I would have bought a hardback--this book should sit in a special place in my library.    First, be careful not to inadvertently buy an abridged copy.  You won't want Bradley's prose altered in any way.  You will come to know--as much as it could be possible--not only the guys in the photograph, but their buddies, their families, and the Marines.  Questions that flitted through your mind during the movie, things that seemed just little odd, will be made crystal clear.    This book is a hard one to put down, but you have to set it aside to allow it to sink in.  As Sands of Iwo Jima, starring John Wayne (and three of the actual flag-raisers: Gagnon, Bradley, and Hayes) doesn't hold a candle to the motion picture version of Flags of Our Fathers, the Clint Eastwood epic, while a likely Oscar contender, is, by the very nature of commercial films, very limited in its ability to bring to life the pages of this book.  This tome needs no other media to depict the lives of the men, their families, and the horror that is war.  The romance of war evaporates with each page turned.  This book is remarkably well organized, skillfully drawing very clear pictures of these men, blemishes and all, their heritages, their upbringing, and their personalities.  You will even come to understand something of the Japanese of that generation, and why it can be truly said that the atomic bombs saved more lives than they took.   James Bradley hasn't made this simply a salute to his father, and he has neither whitewashed nor been unduly critical of any of the subjects.  Get it, read it, treasure it and the men who gave "their todays for our tomorrows." 
      Perhaps Fischer's greatest achievment here is in how much he tells us in so short a book.  He covers Nazi and German history from the 19th century to 1945 in under 600 pages!!  He shows a special gift for writing the most with the (relatively) fewest words.  Even those knowing much about the subject will learn a lot from this volume.  And Fischer knows what should and should not be included in a book of this kind.  This work will be a valuable addition to any historical library.       I particularly enjoyed the section on the Weimer Republic and the 20's.  Most books skip over this period, saying only that the Republic was democratic and flawed, and that Hitler sought to destroy it.  Fischer gives us an in depth look at this society, and explains how its insecurities contributed to the disaster to come.       I only wish the book had been a bit longer.  There is only so much one can include in a one volume work, I know, but a few hundred more pages would have made it truly outstanding 
 If you only read one book on the Korean War, this is the one.  Fehrenbach provides a well-balanced mix of impressions of fighting at the ground level with the broader vision of the war from a strategic and political level.  He is unsparing in describing the appalling unpreparedness of the US Army and, more important, the underlying reasons for it that can easily be repeated in the future.    As the book was written nearly 30 years before the end of the Cold War (1963), it frequently tends to speak in the present tense of an era fading into the past.  Still, this does little to detract from the book.  What would have helped the book immensely is the presence of a few maps to give the reader the ability to identify key locations mentioned throughout the book.  Overall, a "must read," but not an "only read. 
 This adapter provides the 58mm filter screw mount base for expanding PowerShot G6 versatility - tele or wide converters, closeup lens, filters, or power-user tools such as a (circular) polarizer. As noted, the adapter shadows the built-in flash, and blocks part of the viewfinder's field.  Pity that the LA-DC58B adapter for the G3 or G5 cameras doesn't also fit the G6 
 Being a Mason for years, and having read many books on the subject in search of what Freemasonry was really all about, I could not help feeling, when I had finished this book, that this was it.  Yes, This is Freemasonry  from a Theosophical perspective.  I Think it is the true perspective 
 I was recently introduced to Anne Taintor stuff, and I think it's hilarious.  These postcards have the same pictures and expressions as other Anne Taintor items.  I think they will make a great impression on whoever receives them.  The cards themself are of very heavyweight material and feel strong and sturdy.  They have founded edges and are not shiny like most postcards, which gives them a retro feel. These are awesome and I can't wait to mail my first one out 
 My son and I loved reading the avatar books, we own both volumes and are eagerly awaiting the third volume. We also own the DVDs and when we watch the series, my son remembers that we read some parts in our books. It is a great way for kids to make connections from video to print 
 Sophie loved the Magic Cube, I really think one of her favorite toys. This was her first Christmas and the magic cube made it lots of fun 
 Bracken shines in this beautiful comedy directed a master. The story is wonderful: a young man who is accidentally taken for a war hero and encouraged to run for mayor of his town. The only imperfection is the  dramatic sequence at the end that puts somewhat of a black eye on the  film's laugh-out-loud theme 
 Martha Stewart's story has all the trappings of fiction: written and read by author Byron, it tells of her rise to fame, her hidden world, and a background which led a quiet girl to become the richest self-made businesswoman in America, selling her confidence and poise to a nation. An intriguing story of Martha's surprising roots evolves in a memorable biography. 
 I loved the openning scene.  It's quite stylish. The story is simple but effective.  I saw a few compliant in here but as a Chinese I thought I'd give my 2 cents here.  I feel that the movie evokes a deep emotion for me as how a classic hero would do in the most difficult times.  When their country is surrounded by multiple external invasion forces and oppressed by it's own corrupted govenment, your fellow countrymen mostly cared for themselves and some are even preying on their own for profits, few are still willing to fight for a better future.  The hero in this story is not just Wong but those two men who are willing to give up their lives to fight for their countrymen.  Wong, again, caught up in the middle of uprising and must utilize his kung fu skill to battle for his beliefs and his love.   I think this is the best of the entire series.  If you are only to get one of the series, please get this one.    rent it if you must but don't believe everything you read... this included of course 
 David Bohm (1996), wrote about proprioception, which is the basically the self-awareness that allows us to realize that our bodies our wired to know when we move them versus being moved by something else.  In other words, we know when we have moved our arm or when someone else has moved it.  Not so with thoughts and emotions, he said:  "You may get a feeling that you don't like from a thought, and then a second later say, "I've got to get rid of that feeling," but your thought is still there working, especially if it's a thought that you take to be absolutely necessary. . . .  "We could say that practically all of the problems of the human race are due to the fact that thought is not proprioceptive.  Thought is constantly creating problems that way and then trying to solve them.  But as it tries to solve them it makes it worse because it doesn't notice that it's creating them, and the more it thinks, the more problems it creates--because it's not proprioceptive of wht it's doing.  If your body were that way you would very quickly come to grief and you wouldn't last very long.  And it may be said that if our culture were that way, our civilization would not last all that long, either"  (p. 25).  Bohm's contribution to servant-leadership is his resonance with Greenleaf (2002) on the topics of awareness and responsibility.  The latter said that the "servant views any problem in the world as in here, inside oneself, not out there" and that it is not just problems that the self generates and is responsible for because "So it is with joy" as well as trouble (p. 57).    
 I converted to Catholicism three and a half years ago. The discussion in this book regarding Christianity and communism were the most powerful yet simple arguments I have ever read. It brought me to tears to realize how well this author could explain the essence of faith. I read an average of 50 books each year, and have a read a majority of the 100 greatest books in history and believe this book should be among them. The author has a unique way of making characters that you don't even like understood and appreciated for their failures. It brought me to tears to know that I have just discovered this author and he died in 1999. His death is all of our lost 
  This book is one of the few masterpieces out there. I have read many books and I stumbled upon this one and it was tremendus. A student who does not read in my class read this book and never put it down. I am no going o tell you a bit of the bok but i gurantee, if you read it you will be taking the trip with him. i felt exhausted when i finished the book, i felt as i were a character. take it from me this book is a certified masterpiece 
 I'm pretty perceptive when it comes to scoping out the right books to read (i.e. whether or not it's actually worth the time & money).  This one was another great page-turner!  Particularly for fans of hip hop music, those who came of age before the genre crossed over to the mainstream, and also for music fans who've probably heard countless great tales from the industry that are starting to come off like a broken record.  "Raising Hell: The Reign, Ruin and Redemption of Run DMC" is a book title that could very easily read "Raising Hell: The Reign & Ruin of Run DMC."  I said that because for as much as I loved this group growing up and still love what they achieved circa-1985 and their place in moving the genre forward, the book did a lot to burst my bubble (so to speak) on what remains an iconic group.  Without giving away the juicy details of the book, Run DMC should be credited for their historic, innovative stylings.    Coming off the more glossy hip hop infancy of blinged out artists like Kurtis Blow, Afrika Bambaataa, Grand Master Flash & the Furious Five, it was Run DMC who made it cool to "just be yourself" without all the celebrity, wearing-your-wealth-on-your-sleeves images.  It was Run DMC who (at the time) came with a more deviantly hardcore hip hop sound (read: not your commercially-friendly, R&B-type rap music).  And it was Run DMC who helped the hip hop culture grow the most in the mid-80s by experimenting with a slight rock&roll flavor that became their signature sound while expanding hip hop's fanbase.  Where this book may surprise you is hearing all the behind the scenes tales of (now Rev.) Run, DMC and Jam Master Jay -- at least it all surprised me b/c they weren't always true to their music images.  Jam Master Jay (may he rest in peace) is presented as the cool, laid back brotha who stayed runnin' in the streets.  You won't find out anything more than theories about who his killer might be, but just finding out he at least ran with more than his share of greasy cats even into his 30s will make you wonder if that didn't play some small part in his demise (i.e. He didn't deserve to die but this wasn't just some random act of violence as the media initially tried to portray it).  Perhaps a little less surprising is the book's portrayal of Run (the group's leader) as this egotistical, control freak who refused to compromise and even as a born again Christian remains a shady, alcohol-overconsuming man of the world posing as a disciple of the Lord.  DMC, my personal favorite of the group, comes off as perhaps the group member with the most issues.  The book paints him as this slightly introverted pushover who stomached Run's ego trips back in the day during the group's run at the top and one who didn't grow a backbone until their best days had passed them by (thus all the tales of the turmoil, hatred and conflict that defined Run DMC's circa-2000 comeback).  And yet with all of the aforementioned flaws (we all have some!), the most disgusting part of these behind the scenes tales all involve the way Run and DMC reacted to JMJ's murder.  The only specific detail of this book I will divulge is that Run and DMC came off as spiritually unchanged by their best friend's death and more concerned with how to exploit it for money in the same vein TuPac and Biggie's deaths were milked for cash.  Great read but depending on what perspective you're coming from and what image you have of this group, this may or may not be recommended material.  By the end of "Raising Hell," I can't say I lost any respect for them as a whole.  But I guess it's a lot easier to keep their immense accomplishments in context while also acknowledging their utter human qualities and inevitable sameness with most who survive to tell about their music industry experiences (i.e. drugs, sex, some good times & lots of shady dealings) 
 Good tool. Concise and easy to use. Organized around the phases. 
 I was disapointed to discover the iPod comatability port was on the BACK. I was expecting a port on the face and for that reason I almost returned it. But When I talked to my install guy he said he could set it up for easy iPod concetion. He did a wonderful job and the sterio works great with my iPod. It keeps the same great iPod quality sound. Also, my Saab has hign end speakers so that helps too. This sterio is not an install it yourself product :-( Perhaps it worth it pay a little more at a retail store where they will install it for free. 
 I picked this book up in an airport.  I had never read Matthew Reilly before, but WOW!  What a fantastic read.  Yes, the story is SciFi - which I love - so some things are going to be a little out of the scope of reality.  I absolutely loved this read.  It was a quick read and very exciting.  While I was reading the book, it was as though I could see everything on a movie screen in front of me.  Oddly enough, I recently discovered that they are making a movie out of this story.  I can't wait.  Pick this up.  You won't be dissapointed 
 I find this book to be most helpful, as well as easy to read and comprehend. I have learned so much about gardening and controlling those pesky weeds, and have actually had fun doing it(if weeds can be fun!) The  layout of the book is intelligent, and the illustrations are extremely well  done....I don't think anyone reading this book will have any trouble  identifying weeds in their garden. It's a good investment for ANY gardener 
 Dancing is a popular theme in Hunger and Thirst, though not just with regard to the Aragon Ballroom.  I was amazed by Kuper's ability to so effortlessly--or so it would seem--choreograph the emotional movements of so diverse a group of characters.  Few novels have left me with a similar sense of grief as I neared the end of the book, anticipating the loss of characters who, through all their quirks, dysfunction, and strength, were incredibly real and wonderfully human. 
 It is true that the steps towards weight loss are no different than in "Make the connection". But I think this book complements the first one perfectly. For the chapters on motivation alone, this book is worth buying. It explains the motivation issues of certain typres of people and why it can be damaging to your self-esteem to attempt dieting when you are not ready in your mind. This book also helped me to stay motivated whenever I had a low, and to keep going. I haven't regretted for one second that I bought this book 
 this is an awesome toy....this is my son's very 1st hot wheels toy and he loves it. My husband likes it as well. :) It is a very sturdy toy and the cars are fine on the track. The only problem I have with it is that where the booster is and the batteries, it is very light. when the cars come around to go thru the booster, it really shakes and moves around a lot and lifts off the ground. It does not effect the track, but they could make that heavier so it does not move around on the floor.... 
 I dont think you will be disapointed if you like the old hyms & Alan Jackson what a perfect combo. I reach for this time & time again  
 If you liked 44 Scotland Street, you will also enjoy this next book in McCall Smith's series. All the characters are back and their adventures are more exciting even than the last book's. The one exception is Ramsey Dunbarton's memoirs, which are intended to be so boring they are hilarious but unfortunately hit the mark at boring period. I don't know why McCall Smith kept on and on adding installments to the man's memoirs- it felt like there were a lot of chapters wasted on it that could have been better used on the charming Bertie or Pat.  That said, the book still gets five stars, because except for these few chapters about Ramsey, the book was very enjoyable and moved along at a good pace 
 'Ya know, this one might just be "it".  It being one of the best albums ever.  It has rock, country, soul, R&B, punk and whatever else you might expect from a Stones album.  These boys were at the top of their game in 1972 and the result shows clearly in this two LP/one CD tome.  It's as eclectic as they come... all types being equal.  Give it a try, boys and girls... you're not likely to be disappointed 
 Christian Slater's character reminds me of a young Jack Nicholson, who replaces his brother on the Police Force after he is murdered. I was surprised that he didn't become as popular as Tom Cruise after this film was released in 1992, but he had a few personal issues during the 90s that stalled his career.  I think he's a better actor than most people realize, with much more talent than making below average movies like "Broken Arrow".  
 If you are just starting to like jazz.   This album is a great start.  A  great blend of jazz and hip-hop 
 This is a great little book to carry around and log all your food and calories.  I have really managed to change my diet, albiet slowly, by seeing what I actually put in my mouth.  I highly recommend this as an aid to anyone trying to lose weight or change their eating habits 
 Mr. Mittelberg's challenge is one that I hope every church leader will take on.  It is encouraging, practical and able to be adapted to any church that wants to feel the excitement of seeing friends, family and their community impacted by the love of Jesus through the local church 
 I tend to like to answer questions myself, but I ordered this book as I was doing a classroom presentation on counseling gay/lesbian. It was a big hit with my fellow students and has some good answers. All in all a good book 
 Bassani's Garden is a book worth reading.  I enjoyed it because it seemed to capture a world about which I knew little before:  aristocratic and middle class Italian Jewish society before the second world war.  It is a melancholy world to be sure, but not unpleasant. Tim Parks' introduction to the always well-produced Everyman edition was well done, and shed light on aspects of the novel of which I was not aware.  Readers of Lampedusa's The Leopard will likely enjoy The Garden, as both take a literarily mature and nostalgic look at a society which no longer exists.  For myself, I enjoyed The Leopard better, but this is to take nothing away from The Garden, which is fine in its own right. 
 My daughter loves this book!  A great introduction to the art of embroidery - fun projects that don't require perfect embroidery skills for fantastic results.  Instructions for each project are concise and clear yet inspire creativity and experimentation. This is a great birthday present for crafty kids (and adults who want to learn embroidery too! 
 Erica Jong, possibly one of the most underestimated writers of today, does herself well with this wonderful work of historical fiction.  Her prose is absolutely delightful as is her ability to tell a story. Here Ms. Jong has melded fiction, mysticism, historical fact and speculation into a wonderful tale about a fascinating woman in a fascinating time.  She, the author, also gives us a good account of the ancient Gods, and the role they were felt to play in human lives.  We have the added bonus of having some of Ms. Jong's translations (there are many many of these out there, and these of Ms. Jong's are as good as any) along with some very nice pieces (poetry) by the author, written in the style of the time.  As with any work, there are a couple of questionable lines in  the book. I more or less had to agree with another reviewer that the couple of lines discussing dildos may have been a bit over the top, but they certainly do not distract from the work or the story in the least....in my most humble opinion.  I would also suggest you follow the authors suggestion that you find and read for yourself some of the great translations of Sappho's wonderful work. Read the story, enjoy it.   All in all, I highly recommend.  
 A truly remarkable read.  The story is a fascinating blend of historical fact and fiction.  The descriptions and writing style of the author are so real that you feel as if you are actually a part of the story.  The character development is outstanding and draws you in from the very beginning.  I could not put the book down.  I can't imagine any reader, interested in history, or for that matter, a good story, being able to resist the lure of this book.  The ending is explosive and compelling.  The best book I've read in years.  Read it.  
 This is a great how-to-do this book.  Catherine has so simply put forth how to implement the Charlotte Mason method.  As I read this book (which I was able to read through twice in 24 hours) I kept thinking "I can do this".  I was able to immediately implement the ideas 
 I love this CD. My initiation in Reiki was made with some tracks of this CD, which i listen over and over again. Her voice is beautifull. Thank you Deva for sharing it with the whole world 
 This well developed film earlier this Summer is the best book based on the film.  This book should have been out well before the movie.  I liked the movie so much I had to read the book.  A great adventure yarn about the caped crusader.  O'Neal can write a great book and he does here.  Characters are well known.  The plot is so well concocted that I had to read it in just 2 days. I could not put it down.  It's so perfect about how the adventure starts out for Bruce Wayne and ends up of how there is a world and a city with a hero like Batman.  A great ending and a great author goes well together.  A Must Read to say the least 
 Mr. Greer, once again, provides the reader with an in-depth look at Druidry as a way of life and a religion.  His information comes from a long history within the path that he writes about.  Excellent information, well thought out and well laid out 
 A beautifully put together book! I pick it up almost everyday to read and savor it. Combined with pictures and quick bits of his teachings, you can sense his message on an almost more physical level than just up in your head 
 Exasperation with our son's behavior led to the purchase of this book. He's now 3 1/2. He is high energy in most everything he does. He's more energetic, more intense, more inquisitive, more dramatic. The older he gets, the "more" he has become.  This book helped us understand that there are many other kids just like ours, that "more" is not bad (like his PreK teacher had us thinking) and that parenting a spirited child requires a different set of skills.  The author doesn't give any one sure-fire way to help with the daily struggles you face with a spirited child, but she does direct you and help you to understand. Without this book, we may have never understood what spirit is in a child 
  	Few historical periods are as intriguing as the Renaissance; few families fascinate as much as the Borgias.  However, we've not been privy to many firsthand accounts of daily life among the powerful in 16th century Italy.  Now, thanks to a bit of luck and assiduous research, art historian Mary Hollingsworth presents a detailed picture  of Ippolito d'Este, the second son of Lucretia Borgia who later became Archbishop of Milan.  	In Modena, Italy, Hollingsworth came upon a treasure - over 2,00 letters and 200 account books pertaining to the days of Ippolito.  The ledgers contain such minute details as the items in his wardrobe, what he ate.  He wasn't timid about keeping a log of his women right along with his horses, dogs, falcons, peacocks, and a plethora of servants.  Nor, was he embarrassed to note how much was spent on bribes and to whom he paid them.  Thus, readers have the unparalleled experience of seeing courtly life on a daily basis, even to Ippolito's visit to the mistress of the King of France while she was in her bath.  	Ippolito reached the ripe old age of 29 before he received the cardinal's red hat, which at that time was a guarantee of wealth and power.  He was a man who enjoyed women thoroughly and often, gambled frequently, and spent time hunting  rather than in prayer.  Thus, his elevation to such a lofty position had naught to do with religiosity, much to do with politics.  	Mary Hollingsworth has created an amazing view of everyday life among the rich and powerful in Renaissance Italy.  Highly recommended.          - Gail Cooke 
 When I first watched this movie, I sat there and wondered 'what the hell is this all about?'. I sat there and wondered if the cast was on acid.  Then I went away, and for the oddest of reasons, it kept on coming back into my mind. So I bought the DVD and watched it again.   It's one of those movies that the more you watch, the more enjoyable it becomes and the more you can appreciate it.   There is a plot of which to speak of, though it's stock standard and waterthin, but the plot is incidental to the music, dancing and pacing.   It certainly goes down in my top 10 favourite movies 
 this book covers the same topic as a newer title "the hookup handbook". This one is definately interesting, because as you read it you know most of its true!  Let's face it today dating has changed and its an level playing field as far as sex.  It doesn't make you slutty, this book covers all the things you will need to know if you do decide to go this route.  If you live in any city with any kind of bar scene you know this is exactly what happens, so don't listen to someone in the texas, do they even have cable there? lol 
 With this recipe book you can prepare simple Diabetic meals into one dish or pot as it says. It could have had more pictures of the dishes that the recipes represented, but all in all it is a good book  
 I have to take a deep breath before I start this one. I adore Hamilton. I really do. But I am getting so sick and tired of Anita Blake having sex with everything that walks. On the other hand, at least this one seemed to actually follow most of the book description and didn't have a baddie of the moment that required some new power coming online for Anita to save the day.  I think I am quickly learning to hate Ronnie with a passion; her treatment of Anita in the beginning of the book was horrid for a best friend. I loved Nathaniel's reaction to Ronnie and his treatment of her. Nathaniel really started to grow in this book! And considering that he is one of the characters I adore I was happy to see him grow; he was showing a more dominant, more possessive side of himself.  I did like the new information about what Anita is and what she can do. I am continually fascinated by Hamilton's writing of how things work within Anita's world. Her power with the triumvirate she has with Jean-Claude and Richard is growing and she's learning more about how to be the pivot in her own triumvirate with Nathaniel (and how happy am I that he's her animal to call?!) and Damien.  I found the reactions of the men in her life interesting and telling. Richard's reaction to the baby news was... infuriating. Claudia called it right, he wants her barefoot and pregnant and if she's a mom then he can have the house with the white picket fence. That is so not Anita. She's not going to give up her life and her lovers, especially when two of those lovers appear to be the glue that holds her life together and at least one of them is part of her power. I was thrilled by Micah and Nathaniel's response to the pregnancy. I thought Nathaniel would be absolutely adorable taking care of a baby.  I'm honestly more interested in the characters in the books than I am in the plot a lot of times. That's why I think I'm okay with the books having so little of it; I like knowing about the characters and how their lives are going.  On the whole I was much happier with this book than I had been with previous ones. The ending didn't feel as rushed as it previous ones and I was happy that the entire book seemed to take more than just one 24 hour period to complete. (It might not have taken much more than 24 hours but it took at least some more! 
 I hesitate to think what would happen if Thomas Mann wrote the Magic Mountain today.  Would his publisher ask him to shorten it by half?  Would he be told by his agent -- were he fortunate enough to get one -- that the book could never sell unless he enlivens the plot?  Truly, it would be simple enough to ridicule the book's simple plot, particularly given its length.  But if anyone listened, they just might miss out on arguably the greatest philosophical novel ever written.  As intellectually stimulating as this book was, it was equalling gripping to the heart.  That, of course, is the hallmark of a truly great novel of ideas.  In a land of action movies and MTV for teenagers and 50+ hour work weeks for "college educated" adults, I wonder what percentage of our population would have either the time or the patience to savor this masterpiece.  In fact, it might not be too bold to say that we can evaluate the level of education in a society by its ability to nurture the appreciation for works like this one.  I feel blessed for being given the opportunity to read it 
 Kate Sutton, at the order of Queen Mary, has been sent to live in a lonely, remote castle called Perilous Gard. Upon arriving, she learns of the mysterious disappearance of a small girl that occurred a few months prior, and of the strange behavior of the castle's residents. Rumor has it that the child had been abducted by Fairies. Having little else to occupy her time, Kate makes a bold decision to try to solve the mystery herself. The story was a little dry, and the romantic element felt a little too pat at the end, but the story was otherwise charming 
 Daddy Needs a Drink is a delightful peek into Robert Wilder's child-filled life, highlighting the ridiculous charm of his kids, Poppy and London, and the daily dilemmas and lessons parenting has taught him. From the first few pre-pregnancy tales, one of which involves listening in to his neighbors' dalliances via baby monitor, through his kids' adventures and misadventures, Wilder proves that he's laughing at himself most of all.  More than just "cute kid stories," Wilder explores the ways teaching his children right from wrong can often be unsettling for other adults, such as when his son decides to say the word "pussy" at many an inopportune time (not to mention "hipple") or teaching him about dwarfs ("dwarps" in London-speak). He explores his son's addiction to his nuzzies (blanket lint) and their attempts to wean him off of them.  Wilder also has an eye for the hypocrisy of other parents and teachers, pointing out their excesses and eccentricities. On the beach, he describes sitting near "High-Maintenance Mom" while he makes sand mermaids for his kids. When High-Maintenance Mom's daughter comes over to see what the fuss is about, Wilder writes: "The little girl left her mom and wandered over to what must have seemed like more fun than an outdoor office where your boss ignores you." No matter how much he may roll his eyes at certain parenting conventions, Wilder will never be the kind of dad who blatantly ignores his kids.  And, while humorous, Wilder exhibits a vulnerability that's refreshingly honest, most notably when he shares a crying bout upon observing his daughter on the playground. He's a dad who's willing to go above and beyond the call of duty, wearing a filthy Frosty the Snowman outfit, buying outrageous amounts of school supplies, and generally humoring his kids without spoiling them. His essays about his own father, whose love for Sam's Club knows no bounds, show their own deep connection.   Wilder's greatest gift is in making readers laugh, but never at the expense of anyone else. There are stories that his kids will likely one day laugh right along with, and he includes himself in the punchlines. He touches on telephone etiquette for kids, how to deal with his children's voluminous output of artwork, and balancing the needs and wants of two adults and two kids harmoniously, while also giving a glimpse into the rest of his family and his friends' adventures in parenting (where the terrible twos extend onward well past that famous age). This is well worth reading, whether you have (or even like) kids or not, and while his love and awe for his kids is clear from every page, Wilder manages to be hilarious and tender, but never sappy. Wilder doesn't claim to have all the answers, and learns along the way, painting fatherhood as an ongoing journey of learning, growing, and being changed by his role as a parent, and his humorous writing is all the better for this lack of a master plan or know-it-all advice. I will be giving this book  to all the new dads I know 
 Self-categorized on the book jacket as "Current Affairs," this book had me expecting an analysis of Israeli-Palestinian relations, the word "prisoners" in the title no more than a metaphor. In fact, a large part of the book takes place in an actual prison, and while it has much to say about Israeli-Palestinian relations, it is more correctly a memoir of an American Jewish journalist attempting to understand the nature of the conflict that has prevailed in that part of the Middle East since 1948. Finding the political in the personal, he tells of his own beginnings as a youthful Zionist living on Long Island and his years in Israel as his ideals are put to the test working on a kibbutz and then serving in the military police at a desert prison, where he first meets and attempts to befriend a Palestinian prisoner, Rafiq.  Later, working as a journalist based first in Jerusalem and then in Washington DC, the author travels often to Gaza and the West Bank to talk with Palestinians, many of them released prisoners, including his friend Rafiq. His conversations with Rafiq become a commentary on an accompanying account of the interlude of hope for resolution in the Oslo talks, the eventual collapse of the peace process, and the rise of suicide bombings. On both levels, it is a search for common ground that is as elusive as peace itself. The author clings to the hope that where friendship is possible between two men who cannot agree on anything else, coexistence is possible between Arabs and Jews.  This is a well written book that immerses the reader in the deeply bitter and violent conflict that has raged in this corner of the world for decades. The greater part of the book is peopled by Palestinians, each specifically drawn as they reveal themselves to the author, and representing a host of political points of view, from the reasonable to the extreme. Meanwhile, as the author's initial Leon Uris-fed idealism fades, the Israelis themselves are often portrayed as far less than admirable. Leavening the darkness inherent in his subject, the author often finds a kind of grim humor, frequently at his own expense, as he struggles to bring the light of reason to what becomes increasingly a litany of folly on all sides. Very much New Yorker style writing in its use of a personal perspective and its slow-moving, meandering structure, "Prisoners" makes for fascinating and rewarding reading. However, do not expect to be uplifted or reassured by its vision of a world mired in mutual distrust and hatred 
 My favorite sci-fi book, make sure you read Ender's Game before you read this one. The third book is good, the forth one is not so good.  This book is by far the best book I have ever read when it comes to this genre 
 I hope the interest in "Ask the Dust" (reprint and Hollywood film) will send many readers to this excellent biography.  If you want to learn more about Fante and the Los Angeles literary and screenwriting scene of his era, this book is a gold mine.  Recognition came late for Fante, and it wouldn't have come at all without Charles Bukowski's advocacy, but this biography, Robert Towne's feature film, and the Independent Lens documentary that aired recently on PBS ("A Sad Flower in the Sand") are helping to rectify the critical neglect.  Two comments on the other reviews.  Yes, it will be useful in the classroom.  I just taught "Ask the Dust" in a course at San Francisco State University, and this work was a huge help. And to those who could do without the endnotes, they were indispensable for me as I researched the life of Fante's friend Carey McWilliams.    
 I became interested in Sister Hazel a little over a year ago when I first heard their Chasing Daylight album. Having had grown up in the same area of Florida as the group did, I immediately recognized their care-free quasi-country feel under the broader urbanite category of Rock and Roll and immediately felt that this band had struck upon a unique mixture. What drew me to their content was the emotion of the songs and the artistic harmonizing that is so depressingly absent from current popular music.  Many people feel that this latest CD has departed from that down-home style they have come to expect from Sister Hazel, but I found it the perfect evolutionary step in the band's career. Not only is the content as deeply imbued with emotion as it has been in their past songs, but their skill at harmonizing has led to amazing vocalized chords and classic rock allusions as in the great song "Just What I Needed". If this were the eighties, this album would be playing at all of the roller-rinks. And besides, I still recognize that Florida feel in all of their tracks. Party songs like "All About the Love" litter this disc and truly lift Sister Hazel to a new level of popularity, while the emo-kid lurking inside all of us will get a chance to brood over and finally "Surrender" to this band's uplifting sound. 
 One of the best books I have found for different types of cards.  Not the same old run of the mill type card book.  Am glad I purchased it 
 This book is indispensable for anyone seeking solid information about China. No country has inspired more commentary, conflict and controversy, or given rise to more disparate and confusing predictions, projections and polemics. The authors - C. Fred Bergsten, Bates Gill, Nicholas R. Lardy and Derek Mitchell - focus on economic, political and security issues, carefully assessing the range of noteworthy opinions on each issue, and offering readers the data necessary to evaluate them. The authors do not attempt to make a case one way or the other. They provide an excellent, concise survey of contemporary thinking about China, with ample evidence for and against each viewpoint. We think that if you are only going to read one book on China, this should be it. If you are going to read several, start here 
 Jessica Lange plays a stressed out "crazy" military housewife who moves with her husband tommy lee jones and kids from hawaii to alabama.

LAnge has to go far to prove her love for Jones and she does. i read this movie sat on the shelf for three years becase its distributor Orion went out of business. Excellant movie and beautiful music 
 Without question Alexander Yakovlev is a unique individual: dissident, policy-maker, and truth-teller.  He directly participated in and personally witnessed the vastly different eras of the former USSR, from the highest levels.  Former Chief of the Propaganda Ministry of the Soviet Union.  Later, an adviser to Mikhail Gorbachev.  Yakovlev is considered to be the founding father of "Glasnost." He was also in the audience behind closed doors to personally hear Khrushchev's "secret speech" denouncing Stalin.    He is the highest ranking Party member to denounce the hypocrisy,  murders, incarcerations, and barbarity by leaders of the former USSR upon its own people.  (Of course, the former CCCP wasn't the only nation-state that has abused its own citizens.  The USA has done plenty of this.)  Alexander Yakovlev is one of the very select few who's been allowed into the ultra-secret and restricted Presidential archives in Moscow.  Among numerous facts he discovered, were that a total of 41 million Soviet citizens were sent to prisons in the USSR.     This book provides a lot of information about the period of Soviet history from the ascension of the Bolsheviks to Stalin's death in 1953.  This information from the Presidential Archives contains voluminous amounts of classified records and documents.  Obviously, historians are aware of Stalin's mass murders, psychopathology and lack of conscience.  Yet many documents Yakovlev noted were verbatim orders in writing by Lenin.  We learn from Lenin's own writings, that he was just as brutal, though perhaps less systematic.  Lenin led in turbulent times, before and after the Bolshevik victory.  He died peacefully, but soon after.  His death brought down any sense of humanity by the person who replaced him, who then air-brushed him out of history during his reign.      Numerous groups of people that were systematically repressed are listed in this book.  Again, this isn't a unique phenomenon in history nor is it exclusive to the former Soviet Union.   And intriguing book by an accomplished and interesting man.  Regardless of ideology, I tend to believe that: "The nature of states is to seek power above all."     --Political Theorist, Hans Morgantha 
 Definitely a great and historic war film. It offers Iwo Jima, one of the last great battles of World War II's Pacific Theatre. Ken Watanabe portrays General Tadami Kuribayashi, the defender of Iwo Jima. Kuribayashi battles impossible odds as most of the Japanese fleet has been destroyed and what was left of the army and naval airforces has been transferred to defend the Japanese mainland. Its only a matter of time before Japan loses the war. Letters from Iwo Jima offers this great battle from the Japanese perspective. As usual a superb performance by Ken Watanabe and an excellent film production by Hollywood great Clint Eastwood. A must buy for all war films fans 
 I assume the plot of this famous tale is well known, so I won't spend time on it, but in recently re-reading this book for the first time since ninth-grade English class in the '90's, I was repeatedly struck by a piercing question: how exactly over time does drama become melodrama? Will our cherished novels seem melodramatic to readers a hundred-forty years hence? How does this happen, and is there ever an end-point to it? Dickens was by any standard a literary master, and if typifying one's age is a virtue, then he does this to perfection, yet if failing to achieve a universality unhindered by time (as other writers have done) is a limitation, then in this one sense alone Charles Dickens has an Achilles heel 
 My little soccer star feels like a pro.  I only wish these came as a PAIR instead of a single.  It does fit nicely around his little wrist. 
 In the future, there is a special adult themepark called "Delos" which has three different area adventure worlds which are "Medieval World", "West World", and "Roman World" where realistic humanoid robots serve the guests with the vacation they will remember. Two Vacationers ( Richard Benjamin and James Brolin) has chosen Westworld where they can do anything they want but unfortunately as there's a malfuction the robots completely go bersek especially a deadly gunslinging robot ( Yul Bryner) who wants to kill them.  Amusing and fascinating Sci-fi thriller written and directed by the author of "Jurassic Park" Michael Crichton with some fine acting and good special effects for it's time. Yul Bryner himself steals the show as the bad guy who was an influence on "The Terminator", this has became a cult fave and one of the most interesting pre-Star Wars Sci-fi movies of that time and was parodied in the episode of the Simpsons called "Itchy and Scratchy Land".  The DVD has decent picture & sound with only one extras which is the original trailer, but still this is a must have for anyone who likes Sci-fi.  Also recommended: Jurassic Park, Terminator 1 & 2, Blade Runner, Tron, Robocop, I Robot, and Chopping Mall 
 Mr. Browne does an excellent job of examining a sports phenomenon which has not received much actual scholarly treatment.  His writing style is clear and level-headed, and the level of detail into which he goes is fascinating.  He's written a useful and comprehensive book which is also consistently entertaining.  I'd strongly recommend AMPED to anyone who would like to learn more about the subject matter in a pleasurable way 
 I LOVED this book.  I read a lot, and don't love most of what I read, but I loved this book.  Kamla quickly and steadily emerged as the wise and quiet commentary over the unstable and difficult struggle faced by the family she came to love (and not love).  I swear I could SMELL and TASTE India while reading this book 
 "1984" is one of the most well-known novels of the 20th century, perhaps ever. It is also one of the most misunderstood.   Many readers assume that the novel is anti-Communist and anti-socialist. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, Orwell was a socialist himself. During the Spanish Civil War, he fought for a revolutionary party called POUM, "the Workers Party for Marxist Unification". Sounds pretty socialist to me. Orwell was anti-Stalinist, but believed Stalinism to be a perversion of true socialism.   So is his novel an attack on Stalinism, then? Both yes and no. "1984" was written in 1948 and published in 1949. During this time, many intellectuals believed that Stalinism and capitalism would eventually merge, creating a new system, combining the worst aspects of both. This feared system of the future was often called "bureaucratic collectivism". Rizzi, Schachtman and Burnham believed it could happen. Trotsky vacillated on the issue. Orwell must have believed in the grim possibility of "bureaucratic collectivism" himself. That is what his novel is really all about.   "1984" is set in a futuristic society called Oceania. On the surface, Oceania is Stalinist. But on a closer look, it actually looks like a strange mixture of the Soviet Union and the British Empire. On the one hand, Oceania has a unproductive planned economy. On the other hand, it fights for colonial supremacy in Africa and Asia. Indeed, its main bases of power are the Anglo-Saxon nations.   The ideology of Oceania is called "English Socialism", an obvious combination of the British and the Soviet. Oceania is run by a party, divided into the Inner Party and the Outer Party. The underclass is called proles. This is both a reference to the hierarchic Stalinist party in the USSR, and to the traditional British class structure: upper class (Inner Party), middle class (Outer Party) and working class (the proles). Interestingly, the proles are kept in line by mass-produced pornography. This, of course, is another veiled reference to the West. No such thing existed in Stalins Soviet Union.   Even Big Brother himself may be a composite character. Principally, he is a symbol for Stalin, and apparently even looks like Stalin. (And his constant opponent, Goldstein, is a symbol for Trotsky. The mysterious "book" is presumably Trotskys "The Revolution Betrayed".) However, some people believe that the inspiration for Orwells slogan "Big Brother is Watching" comes from a 1930s advertising campaign in the US, where a certain corporate owner declared "Let me be your Big Brother" amidst an enormous portrait of himself!   "1984" is undoubtedly a very influential novel. Many terms from the book have become household words, like "Newspeak", "Thoughtcrime" and "Memory Hole". The same is true of the slogan "Big Brother is Watching You" or even the term "Orwellian", derived from the very name of the author. Indeed, if you havent read this novel, you could be considered culturally illiterate.   Its a pity that such a popular novel has been so misunderstood. But perhaps that is the fate of all popular novels 
 I first read The Michael Handbook several years ago and have found it one of the most useful in my spiritual "meanderings".  A description of this system was apparently first published by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, but has spread far and wide since (her publishing company doesn't seem too happy about that!).  The book being channeled doesn't bother me--if you can't be open minded about sprituality, you should pick another subject.   I like things spelled out clearly without a lot of double talk--the book does exactly that.  The more you read, the more you learn about yourself and why you are the way you are.  By the time you finish, you have a complete picture.  This picture isn't an excuse, it's a starting point.  You have to take it from there.  My only complaint would be the desktop publishing:  I'm a copy editor and I'm sorely tempted to edit it and send it back to the publisher to fix.  It doesn't seem like anyone proofread it 
 Adam, Ethan, and Ryan have everything they want in life with the exception of one thing - a woman who will complete them.  They've planned and dreamed of the day they'd finally find a woman who incites the passion in all three of them and is strong enough to love and accept each in return.  They'd just about lost hope until Adam trudged out to get the mail and finds Holly laying unconscious in the snow only yards from their home.  Holly is running from the man she married.  She's been running scared since her wedding night when she saw her new husband commit murder.   She was still running when her car broke down at the base of a mountain where the Colter brothers hunting lodge sits.  She'd walked to their lodge, but lost consciousness before reaching the door.  Next thing she knows, she's buck naked in a bathtub full of warm water with a gorgeous man standing over her.  As if that isn't enough of a shock to a girl's system, there are two more men waiting in another room and all three of them want to keep her - forever.  The Colter brothers agree that Holly is everything they want in the woman who will become their wife, lover, and eventually the mother of their children.  Convincing her that they're serious about wanting her to stay is going to be a bit trickier than any of them anticipated.  Holly is determined to keep running.  Not only is her husband a dangerous man, but she's also confused by her own desires for Adam, Ethan, and Ryan.  Being so turned on by all three men at the same time makes her a whore, doesn't it?   The brothers are going to have to do some serious explaining about their intentions toward her and why her attraction to all of them is acceptable and even desired.  Helping her to get a divorce as quickly as possible is imperative, but not nearly as important as keeping her safe from the man who wants nothing more than to see her dead.   Maya Banks COLTERS' WOMAN is an awesome story full of emotional turmoil, hot sweaty sex, and enough suspense to keep readers anxiously reading through each scene with bated breath.  Adam, Ethan, and Ryan each have vastly different personalities and needs.  Holly is faced with the prospect of trying to figure out their quirks and how best to deal with each man.  It's a bit overwhelming but she's up to the task.  This book is chock full of scenes that will have you close to tears one minute and laughing out loud, all while chewing anxiously on your fingernails.  The emotional bond that develops between the Colter brothers and Holly is a key factor throughout the story and readers won't soon forget any of these wonderful characters.  Beautiful job, Maya!  You've more than fulfilled my expectations with this endearing tale.  Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)  
 Underwater photography has been around for a long time. And in the days of film cameras each new major film body would be followed in a year or two with a housing to enable its use underwater. In those days camera bodies stayed in production for a long time.   With digital cameras, the industry is still in a period of fast change. The camera you buy today will probably be replaced in a year or two. The underwater housing people have come up with housing just about as fast as the cameras come out. Sometimes it seems even before the cameras are shipped.   Jack and Sue Drafahl have been underwater photographers for 35 years. They have made the change to digital and in this book describe the advantages and differences of using digital equipment underwater.   The book is a general introduction to underwater photography as well as covering the specialized parts of digital photography. Well worth reading before your trip to the islands 
 This is one of my favorite spiritual books.  I love Brother Lawrence.    I always picture him enraptured, laying cruciform before the oven on the floor of his kitchen, slain by the mystery of the baking bread..  (Taste and see the LORD is good..)  It's an arbitrary image, but I feel it catches what he was like.  Blessed Sweetness, everywhere found, in my heart dwell most profound!  He exemplifies for me what it means to be a Christian.  A couple of quotes:  "..In difficulties one had only to turn to Jesus Christ and ask for his grace, after which all became easy.."   "He gave thought neither of death, nor his sins, nor Paradise nor Hell, but only to do small things for the love of God.  Great things he had not in him the power to do.  That done, there would come upon him only what God should will.   And of that he had no concern... Thus he was concerned about nothing, feared nothing, and asked nothing save that he not offend God.."  This is the wisdom of Carmel.  Brother Lawrence springs from this same tradition that earlier had given the Church St. Simon Stock, St. Theresa of Avila and St. John of the Cross; and was to later produce St. Therese of Lisieux, the Little Flower.  This is the flaming heart of Christian spirituality, in its searing purity.    Each moment is another opportunity to surrender your heart to God.  The Holy Spirit is ever about and within us, and time is simply the unfolding of His grace.    As my second favorite Jesuit, Fr. G. M. Hopkins, once wrote: "The world is charged with the Grandeur of God: it shines out like shining from shook foil, it gathers to a greatness like the ooze of oil crushed.."  This book is yet another manifesto reminding us that it is God in whom we live & move and have our being.  He is intimately with us always, unto all time.  Peace, then.  Cultivate awareness of His presence.  You cannot be harmed.  Neither death nor sin can separate us from the love of God.  Only our eternal refusal to seek His mercy & embrace Him can do that.    Also check out anything by Fr. Jean Caussade SJ or St. Therese of the Child Jesus, the above mentioned Little Flower.  The French really had it going on back then.   Pray that la premiere fille de l'Eglise may once again regain her splendor.  Frere Laurent prie pour nous.    Father Elijah, transfigured with the Lord, intercede for us.       All the saints of Carmel, pray for us.   Our Lady of Mount Carmel, bless us 
 Gene Edwards does a wonderful job of pulling the reader in to join the adventure and capture the experience 
 kurt vonnegut's book slaughterhouse five is a great piece of literary work in itself. his unique style of black humor, combined with his vivid imagination is second to none. this book was exciting and unpredictable as i continued to read! its main purpose involved the struggle of a man with his grip on reality. is he, or is he not crazy?  the imagery in this book was another great element, and many regard this as one of the greatest anti-war books of the century. this book is definitely worth reading and will not disappoint! you can't go wrong with kurt vonnegut's slaughterhouse five 
 D'you ever wonder where all the stars of Burlesque went during the hot summer months before air conditioned theaters? Well, they went on the road in carnival shows, and this is the story of that world. This is a lovely, delightful, very informative book!I was enthralled by the stories of these plucky men and women who travelled across the country bumpin and grindin. This is a great book to read after watching "The Greatest Show On Earth". I especially enjoyed the sections on Burlesque performers, and the chapter on "Hooch" dancers was interesting too (kinda gives you some insight on why Vera Ellen was so horrified to be discovered as a hooch dancer by Gene Kelly in "On the Town"!) This book is an absolute must buy/must read!! 
 My first Michael Connelly - which led me to The Lincoln Lawyer, another Good Read - was an unexpected pleasure. Characters are fully-formed, sympathetic and believable. Writing style is relaxed but smart, overall plot (with some very good twists) is well crafted and has great flow. I'm now headed off to get the rest of Michael Connelly's books so I can read them in order. It's great to "discover" a new author (new to me) who is this skilled at storytelling. 
 I think this DVD is fantastic. This live performance is one the best i've seen. The music turns from heavy and angry to soft and melodic. The production is superb, the audio is great and the songs are played without a mistake. Once again these guys prove that they are amazing players. Petrucci, Portnoy, Rudess and Myung are awesome with their instruments. LaBrie is singing better and more controlled than in previous tours. I give a 4 star rating because the song list it's a bit disapointing, it could have been better. But, if you are a die hard fan, get this DVD! It's a must 
 I recommend reading this book to all parents interested in having a natural birth.    Ina May and her husband Stephen began `The Farm' in the early 1970's. The birth stories in Spiritual Midwifery come from women's experiences on The Farm. The Farm statistics include (as of the year 2000) 2028 births of those births 95.1% of all babies were born in the home, 4.9% were transported to the hospital and only 1.3% were emergency transports. This book is based on the over 2000 births that have taken place on `The Farm'.  In the USA over 30% of all women give birth through surgical procedure called a Cesarean Section.  Ina May's book gives support to the fact that birth is not a medical procedure. Spiritual Midwifery speaks to the normalcy of birth and explains why no more than 5-10% of women need a Cesarean Section to deliver babies.  Ina touches on topics such as tests given during pregnancy, natural birth, complications that may arise and how to manage them in and out of hospital setting and most importantly the book provides factual and time-proven information.  Spiritual Midwifery is on the bookshelf of most Midwives and homebirth Midwives.  If you are looking to have your questions and concerns addressed and answered this is the book to read. If you wish to buy just one book, this is the one. 
 In a world full of books that promise to show you the way to that elusive, successful conversion metric this one delivers. It not only explains the fundamentals but gives you some real-world insight and know-how. It is well written and an easy read. I've marked this book up with more highlighter than in a college text book. Definitely worth every penny 
 I've done some investigating on this book and James Frey as an author. When he first started looking for a publisher to publish A Million Little Pieces, we titled it as a non-fiction work, and was turned down for years. He finally put the title of Biography on his book and it immediately was picked up by a publisher.  All that aside whether he was right or wrong..the book is very well written. One of the best books I have read in a while. Frey is an amazing sensory writer and really lets the reader imagine the scenarios described. You can't help but feel sad for James at his lows and rejoice with him at his highs.  Overall..I would recommend this book to anyone with enough time, and the stomach for some graphic stuff : 
 Now in her fifth decade as a performer, Judy Collins has put together this compilation of songs by one of her favorite songwriters and poets, Leonard Cohen. In the charming reminiscences printed in the liner notes Collins traces their friendship, whose beginning dates back to the mid-60s and her album "In My Life," which included recordings of "Suzanne" and "Dress Rehearsal Rag."   These two tracks are reissued here along with other Cohen songs from her various albums, plus three new recordings: Cohen's range (and Collins' marvelous voice, astonishingly untouched by time) is evident in the contrast between the rousingly optimistic, though clear-eyed "Democracy" and the ineffable poignance of "Night Comes On." The singer has always had the voice and the emotional depth to do justice to the full array of Cohen's art, and while one could feel a bit disappointed that there are just three new tracks, it's impossible not to fall under the spell of her renditions of "Suzanne," "Sisters of Mercy," and "Famous Blue Raincoat" all over again.  In addition, with the current world situation, lyrics such as those in "Story of Isaac" gain a new bite: "You who build these altars now to sacrifice these children/You must not do it any more/For you never had a vision and you never have been tempted/By the Devil or the Lord." The astonishing metaphor at the heart of "Joan of Arc," the Saint as the bride of fire, is as vivid as ever, hardly marred by some uncertain tuning in the wordless harmonies of the chorus.  It's powerful stuff, and music fans can hear it all again on this disc. Thanks to Leonard Cohen for giving us these songs, and Judy Collins for singing them 
 I have read a number of cartooning books, some by people who are "household names", but never one  this good! This book covers what every cartoonist wants to know, cutting through the unnecessary   "stuff". I would put this book in the hands of everyone  interested in the fine art of cartooning 
 I am a High school Coach and found this book to be very helpful. It applies not only to the business world but to all athletes.  the one problem that I have is that I went online to do the self assestment and there is no such website.  Thats not good considering I was going to teach this book to my athletes and then have them work online to work on their skills.  Don't offer something then not have it available.  thats false advertising 
 If you like west coast gangsta s*$t, then this is a must have.  "We about to get fucc up," is the best track on this album if not the best west coast track for 2001.  "Dip wit me"  is the 2nd best track, "coastin" is cool too. definitely check this album out........... 
 This book has a very nice cover--really, a very cool design. I'm a little more equivocal about its insides. I was excited enough by the advance blurbs I read for this book to purchase it in hardcover a week or so after it was published--an extravagance that would shock those who know me well. But this topic appeals to me, and I like to throw a little support behind this sort of publishing enterprise once in a while.  The book is interesting enough, and Yagoda does a good job of keeping things moving with lots of examples of and chatter about style from practicing writers. My problem is with one of the book's enabling conventions: The idea that Strunk & White's The Elements Of Style presents an outmoded and "soul-deadening" idea of style and that only books such as Yagoda's truly plumb the subject to its core.  I've seen this sort of thing before, most notably in Clear and Simple as The Truth, by Thomas and Turner--a book weirdly bent on defying its own title and premise. The idea is to construct a straw man out of the immensely popular The Elements Of Style and then throw eggs at it. But it's an approach that anyone who knows Strunk & White well will recognize as a canard.   It's largely a made-up polemic, probably caused by the fact that writers are constantly being prodded to find and exploit "the angle" of the story. Magazines prod this way, so do agents and book publishers. It's not good enough to present a solid proposal for an article or book that simply discusses an interesting subject; there must be an angle, and the more controversial the better. And though it's hardly Watergate, smearing The Elements of Style is what passes for provocative in this crowd.   Yagoda states that Strunk & White's goal is prose that offers "...no trace of the author--no mannerisms, no voice, no individual style...." And then, in refutation of this fabricated Strunk & White "ideal," he fills his book with examples of writers who write with identifiable styles--ranging from subtle to sledgehammer. The examples are fun--these are really good writers--but he's wrong about The Elements of Style.   The first four fifths of The Elements of Style are largely about style in the sense of mechanics and word usage. No trouble there--that's not the kind of style we're talking about in the Yagoda book. In section five of The Elements, though--the section titled "An Approach to Style"--E. B. White takes a stab at offering beginning writers some simple, sound advice for clearing their prose of dross and deadwood so that they can begin the project of developing their own voice and personality on the page.   White's project, then, is to help a writer clear the decks so that the "self" can escape "into the open." Yagoda's mistake (and Harold Bloom's, on page xxi of Yagoda) is in thinking that White wants writers to stop once they've swept their prose free of clutter--to end with complete, bland transparency. But he doesn't; transparency, in White's view, is simply the necessary precondition for achieving one's individual voice as a writer--just as an empty canvas is the necessary precondition for painting a picture. "As he becomes proficient in the use of language," White says, "his style will emerge, because he himself will emerge." Does that sound like a recipe for "no mannerisms, no voice, no individual style"?  I am an editor who has worked with nonfiction writers for sixteen years. I press The Elements of Style on many of them--particularly those having trouble organizing their thoughts or getting their words out in a clear, compelling way--and it usually helps. It is only after mastering the fundamental tools of clear expression (the craft of bringing thought to page relatively intact) that a writer's personality, his "voice" or style, can begin to permeate his prose.   I have to believe it's been a long time since either Yagoda or Bloom spent an evening grading undergraduate essays (if indeed undergraduates are still required to write essays). The usefulness of The Elements of Style for such writers (if they study the book and apply its lessons) is incontrovertible.   Yagoda and Bloom, in fact, recognize the validity of White's approach, in spite of their trendy protestations. Bloom, page 159: "I have made the conscious effort to write in a more straightforward and accessible way." (Thank you, Harold.) Yagoda, page 236: "...the clearing of brush to create a walkable path, is never-ending for a writer." (That as near a restatement of White's thesis in "An Approach to Style" as you're likely to find.)  As for whether or not a writer can learn to write with "style" by reading this book, as Alex Beam's blurb on the back cover promises, the answer is no. A book such as this, while providing fun examples of style at work, is really no more or less instructive than the rest of a writer's (preferably wide) reading, from which he will sift and sort (consciously or not) the possibilities of voice, tone, and style in the ongoing effort to develop his own sound on the page 
 Very important information to help anyone with carb counts. Highly recommend. 
 The "Power and the Glory" is arguably Graham Greene's finest book.  The story takes place in central Mexico during the early 1930's as the Mexico's Communists try to rid the country of the Catholic Church.  A bounty is on the head of the last remaining priest in the state, a nameless destitute drunk.  A Federale lieutenant, whose sole mission is to put every priest in front of the firing squad, is on his trail.  The priest is pursued not only by the lieutenant but his inner demons; he doesn't believe he's martyr material nor is he inclined to become one.  He is a sympathetic character but the  Church he represents isn't.  He is torn between survival and priestly responsibilities which lead to an inevitable conclusion.  The underlying irony that Greene points out is that neither Communism nor the Church treat the poor any differently, "institutions" receive the bread and the poor receive the crumbs, except the Church offers the "Hereafter".  Although written in 1940, Greene's prose is a joy to read; you become absorbed in this book, are carried away and hate to see it end 
 Actually I am, I'm just trying to get at that guys goat who wrote that nasty review, with comparisons to elvis.  There is no comparing Elvis to Johnny, there is no denying Elvis' Sun recordings are great, even if he did nothing at all worthwghile after leaving Sun.  However everything Johnny Burnette recorded in this part of his career is worthwhile, almost, he did sell out like Elvis later on...  So in many ways thier careers are comparable.  They are different artist and not comparable, one is not better then the other, it would be like comparing johhny cash with Hank Williams, Sr., both good country artists but totally different styles.  This cd is exellent, and I recomend it, along with The Sun Elvis cd, buy them both today and stop comparing and just enjoy the musi 
 This is the least preachy bible study I've ever read.   Kushner divides his chapters by themes and suggests, but does not demand, a theological answer which supports his thesis: that an all-knowing God can server the cause of good yet not function as a safety belt.  He supports it with elements from his own experience.   Since his language is comforting and conversational, anyone can relate to him as a speaker. Well worth it! 
 I spent some time in a particular record shop in L.A. as a twenty-something.  In 1984, I kept examining a 2-disc live Jazz set called, 'TRAVELS' because something about the cover intrigued me.  Finally, one day I broke down and purchased it even though I'd never heard of THE PAT METHENY GROUP.  Every once in awhile you roll the dice and win big.  Since then, Pat Metheny has enriched my life like no other musician!  It wasn't long before I discovered that some purely magical quality about his compositions (The tempo?  No.  The rhythms?  Hmmm...) made them conducive to stress-free driving and seemingly transformed life seen through the windshield into some kind of imaginary movie.  Oddly, everything one sees seems to be the ideal visual accompaniment to the music that is playing at all times.  (I'll never forget listening to 'TRAVELS' through headphones while traveling by locomotive through the deep woods between Fort Bragg and Willits, California.  It was a nearly mystical experience!)  After awhile I acquired other P.M.G. recordings like his elaborately textured, Brazilian-accented sets, 'THE FIRST CIRCLE', 'STILL LIFE (TALKING)', and 'LETTER FROM HOME' (my favorites) and found that I could put any one of them into my car player and let it repeat for - LITERALLY - a month or more without tiring of it.  Because Metheny's sound DID gain a deeper and richer resonance over the years and because I never owned 'AMERICAN GARAGE' on lp, I didn't realize that this disc was poorly mastered, as several other reviewers have pointed out.  But it's true : the sound has a pronounced high-end jangling to it, and while it won't entirely infringe on your listening pleasure, it does leave something to be desired.  (Like a little bass perhaps!)  The first two tracks, (CROSS THE) HEARTLAND and AIRSTREAM are great open road pieces, evoking images of corn and wheat fields seen flashing by at 65 miles an hour from the interstate, and the titles indicate that early on, Metheny realized that his music inherently expresses a sense of motion.  THE SEARCH features some very delicate and pretty piano work from Metheny's longtime musical collaborator, Lyle Mays.  The title track, AMERICAN GARAGE, shows the Group in a revved up mood and employing some distinct Gospel inflections.  This is closer to Rock than Jazz.  And although I do enjoy THE EPIC - aptly titled at 13 minutes - it tends to meander just a bit.  The whole album times out at just under 36 minutes - about half of the musical content found on most of his later releases.  'AMERICAN GARAGE' would be worth having if just for that great album cover : The deep blue, cloud-kissed sky and soft Autumn light reflecting off of an Airstream dealership.  (Are you old enough to remember those large silver bullets being pulled all across the heartland?  And the yearning to travel the countryside that they instilled in the mind?)  Even so, I would have to place 'AMERICAN GARAGE' into Metheny's Second Tier of music.  In my subjective opinion, the "Metheny Must-Haves" are the aforementioned titles, plus 'SECRET STORY.'  If you dig those, then you may want to explore this disc, also 'WE LIVE HERE' (his trademark guitar synthesizer finds a funky groove thang), '80/81' (for straightforward Jazz), and 'BEYOND THE MISSOURI SKY' with Charlie Haden (for those late night / early morning super mellow hours at home).    [*WARNING : Make sure you've already heard what you're buying if it is "Pat Metheny" without his "Group."  I don't necessarily like every album he's produced, even with the "Group", but a few of his solo projects are nothing more than "experiments" in dissonance!]  Just as a dog has never really experienced a walk until it has ditched its leash, you, my friend, have never really experienced a "road trip" until you've traveled with the Pat Metheny Group.  If Stephen T. McCarthy is driving, you can be sure that Pat is playing! 
 If your interested in finding out what all the hype is about, or just wanting some interesting techniques to try out, buy this book. it covers dar mak, chin na, and many combination hand and feet techniques. A very  good compliment to a wing chun student's martial arts librar 
 I got this book as a gift from a boyfriend who loved it, and it took me forever to actually get around to reading it, even though it is very short. I finished reading it sitting on a bench in a park in Manhattan, an appropriately precious setting for a book like this. At times, and especially at the start, I found that the book was trying too hard to be different and charming, but by the end I found it did create a unique world for itself and succeeded in what it set out to do. It is certainly an important book, given the time it was written and the social situations it presents, and it serves as an excellent young adult book for those who want to read about actual aspects of life and not sugarcoated teen romances 
 This is the best book I ever bought. I'm a shade lover, due to easy care and most of all...hostas. Until I read Larrys comments on shade, I thought I was the only one who wished my entire yard was shade, and that I may be a lazy gardener. Not anymore! This book is packed full of great ideas for shade gardens, and lots of tips. Theres also plants biographies of those that do well in shade, and he continually reminds you that many "sun" plants do well in light shade. I enjoyed the section on starting a new garden from scratch. His sense of humor is great and its easy to read and well organized. This is a MUST HAVE for those that enjoy shade gardening, and for those who think shade is their enemy. You'll have a new respect for shade after reading this book 
 Anyone interested in either Wittgenstein or poetry should read this book.  It does a remarkably good job of both philosophical and literary analysis,  making the case that poetry, like philosophy as conceived by Wittgenstein,  embodies the curious collision of the mystical with the mundane which best  demonstrates the limits of language.  Tightly reasoned and methodical, the  book explains why Wittgenstein has had so much influence on aesthetic and  ethical projects of the Twentieth Century, and suggests why that will  continue.  "The pursuit of the ordinary may well be the most  interesting game in town.&quot 
 Paint Shop Pro X, as released by Corel after buying the software from JASC, was supposedly a revision of the program in a new user friendly, learning friendly direction.  Unfortunately, the program's on screen help is horrible, and the official manual is nearly worthless.  PSP 9 had a much better manual, and if you upgraded from PSP 9 and already understood the program then you may not need this book.  But if you're new to PSP, you desperately need some kind of substitute manual, and this book is the best I've seen.  PSP has loads of features beyond the one click fixes.  This book is far from being a "turgid" study of each feature.  There is so much to cover, it's more of a highlight reel.  In fact, that's this book's main problem.  It shows, both for photographers and--to some extent--painters and web designers and others who use PSP X, how to do many things, but sometimes it doesn't explain fully enough what one is doing.  It runs through some steps without explaining what each step does.  If users had that understanding, they could better use the program to do additional things.  In fact, that's why I'm writing this review: to encourage the authors to put a little more detail in future editions.  Having said that, I would guess that for most users this book can be very useful in pointing out many of the things they can do with PSP X.  It'll take considerable addition experimentation on screen to fully figure out PSP X, though.  But it would be awful to try to figure out PSP X without this book's help.  And no, the "casual user" cannot do well by just hitting the one click fixes and not learning more: the one click fixes aren't good enough, and the more is too valuable to miss 
 I heard Erin's voice on a Christmas collection, and immediately had to go to the liner notes to find out who was singing.  Having not heard of her by name before, I went online and found her web site.  That was when I was amazed to learn that she is just a teenager.  She sounds so much more "seasoned" while singing a style well beyond her years.  Equally impressive is to note that she has composed and co-written most of the songs.  A real talent, especially in a style not often associated with someone this young.  After listening to the album several times, I am glad to place it in my collection--somewhere between Diana Krall and Norah Jones, as she seems to blend those two artists and styles.  Very nice and sultry.  Well done musicianship in the band.  A great overall sound, style, and an enjoyable listening event.  How nice to hear a "youngster" that someone more "senior" in age can enjoy listening to.  I'm looking forward to a follow-up to this album 
 I liked this DVD but some episodes...........I've seen them so many times I just get sick of them.But this was a pretty good DVD 
 The explaination of each individual element of the scientific paper  is very well presented. I would give 5 starts if it include some examples 
 East, West is most readily accessible work of Rushdie. The stories are high entertaining, and each of the nine stories manages to create well-defined character sketches, as well as plots with interesting twists, myths and humor. The story about Columbus and Isabella is full of laughs, about Courter is full of sentimental exuberance, one about Chekov and Zulu delves into Indra Gandhi's assination and its effect on the friendship of a Sikh and a Hindu (very poignant for us who witnessed the tradegy), and there are others that deal with the charade of charlatan, the obsession of occult of some Cambridge students and so on. These stories reflect how well Rushdie captures both the Eastern and Western personalities and history and how he manages to combine them to make stories worth relishing 
 IN THE BEDROOM is a film about the parents of a college age son who have to cope with his death and the ways in which the death of their only child changes their lives completely. Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson are Ruth and Matt Fowler, a teacher and doctor respectively. The two reside in mid-coast Maine and have comfortable lives centered on their son and careers. Frank, their son, played by Nick Stahl, has what he calls a summer fling with Natalie Strout, a divorced mother of two sons played by Marisa Tomei.  Natalie loves Frank's innocence and the role he plays in her son's lives and we do get the sense that something serious may occur. Life changes when Richard Strout, played by William Mapother, returns to town. He claims to want to reunite with Natalie, but the motive stems more from jealousy than anything else. Frank is killed by Richard. The bulk of the film is the aftermath of the death as experienced by Ruth and Matt.  When the film was released, critics applauded the performances of Spacek and Wilkinson, and viewers will see that the accolades are well earned. We do get a sense of the pain the two face, and we feel for them. The on location filming gives the film an authentic feel. Viewers who know Maine's mid-coast will see many familiar attractions in Rockport and Camden where the film takes place. Even the route numbers for the hidden Maine highways are also accurate. The only fault I found was with Marisa Tomei's "Maine accent." To me it sounded like a Brooklyn accent with dropped "R" sounds, but this is nitpicking and it by no means was a distraction. As a matter of fact I'm sure only a Boston born and Massachusetts raised would have noticed the accent.  As some reviewers have noted, the film is not fast paced, which after reading the summary on the cover, may catch people by surprise. For me, this is not a drawback. The film is based on a story by writer Andre Dubus, a writer whose words should be savored and appreciated and the pace and length of this film allows viewers to savor and appreciate the moods and feelings of the characters.  
 This book is a very informative and easy to understand resource for students and non-students as well. You will receive the answers to all your writing questions!  You won't be disappointed with this purchase!  
 Sizing Up the Senate is a book every doubter of the US government should read.  It is well researched, well written, and pathbreaking in what it analyzes.     The authors analyze the different relationships big state and small state Senators have with their constituents, the differences in legislative strategies used, the different committees big state and small state Senators tend to join, and finally the differences in federal funding.   For constituents, small state Senators rely on old-fashioned hand-shake campaigning and constituent service, big state Senators rely on TV media. Small state Senators do most of their fundraising in the year before the election, big state Senators do fundraising continuously. Small state Senators also tend to win reelection by wider margins, and small state residents have much higher opinions of their Senators than big state residents do of theirs.   For strategies, if a vote in the Senate is going to be close, small state Senators are much more likely than big state Senators to hold out in hope of getting something for their state. Lee and Oppenheimer analyze over thirty votes that were delayed because of hold outs and find that small state Senators were the ones holding out over half the time. If a big state and small state Senator are both holding out, the small state Senator is more likely to be the one rewarded, since a reward to his state is less expensive than a reward to a large state Senator.    Small state Senators basically function like Congressmen. Instead of working on big issues of national concern, they tend to work on getting projects for their districts (or, "states"). Small state Sens have an incentive to do pork barrel work because getting a bridge built in, say, Montana, is going to have a proportionally bigger political payoff than getting a bridge built in Florida.   For committee assignments, small state Sens try to get on committees that deliver pork. Since 1947, the Senators on Appropriations have come from states with an average of 5.29 Congressmen, since 1947, the Senators on Energy and Public Works have come from states with 3.29 Congressmen, the Senators on Veterans Affairs come from states with an average of 4.61 Congressmen, and the Senators on Commerce have come from states with an average of 6.18 Congressmen. By contrast, the Senators on Foreign Relations, Small Business, Labor, and Banking, come from states with an average of 7.63 to 8.89 Congressmen.   Finally, Oppenheimer and Lee show that small states get a much bigger share of the federal budget pie than larger states. They demonstrate that California is shortchanged by billions of dollars every year.   Lee and Oppenheimer show how the checks that the Framers of the Constitution wanted on the Senate have never functioned. They also show how the two-Senator rule was just the product of a compromise, and not any theory about government (in fact, Madison, Hamilton, Wilson, and Franklin all opposed equality).   
      I enjoyed this book immensely.  I love adventure mixed with history and little science anyway.   All the Biblical references were on target, the history was challenging, the relationship between the two main characters was not too mushy.     Read it 
 Overall I think that "Eat Fat, Lose Fat" is a book to consider for the general population. Americans are too obese and spend more time in the middle of the supermarket than on the peripheral aisles, where most of the good foods are (Meats, dairy, produce).   What I question in this book is it's choice of sweeteners. It lumps the sweetener xylitol in with harmful artificial sweeteners such as aspartame and sucalose. Xylitol is a healthy, natural sweetener that occurs in the birch bark. It has anti-septic properties that make it ideal for chewing gums, even nasal washes. It replaces sugar in 1:1 ratio, no "sugar" spike. The authors must have it confused with soribtol, maltitol and lactital and their abilities to cause stomach distress. Nothing wrong with xylitol, and would prefer to use it over maple sugar, which they recommend, and gives me a sugar rush every bit as much as a slice of white bread.  I also question the ration of proteins, carbs and fats. Only 10% protein? Maybe for a sedentary person, but for any athlete or weekend warrior who is involved in weight training of any kind, that percentage is extremely low, especially if the trainer is on a muscle building program!  I also question the use of dolomite. Other holistic health practitioners advise staying away from dolomite as it has a few questionable adverse side effects by consuming it.  I see this diet in some ways resembles the Ornish Diet in that you spend an inordinate amount of time traveling from specialty shop to specialty shop, searching for the ingredients needed to make many of the recipes.  I'll try several, but I'm pretty much going to stick to what I am doing, which is cooking with coconut oil and adding cod liver oil to my diet, along with some of the other superfoods that are recommended 
 This film has often been compared to Pasolini's Salo. Except for some superficial elements, they don't have much in common. Granted, those superficial elements are enormous and shocking, but the resemblance stops there. The Pasolini film is faithful to Sade in spirit and philosophy if not always in detail. This movie doesn't really go there at all. So the only thing they really have in common is the fact that the situations are disgusting and repulsive, but serious in intent.  The existence of good is validated by the existence of evil. And there can be no ultimate good without ultimate evil. Recommended reading: Simone de Beauvoir: Must We Burn Sade 
 I rate "The Turn of the Screw" 5 stars for one reason and one reason only.  Namely: After a century of debate, with one side poised against another as to the true meaning of this story;  after the ambiguous and specious statements made by James himself concerning the story, one can only come to one conclusion, an unsettling one for the many devotees of this story; but one I think is the correct conclusion for this long debated and long lasting tale.  Thusly:  Heny James has perpetrated a very ingenious hoax on the readers of his little treatise into the unusual, "supernatural" occurrences that inhabit this world he invented, and these happenings' consequences on the human mind.  In short, the whole story is a one big joke on the reader.  Think about it.  Learned scholars have debated this story and its meaning for the better part of a century.  Yet no one can conclusively say what the story means.  Intellectuals have attempted to apply freudian interpretations to unlock its mysteries but with no success.  When practically every line in a book can be taken in two ways.  When sentences of importance to the heart of a story are craftily written so as to impose dual meanings upon the reader endeavoring to unlock the story's mysteries; and when the author himself refuses to lead you to some conclusion to those mysteries (even with the subtlest of clues either in the story or in his commentaries of the story); you have a hoax plain and simple.  A monumental joke where the reader senses a deeper, hidden meaning constantly beyond his grasp, but almost at his fingertips!  Put one more way: when everything of importance in a story means two things, then everything of importance in the story means nothing; and thus cannot not be important, unless you recognise that it means nothing.  A very clever and amusing work. A practical joke of deception that if luck is with you, you will have people talking about your work until the Crack of Doom!  (And Mr James has almost made it!)      So 5 stars for a very intricate and enigmatic joke; but one star if you expect to read a deeply psychological/metaphysical tale of horror.  Your imagination supplies the horror, whilst Mr James stands on the bank of the river Styx supplying the laughter of his well done deception. That laughter growing ever louder as your perplexity increases, along with your increasing desire to finally finish the puzzle from a box with no pieces!   IN CHRIST JESUS: THE LORD GOD INCARNATE!!!

 Finally! After researching and collecting Italian cookbooks for several years, I bought this one and realized it's what I've been hoping to find all along.   Good, tasty, natural, earthy food. Not fussy or overdone, just something you'd cook for your family. The recipes are wonderful.  I wanted to serve an Italian meal for 10 people, and here are the ideas that I'll use from her book: Roasted Red & Green Peppers, White Bean Salad with Fresh Sage & Thyme, and Black Olive Spread for appetizers - with cheeses, of course. Add to that her recipes for Osso Buco, Saffron Risotto, Basic Bread (Dough), and Gelato di Limone - and you've got a memorable meal.  It's like living next door to a good cook who's willing to share her recipes with you. I know these will become family favorites -and keep my reputation as a good cook intact.   Thanks, Patricia! You did all the hard work.  
 Anthony Hamilton's third album is entitled "Ain't Nobody Worryin'". The twelve beautiful songs on this album are produced by: Mark Batson, Raphael Saadiq, Christopher Pottinger, James Poyser, Andre Harris & Vidal Davis and last but not least Kelvin Wooten. It's necessary to mention these producers because together with Anthony they have done a great job.  There's a variety of subjects that Anthony Hamilton addresses on "Ain't Nobody Worryin'". Besides the loves songs-sung from different points of view- you'll hear songs with a critical note towards society and some deep comtemporary gospel songs. We know Anthony from his soulful RnB-songs but there's a high quality reggae surprise called "Everybody" included on this album.   Throughout the album you'll hear that Anthony Hamilton is a singer who is born and raised in the South and that he has his roots in Church. He'll bring you joy, drama, love, hope and consolation. On "Preacher's Daughter" featuring his wife Tarsha' McMillian Hamilton, it's like you hear the vicar speaking.  Anthony Hamilton's voice is gorgeous. It's dark, clear and so full of apparently real emotions which lifts him up far above the level of the average good singer. His lyrics are so cleverly chosen and combined that everyone feels what he's singing about. An example of this is the title song which is critical towards society but yet hopeful for the individual person. A song like "Pass Me Over" feels so good to the soul. Two smashing old school beauties on "Ain't Nobody Worryin'" that'll take you right down memory lane are "Never Love Again" and "Change Your world". "Ain't Nobody Worryin'" is an excellent album from a big southern Country Boy. 
 Dr. Michael Savage is the bad-boy of nationally-syndicated conservative talk-radio, with his home-brewed brand of populist conservatism (as apposed to doctrinaire free-market conservatism, for example), and his take-no-prisoners style. This book is Dr. Savage's latest political opus, and takes aim at some of the biggest targets in politics today. But, don't think that only Democrats are targeted herein, George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Newt Gingrich, Rudy Giuliani, and even Rush Limbaugh feel the sting of Dr. Savage's examination.  Yeah, Dr. Savage is a trained botanist and anthropologist, so this book takes the form of a zoography, with all of the various political animals examined, classified...and thoroughly exposed! Overall, I found this to be hilariously funny. Heck, even if you are not a conservative, you will like Dr. Savage's piercing wit, and his willingness to skewer sacred cows to the Left, and to the Right.  I loved this book, and highly recommend it! 
 This is one hard to find CD, finally I brought this album through an Amazon.com marketplace seller. And I am glad I did. This album is one of the best releases by Leeb & Peterson. As a long time fan of early Delerium, this album reminded me of Delerium's 'Semantic Spaces and 'Stone Tower' releases with its lite industrial beats and ambient sometimes dark synths mixed with tribal and natural sounds. There are 7 songs on this CD and all songs range from 8 mins to 11 mins in length, so the listener has time to take in each song and enjoy the sounds and the journey each separate song takes you down. Tracks 1 to 6 are remastered songs from other Synaesthesia CD's. Track 7 'Descartes' is a rare find a B-Side and is well worth the listen. I am very happy with this CD and its a wonderful journey into the inner sanctum of the mind and dreamscape. 
 I have hepatitis C and I've read everything there is on it. This book is the best I have seen. It offers hope for those with hepatitis c with a look at the most important herbs, supplements, and foods to heal hep c. The  clinical trial research supporting these herbs is incredible. Buhner is a  great writer and shows tremendous control of his subject. If you or a loved  one suffers from this disease you can't afford not to buy this book. It can  save your life. Highly recommended 
 I bought this book eventhough I own the dvd because the movie was fantastic and absolutly hilarious. Bridget Jones's Diary (the book) is equally as funny, it differs slightly from the movie but not too much, this works well because it adds new scenes and information into the story and life of Bridget Jones. It's a very well written, quick read that will remain on my bookshelf for a very long time. I recommend it to all 
 It's a good CD, not a Great one. It's a reflex od rhe second age in Schulze's music. If you like Klaus music, hear "Picture Music" or "Timewind" instead 
 Season 1 is truly addictive! The only circumstance that stopped me from watching the entire Season 1 at once was that I had to eat! The story lines are fantastic! The acting is so real that one forgets that the viewer is watching it on your TV! Buy it! Watch it! But one word of caution! Have a protable frig next to you loaded with food so you don't have to move 
 I chose the 1,000 or so page Wordsworth Classics paperback edition of The Life Of Johnson (ISBN 1 85326 797 x) and was very pleased I did. The book had a nice heft to it, and the print was large enough for a comfortable read. My only major beef with this edition is that Boswell's text is replete with quotations from a variety of languages including Latin, Greek, French, Italian and others, and very few of them are translated into English. Whether the editor assumed that the average modern reader is a polyglot, or was unable to provide the translations for some other reason, I feel deprived at not having had access to this portion of the book's material, particularly as the quotes are most often used to gild the lily of one of Johnson's witticisms. Nevertheless, the book rewards the diligent reader with a wealth of intellectual stimulation, and offers a fascinating look into the England of the period including: polite London society, Oxford University, and jaunts around the British and Scottish countryside. Johnson's somewhat eccentric life and personal habits are lovingly and affectionately relayed by his close friend Boswell, who somehow managed to preserve a vast amount of Johnson's conversation without the aid of a tape recorder. With everyday life as a backdrop, we see how Johnson, a self-described lazy man, managed to produce such an abundant literary legacy, not the least of which was his groundbreaking dictionary. I recommend this book highly to people with an interest in 18th century England, the literary society of the period, or who simply love a great biography 
 Great book!!!!!!  Lots of great information about how the media works.......also the real story of Nazism and Pan-Germanism  
 I can only compare my reaction to this story to wanting to turn a boat around - or seeing an accident about to happen and being powerless to do anything about it.  "Memory Keeper's" begins with such a terrible lapse in judgement - that the reader can only watch and wait for all of the life-changing experiences and disasters that will predictably result.  As one deception after another unfolds, I longed to scream, "Enough".  Tell the woman the truth, for goodness sake - who appointed you the keeper of all moral/immoral decisions?  I felt yanked back and forth - feeling sympathy, empathy, anger, frustration, and most of all, exhaustion.  If the true test of a good book is arousing all those feelings, and ignoring the pain, plunging back into the book at every opportunity,  then this is a blockbuster.  This will be a tough book to follow, but I'll be there the day Kim Edward's next one comes out 
 This is David Sedaris' first book. If you like his collections of essays, you won't necessarily enjoy this. The first story, Parade, is about all the male celebrities the narrator has slept with. Glen's Homophobia Newsletter Vol. 3, No. 2 is just that, and involves Glen bitterly recounting unrequited love with a cashier. Giantess is about Sedaris trying to publish some fetish erotica. Definitely not the usual ex-pat-from-a-crazy-family stories he's so widely known for.  If you pick this up expecting it to be like his more popular books, you're going to be disappointed. The stories are dark, which most people can't stand because they see Sedaris as a humorist. However, if you look at how dark his humor is, you'll see that what's going on in Barrel Fever isn't much different from his usual style.  (This book includes the following short stories: Parade; Music for Lovers; The Last You'll Hear from Me; My Manuscript; Firestone; We Get Along; Glen's Homophobia Newsletter Vol. 3, No. 2; Don's Story; Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!!; Jamboree; After Malison; Barrel Fever. It also includes the following essays: Diary of a Smoker; Giantess; The Curly Kind; SantaLand Diaries. 
 Just so you know, there are several JOKE SPOILERS here.  I saw this uproarious roast of William Shatner several times when Comedy Central aired and re-aired it last August. After the wickedly funny Comedy Central verbal drubbing of Pamela Anderson last year (2005), I was wondering who they were gonna put next in the chair of humiliation. Well, it turned out to be Captain James Tiberius Kirk himself. I thought the idea of the iconic and self-mocking William Shatner was a brilliant follow-up and a chance for the roasters to really outdo themselves. Now, I haven't seen this uncensored version yet (there was a Shatner roast pay-per-view, but I wasn't about to put out the chump change for it), so I'm basing these comments on the edited television release by Comedy Central, not on the forthcoming dvd. Being a completist kind of fella, odds are I'll amend this "review" as soon as I get the actual dvd in my paws. But, for now...  William Shatner must be blessed with towering self-esteem, along with a very keen sense of humor, to have withstood all the verbal onslaught and still come out intact and laughing; the roasters absolutely took no pity on him, and, yet, there Shatner was, chortling and seemingly having the time of his life. George Takei and Nichelle Nichols represent the original Star Trek cast in person, while Leonard Nimoy opens the festivities with a video clip conversation with Shatner, even managing to get a dig in as he tries to talk his former shipmate out of doing the roast ("Why are you doing this? Is it for the food?"). Takei, by the way, comes in as a well-humored and thick-skinned dude and, for his own part, gleefully aims several well-honed, gut-busting zingers at his fellow roasters (poor Farrah Fawcett); having just come out of the closet in October 2005, in Frontiers magazine, he actually takes almost as many shots as Shatner. However - and this just may be me being influenced by all the rumors of the animosity which Shatner's Star Trek co-actors held for him - I did sense a certain tension between Shatner and Takei (and, no, it's not sexual tension), when one was speaking of the other, and vice versa. And where was Walter Koenig? He's still alive, ain't he?  Actor/comedian/Cap'n Kirk-impersonator extraordinaire Kevin Pollak, the porcine and potty-mouthed Lisa Lampanelli, Greg Giraldo ("You overact more than Betty White's bladder") and perennial roaster Jeffrey Ross ("Look at you, Shatner...you have let yourself boldly go") perform their comedy shticks from the dais and generally made me laugh, while filmed "tributes" by Sandra Bullock, Ben Stiller, and the duo of Jimmy Kimmel and the fearless Sarah Silverman are hits or misses. I was actually knocked for a loop when Betty White proved to be as raunchy and funny as she did ("It always makes me laugh when I see Artie Lange on stage - knowing I'm going to outlive him"; and did Betty and Shatner really do the nasty? Aarrgh!). Lastly, it's always a pleasant surprise when the roastee is able to give as good as he's got, and, make no mistake, Shatner hilariously tore a hole into his tormentors. Kudos to Cap'n Crunch...er, Kirk.  Now, the negatives: Roastmaster Jason Alexander does try his darndest, but he ends up being merely adequate in his hosting duties. The ever annoying Andy Dick yet again demonstrates that he is neither clever nor funny (this numbnut wastes television air time by mugging for the camera, being weird, and licking faces). And then there's Farrah Fawcett, who was on some odd kind of drugged-up or drunk bender when she horrifically attempted to perform her "bit." Her time on the screen was abysmally embarassing and so excruciating I had to turn the channel and only returned when I thought she had finished. Again, poor Farrah.   The only aspect of Shatner's multi-media career that wasn't brought up and gutted was his stint as a sci-fi author. Nothing else was too sacred or too personal for the irreverent roasters as they avidly demolish just about every fixture in the William Shatner mythos: the hammy acting, the weight, T.J. Hooker, Boston Legal, the toupee, [...], the spoken song career, and, of course, Captain Kirk. As I've mentioned, I've only seen the televised roast on Comedy Central and, honestly, I had a rollicking, laugh-out-loud good time. William Shatner is an overwhelmingly easy target, a fount of low brow insults, and, while I thought the jokes were fairly obvious, they were still so ferociously funny, in spite of their viciousness (or maybe because of their viciousness?). Undoubtedly, the uncensored version is even more hilarious and vulgar and, hopefully, comes equipped with quality bonus features. And, finally, for the last time, that poor Farrah Fawcett...  *********************************************************************  Update: So I just watched the extended & uncensored dvd of this roast, and, as predicted, it was even more of a blast than the cleaned up show that aired on Comedy Central months ago. Surprisingly, Roastmaster Jason Alexander showed real improvement when not bleeped or edited. He was actually pretty funny. And, as expected, roast hangers-on Greg Giraldo, Patton Oswalt, Jeffrey Ross, and (especially) Lisa Lampanelli shine best when unleashed uncut in their full vulgarity. Betty White was awesome, as was George Takei, while Andy Dick remained intolerable. Fred Willard and Nichelle Nichol's moments on the podium weren't shown in full, but, sadly, Farrah Fawcett's weird "episode" was, in its full excruciating glory. I also noticed that the video clip with Leonard Nimoy which opened the aired show was absent in this dvd. Hmmm...  The bonus features weren't all that: a brief "Making of the Roast" segment, "Red Carpet Interviews," "Behind the Scenes Footage," and 3 Comedy Central quickies (short segments from the Colbert Report, Reno 911, and Drawn Together). The one to check out is the "Red Carpet Interviews," where you get to see the cute, bespectacled interviewer (her name's Jessie something) start out sober as she talks to the roasters before the show; then, the camera cuts to after the roast and to a drunk off her mind Jessie, who's still interviewing! It's a gas.    
 i enoyed the acting in this movie, laurence fishburne, did a superb  job as ike turner. Angela Bassett was also wonderful as Tina Turner, I would recommend this movie to anyone over 30=5, who could appreciate Tina 
 I have practiced estate planning, with an emphasis on asset protection planning, for many years. This book's explanation of various asset protection techniques, many of which I have used in my own practice, is both lucid and thorough. Not only will experienced practitioners find the book to be an invaluable source, but beginners too will discover a text that is highly readable and easy to understand. I am confident saying that Asset Protection spans "the universe" of such techniques, with both analysis of the fundamental "building blocks" of the area and coverage of more advanced methodologies. Apart from its useful content, I also found the format of Asset Protection to be particularly straightforward, starting with its discussion of the basic concepts of asset protection and its goals, as well as ethical considerations, proceeding to cover many trusts currently being employed in sophisticated estate planning, and ending with a thorough discussion of entities that should play a part in many sophisticated estate plans. In sum, for beginner and practitioner alike, this book is a "must read"!!  
 the service is very good and efficien 
 This super collection of horror stories will haunt me for a long time. They are well written, driven by both plot and character. Each story is about something deep and something haunting. Some will stay with me for a long time, such as "I Am Not My Smell" and "Valley of the Shadow." Massie has a keen sense of people, emotion, and circumstance. Recommended highly 
 Originally composed of brief notes presented to newly arrived scientists at the Los Alamos research site, then released to the public shortly after WWII, Serber has gone back and added two types of extra material: 1) Additional physics discussion, and 2) some interesting history of personalities and WWII from the point of view of the Los Alamos scientists.  There are a few, easy to detect errors in the algebra, but this book will give you, supposing you've had a course in calculus, a good foundation into the theory of simple atomic weapons.  Then, somewhat amazingly, you can research more on the internet and learn of ways to cut size and weight while increasing yield, and even quite a bit about early hydrogen bomb physics.

 First of all, readers should know that these matters are supremely insignificant for the argument of The Culture Cult as a whole. The chapter where they occur is in fact about the philosopher Karl Popper, who supported the "open society" against its tribalistic adversaries, and his feud with his professor in Christchurch who endorsed the perpetuation of Maori tibalism.  The author of The Culture Cult has been in touch regarding the review below, and this is his response:  "Aw c'mon Phoebe, there's nothing nicer than a human ham, even without salt and vinegar-especially if it's been smoked. That's evidently what the dying Maori chief thought when he gasped to Judge Maning, before breathing his last, "How sweet is man's flesh!" (see Old New Zealand, Chap xiv) But what's the fuss? Most of us had cannibalistic ancestors a few thousand years ago... In any case - as should have been perfectly clear from the references in the book - my argument regarding the very well attested tradition of Maori anthropophagy is drawn directly from Tim Flannery's influential study of ecosystems and extinctions, The Future Eaters."  "In chapter 23 we're told that in New Zealand "...by the late 18th century the bodies of those killed in war were a prized source of food". The Maori author Tamihana, in his biography of his father the great chief Te Rauparaha, "made it clear that the flesh of the victims of war were a valued resource. Indeed, it appears likely that without the protein-rich fuel that they represented, the many long and strenuous raids undertaken up and down the coast by chiefs such as Te Rauparaha would not have been possible. Human bodies were certainly the principal food resource during these long voyages." And so on. Maori cannibalism was I'm afraid not the ritual delectation of tid-bits. Serious eating was involved."  "As for those seals, it's good to know they're flourishing at Kaikoura again. But what Flannery was talking about when he wrote of various marine mammals being hunted to extinction was the situation between four hundred and six hundred years ago. We know about this from the archaeological evidence. Two varieties of seal were in fact killed and eaten out (the three-tonne elephant seal and the half-tonne sea-lion) disappearing from New Zealand forever. As for the fur seals, "By 1600 AD all breeding colonies of fur seals on the North Island and northern South Island had been exterminated." Just those accessible mainland colonies, OK? The few survivors very sensibly moved offshore to islands where they couldn't be hunted and eaten by hungry Maori. That they have now swum back to Kaikoura again is good news."  
 I found this book very helpful in dealing with such things as dealing with brokers, marketing efforts, written v. oral contracts -- as well as warning about typical problems. Having extensive quotes from real consultants was  also very helpful. I recommend it highly 
 John Patrick Shanley's script for the play Doubt is a masterpiece. It is basically about "truth" as a social construct with a broad range of consequences depending on how the construct is framed and accepted. Sister Aloysius Beauvier, the Catholic school principal, is convinced that she has discovered a truth about Father Brendan Flynn, a robust likable assertive priest.   A great strength of this script is that Shanley leaves the mystery somewhat unresolved. Though some reviewers have concluded that Father Flynn did have some sexual involvement with the Black student, Donald Muller, there is still much room for doubt since Father Muller could have been transferred to another parrish to avoid Sister Aloysius' continued assault on his reputation and his peace of mind.  The script wisely begins with the central theme of the play, as given in a sermon by Father Flynn. He states: "What do you do when you are not sure?"  The play cascades from this point with Sister Aloysius convinced of Father Flynn's guilt and Sister James wracked with moral uncertainty as to what is true or not true and what are the moral consequences for each decision.  The play is masterfully written, much like a detective story, in which each clue that propels you toward one solution is then counter-poised with another clue drawing you in the opposite direction and conclusion. The reader may suspend judgement throughout the play, absorbing the subtle clues that propel this clash of characters forward; or the reader may take sides, since Father Flynn is a likeable, robust, assertive, clever, strong, person who is contrasted with the cold rock strength and certainty of Sister Aloysius, who is never presented as especially warm or compassionate yet her actions speak to great compassion if indeed she fully believes she is interrupting the sexual predatory actions of Father Flynn.  The play's strengths are expanded when we hear from Donald Muller's mother who tells us her son is an effiminate child who was been repeatedly beaten in public schools as well as by his father for his effiminate behaviors. In Catholic school, his mother hoped he would be protected. The wise Mrs. Muller realizes that her son's effiminate behavior is strongly correlated with same-sex eroticism when she tells Sister Aloysius 'my son is that way'. Thus this wise mother sees the possible affectionate attentions of this white priest toward her son as far more desirable than the hostility he experiences from young males in public school or from his own father. The character of Mrs. Muller is unexpected, and throws a complete different light onto the actions of the play. Sister Aloysius thought she had found a partner and then found more than for which she had bargained.  I must say, Father Muller's opening sermon, the sermon about doubt which originally sets Sister Aloysius upon his trail, is wonderful. The tale is of a sailor who experiences a terrible ship wreck at sea, and amid the confusion climbs aboard a raft and is the only man saved in the wreck. He sets his course based on the stars since he has learned to navigate from the stars. Yet for the next 28 days the clouds cover the sky every night and he is uncertain whether he remains on course or whether he is doomed. Father Flynn equates this to spiritual/religious revelation/inspiration followed by years of doubt. Yet the questioning and the seeking create a bond with truth and thus doubt becomes as strong a spiritual tool as certainty.  With not a word out of place, this play is a modern masterpiece bound to be a classic 
 I've now read my share of psychic "How to" books, but this one takes the cake. This book tells teaches more than how to be psychic, but also where it all comes from, psychology and philosophy, it also combinds scientific facts and experiments to prove psychic existance, thus, giving you a broader aspect of the psychic phenomenon. For those who have finished your beginner books, and want something more in depth and fullfilling, this is the book. After reading this book, I had to order more Edgar Cayce books! Happy reading 
 I can honestly say this book changed my life by opening my eyes on how investing and money really work over the long term 
 This book is a fun and great read!   I met June Walker via Google. I had a tax question about reimbursements from a client and went searching online. I found a great article on June Walker's website explaining the solution to the exact tax sitiuation I was in! I also found out that she had a book coming out soon, and after reading the tax explanation for my problem on her website, I knew I had to have her book.   After I recieved it, I couldn't put it down. All the tax myths I had heard about being an individual in business were suddenly cleared up by June Walker using lots of easy to understand, real life examples.    June Walker obviously has lots of experience with a diverse group of clients and is able to sum up the tax problem they were having and the solution she provided for them quickly and clearly.   If you are an individual and are ready to start your own business but fear the IRS and tax burden, get this book. It will rid you of the anxiety of keeping tax records for your own business and get you on the right track for providing clear simple tax records for your new business

 This is a great collection of romantic songs with that added French romance. It's great for wedding reception music, especially the first track!! I love the movie, I love the soundtrack 
 Flyy Girl is a great book, one of my favorites.  It is great for coming-of-age books.  I liked how it was real, not too fake.  In the book, Tracy (the main character), grows and blossoms into a sassy teenager.  It's about her life having its ups and downs, her parent's relationship, her experiences with guys, and the new craves around town, like drugs.  At some points, it was a little too vivid...but they passed quickly.  She seemed like she was fast with guys and moved into relationships too fast and ended them as suddenly as they started.  She goes through many of the regular teenage things a usual girl goes through.  It was amazing how a male author could write from a female's perspective so good.  Some of the things in the book were too soon, more like they would happen later in life.  I don't know many girls that would do some of the things she did at the same age.  It was nice to be exposed to a different life that took place in the 1980s.  Right from the get go I was intrigued throughout it.  It was something most girls my age and older could relate to.  Flyy Girl has real life situations and some were sticky and some went smoothly, Flyy Girl had a good amount of both.  She grew up in a middle-class society, is spoiled, uses a lot of the same slang people used today, dresses to impress and looked "flyy", you have the usual judgmental people in here, the guys who think they are at the top of everybody, sassy attitude, basically the same culture of today.  In the end it teaches you a great lesson nobody should forget.  I'll always remember this book because first, I read in it about 2 weeks and it's over 500 pages, so that must already let you know it's a god book!  Second, it's something I can comprehend well because I could understand.  Third, almost everybody goes through at least one of her situations.  Finally, the book shows you how good this lesson can come in handy...if Tracy never learned her lesson, who knows what would have happened to her in the book.  Its one of those feel good books at the end.  Job well done Omar 
 Well, I guess idols routinely crumble under scrutiny, so I shouldn't really be surprised that I came away from D.J. Taylor's biography of George Orwell viewing the famous author more as a man than as a hero. That is how it must be, however. When we study our fellow humans their flaws become discernible regardless of their greatness. As a man, Eric Blair was far from grand. He appeared to have the same faults present in many writers (all-be-they to a lesser extent). I now have a better appreciation of the author, and for the suffering he went through along with the challenges of his life. My one complaint is that Taylor did not treat his subject with the respect to which he was entitled. More empathy and less Thackeray would have been immensely appreciated. As for me, I'll always treasure 1984, Down and Out in Paris and London, Homage to Catalonia, and Keep the Aspidistra Flying. Hitchens was right; Orwell remains relevant. This biography heightens our awareness of the man even though it comes at the cost of his no longer seeming transcendent. Orwell's creative genius is not something undermined by these pages, but I do think that it's hard to appreciate his political outlook after closely examining it. His animosity towards Marxism is rather comical when one considers his continuing, quasi-religious belief in socialism. His time at the BBC taught him a little bit about the way in which bureaucracies function and we can only hopefully speculate that, if he had lived longer, he would have eventually renounced his love for statism and seen the light. 
 I find his book very interesting and informative in many ways. Most of it is very difficult to read because 1. John Cage is extremely intellectual, and 2. He is very avan garde, so some of the formats in which he writes in can be very complicated. I enjoy it being complicated though because there is something you can always figure out about it or just look into very closely. My favorite subject of this book are his journal/diary entries. They include entries of him away at master classes and the things that he talks about are humorous, great to know, and interesting to think about. I recommend this selection of John Cage highly 
 Hoving spent as much times at shows as I have, her knowledge leads one to believe she has as well!  Her people and animal companions come alive and she obviously has a love for dogs that that only a true "dog person" has.  I have read all of her series, but this one holds a special place in my heart.  A must read for any dog lover as well as mystery buff 
 This series is definitely beach reading - but the books are fast paced and very very funny. Thumbs up 
 It's a book on the history of statistics in baseball, which makes a fascinating story unto itself.  Scwarz has a fantastic writing style.  A good intro into why baseball keeps the statistics that it does.  Not a book for a general audience.  You'd need to have some familiarity with baseball and at least know who Bill James is before reading this one.  But then again, if you were drawn to this listing, this probably describes you 
 My son has been using this table for the last 3 months and absolutely loves it.  He also has the LeapFrog table, but gets bored with just one.  This table is on the opposite side of our (toy-filled) living room, and he will go over to this for a change of pace.  He loves Elmo and likes to hang on to his head and also mouth it.  He likes to use the phone, which he also mouths - just assume he puts his mouth on everything :) - and also the little bowl under Cookie Monster.  So why four stars and not five?  I do wish the base had a bit more weight to it, but he can easily pull up on it without getting the whole toy over although we've had a couple of near tips.  Also, the toy is a little less educational than I feel it could be since he is always accidentally setting off buttons with his arm...so he could be pressing the triangle with his finger, but his arm could press the Pig...and off Elmo goes oinking and singing about pigs.  Still a great toy, with lots of entertainment value, and as he matures we have less accidental set-offs.  I bought it on sale and it was worth the money 
 Anyone who's ready to share their expertise on the plateform in small and large settings will find a wealth of resources in this book.  If you're just getting started, Speak and Grow Rich will overwhelm you with revenue opportunities. What I suggest, as a veteran speaker, is that you have pad and paper by your side to list the numerous products you can realistically create to start your speaking career and boost sales.  Every product mentioned in the book won't be beneficial for you, but the ones that link you with your audience will create untold revenue.  I found myself skimming some of the chapters, and that's only because I've been speaking for more than 10 years, so I know and practice much of what the authors suggest. However, I poured over the details in chapters 3 and 9.  The information on learning to craft contracts so that you make money from recordings and don't give away this intellectual property is priceless whether you're just starting or a long-time speaker. This tutorial was eloquently explained and not to be overlooked.  Speak and Grow Rich will help you to trade in your stage fright for bountiful checks you can bank on 
 I bought and read the first edition ten years ago, and it really blew my mind. My eyes were opened and the scales removed. I had an epiphany  regarding Israel and Zionism. Over the last ten years, I've watched and listened to what's been happening in world politics by supplementing the borscht spewed from the mouths of our evening news talking-empty-heads with real-world foriegn news reports and internet-based news sources. I've paid particular attention to American government and Middle-East events. My conclusion is that as a direct result of having a Zionist occupied and controlled government, our country has become morally corrupt, financially bankrupt, and loathed by the rest of the world. As an honorably discharged former U.S. Marine sergeant, my question is this: With friends like Zionist Israel, who needs enemies 
 I was watching tv one late night and stumbled across the short 1929 Movie St. Louis Blues  starring Bessie Smith now im a 24 year old guy who is into all the lastest music but this lady sung a song called st. Louis Blues and i was watching the screen going who is this she her voice full of passion and pain and then i found how she died in a tragic car accident i was hurt bessie smith was  she was really doing the da%mn back in the 1920's so if you wanna know where the r&b of today got its drama filled lyrics check out the empress of the blues she will not leave you disapointed 
 I have read a lot of travel books as Editor-at-Large for Travelers' Tales but this is one of the very best. Morton's grasp of history is nothing short of extraordinary and his powers of description, as a traveler, are almost peerless 
 Speakers arrived in perfect condition.  They were relatively simple to install, and they work very well.  Tweeter is aim-able.  Speakers achieve fantastic high and mid-range frequencies - they sound clear and crisp.  Low frequency response is good (but not amazing by any stretch).  These were my first Polk Audio speakers, and I would definitely buy them again 
 Considering the vastness of the topic this is a very good, general military history of WWI. Don't pick this book up if you are looking for a political history- this is solely a foray into the world of combat, only going political when needed to explain the effect on the fighting.  As such I would recommend it, but I would go elsewhere for a look into the causes of the Great War 
 Consent & deny. Filling in the gaps with retro-fitted pleasure craft billbowas, frittering away the last vestiges of ceiling con-cavedness, somewhat fluid morants of militancy are left hanging by a chad. Helping the booze bound will be tantamount to a feeling of dis-servatude. Catfish? 
 This brilliant book is indispensable reading for any labor activist worth their salt. Get it and clear your schedule for the next 24 hours while you soak up the electrifying history of working-class radicalism in the United States.  Smith's case is meticulous and convincing: The American working-class is far more combative and ingenuitive than its given credit for by the mainstream. And the author's conclusions are provocative: The working-class is a juggernaut in need of an independent, democratic leadership that can fully realize its class interests.  This book is worth it for the highlights of class struggle alone from Toledo, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Birmingham, Detroit, New York, Seattle and beyond. But what makes it truly valuable is its political analysis of the current labor movement slump. Smith is no labor cheerleader nor academic arm-chair quarterback, she's the salt of the movement 
 Robert McCammon has stepped out of his horror genre to write a fabulous book.  "Speaks the Nightbird is actually one novel split into two seperate books.  A magistrate and his male secretary arrive in a small southern town a couple of years after the Salem witch trials to try a local woman as a witch.  The story turns on the fact the magistrate is not feeling well and is getting worse and is only concrened with the "law" while his apprentice is concerned with the "truth".  The apprentice believes that something is not right about the whole affair although it seems ok on the surface.  So the first book starts and concludes with his revelation.    Book two starts right where book one ends. Matthew has decided that the witch is not a witch and there is something else going on in the town. He goes about trying to solve the case while trying to meet his obligations to the sickly judge. The problem is that nothing is ever as it seems. Just when the reader thinks that Matthew has finally cracked the case, McCammon throws another twist into the story. The entire time Matthew is trying to solve the case, the town is going through one disaster after another. After a particularly bad murder,the town is in a blind panic. Dark secrets are revealed about most of the important characters and this makes them all suspects. Like a good who-done-it, book II ends with the loose ends tied up, although not as neatly as you could imagine.  McCammon has done a remarkable job with the two books. He has brought to life an era of time that superstition ruled the land and that reason had a hard time trying to triumph. Even the educated men of the time believed there was evil afoot. He has done a wonderfull job showing how tough the time was even for the prosperous. This is an excellent historical novel and should not be missed. It is a shame that he has retired partly due to the problems of publishing of this book. This was a glimpse of what could have come out of him in the future. What a shame.    This is a step out of his normal writing, but it is worth the effort because it is very entertaining.  If you are a horror fan of his, then this will be a nice surprise for you.  It follows in the same vein as "boys Life" and "Gone South".  Less horror , but still a magnificent read.  Highly recommended.  
 This book is a good anecdote and reality check for people who believe that a Socialist construction like the EU will prevail over a more freedom loving USA, or that various International Protocols and organisations will somehow force a diminution of national power and the elevation of UNO relevancy.    "The clash between U.S. hegemony and the E.U. and its attendant international organizational framework is really a `typical' clash, often seen in history, between differing views of socio-economic organization." writes Read.    How did this conflict arise and what are its possible consequences on the countries involved? In such a confrontation we have the classic battle pitting orthodox liberal freedoms against that of state managed socialism.  Upon this confrontation and outcome resides the future of Western civilization.  This volume-realistic, impartial, intelligent-proves to be an important and relevant analysis of the political dynamics between the world's powerful countries.  "America and Europe: Conflict and Power will challenge prevailing liberal media bias and force people to consider the proper structure of politics and economics in the context of freedom both domestically and internationally," says Read.  The Contents are detailed and include:  -Political and Economic Ideologies -Modern concepts of Socialism and Statism -Regionalism and Globalization -International Economics -Military Power -The Political Economy of Europe vs. USA -Islam -The UNO, IMF, and WTO -Kyoto -Conflict between the US and EU models -Internationalism vs. Nationalism  Written in a scholarly but accessible manner.  Plenty of sources and footnotes. Well researched and written.  
 I happened on this book at a local shop just after it was released.  Having read the superb biography of the Wrights, "The Bishops Boys" by Tom Crouch, I can recommend this book as an excellent companion piece. Noah Adams' narrative has an immediacy to it, and he brings the Wrights alive as only a storyteller can. As he travels around the country, and the world, tracing the footsteps of the Wright brothers and sister, offering observation and insight, Adams brings us face to face with their - and our - history.  With the appproaching "centennial of flight", this would make a very appropriate book gift, especially for the holidays 
 I bought this book hoping to please my child's interest in Toy Story.  I was not dissappointed.  With a few chapters to choose from, a parent can definitely get their money's worth out of this book 
 "The Professor", by Charlotte Bronte, was the author's first novel but it was not published until after her death (and perhaps she refashioned it to some degree later in her novel "Villette").  It is the tale of William Crimsworth, a man without parents and forsaken by his brother, who is forced to make his own way in the world.  He decides to try his hand at teaching and travels to Brussels to teach English at an all-boys' school.  Once at the school in Brussels, he immediately begins a successful, if not profitable, teaching career.  Soon enough he finds himself teaching four classes per week at the neighboring school for girls, and also finds himself falling for the headmistress Mlle. Reuter.  Inexperienced with women, he is susceptible to and deceived by her whiles and charms until love enters his life in the form of a fellow teacher-pupil Frances Henri.  As is to be expected, despite the abuse Crimsworth suffered from his brother, and having nothing of his own, he manages to work his way into wealth and is able to marry the woman he has fallen in love with.  At the beginning of "The Professor", Crimsworth confesses that is narrative his not exciting and he holds true to his word, especially since he can be a rather irksome narrator.  While not a novel to shake the foundations of literature, "The Professor" offers insights into who Charlotte Bronte would become as a writer.  Her characters, a few who are one-dimensional, are mainly well-sketched and drawn out; and despite her claim to the lack of excitement in her narrator's story, his tale unfolds briskly and with few unexpected revelations.  Having been a governess herself, (the novel is based on her own experiences), Bronte combines asides about the state of education and the relationship that exists between teacher and pupil.  Some of these insights hold true for today as well, making "The Professor" an undated and well-written account of man's struggle for success and happiness.  **Two things I disliked about the Wordsworth Classics edition.  This version was rampant with typos throughout the entire novel; the same mistakes were repeated numerous times. I was also maddened by the fact that entire conversations in French were not translated, and therefore not understood, especially during the climax of the story.  
 This is by far the best history of speculative excesses money can buy. A wonderful book: Detailed and well-researched but yet light and extremely amusing. Truly a must-have-read!   
    `Never judge a book by its cover', but there's just something about a hazy full moon in a dimly lit night sky, casting its milky reflection over the tranquil waters of a rocky shore, that evokes a deep sense of nostalgia and just makes you want to fall in love. And it was this very portrait on the cover that induced me to pick up `Nights in Rodanthe.'      The protagonist, Adrienne Willis is an elderly woman and single mother of three grown-up children. When her daughter, Amanda, loses her husband, Adrienne reveals to her a secret she has hidden for fourteen years to help her move on. Thus, unfolds the story of Dr. Paul Flanner, the handsome doctor, who had been put up in an inn in Rodanthe that Adrienne was tending to one weekend. Her secret romance with Paul, though tragic, helped her nurse her ailing heart and gave her the hope and courage she thought she had lost forever.           `Nights in Rodanthe' isn't just a love story. It's about dying for the one you love and forgiving the one who dies for you. It's about `love surviving death into eternity.' It justifies that sacrifice is the essence of love and as Nicholas Sparks says, it shows that love can happen to anyone, at any time and at any age.         I would recommend this book to anyone interested in short compelling fiction. Whether you enjoy love stories or not, you'll definitely enjoy this book because of the fusion of numerous elements that have been used in its creation. `Nights' is about love, sacrifice, forgiveness, hope and of course, the strength to move on...and these are emotions that speak a universal tongue. Be prepared for tears, sniffles and heartache...but moreover, be prepared to be inspired for life.       
 I've walked through my local Blockbuster new release section many times over the last few months, looked at the video box, picked it up, but then the title "Wicker Park" and the cheesey artwork would make me put it back on the shelf. Now I find myself writing my first review in two years. Fortunately for me, this movie was on Showtime last Friday night and I finally got to see it. I don't want to describe it with all the details and plots, you can look at other reviews for that, I want to relay the way the movie made me feel. It's a film I knew nothing about and had not seen the trailer, after watching it I was reminded of how I felt after seeing "Donnie Darko" for the first time without knowing anything about it. In short, imagine the film "Closer" meets "Memento". I'm surprised this film hasn't received the cult status of Darko or Memento, it's probably for the same reason I never rented it, poor marketing. My suggestion for a better title is "Love Again".  
 This is an outflow of a predominent theme of Noll's work: the invention of an American religion. This is a off shoot of Harold Bloom's book The American religion: The Emergence of the Post-Christian Nation. Since reading his "Is the Reformation Over?" I have found his ideas more in tune with a liberal philosophy as underpinning. The primary thought expressed intially is the rejection of perspicuity of the Bible. It is a hypothesis that the problem of interpretation could not be solved by the Bible alone is not a Protestant idea, but a Catholic one.  The views of the Civil War from abroad as being included and their highlighted relevance seems irrelevant for lots of reasons. I think some of those reasons apply to the current controversy of whether the Supreme Court should reference court decisions and law international in their rulings.  That somehow a mix or confusion of the doctrine of Providence was a problem in being able to sort out the question of slavery is dubious. Providence that God is working in all things has been and will be cited into infinity. Why may not one look at the use of Providence as sited generally by Jefferson and many leaders of our history until the present for undertakings?  Or who can leave out the current rage in evangelical circles seeing God's hand divining current trends as forecast in the Tim LaHaye series?  If this was a theological crisis, whose theology? The author does not define these terms or take a stand for a particular theological view.   If there is a declension of "theology", what points. Surely, it is not the dumb contention of Providence being misused by both sides. It is the resurgence of a works religion unfolding.    The author does indicate that enlightenment priniciples, their acceptance in hermeneutics and interpretation of scripture, had a affect in confusing orthodox beliefs in strict propagation of the gospel with that of a socialized political gospel. To this day the two are still emeshed with each other to Christianity's detriment. We are still doing God's work in Iraq etc, etc. and whatever else may come down the pike. 
 This is a really moving book. It's hard to put down, well at least for me it was. If you like happy endings then sorry but this book doesn't have one. because there is no happy ending to this story. there is no happy ending to a child not only being rejected by society but rejected by her family and her community, the people who should love and protect her from society and the cruel world and realistics of racism and hate. instead she doesn't have any escape from this world and there is no escape from it in this book, no moment where she can take a piece of love from someone and dwell in it, this book shows her rejection and sadness and how it came into exsistance. it's beautifully written with a little humor here and there. i highly recommend this book. 
 This book contains many interesting articles on the subject, and is a necessity for those who make gender archaeology their primary course of study.  
 Got this when it came out and gave it a read. Three years have passed and I just referred to it to support writing a paper on technology. The details are good and the higher level dialogue do a nice job of getting the message across without belaboring anything. If you are about the web and doing business, this is worth the bucks and time 
 the best read ever. truth, beauty  and an amazing mission. Most timely 
 WOW!,if you like AC/DC you'll love this album!This is one of those albums that is in that raw rock state.This was releaced in 1983 after the back to back scuces of BACK IN BLACK and FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK.This is a great album from RISING POWER to the frantic album closer BRAIN SHAKE.Thease are songs you con boogi to,some of AC/DC's best.And the soloes,oh the soloes are aswem,and on songs like DEEP IN THE HOLE Angus sounds like he's ripping his strings out!All around,a mighty fine rock album!!  
 Totally worth the money - not only is it cute but works wonderfully.  Our baby loves the ocean surf sound... works like a charm - always soothes and puts her to sleep within minutes. Bonus - also works on the hubby 
 We get an incredibly engaging page-turner of an astronomer/system manager tracking down a foreign hacker. Cliff Stoll genuinely struggles and questions his own actions not knowing whether he is doggedly tracing some hapless student or a nefarious spy. In the end he overcomes his Berkeley counterculture distrust of all those three letter gov't agencies and develops a respect for their work if not their inability to coordinate or communicate interdepartmentally. He becomes a security expert they all seek but laments the lack of openness and the attack on trust that is required in the academic world in order to facilitate networking and the exchange of ideas. A really good story and there is a pretty good recipe for chocolate cookies on page 155 
 It would prove very difficult to over-praise this wonderful book. Bollas writes with such lucidity and wit about every topic he touches that I find myself returning to these pages just to re-experience his prose. If you value psychoanalysis performed in the Winnicottian mode, then you owe it to yourself to read this book 
 William Martin's With God on Our Side offers a sympathetic yet objective look at the evolution of Christian fundamentalism in America over the last 50 years, culminating in the rise of the Christian Coalition and the Religious Right.  Written in conjunction with a PBS series of the same  title, Martin's book contains both a detailed overview and plenty of  first-hand accounts of events that have transformed what was once a  politically non-existent group into one of the most important voting blocs  in America.  No matter which side of the fence you fall on, this book is a  must for students of both religion and politics 
 This CD has all the songs from Lazytown" that kids love.  My girls, ages 4 and 8, love to listen to this and sing and dance along.  We have had it for over 6 months and they still want to hear it in the car every day.  The words to these songs send such a good message, and they are catchy and easy to sing and dance with.  Parents beware - the songs will end up sticking in your head too!  
 I first purchased this book when I was seven years old at a school book fair because I was raised by my father on The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings and the cover, title and description looked cool.  I remember vividly being in second grade and being absolutely tantalized by the day or two it took for me to finish it. It was just a wonderful tale of charming adventure that immediately struck the right chord with me. I'm 21 years old now and I still find myself taking time every year or so to pick up the very copy of the book I purchased when I was 7 to re-aquaint myself with the characters and the adventure and the feeling of being so completely absorbed with a story that can't really be captured beyond grammar school levels that the rest of the world doesn't matter.  This book has stood the test of time for me. It served as a fantastical escape when I was a wee lad and can still provide that exact same charm now as I finish college that I don't believe I'll ever be able to find anywhere else.  Stellar book that will do nothing but encourage young people to read; it's something that's really needed today 
 Alice Miller's "The Body Never Lies" is a provocation for those who are intent on denying that there is a relationship between how children are being treated and how they, later as adults, live their lives. They will fight against this book with those sad beliefs, which they learned in their childhoods and never questioned or left behind. But for those, for whom these connections are a fact and who are willing to explore their own past, their own lives and childhood suffering, this book provides great relief, even liberation.  On her life journey of research and writing, Alice Miller has gained great inner freedom and strength. In `The Body Never Lies', she courageously questions traditional morality and inspires us to face the often life long pain that children suffer through their parents. Her profound insights into this vital relationship create a truthful vision of man and his coercion to be destructive and self-destructive. Her visionary humanity leads the way into a new era, where the source of needless human suffering is movingly and powerfully recognized.  Like in an invisible jail, the fourth command confines many people into untruthful relationships with their parents, from which they often suffer. Abused and disrespected in childhood, they strive, still during their adult lives, to reach and even please cruel parents, who do not wish to understand and support them, who do not care about their well-being.  As long as they are under the spell of this command, they also often suffer in similar ways in other close relationships, denying their truth and reality like they had to as children with their parents. But there is a powerful witness to the suffering we endure through hypocritical, painful relationships--our body. Although we are trained to follow those moralistic expectations to honor our parents, no matter how they have treated us as children or treat us now as adults--the body refuses to do so. Again and again, it tries to communicate the tragic experiences that we carry hidden inside, in the unconscious. Alice Miller invites us to listen to and understand our bodies and ourselves with love by moving away from the destructive command that we must honor those who cause us harm and hurt us 
 There is nothing wrong with this book. It's not too long. It's not hard to read. It's perfect. I read this book in elementary school and I haven't read a book sense that I think is better. This is my all time favorite 
 I haven't read the paperback, but I just came across my copy of the 1956 hard cover and devoured it with renewed interest.Professor Lobeck selects 72 examples of geography and on the facing page illustrates the geological activity that resulted in that geography.New York harbor, Long Island, the Florida peninsula, the Great Lakes, the island arcs of the Pacific and the Caribbean are among the many mapped and explained geologically.A great book for the student of earth science and the traveller interested in maps and why the our earth is so different and interesting 
 I think that Many Moons is one of my favorite books. I like it because it has details that you can imagen easily. For exaample it says in the story that the royal wizard was a little,thin man with a long face. He wore a high red peaked hat covered with silver stars,and a long blue robe covered with golden owls.My favorite part of the story was the ending.I like this part because it leaves you wondering,doesthe court Jester have magical powers? You also wonder,how could a Joker know what to do? If Many Moons was in a best book competition, Many Moons would win!  That is why I like Many Moons. THE END 
   Li Lun Lad of Courage is a book about a young boy who lives in a small fishing village, but he is afraid of the sea. One day his dad ordered him to come fishing with him but he refused.  So his dad gave him 7 rice grains and told him to plant rice on the mountain top of Lao Shan.  Little did he know that that statement would change his life. When he climbs to the mountain top he encounters gulls, rats, drought and even an old priest. This is a story about love, courage, adventure and hardship.  
 It is a good radio.  $99.00 will be a better price for it.  Excellent reception and attachments.  On the down side, be careful with the on/off button when packing the radio if traveling; it activates easily.  
 Rebecca Jones, Does Christianity Squash Women? A Christian Looks at Womanhood, (Nashville: Broadman & Holman Publishers, 2005). 224 pp. $12.99 (U.S.).  It is reasonable to ask why we need yet another book on women in the Church. There are numerous valid answers to such a question. First, each generation needs to look at issues that played a key role in the Church of Jesus Christ prior to their generation. Many of the younger people were not even born when some of the debates were occurring regarding important doctrines or positions on women's ordination and their proper roles. Therefore, there is a need to keep the older issues in front of the younger people. Second, in the course of time new information may have come to the forefront to shed new light on an issue dealt with previously. This new information needs to be incorporated into the discussion. Third, it just might be that a new book is written on an old subject and it takes a slightly different approach from previous books on the topic thereby shedding no new light, but certainly shedding different light on the matter. It is particularly the first and third reasons that I believe make Rebecca Jones' book a very worthwhile read for women in the 21st century Christian Church. That is not to say that Rebecca completely ignores the second reason, but, like the discussions on infant baptism, it is really not a question of finding new texts. In the history of the Church, the pertinent, relevant texts have been discussed-repeatedly. There have not been any new arguments for or against infant baptism for quite a while. The texts are there. We simply need to look at them and connect the dots. Something very similar is at play in the discussions surrounding the roles of women in the Church. As I read Mrs. Jones' book there were three particular facets that drew and held my attention:  First, her style is a very readable, fluid one. Her command and use of the English language makes this book a joy to read. Not only does she possess an excellent vocabulary, but her twists and turns of phrases are delightful. One example must suffice. She comments that Christian women need to understand that it's godly to be sexy and men, conversely, need to understand that it's sexy to be godly. Point made. Second, she employs earthy, mundane examples to make her points. For example, she opens the first chapter with these words, "One day my fourteen-year-old daughter brought home a lesbian friend." She had my attention. As a pithy summary of the conversation that took place in her home she concludes, "This confusion is no longer unique to teens of California. It's exotic to be a lesbian, or at least a `bi.'" Mrs. Jones also uses everyday examples taken from her hairdresser and conversations with children about homework while she's cooking dinner. To use a modern phrase, at the end of the book you know that Rebecca Jones is an "authentic woman." But what drew me to appreciate this book so much that I wanted to write a review of it was what I consider to be the rather unique approach that she uses to make her points. What is that approach? She comes at her topic from a solidly covenantal, redemptive-historical point of view. As she weaves her way through Scripture, the reader is aware that they are being taken on a redemptive-historical journey that clearly explains the place, plight, and privilege that women have in the Bible. Chapter 5 (The Baby) walks us through discussions about Eve, Sarah, Deborah, and Abigail. In the case of Deborah-a much disputed figure in the debates about the role of women in the Church-we are told, "Deborah's story is placed in the downward spiral of Israel's disobedience" and "Rather than encouraging women leaders, Deborah's story underlines the fact that women were not meant to be the leaders in Israel" (pp. 76-77). Particular attention is also paid to the content in which many of the Old Testament narratives are found. For instance, "The story of Abigail is intentionally placed in between two stunning accounts of David's grace and restraint in sparing Saul's life. He refuses to lay a hand on God's anointed king" (78). With Nabal, however, it's a different story. He's a petty tyrant in league with Saul against David. In his anger, David is willing to "take the gloves off," but Abigail intervenes for her foolish husband Jones also tackles the narrative of Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba (Bath-shua), the bride of the Hittite soldier in David's army and how God used these women in particular situations to bring about the inclusion of the Gentiles as well as how he continued to be faithful to his covenant promises in spite of the sinfulness of his people. The treatment that Mrs. Jones gives of Jesus is also quite enlightening. She points out that our Lord respected women and honored them although he never suggested that they should attempt to usurp the role that God has assigned to them in the covenant of grace. There are God-ordained roles both for men and women, which must be obeyed in all places and at all times. Moreover, Jones does not shy away from an open and frank discussion about biblical submission. She cites certain women who "rebel against their husband's authority, refusing to accept what God has placed in their lives for protection and for holiness..." These women are obviously not in submission (p. 165). This type of action on the wife's part makes the man "useless as a husband and father. She takes everything into her own hands and makes him look like a fool in the process" (Ibid.). What is the proper approach? "Radical positive obedience is just the opposite of this stubborn autonomy. It is not merely a grudging passivity. A wife doesn't just become silent and go into neutral. To obey Christ's command to submit, a wife must work actively to know and honor the heart desires of her husband. She conforms herself to its joys, its instincts, and its passions, and she encourages the children to do the same. Submitting to her husband is far more than avoiding the temptation to belittle him. It involves lifting him up, honoring him actively in her heart and before others, and verbally encouraging him" (pp. 165-166). Some, no doubt, will take issue with Jones' book that it does not answer all the questions concerning the role of women. In reality, it isn't meant to. It does, however, answer many, most of them. The secret to unlocking the practical application of this book lies in Jones' redemptive-historical reading of Scripture. For those who have never heard of covenant theology or God's covenant of grace, this book will be a challenge. You will be required first to become grounded in how God deals with his people from Genesis to Revelation. Once you get a handle on that aspect of the "warp-and-woof" of the Bible, then Jones' book will be one that you will return to time and time again. Pastor Ron Gleason, Ph.D. Yorba Linda, C 
 A nice little read, even if the author does not always understand jet aircraft or nuclear power.  This is a story of Saddam's attempts to get the bomb, and Israel's raid that denied them the bomb.  There are many characters in this book:  pilots, generals, Saddam, Begin, and Jacques Chirac.  Chirac sells the Iraquis nuclear technology which could have given Saddam the bomb.  His justification....France made a lot of money out of the deal.  Just another example of how the Europeans don't care who they sell their technology to. The book is a blow by blow story of how Israel first delayed and then plotted the attack on Iraq's nuclear reactor.  Israel used sabotage, extortion, and then assasination to delay the completion of Iraq's nuclear reactor.  Then it plotted the destruction of the reactor by an air strike.  The pilot's stories are the most interesting in this book.  This was a nice little read 
 This book entered my life at the perfect moment!  I've been looking for an "all in one" resource pointing me down the right path toward a quality life.  I've felt as though I've been in a rut for years and now I know how to dig myself out 
 I recently ordered the t3 tourmaline straighter, for 160!, once i received it i was so excited to try it, but it was so awful. I sent it back and got this. I used it today for the first time, and it works beautifully. So far its the best straightener i have ever used, and i have used many! definitly recomment i 
 	 Here's my story. First off, let me say that I've never really been active. I'm 46, I was approximately 35 lb overweight on a 5'4" frame and first started on Weight Watchers. I peaked at 185 lb and slowly lost 9-12 lbs on WW. However, it wasn't the plan for me, what with all the cooking and counting points,  I didn't feel as though I could do it for the rest of my life. I also lacked the motivation to exercise. So I shopped around for a fitness plan that would give me quick results. I really wasn't expecting a program that promised results over night so I was intrigued when I read Dr Weiss's book.    I became very informed after reading the fitness quiz and found  it informative and knew I had quite a challenge ahead. The book suggests you start with stretching. This stretching routine reminded me a lot like yoga but without holding the positions a long time. I found the pilates to be challenging but no stress to my back although I couldn't do a few because I am not strong enough yet.   Then the sculpting routine starts with a series of abdominal moves and ball exercises. I bought some 3 lb. weights to perform the arm exercises at first but now after two months I am up to 7 lbs weights on most exercises for arms and I feel stronger.    There are various exercises to choose from with the weights so you never get bored. On alternating days, you focus on abs and some form of aerobic exercise- I chose walking twice a day by adding an additional  cardio  and stretching every day I was able to burn more calories  and felt fitter. As a motivational technique, I decided not to weigh myself for the duration of the program.   Setbacks: I've had quite a few due to schedule interruptions and sometimes lacking access to exercise equipment near the  end of the book but I substituted my home workout in place of the gym one .  Why this worked for me: I actually felt great after each session and still do. My posture improves immediately and I have so much more energy than when I don't exercise. That's probably why I continue - because when I don't, it doesn't feel good.   I'm still working on building up to the complete program. As far as I'm concerned, it's not necessary to ever get there. But the effort makes for an interesting routine. The beginner program is challenging enough and is yielding the results I want. Dr. Weiss  gives you tips on how to maintain the results and live healthier once you reach your goals. It can be done. And you'll look and feel great! 
  I really enjoyed reading the book scopions by Walter Dean Myers. The book is about a boy named Jamal. Jamal is 13 years old. Jamal has a brother named randy. Randy is the leather of a gang named scopions.Randy goes to jail for murder. Randy was involve in a gang shoting. Jamal lives with his mother, brother and sister in Harlem.I recommend this book to all the readers that like the book monster and other books by Walter Dean Myers. I give this book 4 stars.

 One of the above mentioned reviewers thought the execution to be vague in its style and not the work of indepth thought, perhaps though it takes a certain degree of ingenious to see such possibilities from a pack of tarot cards, to me it sounded like he spent some time figuring out how to best execute it from the after note and in particular its final comment on how he wishes each time he sits down to write a book to be writing as if for the first time sums up Calvino as a writer, his approaches are constantly varied and always breath-takingly original. As I have found European writers in particular are able to take novels to another level of experience, manipulate the form to create something original and classic.  The novel reads like a classic and seems timeless in its setting and execution and follows a Canterbury Tales theme, there are occasionally hints here and there that it is a modern writer, in one tale the mention of technology like computers seemed out of place and alerts you to the fact that is recent.  To best read this you need plenty of time to enjoy it, the steam of conscious style demands your attention as do the tales, some original, some based on classical legends. A well worthwhile rea 
 This book is incredibly relevant for Christians today.  The church has been infultrated with worldly methods and systems of counseling that contradict the Word of God.  Adams shows the need for Biblcial Counseling and how all Christians are called to this ministry in one form or another.  This is a tremendous book on this subject and is a great starting place for one who wants to know more about what Christians Counseling should be 
 I am so happy with this product. I have chronic stomach trouble and this enzyme product has saved me from many days and nights of upset stomach. If I eat too late at night or eat the "wrong" thing, I just pop a couple capsules and no problems for the night 
 I had just entered fourth grade at a new school, and we were going to the school library. I saw this book and kind of thought it looked cool. And it was. I only read afew minutes a day so it took me a week to finish this but it was sure good. I loved the giant spider scene and the battle with the dragon at the end. The reason I didn't give this book five stars is because I recall it being alot less epic then other books I have read at the same level such as: Deltora Forests of Silence or Spiderwick Wrath of Mulgrath. It has been three years since I read that book and I am now working to become an author myself. I will occasionally post small stories on the internet. This is a great book and I hope it will be read for years to come 
 Peter Kreeft has written an intellectually stimulating book on something we all have to face: suffering. He does so by giving us clues from philosophy, the arts, and the Bible to the meaning of suffering. As a Catholic Christian, Kreeft finds the ultimate meaning of suffering in the life, death, and resurrection of Christ. It is a book worth reading and re-reading. In my view, his most striking insight is how in literature, including the biblical story of Job, the protagonist must undergo suffering before the final triumph of good over evil. He urges us to view ourselves as protagonists in the midst of our own life stories. If good finally triumphs, as Christians believe, then the story is worthwhile, even with its inevitable suffering. Like a true philosopher, he also includes a thought-provoking chapter on why modernity can't understand suffering. This is a book that will appeal to all Christians, Catholic or non-Catholic, and to all persons searching to understand the meaning of suffering 
 I bought this book as research for a paper on water and food production on long-term space missions.  The book is well written, easy to read, and packed with lots of good information.  Very useful 
 Internal Combustion by Edwin Black should be required reading for all transportation, energy, finance and defense policy makers in our society. Americans and the world would be far better off. 
 Great little book for people joining the Catholic Faith...and also for those already in the Faith.  Very easy to read and understand with lots of little helpful insets.  
 In the short time of applying a handful of these rules in my friendships, I have come to realize how easy it is to make even the most long-standing friendships more profound and interesting. What I loved most of The Art of Friendship is appreciating that we can always make room for new and different relationships. Friendship is about making the simplest of efforts. And with 70 of these efforts now easily outlined for everyone, one can only imagine how the world might become a better place thanks to it being filled with better friends! 
 Ive been putting this box set off for a good 2-3 years. I finally purchased it used at an amazing price and its an amazing set. I dont know what people are talking about when they complain about the book falling apart and ruining the cds; Its actully a great idea. Maybe if your in a hurry and just open the book fast and shove the cd in that way, that'd ruin it. This guy wrote some of the greatest songs ever, and this collection is like a bible. As too all you anal collectors who complain about songs that arent in this collection, you have to remember the quailty of some songs have no stood the test of time, so they had to leave them out. Other then that, im very happy with the product and anyone who rated it below 4 dont know music.  
 Since their last album for Sub Pop, Wolf Eyes have released something like a dozen albums (!), and that's not counting their collaboration with avant-jazz pioneer Anthony Braxton.  Of course, these things were released on either tiny micro-labels or plain old CD-Rs, and finding them might be difficult even on the web.  Of course, many of us weren't really looking anyway.  In any event, the Wolf-men are back (semi) overground with album number two for Sub Pop.  Call it an "official" release if you must, but the main question casual fans might ask is how the band has progressed in the last two years and dozen obscure releases.  The answer to that is "not much" or "are you kidding?"  The new album basically treads the same stylistic ground, which is basically noise, and lots of it.  Usually this involves synths and other digital equipment being abused so thoroughly it sounds more effed-up than the contents of Mel Gibson's skull after a weeklong booze binge.  Of course, rather than ranting about Jews killing Jesus or Buddha or Elvis, Wolf Eyes are more interested in things like "Rationed Rot" or "Lake of Roaches" (actual song titles!).  The few tracks that have any vocals at all are unintelligable, said vocalist sounding like Skinny Puppy's Ogre being given a tonsilectomy with a blowtorch.  Actually, about half the album doesn't even bother with any type of rhythm, instead oozing and flowing like a river of New Jersey toxic sludge being funneled through your ear canals.  Still, you want progression?  Okay, a couple of tracks feature some wounded elephant saxophone.  Think that'll win 'em a Grammy 
 My mother and I borrowed this movie one night from my aunt because she said it would be a good "girls night in" flick and wow was she right. I really wasnt to sure about the movie at first I thought that the description on the back made it sound like another teen drama but I was very happy to find out I was wrong. I cried alot watching this movie because it really touched me. I knew what would happen in the end from the very beginning but I kept hoping that it wouldnt anyway. Every movie fan should buy this it is really worth the mone 
 It's hard to imagine an author covering the 1800 election, the Marbury v. Madison Supreme Court decision, and several other topics that this book treats and coming up with something coherent. But Ackerman does just that. I came to this book after reading another book by the same author dealing with the nomination, election, and assassination of James Garfield ("Dark Horse," reviewed by me earlier) and I am impressed by Ackerman's ability to write a book on political history that is almost impossible to put down. He puts in all sorts of information that is essential for a modern reader to follow the happenings of a different era with understanding, while never letting his writing become too tedious.  The Constitution was not written with an eye toward the political party system that soon developed, and the constitutional mechanism for election of the Presidency soon developed obvious flaws as soon as Washington retired. Ackerman does not go much into the 1796 election, which already unmasked problems (leading to a President and Vice-President of opposite parties) but begins with the 1800 election, which almost led to a total breakdown.   The main thrust of the book is that out of this election and the ensuing competition between Federalist ideas of the Constitution (exemplified by John Marshall in the Chief Justiceship) and the ideas of Jefferson and his allies (especially James Madison) came a synthesis which has lasted. And I think that to a large extent he makes his case.  I do want to say that another reviewer's comment that Ackerman overly adulates Jefferson and denigrates Marshall does not appear to me to be the case. He points out errors made by both men, though he says at one point that a selfish action made by Jefferson as President of the Senate probably had consequences that were in the nation's best interest, and that may be what the reviewer had in mind. I think the book is actually rather balanced.  
 I like this film very much, but when are they going to put the three "Sabata" films on VHS or DVD? Lee Van Cleef made the first and third. Yul Brynner made the second Sabata and in some ways was the best. "Ace High" is a good film from the same mold of Leone's trilogy. Yet "Ace High," "Sabata," "Death Rides a Horse" and others look second rate though in the same genre. Terence Hill however does bring "Ace High" up one notch the more I think about it 
 This product work perfectly in the Epson printer! The quality of printing is great! 
 I read this book for my 1945-present class and it opened my eyes to the hysteria which plagued this country about the Cold War.  This document was new to me before reading this book.  It made me realize how serious people thought the threat of Russia really was.   The beginning talks about how the document came to be, the middle of the book is the actual document its self, then the end has many comentaries from respected scholars and government officals.  Great book for anyone interested in the Cold War and many different points of view of the Cold War 
 This book demonstrates the power of networking.  This book is great.  It is not the most intersting or entertaining book, but the concept and value of networking is demonstrated at length and very well.  This is a must read for any business professional.  Its a little old, but still well worth the read and the ideas still apply to the current business world.  At times, the ideas and concepts can be a little over the top, but the overall jist of the thing I guarantee will pay dividends later in your career 
 Like another reviewer, my interest in history is quite new. The author's presentation of John Adams left me wanting to know much more of this great man. David McCullough's excerpting of Adams' professional and personal writings exposed a passionate man of deep convictions and possessed of an intellect and idealism beyond his generation. While Mr. Adams was acutely aware of and deplored his own ego, he, at the same time was critical of his own limitations. Even with this conflict, Adams could still say, "I thank God that he gave me stubborness when I am right."   While I read history for breadth of understanding and perspective; learning the character, strengths, weaknesses and foibles of great men and women who accomplished much during their time on the stage challenges me to dare more and risk more in the time and place God has entrusted to me.  I would very much liked to have met John Adams 
 No quick fixes in this book, but instead practical tools to enable people to focus on what Williams calls 'real leadership'. A unique thesis, excellently written. Real substance, not empty management speak and psycho-babble. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. 
 Peg Thompson has given us a real gem: a book to use, not just to read. She avoids  sentimentality and sectarianism, choosing instead to help the reader peel away his or her own layers of hurt, fear, pain, futility, and  anguish in seeking a uniquely personal spiritual life. Her journaling  exercises and questions are keen and helpful. Her "Passageways"  in each chapter are drawn from many different meditation sources. The book  draws on the varied experiences of a diverse group of people, showing that  spirituality is truly multi-layered, multi-colored. This is a book for  those of us who need a way to live spiritually but often feel frustrated  and pained by our "efforts" or uncertain about how to go about  it. No judgements are made nor are any doctrines taught within its pages,  and Thompson even shares with us her own frustrations, joys, triumphs, and  setbacks in living spiritually. Read it, use it, grow with it 
 After working out consistenty since last May, it's been difficult for me to find a workout that's challenging AND fun. That is until I found "Boot Camp Training!" This is a great workout if you've been getting bored with your same old routine. 
 This is a well-written horror story about what happens when men completely take over -and this is putting it mildly as you will see when you read the book or see the film- a wealthy, suburban American town in the 1970s.   I had seen the 1975 film as well as the more recent remake and finally read the book upon which these productions were based.   Ira Levin is a highly gifted writer in the horror genre because he understands far more than meets the eye; he tackles with aplomb and originality that which lies below the surface, at any moment threatening to take over our reality, in seemingly normal and stable suburban life.   Perhaps even more amazing is Levin's ability to write entirely from the point-of-view of the heroines in his frightening and fascinating tales--Rosemary's Baby included.   I highly recommend this book to anyone who is at all intrigued by the false sense of normalcy in suburban life and who is open to the very real possibility that women are not as safe in their suburban communities as they think, and that their actual foes may be closer than they appear in the rose-colored mirrors of their suburban bedrooms

 If you have ever been told that your arguments lack facts, structure, or logic, then this book is for you. Learning the skills to challenge and defend anything and everything is an art indeed. Highly recommend it for partisan zealots.   PenetratingArmenian  A Self Certified Blogspot Blogge 
 i was privileged enough to have dr. kalpakjian as a teacher in college before he retired. we used his 3rd edition as our textbook. now as i start my career in engineering, i am finding that i need to refer to the book! i borrowed the book in college for his class and am now buying a copy for our office.  a great reference.  very well thought out book with excellent diagrams.  worth every penny 
 I came across this book at a bookstore's clearance sale and bought it on a whim, which I was afterwards very grateful for. This is a comprehensive collection of lively, varied stories, each one worth reading. Each is a slice of life as vivid as an Edward Hopper painting, delicious for its voyeuristic glimpse into a life, often a life's last moments.  The book is proof positive of Highsmith's abilities in terms of writing from different prespectives, telling stories as a man, a woman, a young person or a middle-aged one, an American or a European. Everyone will have a different favourite here; pressed to choose, I would not agree with the choice of Mr Ingendaay, who wrote the afterword, but rather select one of the very last stories in the book, "Things had gone badly", for its implicit conclusions about how banal everyday obligations can destroy artistic creativity. "A Girl Like Phyl" is another one of the prizewinners here, an insightful reflection on the harm that can be done by letting idealised memories of an unsuccessful relationship become a fallacious yardstick for measuring other relationships. Just a few of the stories are underdeveloped, staying at the level of character sketches, but this is compensated for by the ingenious ideas that gave rise to other stories, such as the collector of counterfeits in "The Great Cardhouse". The only reason why I give this book four stars instead of five is that I felt a bit too many of the stories (I won't say which ones) ended with a suicide which occasionally felt like a Deus ex Machina. Despite that this is a book that you won't be sorry you've bought 
 As someone who has heard Ken Boa speak and heard the enthusiasm he has for God and teaching the Word, I would highly recommend this book for self-study or group study.  Not only are you walked through Proverbs, but you are asked pointed questions that make you think about the application of the text as well 
 It took me all of 4 hours to read this book.  It was insightful and entertaining.  It was also sad.  I cried so hard at the end of the book that I hiccuped for 3 hours.  I work at a children's home and have passed this book to several of my 'children' who returned the book damp with tears and facing challenges with new resolve.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has to face ANY TYPE of challenge, whether mental, physical, financial, whatever 
 If your child enjoys acting out the Thomas & Friends episodes, Duck is one of the more sensible engines. He is a big green tank engine with the GWR logo on the sides. He stands no nonsense from the engines and freight cars who try to boss him around, and does things his own way--the Great Western way. Unfortunately, sometimes the freight cars get the best of him, especially when they make him crash through a barber shop in "A Close Shave For Duck."  If you could use a sensible engine in your layout, then Duck is for you. Don't worry if  he's accident-prone, though. You could always get an engine that will tow him back into place. Then, Duck will be ready to work the Great Western way again 
 John Marshall is primarily remembered as the great chief justice who handed down many of the decisions that defined the constitutional structure, which law students read every year and judges are still dealing with nearly two centuries later. But in his wonderful biography, Smith shows the full picture of Marshall and his significant influence prior to his chief justiceship. Marshall was a soldier during the Revolution who later entered Virginia politics somewhat unwillingly. He was a well respected lawyer who eventually earned a sizable fortune, unlike most of his contemporaries who inherited theirs. Smith provides all of this in a clear and detailed manner. Also, he avoids one of the great problems that biographers of the founding era have: the extreme focus many place upon private lives of these men while limiting coverage of their public acts. Smith explains Marshall's private life without obsessing on it unnecessarily.   Of course, most purchasers of this book are looking for information on Marshall's years on the bench and his impact upon the Constitution. All of the cases one would expect are dealt with in a thorough manner: Marbury, McCullough, Martin, Gibbons. The best part is of this book is that Smith goes beyond these great cases and provides detail on earlier caselaw that demonstrates Marshall's, and the Court's, commitment to nationalistic constitutional interpretations well before the seminal cases. This defeats criticism that claims Marshall had no support for his arguments, a criticism that develops from his habit of not citing to precedent. Particularly, some of the early unknown cases dealt with interesting issues of the war power and international law.   Smith's biography is detailed and compelling, I couldn't put it down. Even though I have a pretty strong knowledge of constitutional history and of the Marshall era, Smith's book provided a wealth of information on details that I had little idea even existed. I would strongly recommend it to both people interested in legal history as well as those interested more broadly in political history.  
 This movie is a classic, u have so many great actors in this movie... You know, I loved this movie the first time i saw it as a kid and it was better the seccond time... 
 To live the life of Walter Cronkite is to live a thousand years.  For nearly half a decade Walter Cronkite served as the voice of reason to millions of Americans who looked to his print, radio, and television reports for information and reassurance.  This autobiography covers the life of Walter Cronkite from his early life as a lowly radio announcer to his ultimate stand at the pinnacle of journalism.     As usual, Cronkite's wit is second-to-none and comes through clearly in his prose.  Still, he never pulls punches and minces no words regarding the multitude of famous and powerful men and women he met along the way.  His engrained honesty and objectivity is a refreshing look to when journalism was an honest art, plagued not by corporate sponsorship.    Cronkite's work not only serves as an interesting look at "Cronkite, the man," but is a work of modern American history, written by the man who lived and reported it all.  For a readable, enjoyable look at Cronkite's America, "A Reporter's Life" is one of the best.  
 This is some great 80's sounding music! These are some talented musicians, not just synthesized stuff. I definitely recommend this CD to any 80's fans, or simply to anyone who can appreciate great musicianship 
 Gertrude Stein observed of Ezra Pound that he was a village explainer, and very good to have around if one happened to be a village. Simon Blackburn merits the same level of praise. This book's stated intention is to give readers some sense of how philosophers approach the really big questions of knowledge, free will, God, reasoning, and so on. That's a tall order. Think is better appreciated as a chrestomathy of thought-provoking quotations and asides. The book's strongest points are its useful tips on formulating and analyzing arguments. Incidentally, the politically correct reader will be delighted at Blackburn's bows to gender-neutral language, his digs at the religious right and his sly elbow in the dead ribs of Edmund Burke. We [...] recommend this book for anyone interested in philosophy but short of time, or merely out to impress friends, colleagues and clients by dropping names of celebrity philosophers into conversations or sales pitches 
 This time he presents an edition of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's books that's every bit as timely and interesting as his own very 20th century poems.  McClatchy's own writing in every field is widely acclaimed, and in a way he is the Longfellow we deserve, with both poems of spiritual affirmation and the poetry of doubt, jostling side by side, uneasy in harness.  Longfellow's book Tales of a Wayside Inn is given a dramatic reading here, for McClatchy selects not only the best of the Tales but also tries to find room for the body and the heart in all its different avatars.   His excerpts from Michael Angelo are, as well, in tune with what we now know and feel about Michelangelo in the present time of the early 21st century, that he was as great a poet as he was a painter and sculptor, and probably a gay man to boot.  Poems like Longfellow's HIAWATHA and EVANGELINE are sensitively edited to bring forward their multicultural and ecological interests.  All in all, Longfellow may be the most forwardlooking of all the poets of 19th century USA, and that's a strong statement considering we are putting him ahead of (among others) Emerson, Poe, Dickinson, Whitman, Very, and Melville

 I love this book.  I have 3 small children, a husband, and a hyper dog.  We want to entertain more and hope that people feel welcome in our home.  I found encouragement on every page of this book, and many chuckles through-out. The humor hidden within the pages always left me coming back for more 
 Probably the best thing about "Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity" is that it is written so well. Like Rorty's other books it has a way of making philosophy less arcane than it otherwise appears. Other raters here have outlined his project better than I can and illustrate how Rorty builds upon his ideas in the book "Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature." I only want to add the observations that, (1) it is no surprise Rorty feels he has to address religion's influence in this book, and that (2) philosophical objection to Rorty appears quasi-religious in nature. Philosophical critics of both books who are consumed with the nagging perception that physical facts of reality seem indeed to hold up well to the correspondence theory of truth are steeped in a Western religious world view.  That world view and its implications for Rorty's concept of solidarity carries critical import for understanding his project.  For many of his critics that world view seems to be validated by epistemology. As some have pointed out, we do the math and the rockets fly. So some correspondence is working, apparently. In the realm of ethics, the same relationship of language to reality has apparent truth as well. In assigning verbal names to these correspondences, we superimpose a chimerical essence we call "Truth," if Rorty is right. But that "Truth" we assign has no real correspondence to what is out there in the world, in his argument. This "Truth" constitutes an unverifiable relationship because we do not know how reliable the "mirror" is, our cognitive door to perception, and this reliability is the crux of philosophical disagreement with Rorty and Dewey and other pragmatists.   It is the old debate about the relationship between fact and truth on a new level, with Nietzsche's "mobile army of metaphors" winning if you assert there can be no "truth" without words, without language, and there is therefore no "Truth." Rorty is saying the resulting epistemological uncertainty is never going away even though there is no doubt about the practical efficacy of science and phenomenology.   I disagree with critics who think he is espousing moral relativism. Epistemological uncertainty about ethics does not translate into moral relativism. Rorty, like Dewey before him, is saying moral values have to be ultimately pragmatic because there is no epistemological absoluteness about them as there is none about physical facts, even when the rockets work properly. It is a meta-ethical claim, not a claim about the truths of morality. So the assertion that Rorty's concept of solidarity amounts to espousing moral relativism makes no sense. Some critics want to label him "dangerous" in the same way Russell called Dewey's pragmatism "dangerous." Dangerousness does not make them wrong.    Regarding this dangerousness, Rorty does not think theorizing about what level or lack of epistemological surety underlies moral values changes our interaction with them, at least not in a morally or politically detrimental way.  He's saying epistemology is never going to get us to certainty, so there is no point trying to mold the polis on the assumption we do know.  What works is not only good enough but also it's all that we have.   So pragmatists like Dewey and Rorty are "dangerous" in the same way Nietzsche was dangerously misunderstood by ignorant Nazis. Some are inclined to exclaim "this cannot be" because they want absolute ontological certainty, the moral clarity of solidarity not being strong enough for us. That impulse arises from a psychological approach produced by a world view (the "mirror" at work) grounded in the Judeo-Christian tradition (as Genesis says "and God saw all that he made") and Plato's "forms" as the ultimate "True" reality ("seeing" the Truth of forms when emerging from the Republic's metaphorical cave). At its core Plato's theory is as religious as Genesis. These two traditions represent the bedrock of Western epistemological and scientific thinking.   Not everyone thinks that way though, which is why I think Rorty was on to something when he left philosophy. In the East people do not use ocular metaphors as a first resort, for instance, and they have no trouble with the idea that fact is somehow ontologically independent of truth. The Taoist roots of Zen existentialism may be more "scientific" in the pragmatist's perspective (to continue with the habit of ocular metaphors) because those ideas stress bare awareness without reflection as apprehending what we call "Truth," not seeing it and naming it so. The ultimate exact relationship between fact and truth, as Rorty suggests, is likely ineffable, but that doesn't mean we do not know facts of reality exist.  That is an idea with which the Taoists, most famously Lao-tzu or Chuang-tzu, would readily agree.  Rorty is sure enough about the facts of cruelty to write what he does, but that doesn't mean he or anyone else possesses moral certainty---to me "moral certainty" sounds like a dangerous quasi-religious idea.  I think I'd rather have a pragmatist at the helm of the polis than someone who thinks he has recevied the holy Truth.  
 The ideas herein underlie the second inaugural address of President Bush and the foreign policy that flows from that.  For that reason alone this is an important read 
 This book is based on Peter Wallison's year in the White House when he served as a legal counsel.  This book shares some of Ronald Reagan's wit,humor,and humility.  Mr.Wallison offers an assessment of the media coverage regarding the Reagan administration. The media had a tendency to over-cover the sensational while ignoring subjects of substance,like policy(foreign or domestic).They trolled for scandals.  This book shows what management style was used by the President. It also debuncts the myth that President Reagan was not intelligent.  Another interesting topic in this book is the behind the scenes view of situations in the cabinet. Leaks to the media and how rampant they were from the White House and especially the Hill.  There was a comparison of the Chiefs of Staff. Mr. Wallison wrote mostly about Donald Regan because he worked with him.  The chapters dedicated to the Iran-Contra scandal were very good! I came away with a better understanding of exactly what happened and who was involved.  This is the first book that I have read about President Reagan. I recommend it as a balanced book from an author who worked in the White House. I wish that he had been there longer 
 A great follow up to Rev. Law's first book, "The Wolf Shall Dwell With The Lamb."  Highly recommended for people who work in a multi-racial faith community 
 From 1831 to 1836 Charles Darwin, then a young man in his twenties, was  the official naturalist on the Royal Navy ship HMS Beagle. The Beagle spent  five years completing a survey of the coasts of South America and making a  series of longitude measurements around the world.  This proved to be one  of the most important scientific voyages of the 19th century, for it  was  on this voyage that Darwin made the observations that lead, twenty years  later, to his formulating the theory of evolution by means of natural  selection. This book is Darwin's account of his observations on this  voyage. Darwin was a master of detailed observation, and he describes the  things he observed -- the plants, animals, geology, and people -- in loving  detail. His accounts are always lively and full of interest. Darwin was  also a master of inductive reasoning,  and there are several superb  examples of this in this book. Perhaps the finest is Darwin's induction of  the cause of the formation of the coral atolls that dot the South Pacific  and the Indian Ocean (his theory was proved correct in the 20th century).  Indeed, much of the value of this book for the modern reader lies in the  many examples it contains of scientific, inductive thought; a powerful  method of reasoning that is as neglected today as it was in Darwin's time 
 This was one of my very first CD purchases when I finally crossed over to digital in 1990 and about 1300 CDs later, it's still one of the ones I play most often.  Comparisons to Chopin are unnecessary, this gorgeous music stands on its own. I was unfamiliar with Field's work when I purchased this and John O'Conor can be credited with a mini renaissance of John Field - there are now numerous Field works available in the catalog.    In my view, Field's Nocturnes are still not as popular as they should be - they may not be as musically complex as the more famous Romantic piano composers, but they are always beautiful.  I can't imagine a more sympathetic performance than that given by Mr. O'Conor.  I've been playing this CD regularly for 15 years and I really have no desire to hear any other performance of this beautiful music.   The CD cover effectively captures the mood these pieces evoke.  The music is consistently gentle and tranquil but never even remotely dull.  This would be an excellent purchase for someone just starting to explore classical music (stay away from those dreadful compilations!).  In fact, this would be a great purchase for people who profess not to like classical music.  It's difficult for me to believe that there's anybody who wouldn't find moments when this CD would create just the mood they were looking for.  Even headbangers need some reflective time 
 Great! I love this Cd! ITs funky and original- describes Missy well. There isn't anything bad you can say about this album. Missy shows her R&B roots as well as crafting some slick hip hop beats. The only thing I would nitpick about So Addictive is, it leaves you wanting more songs from the extraordinary Missy Misdemeanor Elliott. Favorite songs are: Take Away, Xtasy, One minute man, and of course Get ur freak on! 
 I have been using this guide to Dressing & Cooking Wild Game for several years. I bought it when I was first starting hunting big game to assist me with dressing and preparing the meat for storage or cooking. The  detailed photos and descriptions helped guide this novice through the  processing of Wild Game by showing many tricks I would never have found on  my own. Birds, small and big game, field dressing, to cooking, to the  table. This guide is a must for any sportsman's library. AND IT HAS SOME  GREAT RECIPES AS WELL 
 I don't know how anybody can say this CD is very short - it's 60 minutes long!  And how many tracks do you need?  It's nature.  I think it delivers exactly what is promised: river sounds.  If you like the sound of running water, I think you will like this CD.  The production quality is excellent.  Sometimes running water tends to sound like static when recorded, but not here 
 Dubbed "the King of advertising" by Advertising Age, David Ogilvy shared his thoughts and stories on being successful in the adverting industry in this book.  His ideas are often overflowing with self-confidence, but for a man who reached his level of success, he's definitely earned the right.   Originally published in 1963, in part as promotion of himself and his agency, this book is broken down into ten "How to" chapters plus an opening and closing commentary on the state of advertising. No example ads or illustrations in this book, just straightforward advice and colorful anecdotes on topics ranging from managing an agency to writing potent copy.  The stories are enjoyable, and Ogilvy's advice is enlightening. David Ogilvy led an amazing life, and his insights on advertising, business and human behavior are timeless. Overall, this is an inspiring book that I recommend to anyone involved in advertising 
 I have 12 years of C++/MFC experience and I still found this book to be THE one that would ultimately propel me to learn C++/CLI and be on my way to becoming as proficient in .NET as I am in MFC.  I still have a long ways to go, but this book is the one to start with 
 I am a bisexual husband. i have been married four times, and each time i have tried to explain my proclivities to my wives, but they just don't get it. Maybe if they read this book they'd understand. i highly recommend this book 
 This is a well written novel with our friends the "Ladies of Covington".   It is very true to life but I found it too realistic!  This isn't the "cozy " story the others in the series have been.  When I read a book like this I read it to escape from my  problems but in this book it's impossible to escape!   The tender moments are few and hard to find!   
 I am very glad Mr. Stanley Lane Poole wasn't as prejudiced as the eurocentric scholars and students today.If he had been he wouldn't have been able to peice together such an exquisite peice of work on the facts of history. It seems eurocentricists and those miseducated by eurocentricism, are absolutely obsessed with trying to prove that other nations, races and peoples are "less" than them and will go to no ends to convince themselves that their illusion is true.Its really pitiful. I understand though because for a eurocentricist to admit the moors were black africans whom raised and taught the people of Spain ,whom were savage barbarians at the time, would be giving the africans..a little too much credit.  By the way, if you want to know who the moors were race-wise, check the country of Morocco's archives, look up Sultan Sidi Muhammad, grandfather of the sultan who signed "the treaty of peace and friendship" with America (in 1787), when you see his picture you will see without a doubt,that he was a black african.A descendant of the african moors who occupied spain 
 Brecht's theater is a blast, a genuine attempt to do something unique and productive with the heretofore conservative and corporate medium of the stage.  It represents the first wave of revolution in European theater since the English stage was closed in the mid-17th century. Brecht successfully constructs an antifascist, anti-exploitative theater without being didactic or heavyhanded about it. (As I mentioned, it's actually a blast.) Much of his success came from surrounding himself with brilliant and dedicated people, and much of the success of this collection of Brecht's writings comes from Brecht's polishing his ideas in the tumbler of real practice with those people.  For me, Brecht's passing comments on Aristotle and Shakespeare are worth the price of admission 
 It's actually Layzie Bone's bestest album he ever had. Just lsten to the other ones and compare them 
 Natural High is a slow sultry song about love and passion 
 If you are trying to pick and choose pix off your camera card, any digital frame will be disappointing to you.  These are not $100 computers.  This one is a jpg slide show, mp3 player and bare bones mpg and avi video player!  For its primary use, you'll probably want to enhance your images        and shrink file size for display on a small LCD wide screen anyway.  What I do is edit images on a real computer and copy them to an empty flash device. I plug this into frame and copy pix to onboard memory.  Also great for playing videos from YouTube etc. off of plugin flash.  Only caveats are: 1. No support on company web site.  (business opp?)  2. On my Dell direct USB cabling is flaky.  Drive appears and disappears. If I'm quick I can make a transfer, but it's easier to use flash.  Of course if you just want to see what's on your camera card, just plug it in.    
 James comes through again. A real page turner. Andrew Gross picked a winner to collab with 
 Edward Larson's book on Evolution I found to be extremely useful and a valuable resource.  Larson is the author of a fine study of the Scopes Trial called "Summer for the Gods."  This Modern Library book in its 300 pages is chock full of useful information on this topic.  This is not a book just about Darwin, though of course he is the central character, but more about what preceded Darwin and what went on after the Darwinian breakthrough, all the way to the present, in Europe and the U.S. In other words, this book places Darwin within a highly useful framework, what occurred before the "Origin of Species" and what transpired thereafter. An initial chapter focuses on pre-Darwinian developments beginning with the Enlightenment in biology and geology among other fields, including individuals such as Lamarck, Agassiz, Lyell, and Hutton. The next several chapters deal with Darwin and his argument, including the later "Descent of Man."  A really superb chapter on the "Ascent of Evolutionism" discusses the debates that ensued after Darwin announced his theory, including non-Darwinian theories of evolution.  Subsequent chapters deal with the "missing link" problem; the evolution of genetics; the development of eugenics; and the religious opposition (principally in this country) to evolution, including the Scopes trial and "intelligent design."  The book concludes with an analysis of the most current theories relating to evolution, including the tremendous impact of DNA technology.  Excellent notes, outstanding illustrations, and Larson once again demonstrates his ability to explain complicated scientific concepts to the layperson--a rare talent.  A treasure trove of information on this topic presented in a highly attractive format--i.e., it is just fun to read.   
 This is a beautiful and subtle story.  While the story metaphorically uses a fence as the boundary constructed between people of different races, the metaphor could also be used to represent the boundaries that always seem to exist between people who are different from one another.  If we all could only meet each other at those fences, like these little girls... 
 Good album. Just a shade below their "It's Just the Night" CD, but very good 
 I love this book.  I haven't laughed so hard from a novel since I read Cold Sassy Tree in high school.  I recommend this to anyone who feels nothing will ever get better, it might not, but is can get funnier 
 I use these socks for running and they are very well cushioned and comfortable. they also withstand frequent laundry without loosing quality.  
 This book is just what my family needed to get our lives organized! 
 Bernard Malamud is known for creating deeply flawed characters with strong ideals, and Seymour Levin - known interchangeably as S, Sy, Seymour, Levin and Lev - the central character in this wonderful novel, is no exception. A thirty year old masters graduate, down on his luck, but with the backing of an NYU education, he lands a job as a college instructor in the English department of a fictional mid-western state (Cascadia) college. This opens up an interesting cast of characters who view him with a mix of interest, disinterest, partly an inferior, an activist/idealist (his beard suggests he is a radical in the year 1950 in the midst of red-baiting and community suspicion), a potential threat, an alien, an anomaly.   Levin, "formerly a drunkard" (to quote the author) has deep seated problems and issues of self worth. He is a plain man, though definitely an idealist; however, one gets the sense early on that his idealism comes less from a passionate, inward set of convictions and more from a sense of inferiority, and a desire to find meaning in ideas. His activities and how quickly he reacts to the new environment are fascinating - he wastes no time getting inappropriately involved with a female student, sleeping with the wife of a trusting colleague or getting embroiled in the politics of the English department (here Malamud provides an interesting look at a college in a conservative town that values professional training at the expense of literature and learning) and being drawn into a myriad of ethical and moral dilemmas. Without spoiling the plot any further, Levin breaks every conventional rule in the book - this makes him less a sympathetic character and more someone the reader is almost glad to see suffer the fate he does. I would not have felt this way if I got the sense that Levin was fighting for something and doing it sensibly - while I love literature, the way Levin goes about seeking its elevation seems foolish and misguided. Perhaps more about ego and an attempt to feel worthy than out of a true love of books.   This is in essence something of a morality tale, and if I had to get to the heart of what Malamud is saying here it would have to be that misplaced idealism - without moral or ethical standards - will destroy the person within. I found it to be both gripping and bleak at the same time, but surely one of my favorite Malamud novels (and I have now read them all, so will have to find a new author to stalk!).   It seems that from the sparseness of the reviews here and from the seeming lack of recognition this book has received, it is one of his least known works. That is a shame because the characters and plot are fascinating; the themes are timeless (suspicion of someone who looks different, moral bankruptcy, clash of conservatism and radicalism, status quo versus change) and the writing is very good 
 For anyone in a serious marketing role, Lead Generation for the Complex Sale takes a detailed approach on how to nurture leads so you can work more effectively with sales and not have to go back to the well every time you run a new marketing campaign. I has changed the way I think about lead generation forever! Thank you Brian 
 One of the biggest problems encountered in approaching different medical strategies is sorting out the claims of the various schools. This volume presents a clear and well worded guide to a wide variety of medical issues,  comparing the different available techniques. It is not perfect. In a  volume of this size, judgemental claims are made, and one can disagree with  the judgement made. Claims are made, without the reasoning behind them. To  be honest, there is not enough space in a volume of this size for a more  comprehensive evaluation, so you will have to read around the subject of  interest. Having said that, despite room for disagreement, I found the  information was accurate, comprehensive and understandable. If you want a  handy, one-volume reference in clear format, this is the book for you. I  liked the broad approach, but did not appreciate the "school  medicine" assessment at the end of the reviews, although the balance  was well met. I am recommending this book to my friends 
 I first heard this album while sitting in a coffeeshop in Corvallis, Oregon - many years ago - went out and bought the tape immediately .  I pretty well fried the casette tape out during long cross-country drives and, as I'm not a huge fan of the genre had decided not to replace it with a CD.  Big mistake!  I heard One is One again on a college radio station near Austin, Texas in the summer of 2006 and decided to buy it again.  I'm now afraid that I might fry the CD out.  The music is surprisingly melodic for techno (if that is, indeed, what this is) and, when listened to closely, surprisingly complex.  It is also very strong music (without being overly aggressive - there is, after all, such a thing as too much bass) with enough going on in the way of dynamics and signature shifts to keep the listener engaged - even during the longest and loneliest drives across west Texas.  If you like early techno (Space comes to mind, even some of the intrumentals by Sky verge on primitive techno) I think you'll like Robert Miles 
 At the first instance let me issue a warning :  You are bound to get caught in the tornado :   `A Sideways Look at Time'.  Any page will get you hooked.    The new literary genre invented by Jay Griffiths is splendid, wide-ranging and illuminating.  Shapeless concerns are articulated spontaneously and you will get fascinated with your new outlook  in life.  Sift  through this compendious book for strands of gold.    The author may be self-indulgent but her arguments are irresistible and provocative.   Analyze and enjoy the following nuggets of wisdom from her book :  1)      It is not that time passes, but ourselves.   Time is always there... as long as there is life to use it. 2)      Time has immediacy and radiance.  It is a sensual perception and not a notation. 3)      Time is not inert.  We live with the past and present altogether.  The past lives in the present spiritual values. 4)      We live forwards but we understand backwards. 5)      Have just a few hours everyday that are inviolate. 6)      Children live in the heart of the ocean of time itself, in an everlasting Now.  A child's eternal present is present-absorbed, present-spontaneous and present-elastic.  Children have a dogged, delicious disrespect for punctuality. 7)      Speed is deceptive and alluring, cruel, adrenaline-pounding and fascistic.  Language too is driven faster and faster.  Markets become super/hyper markets.  Words are pressed from text to hypertext, not to supersede but to hypersede themselves. 8)      In prostitution alone, the phrase `Time is money' is almost true. 9)      The earth is sacred.   It is not for violation, exploitation or negotiation. It is to be cared for, to be conserved.   10)   With industrial agriculture, genetic engineering and biotechnology, time is reduced to a sequence of numbers without the vibrancy of natural seasons.  Divorcing time and nature makes an artifice of Time and artifact of Nature.   11)   Particularity is lost on the Information Super Highway.  Being a virtual everywhere is an actual nowhere.   It is a Teflon place, wiped clean of muddy, earthly reality.  Every act in virtual time is final, finite and finished.  No human act is. 12)   Computinglish, the type of language dominant today -overweighing command structures and undervaluing language's playful, seductive and gainsaying subtleties, its ambiguities and nuances, disagreements and disobediences.   13)   The word `Will' is not innocent.  What will be is not in the lap of some-God-of-the-future, but is an act of will, an act of power, the will of today.  When the will is infinite in its grasp, the only possible result is tragedy.  Will must be tempered with respect.  This will could be a present, an act of care and generosity. 14)   In this age of `rights', there should surely be Time Rights, fighting any attempts at the metaphysical enslavery of people's time, arguing for a humane clock, for an integrity of time and respect for the dignity of the individual's hours. 15)   Trees do not just last passively over time, they create time by creating breathable air.  They are oxygenating lungs of the Earth, vital to the ecosystem and home to millions of species.   Time is different in a treescape. 16)   India has its `vessel above time', always full to overflowing,  a notion of eternity transcending any temporality.  17)   The mythic moment is where the profane present meets a sacred eternity.  Delve deeply into the following chunks of messages which embrace Dharma, Poetry and Philosophy.  TIME  This fantastic book is a broadside against all the misuses of time. It is a manifesto for time to be seen extraordinary, strange, and sensual.  Scientists today use femtoseconds, a millionth of a billionth of second.   Time has been increasingly divided and subdivided.  Everything is timed.  Quality time is quantitative, counted and accounted.  The fullness of time is over emptied of its grace and generosity.  In femtoseconds and cesium atoms, modernity's time is divided but not distinguished.    Chronos and Kairos were different Gods for time's different aspects.  Chronos was the God of absolute time, linear, chronological and quantifiable.  Kairos was the god of timing, of opportunity, of choice and mischance, the auspicious and the not-so-auspicious.  If you sleep because the clock tells you it is way past your bed time, it is chronological time. If you sleep because you are tired, that is kairological time.  Kairological time is the spirit of the particular moment. It is a concept, time enlivened and various, time elastic and fertile.     WOMEN  If man has seven ages, women in contemporary Western society has only one.  One young one.  One fixed one.  Time must be stayed, for women, like  plastic - with plastic.  HRT, cosmetic industry, and the cosmetic surgery all help towards this goal.  Female faces are plasticized into facile facsimile face-lifts.  The face's whole meaning is a page to write your character on; the whole purpose of having a face is to show emotion in motion - the mobility at the heart of expressiveness.   Obstetricians speed up labor with vacuum extraction or caesarian section.  In its wise etymology, what does obstetrics mean?  `To be present',  to `stand at'.  Not to speed up labor but to be present at it.  Not to force a woman but to stand by her.    PROGRESS  Progress is only an idea, a mental construct, but it is treated as if it had the status of concrete fact, as if the march of progress had a sort of absolute inevitability and preordained certainty.   Progressing into the future appeals because it claims an optimistic mobility while the whole idea of sustainability can be characterized as stasis.    Progress is a specific idea; western, money-oriented, and technologically biased.  But it pretends to a universality, so that all peoples must be made to define and embrace progress in exactly the same way.  Progress is two-faced; it has a lovely smile for the powerful and a cruel sneer for the poor and underprivileged.    Jay's holistic view of time resolves the modern dilemma - a meaningless existence and the Subtle Trap of Counterfeit Meaning.  The Search For Meaning is vital precisely because without it, you fall prey to the lure of "counterfeit" meanings. If you make no effort to discover the meaning of your individual life, you thereby play host to an existential vacuum at the very core of your being.    Thank the author Jay Griffiths and read her magnum opus with wonder and reverence.    You will find the real meaning of your life.   You can hear the language speaks instead of the author.    
 Watching "Once and Again" is one of the most painful television shows to watch, let along watch again.  This is not because it is a bad television show, but because when it comes to dealing with the aftermath of divorce it is the most painfully realistic television show that has aired to date.  I would like to be able to identify with Rick, but my personal situation is more like that of Jake, and instead of focusing on the romantic relationships between the adults I keep paying more attention to the pain of the children when they talk about what divorce has done to them.  Watching "Once and Again: The Complete Second Season" on DVD, the character I found myself paying attention to more than the first time around when the series aired on ABC was that of Zoe Manning.  There is a moment when she reads her parents, Lily and Jake, the riot act regarding being the youngest and not only getting hand me downs from her older sister Grace, but also ending up with less years where the family ("Scribbling Rivalry").  Anybody who has been in a family that has gone through a divorce will find this show hits home time and time again.  If you have been spared that particular experience, then I really do not know why you would want what these people go through.  If the first season of "Once and Again" is about Lily Manning and Rick Sammler falling in love, then the second season is about how that relationship has a ripple effect with their family as the inevitability of the relationship forces their children and ex-spouses to a new level of acceptance.  There is actually more abut Lily and her new job (e.g., "Scribbling Rivalry") and Rick working on a mega-project for Miles Drentell ("Edifice Wrecked"), than there is about them being with each other.  While Lily and Rick are happy, for the most part, everybody else is wallowing in misery to varying degrees, and throughout the season getting all the kids together and on the same page proves to be problematic again and again (e.g, "Feast or Famine").  The major irony is that the dyad I am most interested in is Karen and Jessie, especially knowing what is going to happen to Karen in the third season and what Evan Rachel Wood has done since this show ended (although I am equally impressed by Julie Whalen as a young actress as well).  So I tend to pay attention to what each of those characters are doing, albeit for different reasons, but with more of an appreciation of how Jessie is her mother's daughter, which is not always a good thing ("Best of Enemies"), especially since Jessie is having trouble adjusting to high school and stops eating ("Food for Thought").  Having Miles Drentel is a mixed blessing, because while watching David Clennon is always a pleasure, when he becomes a wedge between Rick and David it is like watching Michael and Elliot on "thirtysomething" all over again.  But it does inspire a true moment of vision for Rick ("Ozymandias 2.0"), and by the end of the season it becomes clear that the purpose of having Miles around is to bring Rick down to the point that all he can offer Lily is himself at the end because his professional reputation and business are pretty much shot.  This becomes important because it means Rick and Lily do not have the money to find a house where their merged families can have enough space to breathe, let alone live.  But dramatically the whole bit of Karen and her law firm trying to stop Miles, and Rick, from building their project is more interesting ("Edifice Wrecked"), especially when it seems Rick might end up going to prison ("Won't Someone Please Help George Bailey Tonight").  When the psychiatrist that Jessie is seeing points out that only married people get as angry as Rick and Karen get at each other, it seems so obvious.    This really is a year of one step forward and one step backwards for most of the characters.  Jake is the big hero when an emotionally disturbed bus boy shows up at the restaurant with a gun ("The Other End of the Telescope"), but bails on Tiffany when she wants him to be a father to their baby ("Forgive Us Out Trespasses").  Judy comes up with the great idea of "Booklovers," despite Lily's negativity, but needs the entire rest of the season to figure out Will Gluck.  Eli has found something he likes and is good at with his music ("I Can't Stand Up For Falling Down"), but is unable to build on it as his problems with school and romance continue.  Note: why Rick and Karen wasted time letting Eli apply to the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana is beyond me, because I have taught there and my oldest daughter is graduating from there this December.  I have to tell you that unless Eli is going on a basketball scholarship, he is not getting it to that school and thinking he had a chance was a totally unrealistic expectation.   So, my question is whether the people who put the show together know this was a big mistake and it is an insight into Eli's parents, or simply me once again reading way too much into the situation.      My only real complaint is that this time around it becomes clearer to me that Lily is really way too judgmental.  At least when she does not immediately accept Rick's proposal (another painfully true moment for me), she does not leave him hanging for long and I liked the way he found out she had accepted his ring.  The fact that season two ends with the wedding ("The Second Time Around") might seem like the end of the story, but only if you make the mistake of thinking "Once and Again" was simply about Lily getting remarried.  It really is about trying to make two families one, which is why fans are sitting around waiting for the third and unfairly final (and incomplete) season to come out on DVD 
 For anyone interested in the background, impact, and future of the Pick-Sloan Plan, you need look no further than Lawson's aptly titled "Dammed Indians".  The tribes from Gavins Point Dam near Yankton,  SD to Ft. Peck Dam in Montana have all been adversely affected with the  damming of the Missouri River, a truth which Lawson documents with  precision and skill.  Originally a Ph.D. dissertation written in the  history department at the University of New Mexico, Lawson is a fine  example of some of the many outstanding American West historians who have  come out of that institution 
 I had to read this for an English class, and I must say, it was sheer Hell. After I began to understand it, however, I came to admire Spencer's lagnuage, imagery, and wit. Hard to read, but great book 
 Good DVD TV Show.  This DVD was good I liked it because David Charvet, Jeremy Jackson, Nicole Eggert, and Pamela Anderson were in it.  David Charvet and Jeremy Jackson are so hot!  David has great everything: hair, face, body, abs, voice.  Jeremy is still young in this show but as he got older he became a hunk.  He has great everything too: face, body, abs, voice.  Nicole Eggert and Pam Anderson are hot too.  Nicole and Pam are hot back in the day in this DVD.  They are older now and are sure showing it they are not as appealing these days.  I must say that Pam sure does have great big ones...Being a teen guy I know Baywatch having seen it over the past few years on the spike t.v. channel 
 This was a really amazing book.  When I first picked it up I had a hard time not seeing the people from the movie in my mind but eventually I got past that and really loved it.  The book is always better.  
 It's terrifying to realize the complexity of evil and it's coherence to life as we know it.  Sometimes to know what is good you need to define what is not.   This helps clarify what is not.  Brace yourself and pray 
 The most common comment from the people I showed this book to was "I wish I had it when I started using Eclipse".  While this is a very small book, the contents have been selected to give you a best start with the main features of the Eclipse IDE. The topics are short but concise and include scattered tips for the points of interest.  If you're just starting with this IDE, the Eclipse IDE Pocket Guide will give you a great head start and will continue helping you as a lovely reference to refer back to as the features become familiar. Having all of these critical features pointed out earlier will save you a lot of bother in the future, since you'll be annoyed if you only find out about them much later by accident or experimentation!  Experienced users are less likely to get much from it though. The authors made a decision between content and size, and I feel they chose to stick with a smaller, simpler book than I would have expected. There is a final section on places to go for more information, but it just refers to various community sites.  I wish I had this book when I started using Eclipse 
 I'm not Muslim myself, but I have long had a lot of love, respect, and admiration for Islam and Muslims (growing up in the Eighties and early Nineties, my family were even friends with a wonderful Iranian family who had fled the Revolution).  It answers a lot of questions and concerns of not only the loved ones of women who have become Muslims but also of people who just would like to know more about Islam, particularly modern womens' role in it and why so many American women are choosing to become Muslims.  I'd like to consider myself pretty knowledgeable about the faith despite not being a member, but I too ended up learning things I hadn't known about before.  It's clear that the women who responded to the survey sent out by Mrs. Anway and her daughter Jodi are very happy in Islam, feel it empowers them instead of, as the media would have people believe, oppresses or represses them, have wonderful marriages (although there were a few respondents who reported having had bad marriages, it was clear that that was the fault of the "men" they had had the misfortune of marrying, not because of the nature of Islam itself), feel very in tune with spiritual matters, and in many cases are happier about themselves and their lives since choosing Islam.  It saddens and upsets me to see reviewers giving this book low ratings not because of the content but because they apparently dislike Islam anyway and seem to not believe anything positive about it.  Are all of these women talking effusively about how they feel more liberated in hijab than in the type of clothing most American women wear, clothing which causes them to be looked at as a sex object and not a person, how well their husbands treat them, how warmly their in-laws welcomed them, how many rights women have under Islam, just brainwashed liars?  That insults everyone's intelligence to claim that this book isn't telling the "truth."  The truth is what these women experience and have chosen to share, and if that goes against what you believe about Islam, I guess nothing can convince you that, despite what the media portrays and how certain men in certain cultures have kept their women illiterate to keep them from reading the Koran and learning how many rights women really do have under Islam, Islam really is a religion of love, moderation, and respect and rights for women.    As others have mentioned, there is a cut and paste feel to the text; it would have been even better had there been more scholarly information on Islam, like in-depth explanations of the marriage rituals, the pilgrimage to Mecca (which women btw ARE allowed on, despite the allegations of another reviewer), giving to charity, the various holidays, what's in the various sections of the Koran, types of Muslim schools in the United States, and if it's usual to have a little ceremony or celebration after taking shahada (becoming a Muslim), and if so, what the celebration consists of.  And as others have pointed out, a lot of the women surveyed seemed to have become Muslim primarily because of their husbands, or the men who later became their husbands.  As a Jew by Choice myself, I share that complaint when reading books about conversion to Judaism; despite popular perception, a lot of people convert to another religion (Islam, Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism, etc.) for themselves, while single, finishing the process while still single, not marrying for some time afterwards or even ever.  Conversion is always stimulated by much more than a romantic relationship 
 There are times when I want to light this book on fire and throw it (and the metronome) out the window.  But it works.  I like how the exercises gradually get harder, instead of taking big jumps.  Even my typing's improved 
 "'Uncle Max' is the story of a gawky adolescent teetering on the edge of homosexuality, who discovers an unlikely hero in his outrageous, irreverent uncle. Together, this daring duo embarks on a glorious madcap adventure that will change young Dillon's life forever."-- zebra 
 "Double Trouble" took advantage of the spy themes in the '60s. Elvis does his martial art moves in this picture. Unfortunately, his fighting opponent falls down a boarded-up well and...well, enough said. Annette Day tries to put her move on Elvis. He's a little resistent at first, but eventually gives in. A lot of action, a lot of comedy, and a lot of music is what is made up of "Double Trouble". Whoever said that they were the only one enjoying this picture was wrong. You're not alone. I am a true and huge Elvis fan. I love all of his movies, no matter what they stuck him in. "Double Trouble" is double fun 
 This film is hysterical. It has a plethora of quotable lines and is a great movie to watch on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Alan Alda plays a sociopathic borderline dictator of a Dean of a Bannanna Republic Med  School. Guttenberg doesnt...ruin the movie. All in all, if you like Real  Genius and Spies Like Us, this  movie will keep you on the floor laughing 
 I am somewhat new to reading books such as this for pleasure, but I read  what I think will interest me.  I was thrown at first by the title thinking  that the book was going to be about hard scaping.  Instead this book was a  real eye opener to a lot of things we take for granted every day.  Chapters  titled soil, water, and air open up the reader to understand all that is  envolved in making a city before you get to the buildings and people.  I  initally borrowed the book from the library while reading it but had to  purchase a copy of my own for future reference.  I give this book a high  recommendation to anyone in the architecture or landscape fields 
 We have a household of 6 indoor cats.  This product is very effective at minimizing the aggression that is bound to happen in this situation.  It was amazing from the very first day.  We now keep two units in the house...and it is quite obvious if we forget and one of them runs out.  I have heard similar stories from friends who use this product, even one friend who works with feral cats.  I highly recommend this product for anyone with a multiple cat household 
 I was scathing in my review of the Arrival CD because basically, it was crap. This effort from Journey (who I have loved for many, many years) really grows on you. There are some excellent lyrics and musicianship (Would you expect anything less from Journey?). There are two negatives though and that is that each member of the band takes lead vocals - That should never happen again as there are a couple of tracks that flop and there are too many tracks which right near the end are just plain rubbish. Take out Every Generation,Better Together and Gone Crazy and you have a really good album. Highlights are:Place in your heart - (sounds like separate ways part 2 with very much Steve Perry vocals), Believe, Knowing that you loved me, Beyond the clouds and Never too late.  This is a much better return than Arrival and I am warming to this Steve's voice. Keep it comming guys 
 The film is a classic, the restoration is beautiful, and the restored audio is excellent, with one inexplicable gaff.  During a humorous dialog exchange, one of Redford's funniest lines is replaced with a sanitized-for-TV dub, which I had only ever heard on the broadcast version of the movie.  Original Dialog Gondorf: Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.   Hooker: He didn't tell me you was a f**k-up, neither.  The perfect timing of the exchange is blown to bits by the dubbed in line, "He didn't tell me you was a screw-up, neither," which has neither the delivery nor the comic impact of Redford's original.  Even if it meant getting the film re-rated, this movie deserved better treatment.  Why a company would go the all the effort of restoring a classic, award-winning film, then leave in a clumsy, laugh-robbing dub like this, is a complete mystery to me.  Other than this one cringing moment, it's a true gem 
 I recieved this cookbook as a wedding gift and I just loved it. This book is for someone who is just starting out to learn how to cook. It has recipes for desserts, entrees,breads,smoothies, and even mixed drinks. It explains how to organize your kitchen and what every utensil can be used for. There is even a section of ideas for table centerpieces. This is a great book for yourself or a gift for someone. 
 From some of the reviews I looked at below you'd think that children didn't have a right to watch the things they enjoy. There are many films I viewed as a young boy that I would not want to watch today, however, they were good for there time. And children need to have their films too! So lighten up adults! This animation was made for, marketed and directed for children. My two young daughters loved this film. And that is all that matters to me. However, I liked it too. My children laughed through many parts of the film, and I right along with them. So you don't have to be a child to enjoy the film.    As for the reviewer below, "Toy Story" is great and a wonderful and delightful film. But so is this. If you have children [I have two young daughters] you might consider this film. It is immensely enjoyable with action, suspense, and comedy rolled into one. Just what the children need: A little bit of relaxing fun. The story centers around a family of super-heroes with both the Mom and Dad retired from the spy business to raise a family. But their young children also have super powers. I highly recommend the film [for children] and also for the other children [adults like me]. This is a delightful little treat of a film and does not need apologies or comparisons to other films. Enjoy it for the sake of entertainment. Recommended!  
 My cursory review of the book stimulated a careful reading.  I found Dr. Ravicz' book to be well conceived, well researched and exceptionally well written for a 'popular' book.  It should be required reading for groups, couples, and -of course - for those individuals who for financial reasons have to 'work it out' alone.  Men could benefit also, but the focus on woman leaves us with a joy of challenge, not a fear of working on our problems!  Right on, Dr. Ravicz! Your degrees suggest we should have more from you 
 One must remember when reading Dr. Berne's book on the games we play that it was written over 40 years ago which makes it a far more ground-breaking work than one may suppose. It's brief but exudes many timeless truths about the nature of human beings. It's important for me to note for potential readers that his transactional psychological viewpoint does not derive from the separate mathematical field of game theory. That's a completely different discipline. The titles he uses for the games we play were inventive as was his choice of using acronyms to describe them. One example is IWFY for "If it Weren't for You." Dr. Berne's work is an intriguing starting or middle point for those people interested in the way we relate to one another. 
 Winfred Blevins' `Give Your Heart to the Hawks' is exactly what its sub title claims - a tribute to the Mountain Men. It is neither a historical novel nor a pure history. Rather, it is accurate history, albeit with Blevins' interpretation of the thoughts and emotions that the mountain men were experiencing during some of their most dangerous and daring exploits added.  This technique removes the book from the roles of strict history, but works well in creating the tribute that the author intended, for his goal was not simply to chronicle the bones of their history, but to bring to life their wild and free existence and allow the reader to enter into the spirit of the mountain man's life. Blevins does not attempt a comprehensive account of the mountain men. Some are covered extensively, like John Colter, the prototype mountain man, Jim Bridger, and Jed Smith, the most atypical and perhaps greatest of the mountain men. Others, like Old Bill Williams, Joe Walker, and Kit Carson are barely covered or mentioned only in passing. Blevins does not cover the mountain men of the southwest at all. Instead, he illuminates his chosen subjects in depth, choosing to fully explore the life that the mountain men lived rather than broadly covering the entire scope of their collective history.  To recreate the wild drama of the mountain man's life, Blevins tells some of the most thrilling tales of the era, like John Colter's desperate naked run from Indian braves pursuing him for sport, Hugh Glass' amazing solo trek through 300 miles of wilderness without weapons or any tools for survival after being left for dead when mauled by a grizzly, or Jed Smith's daring crossings of the desert and mountains to find a land route to California. He writes of these men, "Any man who survived for several years as a trapper, taking responsibility for his own survival alone in the wilds, had been schooled thoroughly by the Rocky Mountains. ...He had graduated from Rocky Mountain College, a pragmatic university that gave no degrees, but flunked men into their graves." Between the various stories of specific mountain men, he includes interludes that detail important aspects of their life and trade - trapping, yarning, rendezvous, buffalo - cuisine premiere, mountain craft, mountain mating, and trappers and Indians are a few of the interesting subjects of mountain life dealt with in these interludes. He also includes a few colorful accounts written by the rare, literate mountain man detailing their unique life. He succeeds admirably in breathing life into this too often neglected period of amazing individuals who blazed the way for the westward expansion of the American nation.  While Blevins' writing is not always stellar, he manages to create an effective and stirring tribute to the wild individuals who chose to live free in the Rocky Mountains. No one who is interested in the period should miss it. Both students of the period of the mountain men and fur trade and those looking for a good introduction to the subject will find `Give Your Heart to the Hawks' a fascinating and rewarding reading experience.

 My son really enjoyed this story of a young orphaned girl "chosen" (to her dismay) to leave her country and go to America by herself, leaving behind her grandmother. The pictures are excellent, and the story moves quickly. The story  provoked frequent questions by my son such as: "Why did Jessie have to leave her homeland and her grandmother?" and "Why did the villagers think going to America was such a good thing?" Because Jessie was a child, my son identified with her. A beautiful story 
 The Oxford English Dictionary is one of the largest and most encompassing dictionaries in the world. It took almost 70 years to complete and during those years thousands of volunteers scrutinized newspapers, journals and new and old books for new words, new meanings of words and sentences that would clarify the meanings. One of the most active volunteers was the American doctor William Chester Minor. During the 20 years that the doctor collaborated he developed a friendship with the editor, James Murray. When Murray decided to visit doctor Minor, he found that the latter served a lifetime sentence in the Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane after he had killed an innocent worker. The intellectual doctor Minor was found to be mad as a hatter: at night he heard voices, he claimed he was kidnapped, tortured and abused and under the floor of his cell there would live a bunch of Pygmees. The biographies of Murray, Minor and the Oxford English Dictionary are nicely interrelated in this well-written book. 
 Motherless Daughters: The Legacy Of Loss by award winning journalist Hope Edelman is an informative and expertly contributive documentation of the psychological and spiritual effects the death of a mother might have on the life and psychological well being of a daughter. Deftly presenting how the absence of a nurturing maternal hand could influence the development of a daughter's self identity, and what might result from the loss of such a role model and source of emotional support, Motherless Daughters tells of why living beyond a mother's final year reminds a daughter of her exquisite separateness; how present-day relationships are defined by past losses; what the "unmothered" woman can do to reclaim her autonomy and restore her connection to the family of the motherline; and how to understand grief as an ongoing journey. Very strongly recommended reading for all women, who have lost or who are risk for the loss of their mother, Motherless Daughters is to be especially commended or its outstanding presentation of insightful and helpful material for coping with the death of a mother. 
 I enjoyed this album because it was mellow enough for me to listen to without being barraged by a bunch of cursing. It is a little bit "bubble-gummy", but I like bubble gum! I could even play it at work.  Even though I am more of a fan of traditional dancehall, "Hotshot" made my workplace " reggae-friendly" 
 Bao Ninh's novel is, I assume, like most first novels, largely autobiographical.  Like his protagonist, Kien, Ninh was one of ten survivors from his unit of 500 which started the war with him in 1965.  This is a tough read, a story with tragedy scoring almost every page.  There are no MASH unit antics or Hogan's heros characters here, only unrelenting bleakness, pain, terror, and loss.  The Vietnamese began resisting the French occupation in small groups of guerillas before WWII.  Stanly Karnow, in his book, Vietnam: A History explains quite explicitly why the Vietnamese did not consider the French occupation as one of the culteral highlights of their history.  After the French were expelled by a ragtag army which had opposed the Japanese while the French cooperated with them back in the last good war, the United States subjected the people of Vietnam to our gentle mercies up until 1965 when it became obvious to all that many of the Vietnamese would never accept our installed leadership and artificial partioning of that country when it became obvious back in the late 50s that Uncle Ho was destined to win any free election of the people.  However, by the time Lyndon Johnson sent in the first large scale troop deployment, much of the South had already been destroyed, at least in the countryside, by the creation of "strategic hamlets," in actuallity rural prisons, supposedly meant to protect the citizenry.  This was a strategy which had failed in Chaing Ki Shek's China years before and was equally successful in Vietnam.  Ninh/Kien's story really startes with him and a girl friend, Phoung, almost but not quite consumating their young love while skipping school, then skips back and forth beeen pre-war, post-war and wartime scenes. It is told mostly in flashbacks and stream of consciousness vignettes and is sometimes difficult for the unsophisticated reader to follow.  Kien goes from a poor but happy and extremely idealistic young student to warrior and finally back to student and author after ten years of unremiting war, violence and loss.  When he comes home to find Phoung still in the same apartment building in which he lived in the old days and still has an apartment, it seems as though he might have realized his dream of happiness.  However, near the end of the book we discover the terrible events and betrayals at the beginning of their seperation which make a successful reunion impossible for both.  For any who still think war is glory and honor and a test of courage and manhood, Ninh illustrates quite vividly that it is continuing horror, terror, chaos and blind chance which determines who lives and who dies. And sometimes the living envy the dead before the Sorrow of War has played its last chorus.  The government of Vietnam opposed the publication of this book, and it is easy to understand why, given the honesty with which life in postwar Hanoi is portrayed.  One of the most amazing things about the book is the almost total abscense of bitterness toward the Americans who invaded his country and started the war that destroyed so much of his life.  There is also an interesting parallel between the American Vietnam veteran's homecoming after their time "in country" was over, and the Vietnamese soldiers who fought and suffered so long and so greatly for the eventual victory.  The sorrow of war is almost overshadowed by the sorrow of his homecoming and all that he had lost as a result of that war.   As we continues this new war, Ninh's is a cautionary tale which should be read by anyone rejoicing at the idea the American military might can overcome any foe.  Vietnam proved a long time ago that it takes more than superior military equipment and a vastly stronger economy to win a war. Ninh tells us why.   wf 
 It must be a good season for new perspectives on native experience.  Between Mr. Marshall's book and Kent Nerburn's book, Chief Joseph and the Flight of the Nez Perce, we are finally beginning to see the native experience in light of their own cultural understanding.  Mr. Marshall has an authority few writers possess.  Crazy Horse is one of the most difficult native leaders to grasp.  Mr. Marshall does an admirable job of bringing his story alive.  Highly recommended 
 Great book; it get's you thinking. My kids arre almost out of the nest and they are all I could ask for. Yes, I worked. But not until they were in school, almost always part time and I did not use 'working' as an excuse to not volunteer at school, sports, and generally be in my kids lives. The point is really about your priorities. Do you instinctively put your kids needs first? It's been interesting to see how things have worked out with families in our area. We have a large group of kids who have been together since kindergarten; now they are seniors. You can instantly tell which parents were connected, involved and had their priorities straight. Not all of them stayed home the whole time.  On and off I used to listen to Dr. Laura, frequently agreeing, but many times not. What I love is that she has an unpopular point of view and she's not going to let social, financial, or industry pressure dilute her message. Yes, she's frequently abrasive; so were many people who have made an impact in the course of events in this world. If you are a parent with young children READ THE BOOK at least it will give you important ideas to agree or disagree with. 
 Are you reading Tobias Wolff yet?  Are you?  If not, you should be.    With Back in the World, Wolff gives us yet another outstanding compilation of short stories.  As always, Wolff's stories are brief and absolutely potent, offering all the complexities and awkwardness of the human condition in a direct and entrancing manner.  His stories are so rooted in everyday life that when something unusual takes place it reminds us just how odd life can sometimes be in the middle of all the humdrum.  Never does he take us beyond the possibilities of reality, however, and I believe that's why I so remarkably relate to his work.  I unconditionally recommend all of Wolff's writings, and Back in the World is certainly not to be excluded.    (Visit author Scott William Foley at www.swilliamfoley.com 
 It is very difficult to find a book on the subject of Cryptology which does not go into great detail about the math, forgoing the necessary context to understanding.  I have read many book on the subject and wish I had read this one first, if not early on.  Kippenhahn has accomplished that which others haven't.  Providing the historical context based upon a particular crypto advancement.  Instead of the entire history of the subject, he provides sections of chapters which focus on some aspect of the history, not for history sake, but to have the reader understand a particular advancement or application of cryptology.  By understanding, I'm talking about providing a lot of visual material.  Monalphabetic maps, key tables, turning grilles, Vigenere tables, and others.  All of these are very clearly displayed and understandable by any student or adult.  He also provides simple "schematics" for cipher machines (switches and lights), which again give you the context to then understand (conceptually) what is behind Enigma machines and the like.  He introduces symmetric and asymmetric systems, such as DES and RSA respectively.  First conceptually, then with a bit more detail behind it.  His discussion on RSA includes an appendix which explains the math to mere mortals.  Actual example keys are derived using two examples.  If you're interested in why the math "works" you'll need to refer to another source.  This shows the process for creating N, E, and D, the keys which support an RSA keyset.  An introduction to the application of some of the techniques in the book include some theoretical banking examples, and smart cards.  In summary, unless you already have an advanced understanding of the subject matter and math, I strongly encourage you to obtain and enjoy this quite readable 260 page book.  You'll finish it fairly quickly and have enough of an understanding of the field to delve deeper if you wish - but won't have to 
 It's hard not eating meat, and I succumb often, usually with delicious fish dishes, always on Thanksgiving and Christmas, because I just love sitting down to a big turkey dinner with family and friends. But most of the time I try to stay away from meat, even though I quiver when I drive by a Mickey D's and smell that aroma. Yes, it's alright, I believe, to admit that you like going to McDonald's on occasion.  Anyway, I'm rambling when I should be focusing my attention on this wonderful cookbook, this gem from the Moosewood Restaurant people that is chucky-jam-crammed full of tasty vegetarian fare. If you have a spouse who screams for his steak, meatballs or pork chops, try serving him up Japanise Braised Eggpland or the Moroccan Stew Moosewood Restaurant style, you'll have his mouth watering, have him begging for more. In fact, I'd say if you want to be a vegitarian, you can throw all your other cookbooks away and just use this one. That's my opinion anyway and I'm sticking to it.

 I am very pleased with the book! The pictures & descriptions are excellant,better than anything else I've seen so far through the years. It's very easy to find the species, good size for travel, and just handy to have by the patio! This guide is exactly what I was looking for! Thanks!---Jeannice----- 
 I think Grease is an absolute classic. There is really nothing like it. John Travolta was in his prime. The music is fantastic and it is so fun to watch.  Other classics not to forget about are: Mary Poppins My Fair Lady The Wizard of Oz Chitty Chitty Bang Band The first Charlie and the Chocolate Factory The Sound of Music Oliver West Side Story Fiddler on the Roof Singing in the Rain The Wiz Little Mermaid Aladdin Beauty and the Beast Grease The King and I Oklahoma The Music Man South Pacific  My Voice Students are always asking me for recommendations so I though I'd post it for all! We can't forget about these great musicals 
 I loved being able to laugh as Roarke and Dallas handle being the coach team for Mavis..there were some hilarious parts in this book on that situation....and I loved the book as a whole..I can always count on getting a great read when I buy a JD Robb book...kudos to the author 
 A good introduction book to the Intelligence subject. In this book the author browse all the elements and methods of intelligence in a mix with history examples, that helps you understand all the facts of this world and the importance for a goverment to use it in order to be updated and alert of international events. 
 This book is a classic, the non-fiction work of a German speaking Frenchman dragged into the German army and fighting through the Russian campaign. It is one of those 'you do not want to put down' stories.   A true survivor story 
 I started this book several months ago and did not get past the prologue. I had just finished a very good but intense book at that time and in retrospect was not ready for another one. I am glad I gave this book a second chance. Krueger weaves a great tale of suspense and intrigue. I had some ideas as to what was going on and who the bad guys were, but did get some fun surprises. If you have not read this book, then stop here. I was very sad that he killed off Molly, or appeared too anyway. I have not read his next book yet but read the blurb in the back of Iron Lake and am hoping that Molly survived. I am sure she did not but I thought that would have been a good avenue to pursue. His interactions between his characters are very real and the reactions he has them portray are realistic and emotional. I would highly recommend this book to anyone 
 I have been using these since my son was born and now he is 2.  I will keep using them until he outgrows all of the sizes!  They are fantastic! 
 This is the second of Scott Soames's two-volume history of analytic philosophy. Together these volumes illuminate the most important developments in metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of language and ethics from 1900 until 1975. In the first volume the contributions of Moore, Russell, Wittgenstein and Quine, among others, are covered. The second volume covers more of the contributions of Wittgenstein and Quine, and the contributions of Ryle, Grice, Davidson and Kripke, among others. Soames carefully explains the theories of these philosophers, and clearly sets forth their arguments. He critically evaluates their arguments, showing their successes and their failures. The volumes are also very well organised, with each chapter including a nice outline and each part concluding with suggestions for further reading. What emerges is a work that is comprehensive and detailed, insightful and original. As Soames explains, some important philosophers are not covered and some material from the philosophers that are covered is not discussed. These volumes are also controversial for not engaging with the secondary literature and for some of the interpretations offered; some of the debate can be followed online. The intended audience of these volumes is primarily upper-level undergraduates, graduates and professional philosophers. While Soames would also like others to gain from these volumes, I think that those who have not had some exposure to analytic philosophy will find them difficult. As a graduate student in philosophy, these volumes have been of great help to me, filling in some major gaps in my education. I think that Soames's volumes will illuminate the classics of analytic philosophy for generations of philosophers and philosophy students, and may become classics themselves. I highly recommend both volumes 
 I absolutely loved this book, too!  It is an amazing follow up to Undead and Unemployed.  I really laughed a lot!  I read this book in about 6 hours.  I can't wait for the next book!  I would totally recommend this book to anyone 
 I bought this product to use during my camping trips. I had a minor issue with my order but was corrected immediately, great customer service. This is a really neat hammock, it packs really small but is very resistant. My friends loved it when they saw it and it was really easy to set up. You will enjoy it whether you go camping or on your backyard 
 Thanks to LD Beghtol, we now have a book to accompany the already expansive boxed set of 69 Love Songs. Split into thirds, the first part being a hilarious lexicon featuring words found throughout 69 Love Songs (with extensive footnotes to boot!). The second part goes song by song with notes (tempo, key, style, things to listen for!),  quotes and memories from preformances and recording from the members and noteable friends. The third part includes preformance notes and a sassy interview between the author, Stephin Merritt and a friend. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has a sense of humor, a pulse and good taste in music. A must have for fans of the Magnetic Fields, Stephin Merritt, LD Beghtol and fun 
 Great hooks on this album.    It was probably less successful commercially because it's sonically identical to Back in Black and For this About to Rock; the band started to sound repetitive.  But as it stands alone, Flick of the Switch has some super riffs,chord sequences and that cool guitar syncopation that defines AC/DC.  Plus the Young bro's guitar tone is as great as ever and Johnson's voice is at full wack.  My second favourite with Johnson after Back in Black, with only Powerage being better from the Scott era.  Overall, I reckon "Flick" is at least as good or better than the much more popular "Highway to Hell", "Let there be Rock" and "Dirty Deeds" 
 The CD Sounds of a band change, especially when a band produces Mainstream records. ONE BY ONE is Foo Fighters' second Mainstream album, and work they should be proud of. Over the years, the group has lost their sense of quality in dynamics. However, this musical trait is still there, just not to the band's fullest sound as they originally started with. The rock band's sound also became harder and more distorted than previous work. Except their pieces need this grunge and coinside well with it. This record landed the band plenty of music videos and a soundtrack spot to the film Identity. The bass and drums are the musical foundation, and the guitars provide awesome rock counterpoint. Grohl's vocals give Foo Fighters their rough sound but with very musical qualities. ONE BY ONE is a great progression of Foo Fighters' performance and a must have.   Stand out tracks include: "All My Life" "Low" "Times Like These" "Lonely As You" "Overdrive" "Come Back"  DVD Features This disc contains music videos for "All My Life" and "Walking A Line". There's an audio track of "The One" with interesting sketch art of the band. Short video clips of behind the scene footage are present as well. A picture gallery of the rock group is also included 
 Whatever you may think about this novel, King's portrait of his antagonist, John Rainbird, is among the best to be found in contemporary popular literature. With a few short paragraphs, he introduces a character worthy in every way of the powers-possessed protagonist--one whose only purpose in the story is to kill her. By the time we've read his introduction, we know that we'll be holding on for a wild ride to the very end 
 After having the eggplant torta from this book at a friends house, I immediately went home and ordered the book.  I'm working my way through it slowly since I'm not a consistent maker of dinner, but I have used several recipes repeatedly for home and entertaining.  The praise has been universal.  Having experimented with lots of recipes, it is such a thrill to make something that people rave about and tastes as good as it "sounded."  The pasta with fennel (a fresh sauce perfect for summer) is gourmet in quality and my husband raves!  The ricotta torta is another delicious treat.  You have to have time to slice and dice, of course, but when the results are this good, I don't mind.  I highly recommend this book for amateur cooks like myself who will suprise themselves and increase their confidence through the splendid results! 
 Remarkably for a book written in 1938, this amazing volume is as compelling today as it was then.  Extremely well-written, passionate, and erudite, C.L.R. James's classic is still the starting point I would recommend for anyone interested in Haitian history. I would also recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the French Revolution.  The narrative reads like a great novel, despite being a well-researched history book. Years before mainstream U.S. or European historians saw Carribbean history as relevant, the West Indian James showed its import for both Western and Global History.   First, James shows the utterly heartbreaking treatment the slaves of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) were subject to. Then he demonstrates the contradictions in Western Revolutionary thought which used emancipatory language but refused to address the issue of colonial slavery. Then the leaders of the slave revolution emerge in his story as true sans-culottes, Jacobins and patriots in their own right; men and women who refuse to let Napoleon reenslave them and forge a nation.  Their act of "rebellion", the creation of the first black republic in the Americas and the only successful slave revolt in history, would strike fear into the hearts of slaveowners everywhere.  They would pay for taking the heady egalitarian language of the 18th century seriously-in both the 19th century and the 20th and beyond, they would be subject to pay enormous indemnities to Europe for having "taken" the plantations of the whites, be subject to embargos, be forcibly invaded on several occasions, have dictators foisted upon them, and much more.  But none of that could take away the fact that their courage, bravery, and love of freedom had earned them their freedom from slavery and that their history deserved to be recorded, admired, and preserved.  No one has ever done that more skillfully than C.L.R. James.  A truly triumphant story 
 Imagine a Britain where Winston Churchill never lived past his teen years; a Britain that has been at war with Russia for over a hundred years; a Britain where time travel is practiced; a Britain where literature is as popular as sports or reality shows are in our reality. This is the Britain where Tuesday Next lives. She is an agent for a government agency that solves crimes involving literature. When the evil Acheron Hades begins using a device that can send humans into the world of a poem or a novel, he uses it for his own gain.  For book geeks, The Eyre Affair is a hilarious treat. Jasper Fford's wit is on par with Douglas Adams and his imagination is reminiscent of J. K. Rowling. Many lit references abound in the story, and I'm sure I missed many of them, but the ones I caught were great. The first two/thirds of the story really serve to set up the last third, where Agent Next must rescue Jane Eyre, who has been pulled into our reality by Hades. If the reader has read Jane Eyre, there is probably no need to re-read it for The Eyre Affair, but the reader who has never read Charlotte Bronte's classic, I recommend reading it first the get the full effect.  The Eyre Affair is my favorite new book. It's just so much jolly-good fun 
 Don't mislead by the title, because other than cheerleading, this movie has a little (actually, nothing) to do with "Bring It On." However, I only say that so that you won't be disappointed if you were expected it to tie in. That said, the movie is fun, and has some great lines and superb actors 
 As the title indicates, Vidler's recent publication guides us to see the underlying forces that caused warping and irregularity in contemporary architecture. Beginning with defining various conceptions of 'phobias', Vidler navigates us into the realm of abnormal psychology. Critical theorists, such as Georg Simmel and Walter Benjamin, are also introduced to interweave the ideas of 'estrangement' and 'flaneur(metropolitan nomad wandering unconsciously)'. In so doing, he allows readers to understand underlying mindset behind the buildings of Libeskind, Himmelblau, and Eric Owen Moss 
 I was recently introduced to this album and I thought it was fantastic!  "Closer to Fine" and "Watershed" are my ultimate favorites, but "Least Complicated" and "Galileo" are up there on my list as well!  If you like a firm voice and great lyrics with wonderful stories behind them, this is the music for you!  Check it out today 
 Spiceworld is such a good spice album my favorite song is Lady is a vamp and spice up your life and stop + more ! forever album was the wrost when it was without gerri eww! Spice and spiceworld are the best ones 
 The murders begin in 1907 on the Arapaho Wind River Reservation when photographer Edward S. Curtis convinces the Indians to reconstruct a village and have warriors attack the tribe.  During the shooting with blank bullets, Bashful Woman, the daughter of Chief Sharp Nose, is killed by a real bullet.  Her Anglo husband Carston Evans testifies that he saw the Indian Thunder kill his wife and his two Native American friends were adding him in the attack.  His testimony was enough to convict and hang the trio.  In the present, Denise, a descendant of Sharp Nose is murdered and her husband J.T. Painted Horse is the FBI's number one suspect until he is tortured and killed by men who were looking for something on the same night Denise died.  Christine, the curator of the Arapaho Museum, disappears and her home is ransacked.  Lawyer Vicky Holden and Father John O'Malley investigate the homicide from different directions, but reach the same conclusion.  Vicky tries to convince the authorities who she believes is behind the murders while Father John tries to protect the last remaining witness.  Through the use of flashbacks readers learn what really happened on that day in 1907 and how justice was thwarted.  The Arapaho still seek justice for Bashful Women in the present but they are up against high powered politicians who will use any means at their disposal to erase the proof of what happened almost a century ago and they will kill anyone who has knowledge of that event.  WIFE OF MOON is an exciting who-done-it that will appeal to fans of Tony Hillerman and David and Aimee Thurlo thrillers.  Margaret Coel provides a deep look at the Arapaho culture wrapped around a fabulous mystery.  Harriet Klausner 
 the information in this book is nice to have in plain talk for those of us who did not grow up with a pressure cooker in the hous 
 This was the first book Ive read of Carolyn Myss and I loved it!  She really explains things, and I got the audio CDs of her workshop with this which really helped explain things as well, though the book goes into far more depth.  Her ideas really worked for me, and they make a lot of sense.  
 This was what we listened to when it was friday after work and a group of buddys and myself would kick back and "relax" from the week behind us. It was sooo tooo bad that JoJo Gunne didnt quite click with the rock radio stations at the time. Some airplay though not much.. There was another party band simular in sound that was coming up at the same time called Bachman Turner Overdrive. They sort of stole the show. But damn!!!.. Jay Ferguson and the boys could hammer a tune out and make it feel good. Disco was coming up, the punk rock music was wearing us out and we just wanted to sit back and get down with some straight forward rock. Not overproduced and re-re-remixed and mastered. You can actually count all the instruments on one hand. JoJo Gunne was the answer in 1973. It still is now. A new re-union album with the original band is in the works for release this year. Can't wait. 
 This CD reminds me of the good times "back in the day". I remember when "Grazing In the Grass" was first played on the radio. It was The Jam. Then, I turned it over to the flip side, and there  was "Going In Circles." To this day, "Going in Circles"  is one of my favorite songs. "Check it Out", "Great  Day" and "I Really Hope You Do" -- all classics. The only  song missing is "Willa Faye.&quot 
 Jamie Oliver's approach to cooking has reminded me that mealtimes shouldn't be stressful, but rather they should be opportunities to get together with family and friends and enjoy each other with some great food!  Usually when I cook I stick to the bulleted list of ingredients and exact steps to follow, which Jamie's cookbook lacks.  My most useful tools in the kitchen are normally my measuring utensils.  But cooking without exact steps to follow makes the whole process more enjoyable and really gives me a sense of ownership with the food I prepare.  I'm learning that cooking isn't about trying to do everything the same way each time; its about experimenting with the food and trying new kinds of food altogether...its all about being adventurous in the kitchen!  The best chefs in the world didn't become the best by sticking word-for-word to bulleted instructions.  Thanks to Jamie for giving me some confidence to do my own thing in the kitchen!  Looking at what Jamie has done with his restaurant Fifteen (see the DVD Jamie's Kitchen), he really has shown that it's not a formal culinary education that makes a chef great, but passion for the food.  So go get a Jamie Oliver cookbook or catch one of his shows on the telly, go out and meet your local butchers and farmers, buy some fresh veggies and meat and herbs and have some fun with them!  Enjoy spending mealtimes having some fresh food in the enjoyable company of family and friends 
 I GOT THIS FOR MY WIFE AND SHE WAS VERY HAPPY WITH IT.  SHE HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS CD FOR YEARS.  THANKS ALOT.  WAS QUICK SHIPPING TOO 
 I just bought this one recently and tried it today for the first time. I did the first two segments for a total workout of 20 minutes.  It's quick, effective and gets your heart rate right up there. There is very little warm-up and no cool-down to speak of (of course, with only 10 minutes per workout, you can't be cooling off half of that time), so just reminding everybody here (especially if you are new to working out) to make sure to take the time to bring down your heart rate after you're done, by walking in place and moving around. Do not stop moving until your heart rate has come back down to normal.  It's great and effective. I really enjoyed this DVD and I will be using it regularly 
 I know that I've read this book at least twice, once in grade school and once again recently because I remembered how much I loved it the first time. There's something gripping in the way Buck developed her characters in this work, which allows us to grow and understand and experience life with them over the course of their lifetimes.  We see the central character and his dutiful, faithful wife age from a young married farming couple to rather wealthy land-owning seniors, and in between we experience all of their struggles, sorrows, joys, accomplishments, bad and good decisions, falures, and regrets right along with them. The central character is frought with natural desires and temptations as he builds his wealth and status in the community, and he appears to us all-too-human as he revels in many of the distractions that we know will bring him unhappiness and will leave his wife in sorrow.  Not only is the reader allowed to vividly experience life through Buck's characters, but she skillfully transports us to a time and place in early-twentieth-century China where we can taste the culture, the thinking of the times, the prejudices, the beliefs, the customs, and the struggles of both the rich and the common man.  This is really a beautiful and elegant work. Highly recommended 
 THIS WAS AT 1OTH BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR MY SON. WE ARE CALIFORNIA TRANSPLANTS LIVING IN TEXAS, AND NO ONE HERE, AT THE TIME, HAD ANY IDEA THAT KOBE HAD EVEN CHANGED HIS NUMBER FROM 8 TO 24. IT WAS A NIGHTMARE (AND A LOT OF DRIVING AROUND) TRYING TO FIND KB'S 24.   I FOUND IT ON YOUR SITE AND THE PRODUCT WAS JUST WHAT I EXPECTED, NO SURPRISES.  MY SON LOVES IT!    
 When Professor von Hardwigg discovers an ancient parchment suggesting a journey to the center of the Earth is possible, he wastes no time dragooning his dubious nephew and ward, Harry, into an expedition, first to Iceland, and then into the Earth.  Harry, a young man, sees no good that can come of this expedition, but dutifully agrees.    So begins one of the most beloved classics of science fiction ever published, Jules Verne's "A Journey to the Center of the Earth".  I'm hardly a Verne expert, but I've read many of his other classics.  "Journey" is unique among his work.  It's one of the few books to feature a first person narrator in the form of Harry.  Moreover, unlike his other books, "Journey" is less grounded in science and more interested in the fantastic.  Verne, through his various characters, slyly implores his readers' indulgence, reminding us that there is plenty about the center of the world we don't know.    Verne was an author who dealt in archetypal characters.  From "20,000 Leagues Under the Seas" on, Verne generally concentrated on three types of characters as his protagonists:  the brilliant and calm professor; the professor's loyal apprentice, and; the non-scientific, cantankerous, pragmatic, but steadfast man of action.  Here, Verne mixes and matches these traits, making for a more interesting cast.  Hardwigg is a brilliant scientist, but he's also a ball of barely restrained emotion and energy, demanding his fellow travelers press on, perhaps beyond all reason.  The man of action, the Icelandic Hans, is loyal, but by no means cantankerous.  He simply does what must be done, and is unsteady in his loyalty.  Finally, Harry, rather than the unquestioning apprentice, is quite skeptical of this expedition.  Hardly steadfast, he proves to be quite cowardly and panics at inopportune times.  Thus, with these interesting characters in the mix, the plot of the novel proves frequently unpredictable.  While the premise is fantastic, the action of the novel is far less concerned with monsters that might be found at the center of the earth than the more realistic, albeit more mundane, threats of natural disaster.  Rather than being chased by dinosaurs or hidden cave-men, our heroes must deal with being lost, the threat of starvation, underground lakes, exhaustion, and exposure.  Naturally, just as all hope seems lost for our heroes, fortune takes a hand.  Obviously, if Harry is narrating, they probably get out okay.  Still, there are some moments of true white knuckle tension, as Harry is lost in the caverns, or the trio finds itself on a raft with only a piece of jerky as their food-supply.    Wisely, Verne lets the scientific explanations he used as the basis of his other novels go here.  He's less interested in giving his reader an education in the latest discovery, and concentrates instead on a great rip-roaring read.  Admittedly, the conventions of Victorian-era fiction don't always allow the book to rip or roar.  The first third of the book is actually dedicated to getting Harry and the Professor to Iceland and recruiting an expedition.  It's more of a travelogue than an adventure tale, which makes the book more realistic, although not consistently exciting.  Once our heroes are underground, however, the book takes off.    In the grand scheme of things, "A Journey to the Center of the Earth" is probably not my favorite Verne book.  It lacks a remarkable character, like Captain Nemo.  It also lacks some of the sharper satire Verne brought to his other books, like "From the Earth to the Moon."  It doesn't quite have the pacing of "Around the World in 80 Days."  Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable and charming read, and certainly has earned its place among the classics.    
 Warning: Don't get carried away by the title of this book, it is purely metaphoric.  When you are handed a 600 page autobiography of an entrepreneur, at first, you may wonder whether such a piece is worth even leafing through. Who has the time to read stuff like this?   LOSING MY VIRGINITY is an extraordinary book written by an extraordinary man, Richard Branson. One may actually have some reservations about reading about a not exactly well-known business magnate (I am talking about India, of course). But rest assured, once you read through the author's bio and the very impressive blurbs, you will realize that it is far from a conventional (boring, if you like) memoir.  Branson is one of a rare breed, a paragon of British entrepreneurship, and a genius who has revolutionized British culture and lifestyles. Throughout this book, one can find a real humility in Branson's narrative of himself and his experiences. Like most contemporary memoirists, Branson uses the confessional mode of writing, which has allowed him to do things that a conventional novel will not. Branson's style of writing is so good-humored and his perceptions so remarkable that this book is worth a read even if you don't have the slightest interest in business. As one critic wrote about this book - Heavy but impossible to put down.  The book is written in a chronological fashion, and the chapters have rather stimulating titles. The chapters are actual chunks taken from Branson's life, and provide a rich visual and verbal experience to the reader. Some 130 photographs (both color and black & white) are there, and they complement the narrative beautifully.  It is fast paced, and has an honesty which is a little trivial at times. Branson reveals much about himself. Towards the middle, he gives a passionate account of his devotion towards music. His other great passion, adventure (some of which have been near-death experiences), is also dealt with in detail. Branson's love for ballooning, which he calls the most exhilarating of all sports, got him an entry into the Guinness Book of World Records, a real tribute to his daredevilry.  Branson's tale is novel, and is filled with instances of courage, the courage to break away from tradition. At age 16, Branson started a student's magazine and then ventured into music, which was a big hit. Richard Branson recounts this as a sad moment in his life when he had to sell Virgin Records to Thorn EMI in order to keep a floundering Virgin Atlantic Airways afloat. Today, apart from Virgin Atlantic, the Virgin Group owns Virgin Cola, Virgin Vie, Virgin Brides, Virgin Mega-stores and many more such ventures, which cater to everything any person would want in his daily life.  Now, after conquering the world, he wants to fly you to space.   I would hate to spoil the read for you, so suffice it to say that LOSING MY VIRGINITY is a real, inspirational story that can only be told by the man himself.  Such is the popularity of this book that it has become a byword for 'What they don't teach you at Business Schools'. From another perspective, it is a comic recollection of life's ups and downs juxtaposed with anecdotes about rock stars, politicians, friends and foes.  One finds no moral story in the end, no grandfatherly advice to the young blood. Instead, one is left with a deep feeling of admiration and a constant mulling over his adventures. If you ever want to know how much a single guy can achieve with "talent, initiative and good ideas", read this book. It comes as close to providing the real experience as any book can, and for this reason alone it should be coveted 
 While yearning for more Tony Hillerman after reading his last book, I accidently came across The Shaman's Bones.  I absolutely loved it.  I could easily imagine neighbors from my childhood that could easily play some of the characters in this book.  The only problem I had with this novel were the few dream sequences, which I thought tended to be unnecessarily long and disruptive to the flow of the the plot.  Regardless, I intend to read the other 'Shaman' novels 
 What can I say.  This is one of the great science fiction books of all time.  Not only that, it's scarier than anything Stephen King ever wrote and as exciting an adventure story as anything by Patrick O'Brien.  You might remember the movie from your childhood days, but the book is far more inventive and thought provoking 
 The biggest mistake made with people who review albums from Rakim is that they compare them to all his other albums.  The idea that any true hip-hopper should "have to" like one Rakim album more than another is foolish.  Did Follow the Leader have as big an impact on hip-hop as Paid in Full?  Of course not - no one had heard anyone flow like Rakim before or use funk samples as effectively before Paid in Full.  Is Paid in Full better than Follow the Leader?  Who cares?  They are different!!  A better idea would be to compare any Rakim album, take Follow the Leader as example, against any other hip hop album out there.  Even albums considered classics in their own right like, say, Straight Outta Compton.  As groundbreaking and different as Straight Outta Compton was, it is clearly inferior in terms of lyrical content.  Rakim's content takes you deep into the world of street crime, 5% Nation dogma and Divine Mathematics, science, art, history, philosophy, and sociology in a single verse, (see "Follow the Leader").  His meanings are double and triple layered and can literally years of repeated listenings to discipher an entire album.  He could spit the most violent and menacing verse in the history of hip-hop and never use a single curse, (see "Lyrics of Fury").  M.C. Ren even admitted that he listened to Rakim when writting his own lyrics for inspiration.  As far as production is concerned, the use of funk samples was pioneered by Eric B and Rakim.  Average White Band, Parliament, Funkadelic in addition to the foundational James Brown were used here.  But also the influence of jazz musicians like Bob James was clearly visible.  This sound was more mature than anything prior to Eric and Ra and does not sound dated by any stretch even today.  Finally you have consistancy.  This statement may be blasphemy in the eyes of many but the second half of Straight Outta Compton slipped off.  It was more radio friendly and formulaic than the first half.  Follow the Leader may have had its hits up front but the content is thick throughout.  Am I jockin Rakim?  Yup.  You should be too.  Grab ahold and start swingin.   
 My God, I love this CD.  I love AFI's punk stuff in general, but this has to be my favorite album by them.  It's loud, fast, agressive, and pissed off!  Everything a punk rock album should be.  The lyrics are also very well written, and they're almost poetic.  Not quite.  AFI really started getting poetic with 'Black Sails in the Sunset', which is this band's second best.  Anyway, the best songs on here would definately be 'Today's Lesson', 'The Devil Loves You', 'pH Low', 'Lower Your Head And Take It In The Body', 'Three Second Notice', and 'Third Season'.  Definately reccomended to ALL punk rock fans.  New scene-emo AFI fans, you probably won't like this at all.  Haha 
 These days, you don't see many people with the interest or guts to do what Jon Stewart and his co-workers do. In America, the book, they aim to teach misinformed Americans what their government is really about. Many people don't actually know what the heck goes on in the government, nor do they care.  The book, filled with hilarious tidbits, great explanations, and well thought out presentations, aims to make the government interesting. It's got history, how the government works, modern day conflicts, theories, ideas, people, and what our Founders did for this great nation. It should be a book in every classroom and required reading for every citizen.  Jon Stewart and the authors of this book went out on a limb for this. They went against the grain and did what they knew was right. It's our duty as Americans to criticize the government. When there's something wrong and you have the ability to fix it, you have the responsibility to fix it.  Hopefully this has changed America 
 Dan Poyner's essential classic "The Self-Publishing Manual" was vital to me in publishing my own speech recognition books. This book, "Successful Nonfiction," elegantly summarizes key factors necessary for any non-fiction writer to succeed. The best parts of the book are the passages profiling authors who have used the tips and techniques provided. The book is also elegantly designed and would make a good gift for writers, or want-to-be writers 
 This is Loreena McKennitt unplugged, on what is--to my knowledge--her first album.  These are gentle, wistful songs, primarily minor in flavor and performed in a fairly traditional manner.  "Elemental" is a short CD, only about 33 minutes long.  Eight of its nine songs are vocals--mostly Loreena singing in her sweet, lilting voice to her own harp accompaniments, although gentle additions of acoustic bass, accordion, synthesizer, cello, guitar and occasional multitracks of her own voice sometimes enhance the pieces as well.  "Carrighfergus" is a duet with singer and guitarist Cedric Smith, and Lullaby is a poem by William Blake, read by Douglas Campbell and accompanied by McKennitt's vocalise and instrumentation.  Other guest artists include cellist Pat Mullin and acoustic bass player George Greer.  There's none of the bodaceous intensity and world music instrumentations of McKennitt's later work (like "The Mask and the Mirror" and "The Book of Secrets") but a delicate, dreamy magic drifts through this album that is delightfully restful and soothing.  And her deft, delicate, evocative arrangements of harp and harmony, even at this early stage of her career, stand out as something special.  Follow Loreena McKennitt's development as a musician and composer by collecting all her wonderful works!  Her next release after "Elemental" was "To Drive the Cold Winter Away," followed by "Parallel Dreams."  Try also the work of Kim Robertson and Aine Minogue, two more elegantly innovative harpists and composers. 
 Lucy Kelson is a smart and funny attorney whose sole purpose in life from childhood was to fight for the last shreds of justice in the concrete jungle that is New York City. When she hears that Wade Corporation is planning to knock down her beloved Coney Island community center, she spares no time in stopping its CEO George Wade (played by Hugh Grant) in the street en rooute to his limo to convince him otherwise. Coincidentally, George has recently been berated by his older brother Howard (the real boss of the company) about his choice of chief counsel and their actual abilities. After quizzing her on her education and resume, George was impressed by her quick wit and perserverance, George hires Lucy on the spot and there begins a torturous yet blossoming relationship. Named after the customary two weeks notice that employees give employers before resigning from their jobs, this movie is superbly funny not only because of the jokes but because of the ingenious acting of Bullock and Grant. They convey wonderfully the light-hearted atmosphere of their relationship, and are versatile enough to switch from being quirkily humorous to sweetly romantic. The antics are never-ending, and added with Grant's bumbling British accent, makes this movie a gem of a romantic comedy 
 At 29, I suddenly started feeling sick all the time.  Doctors tested me for everything under the sun but found nothing.  They "diagnosed" me with "Fatigue of unknown origin".  By pure chance, I happened upon The Yeast Connection and it explained everything.  I followed his diet recomendations and felt better almost immediately.  I can't imagine what my life would be like if I hadn't figured out how my diet and lifestyle were making me sick.  I have cut out processed food and sugar, and now eat a diet mainly of organic whole vegetables and whole grains and I feel terrific.    If you have intense sugar cravings, get sick a lot, are depressed, or are tired all the time, read this book.  If you have been on birth control, taking a lot of antibiotics, or eating a diet high in sugar and processed foods, read this book.  If doctors can't figure out what is wrong with you, read this book.  The book isn't that well organized and a lot of information is repetitious.  But it's well worth muddling through.  The information is priceless 
 "The Queen's Suite" is the most memorable work in this collection, and shows a respect for the Queen which she has rarely been given by other musicians.  One of the more crass examples being the recent Golden Jubilee.  Ellington offers up a lovely collection of vignettes that are most gracious and very entertaining.  The Suite was written after his royal engagement in 1958, in which the Queen singled him out at the reception, apparently leaving him speechless in reply.  Instead, he and Billy Strayhorn played for her a series of short pieces, which they eventually formed into "The Queen's Suite."  The other two suites in this collection are also enjoyable, but don't have the same resonance 
 Slaughterhouse five is by far a great pies of work by Kurt Vonnegut. The story's plot focuses on the life of the protagonist named Billy. The story can be a little complicated being that it is a story in a story of the author's who is a character in the book. The book more or less has no structure in it. The plot structure cannot be described as linear, but rather it is more spatial in its organization. the style of the story to me was almost bleak and depressing, with a subtle mention of science-fiction in it 
 Paid less for two items than I would at the local pet store for one. Quick free shipping and no tax. What more can I say 
 On the surface, this is a simple and sweet tale of three frogs who learn how to share.  But as a student of theology and of literature, I must share my insights into this amazing children's book.  On a deeper level, this is a Christological parable and a history of salvation through Jesus Christ.  Although I admittedly know nothing about Leo Lionni's personal beliefs,I am sure that this is the intended meaning in this fable.  The richness and beauty of its symbolism could hardly be an accident!  Three frogs (symbolizing humanity--three being a biblical number of completeness) live in constant disharmony with each other.  "The air is mine", "the earth is mine", "the water is mine": their quarrels are so absurd, pointing to pride as the source of their sin, as clearly the air, earth, and water can belong to no one but God.  And then One "appears"--the Toad-- who teaches, just as Christ taught during His ministry.  He tells them that they must learn to share and live in peace.  But they do not listen to Him or follow his teachings.  So, it happens that one day they seem to pay for their sin, clinging to separate rocks as flood waters swell and consume their island.  It is only when they join together on the single remaining rock that they feel better, "sharing the same fears and hopes".  Here, on the rock of the Church, they are saved. When the flood waters subside and recede, they realize:  "The large rock that had saved them was no rock at all.  'You saved us!' shouted the frogs when they recognized the toad." They had been sitting on the back of the Toad--who miraculously remains strong through the greatest storm (pointing to His divinity). But it is only when the toad RISES from the waters (i.e. from the dead), that the church/disciples(the frogs) understand the source of salvation---through the sacrifice and resurrection of Jesus Christ (the toad). And it is through passing through the flood waters (the waters of Baptism) that salvation is attained.  The book ends with the Church in Paradise.  "And later, when they rested in the weeds, they felt happy in a way they had never been before."  Leo Lionni's message here is that paradise begins in the heart. (As Christ taught in his parables, such as the parable of the mustard seed.)     Of course, small children will not see or understand many of the theological meanings and messages.  It is an excellent book to teach small children about sharing.  But it is so much more!  I highly recommend this book to Christian families wishing to teach their children the truths of the faith.  But of course, you will need to do a lot of "sharing" and listening---not just reading--to get at the heart of this book with your children.          
 Cut during two seperate sessions in 1949, this cd is classic bop top to bottom. The first half of the cd features Stitt's tenor Backed by the genius of Bud Powell, Curly Russell on bass, and Max Roach on drums. The set kicks of with a high energy performance of Powell's "All God's Chillun Got Rhythm" and the bird flavored "Sonny Side", on which both Stitt and Powell cook. The second half teams Stitt up with trombone heavyweight J.J. Johnson, pianist John Lewis, Nelson Boyd on bass, and Max Roach returning on drums. Johnson's "Teapot" is a highlight. While the sound quality suffers on a couple of tracks, the performances are consistantly superior. Stitt, Powell, Johnson and company are all in top shape and do not fail to impress. This cd is a must for bop fans, and contains some of Stitt's best playing 
 Chandler had probably never seen most of the people with whom he corresponded in his letters, but his opinions on everything from the plight of the writer in Hollywood to the merits of housecats are not only witty and memorable, but also indicate an extremely thoughtful man and first-rate analytical mind.  The only problem I had with Hiney's editing is that a bit more could have been explained--although some of the context of each letter is provided, additional information would have been helpful.  I believe I would have appreciated Chandler's observations even more had this been the case 
 Murder begets murder begets murder begets . . . madness.  Enacting personally the larger Anglo-Irish tragedy, a family experiences, and inflicts, murder, leading ultimately to the insanity of the latest-born of the clan.  Aeschylus would have understood, though his Orestes ultimately escaped the demons of his past.  A gripping piece of fiction that is at the same time a history of Irish-English relations "writ small.&quot 
 This field guide is wonderful. The multiple drawings of each species and sex really provide ease in identification. Song descriptions are also provided along with habitat maps. The layout is simple and after a couple I.D.'s you'll be glad you made the purchase 
 This is the third book I have read by Grisham, and so far I have really enjoyed each one. Grisham really knows how to write a good legal thriller. This book does not have any courtroom/court-case scenes, which I really enjoy, but it still kept my attention very well. Grisham gives you just enough "inside details" to keep you guessing without actually telling you the answer. For example: at one point, the clues seemed to point to Fletcher Coal being involved in the killings, but that was way off the mark in the end. This characteristic of Grisham's writings makes for a very enjoyable read. One of my few complaints about this book is the sudden romance between Gray and Darby. They had hardly even met before they seemed to become attracted, then it VERY quickly blossomed into an open show of affection, even though at the same time, Darby was supposedly mourning for Thomas. Even so, that is probably the main thing that seems wrong about this book, and it does not detract from the overall quality very much at all.  Overall, this is a very captivating, page-turner book that really holds your attention. I highly recommend it, as well as Grisham's other books. So far, I have found Grisham to be an awesome writer of legal thrillers. I promise that you will not be disappointed. Read and enjoy 
 Lynne Cherry's illustration of this book are so realistic they look like photographs.  The book has exceptional detail from the flowery meadow to all the creatures living in it.  The poetic text and illustrations describe the life cycle of a swallowtail butterfly with great accuracy.  A wonderful story for nature lovers 
 Otherworldly artistry from way back before WWII. Some of this stuff was even recorded in the 1800's. Hard to imagine...  It's more of that weird, old America Greil Marcus is always going on about...  Special kudos must be given to the NuGrape Twins...their plaintive "I Got Your Ice-Cold NuGrape" is incredibly powerful and haunting...  Another winner for the extremely weird and wonderful Revenant label, founded originally by John Fahey.  
 Young Casey (Nathan Forrest Winters) has an acute case of coulrophobia (fear of clowns), so when his two older brothers suggest a trip to the visiting circus, Casey is understandably reluctant.  Being aware of the young boy's fears, his brothers--especially the oldest, Randy (a young Sam Rockwell in one of his earliest film roles)--tease him a bit, and Casey eventually relents to prove to his bros that he's not a wimp.  But at the circus, one of the clowns singles out Casey and tries to get him to come into the center ring to participate in a skit.  Casey freaks, of course, and bolts out the nearest opening in the Big Top.  "Their faces are fake," he later tells his brothers, trying to justify his behavior. "Big happy eyes; big painted smiles. They're not real. You never know what they really are."  As the boys walk home, Randy, who has been put in charge of his brothers Geoffrey (Brian McHugh) and Casey while their parents are away, is hardly sympathetic and harasses Casey relentlessly about such "sissy" fears.    After the circus closes for the day, three patients who recently escaped from a psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane--what other kind is there in a horror flick?--murder the clowns and assume the harlequins' identities by donning the makeup and costumes themselves.  Then they demonically frolic into the night and wind up at the home of--you guessed it!--Casey and his brothers, and the young coulrophobic is forced to not only face his fears, but to defeat them.  Thus runs the plot of 1989's CLOWNHOUSE.  And while it takes a wee bit of effort to suspend disbelief and accept the coincidence of the evil clowns winding up at the home of young Casey, the skills of auteur Victor Salva turn this simple story with its somewhat cliche setup into a polished, well-paced horror flick that is actually quite scary.  As a screenwriter, Salva has a knack for creating frightening situations and making them believable, and as a director, he is very adept at milking all the emotion he can get from a scenario without pushing it too far over the top and into parody.  With the exception of the performance from a young Sam Rockwell--genre fans have seen Rockwell most recently in SF hits like GALAXY QUEST (1999) and the remake of THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY (2005)--the acting in the film is pretty average fare for a 1980's low-budget thriller.  But the characters do have a comfortable family dynamic, mainly due to Salva's masterfully realistic, believable dialogue.  (Indeed, Salva seems to have a genuine talent for writing dialogue for youngsters, as is evidenced again in his later films like 1995's critically acclaimed POWDER and 2001's boxoffice megahit JEEPERS CREEPERS.)  Overall, CLOWNHOUSE is a well-done horror movie basted in slasher overtones, one of the few of the post-HALLOWEEN (1978) horror flicks of the 1980s that is able to generate scares via the threat of violence rather than through the relentless depiction of gory murders. (There is, in fact, very little by way of graphic violence or blood-and-guts gore in this flick.) And CLOWNHOUSE is actually more than just a spook show. It is also a rather interesting comment on childhood fears, the psychological legitimacy of some of those fears, and how a child's life can be negatively affected by such fears if they're not dealt with effectively.  Ironically, the public perception of CLOWNHOUSE has been the victim of real-life childhood horror that took place behind the scenes during the film's production. This horror came out of the darkness and into the light in 1995, soon after the release of Salva's film POWDER, when it was revealed that the writer/director had served time for the molestation of Nathan Forrest Winters, the young star of CLOWNHOUSE.  Not only did this hinder the boxoffice success of the critically revered POWDER, but it understandably placed a stigma on CLOWNHOUSE that has caused some critics and viewers to read into the film's plot and visual imagery innuendo that really isn't there.  Fortunately for Salva (and for filmgoers), he was able to remove the dark cloud from over himself--if not from over his previous films--with the release of his very successful (both critically and commercially) non-genre drama RITES OF PASSAGE (1999), and he later redeemed his reputation in the horror genre with the very financially successful JEEPERS CREEPERS in 2001.  But reviews should be impartial and examine the merit of the film in question ONLY, not taking into account any personal problems that the filmmakers may be struggling with.  With that in mind, CLOWNHOUSE is an excellent little '80s horror flick that transcends much of the HALLOWEEN rip-offs that deluged the theaters during the decade.  The DVD from MGM is a no-frills disc that contains only the theatrical trailer as an extra, but it does offer a good digital transfer of the flick at its original aspect ratio.  And while the disc may be hard to get these days, it is well worth the search.  Fans of horror or 1980s slasher flicks will certainly want to add this disc to their collections 
 All of Writer's Digest resource books are excellent.  If you think about it, where else would this vital industry contact information be available?  I'm getting irritated with "Quack's" comments on every Writer's Digest review page.  He obviously never sent a query or manuscript to an agent (as he probably can't write one to begin with) because I've had a lot of luck sending queries, proposals, and manuscripts to agents and publishers who "say" they aren't accepting new authors, etc.  I have one book deal in the works because I sent my proposal to a publisher who clearly stated, "No new authors."  So Quack needs to get a life, learn how to write, and stop being such a kill joy.  He'll never be a successful writer...or a successful anything.  He's just too pessimistic.  If you're serious about writing, you need all of the contacts and resources you can get.  This book will get you started on the right path 
 I purchased this book as a companion to Sink Reflections by Marla Cilley, aka Flylady.  Marla often references the Sidetracked Home Executive as the origin for her organizing system, and I was hopeful this book would solve some the mysteries behind the terms she uses such as "SHE" and "Born Organized."  They definitely did, with quite a bit of humor and wit.  A very enjoyable book.  I probably won't use the card-file system (my control journal is already functioning quite well for this purpose), though will be able to use several of the tips in this book.  Would recommend this book for other flybabies.  
 The first time I saw the movie Sahara it was great, but when I read the book it was even better. Reading this book is like going back in time. I like how Cussler puts some history in his books but twists it just enough to make it interesting. Dirk and Al are at it again, but this time they are in a race against the clock to save the world because the Oxygen in the world is about to run out if the chemical pollution doesn't stop. They are push to go in the middle of the world's biggest dessert because of a surprise perk. That you wouldn't believe. I recommend this book to anyone that likes action, a little romance and humo 
 Freddy, a maple leaf, is born in the spring, and grows to know his fellow leaves and his surroundings. Although leaves superficially look the same, he learns and appreciates the subtle differences between himself and each other leaf. He admires a larger leaf, Daniel. Daniel has a deeper understanding of life and death. He helps Freddie understand each of his phases of life. Finally, Daniel explains death and letting go.   The book uses the gentle, concrete metaphor of the annual changes in leaves on a tree to help anyone appreciate the different phases of life. Each leaf leaves the tree differently: some drift down quietly, and others fiercely resist the tug of the wind. This shows how each person approaches death differently. Freddy resists until he is withered and brown, the last leaf on the branch. Finally he lets go and experiences a sense of peace.   Although the leaves, die each year, they are part of the tree which lives on, although even it has a finite life. the book discusses the interconnecedness of life and death. however, it does not take a stand on the specifics of a life after death.   This would help children of a wide range of ages appreciate not only death, but also the different phases of life. Each time Freddy the leaf changes with the seasons, it is puzzling but he learns its value. He sees how the tree and the leaves have purpose. this helps one see that life has purposes that may not be immediately obvious. This book is also moving for adults who may be experiencing a life transition. I recommend that anyone, of any age take this book and read it under a tree. 
 Although this is a great resource it is a bit bulky. Even so, I wouldn't want less material. I appreciate the reproducible sheets so much. I don't have a lot to say that others haven't already said. I do want to recommend another set of books to use directly with the children. It is four Dolch sight word books by Betsy B. Lee. These don't look that much like little kid books and they are even used in middle school and the lower grades. Look up the author's name at amazon 
 You HAVE to see this movie! This is one of those movies that when you are done watching it, you just feel good! I was pleasantly surprised at how great it was! And, what a neat concept - Home Exchange!? 
 Great little book !!  Very handy and easy to use.  Comprehensive listing of all the words and phrases you need.  A recommended must in your Yiddish collection 
 We've checked out a number of Boynton books from our library, and Pajama Time is the first one my daughter has really loved.  She just turned two, and she is always asking for "Jammie Time" to be read to her, especially when we are getting her ready for bed.  I like how the book can be sung, which always brings a smile to my daughter's face.  The pictures and words are silly and seem to be very appealing to toddlers. 
 YMAA presents may books on the chinese arts.  The cost of these books is clearly outweighed by the depth of knowledge the writer presents.  Master Liang is no exception.  Clearly a highly informative reference text.  Pictures are useful but we all want bigger pictures....  A good buy for the Tai Chi, Buag Qua, Hsing Yi or internal stylist.  (I met Master Liang at a seminar in CO long before this book was published 
 The presence of the Holy Spirit will fill you as you hear the worship and praise on this CD. Just for the song Unto the Lord this CD is worth buying.  This song is a personal testimony of giving yourself completely to HIM.  BE moved by the awesome power of the HOLY SPIRIT. A MUST HAVE!!!!! 
 `John Barleycorn' is the so-called "Alcoholic memoirs" of American literary icon Jack London. John Barleycorn was London's nickname for booze, and his relationship with Mr. Barleycorn is one of love/hate. In spite of the sub-title, London persists throughout this drunken autobiography that he is not an alcoholic. Nevertheless, he eloquently chronicles his tumultuous drinking career with the goal of demonstrating the enormous toll that alcohol can take on the mind, body, and spirit. At times, he glorifies his drinking, but for the most part he seems to resent this seductive destroyer of men, and claims that the only reason he drinks so much is because it is everywhere. He sees drinking as sort of a social obligation, a manly thing to do around other men. Not only does he resent it, but he concludes that prohibition is the only way to stop the destructive force of alcohol.  `John Barleycorn' is not only a story about the effects of alcohol on one man's life, but it is also an adventurous tale of one of America's first celebrities rise from rags to riches. The narrative begins with London's poverty-stricken childhood in San Francisco, continues through his teenage years as a brawling oyster pirate, and on into his adult years as a celebrated writer and passionate socialist. The prose is magnificent, and although `John Barleycorn" was highly entertaining, there is also a sense of sadness for me because I know first-hand how agonizing this type of life can be. With that said, this is a fantastic piece of American literature. 
 Great reprint of this great classic science fiction / fantasy series.  Much appreciated.  Looking forward to purchasing the remainder of the series when they are published 
 Everyone should read The Golden Ass, especially this translation. Just reading it can deepen a person. It's one of those books to be treasured and re-read every few years, finding new insights and humor. The Cupid and Psyche portion is rousing and sly and stands alone.  I've given copies as gifts over the years and notice my friends still hang on to them long after 
 It is said of Robinson Crusoe that he in managing to survive for twenty - eight years on an isolated island in which he was for the most part alone provided a metaphor for Mankind itself in its solitary struggle to survive in this vast sea of a Universe. And that by his ingenuity and his resourcefulness he gave to all of us a demonstration of how we in living must learn to adapt and reconstruct our own world and lives as we go on.   And that thus in reading this work we are not reading the story of some strange shipwrecked figure from a few hundred years ago but rather reading the story of ourselves and our own struggle for survival. In this it is not surprising that the sequel to the novel is considered far less compelling. And Crusoe's return after the death of his wife to the island he left is seen as somewhat of a failed adventure, especially as his faithful servant Friday was killed by savages in the process.  One is young and alone and can go far into distant worlds and survive. But when one is old and returns to those worlds seeking to find one's youth there one only finds those worlds have aged also- and the mirror they hold up to your face is not a flattering one.  I wonder now what it would be like to as a child set out in the world again to a distant land of adventure.  'Robinson Crusoe' lives in all of us, but perhaps most especially an really only to those who are young. 
 i perticularly liked this book, knowing how it feels to move counties and starting from zero. the reason i give it four stars is because the way this author described his story could not have been any clearer. he describes his feelings with a lot of dedacation which is why i liked this book. 
 Great book but, wasn't what I anticipated.  None the less, Steven King classic 
 St. Augustine once said of God, "We are meant for thee, and our hearts are ever restless until they meet their rest in thee." John Elderdge has done an astonishingly good book on finding the true desire of the heart, that elusive call of "Joy" which C.S. Lewis so ably spoke about.  From the opening words of his parable of the Sea Lion, which is worth the entire book, he guides the reader through that desire which is in the hearts of those who belong to Christ, and directs them to the One for whom that desire points.  As Elderdge points out, the problem most Christians have is not that their desires are too strong, but they are too weak. We mess around with things that don't amount to a hill of beans, while infinite joy is offered us.  It is well worth reading, and an eye-opener. It should awaken even the most lethargic soul. 
 Did anyone ever love Paris, or at least eating in Paris, like Liebling. I share his love for the city and for the cuisine. Perhaps this colors my view but I really enjoyed this book 
 I first saw this film many years ago.  It was funny then and it still is now.  If you've seen Bram Stoker's Dracula, then you need to see this movie.  It's a great spoof that makes fun of the movie.  
 The title of my review sums it up... stick a pretentious professor of philology in a series of European settings and watch the foolish action, to which our hero (Von Igelfeld) is oblivious.  The book is a set of eight stories that are somewhat intertwined, involving the professor and his unusual friends.  The best ones are the first two.  I got the biggest chuckle when the 1923 edition of the rules of tennis had no provision for a tie breaker, which led the professors into total confusion.  Some of the later chapters could have used a bit more humor.  Throughout the book, Von Igelfeld's pride in his great book of Portuguese irregular verbs is evident.  
 Kings and queens of past times usually seem so remote, but Berengaria comes across as a genuine person that I felt I might have known. I could feel her joy and her trepidation, and sympathize with her heartbreaking rejections. The book convincingly portrays life in medieval France among those of high degree. "Queen Without a Country" held my interest from beginning to end 
 I just bought this graphing calculator. It looks and feels very stylish and comfortable. I believe this is a better choice than the ti-84 plus silver edition as that version has a little more memory and a few more applications and cost about $20 more. I don't care about those extras because i only need it for my math class!!If you need a graphing calculator this is the one to get as it it almost identical to the ti-83 plus and only cost about $10 more. Buy this and you get a better screen, more memory, and faster speed!!!!!!!! 
 There are a lot of nice items to send away for. My Mom and Dad both get ideas and things for us to do from the book. The craft kits in the book, some of which want a dollar or two for postage are nice.  Some great stickers, books and other goodies too 
 My one year old son loves Toy Story, especially Woody. His face lights up at the sight of him and this book has wonderful color pictures that keeps  him interested when I read it to him. It follows the movie very well and is  his favorite night-time read. It is also broken down into chapters so you  don't have to read it all in one sitting. Thank goodness for this book and  I can only wait for the movie 
  This book is designed to teach the basics of money changing to children in grades 2 and 3. P. B. is a boy who likes peanut butter sandwiches and he also puts his allowance in empty jars to store it up. However, he recently noticed that the level of coins in the jar has dropped so he thinks someone is stealing it. The jar is on the window sill and he has it staked out. His friends Maria and Mike are walking by when they spot him and ask him what he is doing.   Shortly after they all eat a sandwich, they see P. B.'s sister Jill take money out of the jar. When she comes out, they confront her and she says that while she took coins out of the jar, she replaced them with dollar bills, which take up less space. Jill also tells them that yesterday the cat knocked the jar down and it broke. She replaced it will a larger jar, which explains why the level has dropped. They all go out to the garage where they count the money and it turns out that it is all there.  This story is meant to be the prelude for a series of exercises to give to the students about counting money and the different ways in which a certain amount can be expressed. It will interest the students and lay the proper foundation for the activities which appear in the back of the book. The combination of story and exercises is very well done.  
 Just a response to the review noting the wrist strength needed to release arm on excavator.  My 23 month old received this for Christmas and I must admit it took us at least 5-10 preplexed minutes to figure out the twisting motion for release.  My 23 month old learned it within the day and has no trouble at all since.  Great toy!  and a reasonable price for the enjoyment 
 Creeley has skillfully captured both Ingersoll's blazing integrity and his wonderful insights. There are memorable quotes on nearly every page (On Immortality: "It is better to ignorantly hope than to dishonestly affirm."). An excellent reminder that we are all better served by having an open, honest, civil debate about life's most ultimate questions 
 Buddy Guy has done it again. This recording is simply one of the best I have ever heard and was engineered beautifully. And to make it even more special, B.B. King and Eric Clapton make an appearance. This is an essential Buddy Guy CD 
 The moo mixer works great and it is easy to use - just pour in the ingredients and hold the handle to start the mixer.  It is also easy to clean because the cup part of it can be removed for washing.  My kid loves this item. 
 Hilarious, disturbing and painfully accurate, KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL is a highly recommended book for anyone who loves restaurants, food, good stories and great writing.    Essentially an autobiography, KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL is a compilation of essays about the restaurant world and author Anthony Bourdain's journey from a lazy, dishwashing college drop-out to one of the most celebrated chefs in America.  What makes Bourdain's journey a fascinating read is the author's fearless honesty about himself and the food business.  Like a flasher, Bourdain reveals it all: the good, the bad and the truly ugly details the greater public would be shocked to learn about this seemingly glamorous industry.  While offering invaluable tips about how to cook like a pro, dine like regular and avoid the pitfalls that sink wannabe restaurateurs, Bourdain lovingly exposes the madness and mayhem behind the scenes of America's best restaurants.   A chef's chef, Bourdain truly adores the criminal eccentrics who toil in his kitchen and in a sense KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL is love letter to those he affectionately calls the "wacked-out moral degenerates, dope fiends, refugees, a thuggish assortment of drunks, sneak thieves, sluts, and psychopaths."  Though perhaps too frank for prim and proper types, KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL is so well written and so chock full of twisted details, I would recommend it highly to anyone who loves a good meal as much as a great tale.  -- Regina McMenami 
 While other people have complained about the lack of text in this book, I found it refreshing. It was nice to evaluate these rarely seen drawings (in high quality reproductions) on my own. The thumbnail reference page in the back is also a nice design idea. This book might serve as a nice companion to either the MCA catalouge or the Rosenblum book 
 To see him as an intelligent, well-read, fearless, analytical, funny and caring young man, you gotta see this video. Since I was not a rap fan, I had lumped all the rappers into one group, not so with Tupac. RI 
 Its a very good source for creating innovation in gardenin 
 This book has a taste of everyting! It has a little bit of drama,happieness,sadness,anger,and death. I've read this book twice and it's still one of my  faves 
 I'm 32 years old as I write this.  I remember buying this album brand new back in the day and spinning it (yes, I had it on an actual RECORD!!!) non stop.  When the parents would leave, I would crank it LOUD and lip sync to my favs. My big time heroes at the time were Piper (so of course, I loved For Everybody), and Paul Orndorff (who old school fans will remember came to the ring to Real American after he turned on Hogan. Anyhow, the way I see it, anything that can make you smile is a good thing.  This is a CD that will make you smile. It might be lost on those who didn't follow the WWF in the late 80's. I just wish it wasn't 12 bucks 
 Follow directions.  Three to four wasters at the beginning.  Makes great caps 
 With a quiet, unassuming elegance, Canadian-Chinese author Judy Fong-Bates sets the scene for her highly applauded debut novel, 'Midnight at the Dragon Cafe'.   Perhaps this story touched me more acutely than most of its readers, as it called to mind what my father and his parents must have experienced during and after their immigration from Hong Kong to a little town in Canada in the mid-1950s. Every word to me was genuine, haunting, compelling...  Little Su-Jen Chou (at the tender age of six), along with her beautiful yet bitter mother, immigrates to Canada from Communist China, to meet the father she has never known. A father who is the proprietor of the local Canadian-Chinese "greasy spoon". With Su-Jen mother constantly haunted with yearnings for her homeland, unpleasant family secrets uncovered, and the trials and challenges they face in a new and often-times unwelcoming land, Fong-Bates weaves a story full of heartbreak, tribulation and acceptance.  Poignant in its simplicity and yet weighty in its inner complexities, 'Midnight at the Dragon Cafe' explores many social issues of the time, along with the disappointments, the pride, the sacrifices, and the triumphs of those who immigrated to Canada in search of something "better". Compelling and well written, Fong-Bates stunning first novel deserves a heaping spoonful of praise. 
 James Patterson never fails to impress as any of his many fans will probably tell you. This time, to no one's surprise,he does it again, and then some. In "Kiss the Girls", Patterson connects two serial killers that work with each other as well as compete against each other. Sounds scary enough right, well not only are they working together, they are covering it from coast to coast. Casanova takes the east side and The Gentleman Caller takes the west. Yet again, Alex Cross is thrown into the case when his own neice becomes captured by Casanova. Cross is thrown into a mind-blowing game of cat-and-mouse once again as he tries to crack the case and save his neice. You won't be able to put this book down and you will never guess how it ends. Full of suspense, and action packed. Five stars all the way. 
 Lehane writes best when writing about the escapades of the kenzie/gennaro team, and this book is at the top of the five he has written about them so far. the action is relentless, the suspense is biting, and the humor is suffocating. a must-have 
 Frequent motivational author John C. Maxwell, a former pastor, squarely based these 21 laws of leadership on enduring values. These guidelines are meant to inspire, not innovate, as they offer techniques to make leading by principle a practical reality. Maxwell's straightforward, insightful rules are well worth the time you will spend reading them. We recommend this gem of simplicity as a game book for building stronger teams and becoming a better leader. 
 To keep this short and to the point:  If you've never heard a 2Pac album before this may be the best place to start. His music from this album is rapped with a type of raw passion that I haven't heard before. The messages within his lyrics are important, for those who choose to listen to them.  If you have heard 2Pac's music before then I suggest you pick this up. It will be good to hear his original tracks whether you're a casual fan or if you have a deep love for his music.  The music off of 2Pacalypse Now and some of his other early albums is distinctly different in style from his time on the Death Row record label (which is anything from the All Eyez On Me album forward, including that album.) Both styles are quite unique and just as good as one another, as 2Pac didn't lose a step until his tragic death in 1996. I particurlarly enjoy both styles of his music, and think that any fan should find it in themselves to try to as well 
   As a college student, Dana was probably uniqely qualified to write this book. Surely few of his fellow sailors were as articulate as he was. This book reads almost like two; a book about early California surrounded by a "life at sea" book. Both at sea and on land Dana found fascinating characters, places and events. His interest in them make the book a fun adventure to read.    As a native San Diegan I also get the pleasure of walking in Dana's footsteps; through the house of Don Juan Bandini and the Mission Dana and his friend Stimson visited. Many of the landmarks Dana described are still here.   Lastly, my father told about reading TYBtM as a young man and wanting to see San Diego. He came as an adult and the rest of his life was lived here so it's fair to say that his love of this book profoundly shaped my life. The only regret I have after reading this book is not getting to it sooner so we could have talked about it together 
 The first SLEEPAWAY CAMP film begins with two young children, Angela and Peter, out on a lake with their dad, John. There is a horrible boating accident, and John and one of the kids is killed. Eight years later, the surviving child, Angela, is now 14 and living with her cousin Ricky and aunt Martha. Angela is painfully shy and hardly speaks at all. The two kids are headed off to the summer camp Arawak. When they get there they meet some people who don't take well to Angela: Judy, a pretty and stuck-up bitch, and Meg, a councler who is creeped out by Angela's tendancy to stare at others and not say anything, and annoyed by the way she doesn't participate in any activities. Then Angela is assaulted by Arty, the dirty, perverted cook. Ricky comes in the nick of time, and Arty chases them out. Later while Arty is cooking ears of corn over a big steaming pot, someone sneaks up behind and pulls the chair out from under him and making him fall in. Arty is horribly burned and taken to the hospidal. But then other members of the camp who were mean to Angela start getting knocked off. Is the killer Ricky, who always wittnesses when someone is cruel to her and acts out in her defense, or is the killer Angela herself? (If you've read the other reviews or description of the sequels, you probably already know the answer, as well as the film's final shock twist.)  In SLEEPAWAY CAMP 2: UNHAPPY CAMPERS, it's four years later. Angela (O.K., yeah, she's the killer in all the films,) has been rehabilitated (or so they think,) and is now working as a camp councler at camp Rolling Hills, where the campers consist of about two middle-school boys and 37 high school students. Angela wants to be friends with the campers, but there are some-particularly the eight girls who she's directly responsible for-who have bad attitudes and nasty habits, like doing drugs and having promiscuous sex. So Angela starts bumping off the people she deems bad campers.    In SLEEPAWAY CAMP 3: TEENAGE WASTELAND, Angela kills and takes the identity of another girl so she can go back to summer camp once again. There are eleven other teenagers there, both rich and poor, and three counclers. Of course, Angela meets people there who rub her the wrong way, and the killing begins once again...  Stuff in particular I liked: the trailer in part 1, the rock music in parts 2 and 3. Both Felissa Rose and Pamela Springsteen are wonderful as Angela. You have to feel sorry for the killer here, actually, since if only she'd had a better life growing up or could once come to a camp where everyone was well-behaved she could have gotten along fine. Certian scenes in particular in part 2 shows Angela really just wants a friend. And of course there are a number of good kill scenes as well. Also the characters are better fleshed-out, at least as far as slasher films go. The commentairies are fun to listen to, and Felissa Rose is one of the people who does commentary for the first film  Now for a few complaints: Angela is supposed to kill only those who are really mean. Yet there are some murders that seem unmotivated, at least later on in parts 2 and 3. Why did she kill Anthony and Jud, the two guys who dress up as Freddy and Jason? I mean sure they had that unwelcome party in the middle of the night with the girls that Angela wasn't happy with, but Molly, the girl who Angela really liked, was involved too, so that doesn't seem good enough. If it's because the boys wanted to scare the girls, well Angela scares them right afterwards dressed as Leatherface (she doesn't actually kill anyone right then, though) so that would seem to make her a hipocrate. Then at the end of part 3 she sets up a booby trap that kills two teens that weren't bad either, Angela just decided they were boring. My other complaint is that Pam Springsteen, who plays Angela in the sequels, doesn't do the commentaries for them. (She doesn't act anymore either, which is a shame.)     
 I love the detroit tigers, this is a good buy for any baseball fan. its cheaper here then in stores 
 I loved this book.  It is far from the typical Grisham legal fair, but something that everyone has thought of doing at least once in their lifetimes - skipping Christmas!  The characters are wonderful - the wife, pathetic, the husband, oh, so stalwart in his resolve to skip the holidays - until a wrench is thrown into their plans.  Do yourself a favor, Grisham fan or not, and read this next November 
 good book and tells a good story nice book to rea 
 This is a stunningly beautiful book. David Doubilet has broken a visual barrier, between water and earth. Highly recommended 
 Rogers and Hammerstein were in a different league when it came to writing musicals. Their music, lyrics and story are never alike. These two partners were exceptional and their music shows it. Carousel is a tragic story but also shows that human nature can rise above adversity. The music is wonderful and the characters believable. A great movie 
 This cd is a great one it is my favorite one out of all of them i would invest in it because it is awwwwwwwesome man buy it buy it o.k o.k. song #1 a 2# a 3# b and son on and so o 
 From the viewpoint of someone who saw the original in the theatres back in the 70s I can truthfully say that the production company has done a superb job of remastering and restoring this great film.  The colors are sharper, the audio is much clearer and the video quality is fantastic.  A great fun car chase film that has no peer, I highy recommend it for a evening's entertainment that doesnt require too much heavy thinking.  
 Marcia Willett's "A Week in Winter" is a very much modern day novel woven in a familial paradigm spun from threads of characters who appear in all dimensions absolutely real and vibrant and full of life. This is a book that comes as a refreshing read and employs a realistic portrayal of life in ficton. "A Week in Winter" as the title itself suggests is the life of a famly during Christmas and in a limited space and time windows the sudden and occasionally abrupt changes in the lives of a plethora of characters ranging from one-year-old Luke to old Maudie Todhunter. This is a moving story about human passions,dreams,hopes,expectations,acceptance and inability to go beyond the insulated boundary of perception,a riveting tale about man's tryst with inevitability and most importantly his own self.  Set against the backdrop of a week during Christmas time,Marcia Willett's amazing piece of literature revolves around Moorgate,a house of contention on the edge of Bodmin Moor in Cornwall,England. Indeed it is the proposed selling of Maudie Todhunter's late husband's home that spells troble which ripples diasaster and severe coldness across the family. Maudie is the second wife of Hector Todhunter and has never been able to make the transgression from a stepmother to a mother for Selina and Patricia,Hector's daughters from his first marriage to Hilda. Selina has been an eternal enemy to the hapless Maudie whose life has been rendered forlorn by her husband's death. Her only means to gain some respite from the gloomy atmosphere is exchange of emotions with Daphne,Hector and Hilda's old friend,and occasional but just as buoyed and joyous visits from Selina's daughter Posy. A disenchanted stepdaughter,a huge figure's death and financial insecurity are not enough to conspire and rip apart Maudie's life,and now that she has put Moorgate on sale,things are going radically out of hand.  Selina is fuming with rage at the inevitable sale of her father's home and like one of her realm---that of emotional unbalance and indecision of mind---is making all sorts of execuses to impede the sale. She coaxes,pleads and even threatens her husband Patrick Stone,a disillusioned and resigned-to-fate man,to but Moorgate but the odds are heavily stacked against her. "What is one man's meat is other man's poison". In this case though,the adage becomes "What is one man's poison is another man's meat". Rob Abot is the caretaker of Moorgate but given the splendor and charisma of the house he's steeply in love with it. He has not enough finance to buy it but an unconceived meeting with Melissa---who lives in London along with her writer brother Mike and his son Luke,and is a prospective buyer of the property---sripts a fantasy tale that is full of promise and anticipation Rob and Melissa both fall in love at first sight with each other and the five days spent together at Moorgate are the few moments of unassuming glory and fun before the threatening darkclouds swallow them up.  "A Week in Winter" is not just simply a novel about the selling of a house and the consequence of this act;its moral conviction and conjuring up of vivid truths of life are more taut ideas. The book has a tragic note right from the very inception and this sombre picture is carried throughout until the end punctuated by happy incidents. This shade of pessimism might be the flip side of the book but then again,life at its best never promoses any fairytale gratifications. The best feature of this book is the picturisation of the characters of the characters as possessing stories of their own;each figure has its own story to tell,a story patterned in overlapping patches of black and whiteand all stories are distinctly different and so all the more better for the construction of the plot.  Marcia Willett's magic lies in her well-drawn characters all aspiring to jump out of the pages,turn to life and form a part of the reader's environment. Each character is well-defined and massively crucial for the gradual unfolding of the story. "A Week in Winter" is an ebullient book that mirrors life in its exactitude and involves condensed descriptions and measured glimpses of intrinsic emotions and feelings. Patrick Stone's sudden realisation of his position and his metamorphosis,Daphne's acknowledgament of a dark secret,Selina and Maudie's relationship and a slight repitition of feelings of one generation in another are the most critical junctures of this lovely and exotic book. The authoress makes her book an absorbing read and we seem to live the experiences of the fictive characters ourselves. A fluid narration held by certain dynamic reflection moods,invokation of tragedy,romance and Nature and a brilliantly construed idea make this book a wondrous book,one that never attempts to gallop away from life's destined campaign 
 Its so easy to read, so basic, but it tells you everything you ever need to know about teamwork, and how to take on tasks, while also explaining how to overcome conflicts that can arise in a team.  What more can you ask for?  Highly Recommended 
 This is the most amazing piece of equipment for barbequing. Everyone should own one. I purchased one for my daughter and she is delighted with it. I plan on ordering an extra one just to have a spare 
 The Animals Divine Tarot is a stunning addition to Lisa Hunt's body of work.  If you are familiar with the previous best-selling decks she illustrated, The Shapeshifter Tarot and The Celtic Dragon Tarot, then you should be quite excited about the Animals Divine as this kit is all Lisa Hunt.  She is the author of the book as well as the painter of the cards.  The 78 cards in the deck are true works of art, each watercolor image done in Lisa's signature ethereal style.  If you were impressed with the art from her previous decks, then this imagery will blow you away.  First impressions:  When I received my advanced copy, I excitedly tore it out of the mailer and gazed at the packaging.  The artwork on the box is subtle and tasteful and will look great on my shelf.  Inside, the book and cards were neatly packed and I was pleasantly surprised at the inclusion of an organdy bag.  Stunning art on the cards aside, they are sturdy, feel comfortable in the hand and shuffle well.  There is a definite positive energy to them.  I have shuffled through them many times and every card is beautiful.  Some of my favorites are Kutkinnaku (Knight of Swords), Ganesha (The High Priest), Cerridwen (The Magician), Seal (Ace of Cups), Firefly (Ace of Wands), All Animals (The Wheel), Gaia (The World), Thunderbirds (The Tower) and Rabbit (Ten of Pentacles).  The major arcana and the court cards are represented by a goddess/god from world mythologies and their corresponding animal.  When it comes to the suits, pentacles are earth, cups are water, wands are fire and swords are air.  Each of these cards showcase an animal that best fits that element.  The cardbacks are classy with a neat looking Animals Divine logo triskellion in the center, printed in metallic gold ink.  At first glance, the book has a quality appearance and seems well written.  After the foreword by tarot artist/author Kris Waldherr, Lisa delves into how connecting with the animal realm can help broaden our understanding the world, our relationships and ourselves.  Her explanations for the cards discuss their meaning, symbolism and describe how the animal and/or goddess/god represented apply to that specific card.  There are accompanying illustrations of the cards with each description, which I find extremely useful as a reference tool.  Lisa finishes the book with insightful meditations using the cards, as well as sample spreads designed specifically for this deck.    I would, without hesitation, recommend the Animals Divine Tarot kit for any practitioner of tarot or a collector of quality decks.  This sensational kit is a must have!  UPDATE (Aug. 08, 2006):  The Animals Divine Tarot is the winner of the prestigious  2006 COVR Interactive Sideline Awar 
 I purchased this CD for my wife because of one song - "I hope you dance."  She enjoys all the songs 
 Supergrass' I Should Coco is a landmark acheivement.  The thought that mere teenagers could recreate an energy not felt since the birth of punk in the late 70s is astounding.  Supergrass deliver great track after great track almost through the entire album, each one filled with a youthful energy and an appropriate goofiness that is so lacking in the world of music.  The frontman of the band, Gaz Coombs, has written enough infectious songs on this one effort alone to qualify him as one of the great pop writers of all time.  Only during maybe one or two tracks does the album slow a bit.  It effects the final result of the album but it doesn't kill it (the slow tracks are just as good as the rest).  It's amazing to think how short-lived Supergrass' fame was when listening to this fine album and one can only hope that these unsung artists will rise to the top once more 
 I studied English in Europe in college and I don't understand why Ross Thomas was not on the menue... I read Thomas because this man's got more taste,  sensitivity and fine humor than you'd expect from anybody. This book is one of his finest. When I'll have finished all his books, this'll be the first one I'll read again 
 I originally had the Sony DCS W50 but returned it to get the W70.  Pros 7.2 Megapixel Small and Light High Quality VGA Video Recording with sound 3X Optical Zoom Optical Viewfinder, you'd be surprised how many companies are doing away with the optical viewfinder Great Battery Life Big LCD Display  Cons Non-Standard USB port on the camera Pro-Duo Memory Card, come on Sony! SD Cards own the market No QVGA Video mode.  VGA (640x480) is really nice, the low quality mode 160x112 is also a good feature to have but why not QVGA (320x240), it would of been a nice to have that extra feature.  Sony I am very impressed  The negatives of the camera are negligible in the long run, sure I would of liked an SD card slot, but Pro Duo cards are coming down in price.  The quality of the photos are incredible.  The camera is small and sleek.  This camera also offers several different photosizes.  7 MP, 3:2 (6 MP), 5 MP, 3 MP, 2 MP, VGA, 16:9 (2 MP).  All the standard features, Macro (which is incredible), red-eye reduction, low light, etc.  There are three other camera's in Sonys W Line.  The DSC W30 and W50 which are both 6 MP cameras, and the W100 which is an 8 MP Camera.  As I stated before I originally had the Sony W50, the 6 megapixel version, but decided that I should of spend the extra $50 for the 7 MP one.  The LCD is prone to fingerprints, but they are easily wiped off.  For the price and the quality this camera is a steal all other 7 MP cameras are currently much more expensive 
 An interesting and concise explanation of many facets of cat behavior, organized into brief question and answer sections that make for easy reference and quick reading.  Desmond Morris illuminates many fascinating aspects of feline hunting and mating behavior, as well as providing insights into their body language.  The book may lack some scientific rigor in that Morris sometimes speculates on issues of cat motivation for which he has no experimental or statistical support (or at least none that he mentions), but it is clear that he respects these animals, takes them seriously, and bases his conclusions on many hours of observation.  Recommended 
 If you live in the Northwest and have any interest in wine, this is a book for you!  It is what I call a "great read"(a "must" read if you will).  It captures the flavor of real winemaking with a background of facts (vines, soils, geology, geography, climate and latitude), a sustained taste of optimism with a strong aroma of humor throughout. Real people, real places, real wine--this book is the real deal! Try it, you'll like 
 Rogue  Review By Roger D. Noriega   No Law. No Conscience. No Stopping Them.   This story takes place in the Next Generation time frame, a few days after the events of Star Trek: First Contact. Captain Jean Luc Picard is aboard the Enterprise, supervising her repair, taking stock and going over the post-action report with his first officer William T. Riker. While reviewing the crew list, they come to a name that stands out among the dead: Lt. Sean Liam Hawk. "Such a loss. So enthusiastic and passionate" are Picard's thoughts on this one particular Lieutenant. Everyone reaches a crossroads, if he lives long enough. Six months ago, Lt. Hawk reached his.   The Chiaros system: found deep in the Gemenis Gulf. The only habitable star system in this desolate sector of space. Three empty sectors of space and the Romulans are interested in wresting this star system from the hands of the Federation. Chiaros IV has applied for membership into the Federation and the U.S.S. Slayton is there to be on hand while the historic vote of this proud race takes place. While a shuttle is dispatched with several senior members aboard, Captain Burdick suddenly discovers a massive sub-space wave distortion wave front headed in all directions, 8 astronomical units in diameter. She orders the Slayton to investigate and in nearing the anomaly, the Slayton is crippled. Before repairs can be made, the Slayton is destroyed with all hands aboard. The Federation starship veered too close to someone and something . . . the mystery begins.   Captain Picard and the Enterprise are ordered to the Chiaros System with Ambassador Tabor and Picard's old academy friend: (now an Admiral) Marta Batanides. Turns out that (now a Commander) Cortin Zweller was aboard the Slayton and Admiral Batanides wants to mount a rescue operation to find her missing ship and classmate. During the journey, Ambassador Tabor finds a possible candidate to Section 31 - Lt. Hawk.   "I will let you in on a little secret, Sean. Starfleet knows that mistakes can be made. Are made. They've known it since the beginning. It's why the founders of Starfleet created a secret bureau, an elite group whose job is to provide for the organization's best interests."  "You mean Starfleet Intelligence? They are hardly a secret."  "No, not S.I. The group I'm talking about is known as Section 31."  "I've never heard of it."  "Most people haven't. I doubt even your Captain Picard, as wise and knowledgeable as he is, is aware of the group, even though it was part of Starfleet's original charter two hundred years ago. Section 31 exists to identify anything that might threaten the Federation-and then deals with it, efficiently and quietly."   Upon arrival to Chiaros IV, wreckage of the Slayton is found, but the shuttle dispatched from the aforementioned ship isn't located. Picard and crew make contact with both sides of a brewing conflict, one that is the legitimate ruling government, the other, a rebel band of insurgents fighting with Federation phasers! An ambush ensues and many important people die and or taken prisoner. Public sentiment is not good and the upcoming election may turn against the Federation.   The Romulans are the logical choice for the populace since the chosen side (The Federation) is supplying weapons to the rebels. Evens are further complicated by the presence of a space anomaly that is protected by a Romulan Cloaking Device of staggering size. Hawk believes it could be a Dyson Sphere, but a probe sent in provides no answers. Captain Picard is unwilling to risk his ship without definite answers. None are forthcoming and a traitor to the Federation sells-out his countrymen while the traitor to the planet turns out to be the key to the secret hidden behind the cloaking device.   This book wins praise across the board. Too bad this book wasn't turned into Star Trek X. Section 31 defends the Federation from harm but who or what protects Section 31? We learn serious lessons about knowledge, faith and making deals with the devil. Who makes the decisions to sacrifice something for the greater good? I cannot, in good conscious give up anymore in this story, but let me tell you, this one should not be missed. The story is just short of being epic, but it is clearly one that should have been told on the big screen 
 This text is a lot of fun, a rapid-fire compilation of visually interesting experiments. *However* it is out-of-date on safety.  Despite a recent revision the text appears unaware of the great danger posed by materials such as carbon tetrachloride (a chemical which has since the 60's been all but banned), mercury, benzene, phosphorous, thermite, etc.  To say "be careful" is not enough when talking to a lay audience.  Please be cautious, the experiments may sound thrilling but the harm can be nasty and permanent 
 People had always thought that solid matter was, well, solid.  It was only when scientists had an understanding of what atoms were that they began to realize that there were huge spaces between atoms.  Later they got to understand that an atom itself consisted mostly of empty space, a big outer shell where electrons whizzed around, containing only a tiny nucleus.  The image of the big shell and the tiny nucleus was given by comparison, a comparison that gives the title to _The Fly in the Cathedral: How a Group of Cambridge Scientists Won the International Race to Split the Atom_ (Farrar, Straus and Giroux) by Brian Cathcart.  Actually, the atom had been split long before, if the atom, which had been considered indivisible, is split by chipping electrons off that outer cathedral-like shell.  But "splitting the atom" has long had the real meaning of splitting the nucleus, and this is the intriguing story of the stolid, energetic and gentlemanly scientists at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge who in 1932 brought forth the birth of nuclear physics.  The commanding presence in the book, just as he was as he oversaw the lab, is Sir Earnest Rutherford, a "barreling, thundering, penetrating presence in the world of physics, a great rowdy boy full of ideas and energy."  He was thrilled by the ardor of the chase in scientific exploration, and he was an ingenious experimenter, although he was often clumsy with apparatus.  In 1927, Rutherford as its president addressed the Royal Society, proposing a new way forward for solving the problem of the composition of the nucleus.  If it were possible to accelerate particles artificially, he said, by huge voltages of electricity, they could be slammed against the nucleus and the scattered wreckage analyzed.  This sounds completely sensible now, but there was no equipment that could produce such accelerations.  The two heroes of this book, John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton, worked in Rutherford's lab, and were easily persuaded to join the chase.  Cockcroft was so quiet that his children eventually made the rule that "Daddy could not leave the dinner table until he had uttered two whole sentences."  He was superb at designing and making experimental equipment that no one else had thought of before, but was not the experimenter that Rutherford would have liked.  Walton was.  Another quiet man, he was the son of a minister and a devout Methodist who shunned any activity that might be called frivolous.  He came up with the idea of accelerating particles electrically on his own, and when he proposed such work to his boss, Rutherford was of course delighted.  In 1932, after almost four years of patient, frustrating, exhausting, and inspiring work, protons bombarded a strip of lithium, and the lithium nucleus cracked open into two helium nuclei.    Part of the charm of this book is that it describes work done in a scientific atmosphere that was like none found today.  Rutherford, even though a hard taskmaster, insisted that at six at night, everyone had to go home.  He would not have his researchers overextend themselves, and at that time, all circuits were switched off, no matter what experiment was in progress.  He did, however, allow this strict curfew to be waived once Walton and Cockcroft had made their initial findings, so that they could confirm them and rush into print ahead of the other experimenters in other nations that were trying to break down the nucleus as well.  The two experimenters did not exactly become household names, like, say, Watson and Crick, but there was some (often misdirected) praise from the press, and they got plenty of recognition from their peers.  Albert Einstein visited the lab and was thrilled with what he saw; incidentally, the experiment was the first laboratory verification of his famous equation E = mc^2.  It took almost twenty years, but Walton and Cockcroft were awarded Nobel prizes, which also failed to make them famous.  Modest, quiet, gray scientists, they probably were happy to have it that way.  
 This book is good as a reading book or as a quick reference for scholarly research in the area of LGBT studies.  I personally found Rowse's treatment of King James to be a good starting point for a paper I wrote on  homosexuality in Jacobean England 
 This book was given to me in paperback, and I literally wore the pages out of it's binder.  I love "Southern Living" and "Junior Leage" type cookbooks, but this book by far gives more recipes that are unsolicited requests from friends who have tried it's secrets.  These dishes are "different" and extremely "tasty".  Not Bland!  Try it's Poultry and vegetable sections for dishes that are uncommon and full of flavor.  The only room for improvement this book has, is that it needs photo's to help entise it's readers 
 The book is very valuable indeed for students and teachers as well as for researchers for grasping the very essence of social research. It is read at one breath and inspires one for further thinking over the matter and over the topic one has chosen for a future research. Unlike other books of this kind this work managed to avoid being too much dogmatic and rather invited a reader to think over the issues covered rather than take them for granted. 
 The usefulness of this book for us in 2005 lies in the way it gives a wider historical perspective on current debates over racially-tinged political issues - particularly affirmative action in college admissions and funding for inner-city schools.  One of the early focuses of DuBois's historical account Freedman's Bureau, which was set up by the Federal Government during Reconstruction to help establish African-Americans.  His analysis of why it mostly failed reveals how, after being hobbled by inadequate resources, it was faced by a thicket of special interests and a tidal wave of white racism.  Without the assistance of institutions such as the Freedman's Bureau, African-Americans had to fend entirely for themselves.  Trapped in a situation where they were economically powerless, politically disenfranchised, and stranded in a hostile society, few African-American people were either able or even allowed to succeed, while most became discouraged.  The result was a fall into a cycle of poverty and hopelessness, a situation that in some corners of the country tragically continues into the present.    As DuBois puts it in his discussion of the emancipation, "when these variously constituted human particles are suddenly thrown broadcast on the sea of life, some swim, some sink, and some hang suspended, to be forced up or down by the chance currents of a busy hurrying world."  The question for DuBois is how African-American people could learn to "swim," as it were - that is, to protect themselves, thrive, and mount a political counter-offensive in a country so extremely antagonistic to their well-being and even their very lives.  DuBois's big idea for solving this problem is his famous argument for the "talented tenth."  Basically DuBois is arguing for African-Americans to get a higher education and also to seek out professional careers for a number of reasons beyond the immediate good of education and being a professional.    The soundest support for "talented tenth" argument is is DuBois's claim that educated, professional African-Americans would be able to act as teachers and leaders of their community.  Speaking of "college-bred men, black captains of industry, and missionaries of culture," DuBois calls for the cultivation of "men who thoroughly comprehend and know modern civilization and can take hold of Negro communities and raise and train them by force of precept and example, deep sympathy, and the inspiration of common blood and ideals."    What DuBois clearly had in mind were institutions like the NAACP and movements like the Harlem Renaissance, and it seems pretty clear today how accurate he was in predicting how important such efforts were in establishing a truly free and equal society.  The Souls of Black Folk gives one an appreciation of the intellectual foundation of these efforts.    DuBois's argument continues to be important in an era when affirmative-action in college admissions is coming under increasing fire from the right.  It also remains important given the current reign of the so-called "No Child Left Behind" bill and similar state and city efforts, which leave inner-city schools inadequately funded even as these schools are threatened with being shut down due to a lack of improvement in test scores.  Of course, this improvement could only realistically come about through a significant increase in funding that the bill denies in the first place!    To sum up, The Souls of Black Folks is a classic statement on the importance of education to African-Americans and to the cause of racial equality as a whole 
 I agree with the other reviews here... this is a well thought out book and Todd definitely explains the technology well.    This book would have been perfect.. if I didnt get to the first big code example (page 205-209) and find so many bugs..  Work thru setting up this project and you will see what I mean.  This has kind of scared me away from the rest of the coding examples in the book.. some other typos and such (isnt it a foreword????)  that made me smile right off..   Bottom line - SPS 3.0 explained well, dont trust the coding examples 
 Having Barry's first rehearsal and his last concert on the road is a fascinating look into the history of Barry Manilow's phenominal career. The first disc recorded at  Carroll's Studio offers some of Barry's  great early material which hasn't been featured for many years including Cloudburst and Sweet Life. The 2nd DVD is fast paced where Barry's music and wit shine through.  It's interesting to see his transformation into a polished stage performer compared to his stage presence on the first disc. On both discs are It's A Miracle and Could It Be Magic which shows the timeless quality of these songs. These discs show the talent and versatility that have contributed to his long standing successful career.  
 Teacup and saucer are even more intricate than pictured.  Also, Amazon did a fabulous job with careful packaging and shipped very promptly 
 A very well-done telling of the ingenious plan to mislead the Nazis before the invasion of Sicily.   It was audacious and elaborate but well-coordinated in its scope to stage the death of an important curiour and make sure his body and papers were found by the Germans in a circuitous manner not to draw suspicion.  It is difficult to measure how well the plan worked but it did indeed have some impact when the Germans believed the ruse.  It seems a difficult kind of story to tell in movie form but this film does it well.  A top notch espionage film 
 Treasure Island is one of the several films that the dream team of Wallace Beery and Jackie Cooper made together. This one seems to illustrate their relationship off-screen much better than others in the past. Cooper plays the main character, a boy who works in his father's tavern. His life is changed when one day, a sailor called Captain walks in (Lionel Barrymore). His appearance sets off a series of events leading to pirates entering the area, leader of all being Long John Silver (Beery). They come to seek the treasure indicatd on a treasure map the Captain leaves at the tavern when he dies suddenly. However, the map is in the hands of loyal British subjects under the orders of an honest man (Lewis Stone), so the pirates have to resort to trickery to get their way.  What is disturbing about the movie is how evil one man can be to a boy who looks up to him as a friend and as a father-figure. One can only imagine that this was the way Beery really treated Cooper in life, especially from hearing Cooper tell how much he hated his constant co-star. This information makes the film all the more powerful and heartbreaking at times. Otherwise, it is a wonderful adventure story, something that never goes out of style.  Also included on the DVD is the trailer for the film and a few short subjects including an early color short 
 The Klezmatics are a superior performing group for Klezmer music.  This is one of their best 
 The loss of a loved one can be overwhelming when grief sets in, but closure is brought to the mourner through customary funeral services.  However, when someone loses a beloved and the body of the loved one is not recovered there will never be true closure, which will leave the bereaved in somber doubt.  Thus, the perceptual concept, seeing is believing, is one of the fundamental keys to the story's melancholic atmosphere as the main character, Marie Drillon (Charlotte Rampling), drifts into a ghostlike world.  Under the Sand begins with Marie returning to south France with her husband Jean (Bruno Cremer) to their summer house where they spend every summer.  It is a vacation that they both look forward to as they can get away from the hectic city life.  The Drillon's keep a thoughtful silence between them as they go through the daily chores, which is only broken sporadically.  Apparently both enjoy silent contemplation and solitude, yet they harbor each others company with warmth and nurturing love.  The loving relationship between Marie and Jean takes a sudden turn as Marie wakes up from an afternoon nap under the Mediterranean sun.  Bewildered where her husband is she begins to search for him along the beach where he went swimming.  Panic begins to crawl upon her as she fears the worst as the coast guard cannot recover him.  Months later Marie has returned to her daily routine in the city where she lives and works.  Marie's friends attempt to find someone to woo her, but she continues as if Jean is still alive.  Marie buys her missing husband ties, talks to him before she goes to bed, and hugs him good night.  In essence, it seems like Marie uses an avoidance strategy to deal with the loss that drives her into a delusional state where she sees and believes that he is not gone.  Underneath the surface of what is depicted there are several issues that could have caused Marie to drift into a delusion due to why her husband disappeared.  It could be the moments when Marie and Jean sat in silence and never expressed their possible true thoughts, it could be a secret that Jean had, and he could have been simply bored with her and left.  However, she will never find out as he never left her a note or a message of what he did. Instead she is left in a cerebral no man's land where she question why, and if she had anything to do with his disappearance.  Franois Ozon's Under the Sand is an intelligent depiction of grief, loss, and the process of dealing with a lost one that never is recovered.  Ozon based the film on an event that took place by the ocean during his childhood.  In addition, Ozon researched grief and loss by interviewing psychologists and specialists in the field of grief and mourning, which is evident in the depth of the character's persona.  The film simply relies on Charlotte Rampling's performance, which is brilliant as it becomes an intricate character study of a characters grief and loss.  Under the Sand offers a wonderful cinematic experience, which is enhanced by Rampling's marvelous performance.  It is also Ozon's cinematic touch of minimalism that brings more to the screen than what is uttered.  This forces the viewers to dwell on what is illustrated on the screen as the silence influences the power of the image.  Ultimately, the film reinforces the notion that "seeing is believing" as the audience cannot see and does not know what to believe 
 I don't think I'll ever drive my Porsche as enthusiatically as the author has done, but I really enjoyed the explanations of the 911's abilities.  A good book for days when you can't get out in your own car 
 What is really good about this book is that it proposes a framework and then illustrates it with case studies. Aside from the thesis that a profit motive can be the driver for economic growth, improving the capabilities and lives of the poorest it also shows that developing economies does not equal low technological maturity or lack of opportunities to innovate with business models, distribution channels, product development or business processes.Having grown up and worked in India in the mid 90s it was clear that this kind of thinking and business models were not actively pursued.  However, the case studies suggest this has changed and in many ways as far as India is concerned this is visible by strong anecdotal evidence. Also in many ways there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that people have realised that the government will not solve all that makes doing business difficult and have been using this kind of thinking as a driver for entrepreneurial business which also have a positive impact on the people at the bottom of the pyramid.  Will The framework and ideas apply in all developing economies , specially with smaller populations ? This question is harder to answer and no doubt time will tell

 I'm so glad we bought this.  My youngest son (2 days from 2!) asks for "OooWa OOooWa!", his favourite part of "Walk Along the River".  His older brothers (6 and 8) dance and sing with him to the entire DVD which is a rare achievement.  My hubby and I have privately and jokingly cursed the catchiness of these tunes but are thrilled to have at least one disc our toddler will watch all the way through.  Only my mother-in-law is sad--she cannot believe The Laurie Berkner Band has only one DVD 
 A very well done and most interesting film on a very intelligent animal, the DOLPHIN. It is perfect. I'm buying copies to give to my friends 
 Elaine Morgan is always a very interesting and enjoyable read. Here she looks at evolution from the perspective of the fetus and the child and, as usual, presents us with plenty of information and questions about our evolution. The chapters are brief and together cover a wide range of issues. Towards the end of the book she, as would be expected, offers again the Aquatic Ape Theory as an answer to the questions raised. She also then discusses the changes in family structure and finally the needs of the child in a modern world where 'children have lost their evolutionary clout'.  (I must take issue with Stephen Haines' inane comment below about Morgan pandering to the 'FemiNazis' because she takes time to justify her use of 'he' to discuss the child. It is precisely this subsuming of all humans within 'man' and 'he' that has blinded us to to the fact that the majority of humans are females and children and without their perspectives we cannot have a genuine comprehension of human evolution. We often cannot tell if we are talking about the human 'he' or the male 'he' which are different concepts to deal with in our heads. The irony of Mr Haines' comment is that this very subsuming of the female is precisely what stirred Morgan into her research and writing. It may appear trivial but in reality using male terms almost always leads to half-truths in our thinking - as would naming, and therefore thinking about, all humans as 'American' would. I'm certain that few men would enjoy being addressed as 'she' and for humans to be 'woman'.)  'The Descent of the Child' is certainly an easy read suitable for the layperson while still presenting important questions that need to be addressed about our evolution. Though other books do present much more thorough information about eg sexual reproduction, Morgan is simply introducing another perspective that puts the spotlight again on how much still needs to be expained better. I would have preferred better referencing for some of the points she made but appreciate the thought-provoking writing she has pursued for decades 
 Although I have to acknowledge the wonderful use of language that Joyce displays in this work of fiction, I found that I had a great deal of trouble getting into it.  This is a coming of age story and perhaps it would hold more relevance for a male than it did for me.  There is some dispute as to whether or not this is an autobiographical story or not.  What is is a "stream-of-consciousness narrative" and it is a style that Joyce is credited with developing in his body of work.  The book centres around young Stephen, and his changing viewpoints as he grows up.  We see how an innocent' idealistic youth changes his ideas as he matures and as life happens to him.  It leads him to question his Catholicism  and his idea of family values.  The language is what is really beautiful about this story!  I had a bit of difficulty getting into the story, but felt that it was an important enough work to persevere 
 One of the best records of the 90s, and it only gets better with age. This is one of those albums that will be cited and referred to for many years to come. it's amazing there's still cheap used copies available. Get one now. This is the "Pet Sounds" of the 90s

 According to the author, the past twenty years have yielded much in the way of archaeological evidence about the ancient city of Troy, the Trojan War and the Late Bronze Age. This he makes clear in the introductory sections of this wonderful book. Using this new archaeological information, as well as ancient literary sources, especially Homer's Iliad, he reconstructs the story of the Trojan War - from beginning to end. Along the way, he points out which events are now known to have happened, which ones are plausible and could have happened and which ones are not likely to have happened. In some cases, he treats certain ancient descriptions of events that seem unlikely (if not impossible) if taken literally, as being plausible if one re-interprets the ancient texts using expert knowledge of the way ancient authors expressed themselves, e.g., a war lasting "ten years" may simply have meant a war that lasted "a long time". At the end of the book is a section entitled "A Note on Sources". This is an extensive twenty-one page bibliographical essay (i.e., with the author's commentary) that is priceless for someone wanting to read further. The writing style is clear, friendly, authoritative and quite gripping. To paraphrase the author, the more one learns about ancient Troy, Mycenae and the Late Bronze Age and the more one finds through archaeological excavations, the more one realizes that there is more truth and accuracy in Homer's writings than was thought in the past. I recommend this book to anyone, but especially to ancient history buffs 
 Being an avid Parents magazine subscriber, I turn through their pages every month searching for advice from parents across the country. It's almost like sitting in a room, sharing your best ideas with hundreds of  other parents. Although Parents magazine features this every month, it's  amazing that they've created an entire BOOK about this useful information.  At least one in five of these tips could work for you. Creativity from  around the nation combines into these pages to provide you with  unforgettable hints and tips to make parenting a LITTLE easier and more fun  for the kids. I've learned a lot in the past two years from just other  parents' advice and strategies. It also helps you stimulate alternative  ways of disciplining your children. I recommend this book to all parents  willing to learn a little more about themselves and their children. Instead  of arguing and cleaning up, you'll spend more quality time with the little  people you love 
 I read this book the first day it came out and couldn't put it down.  At last there's a manual explaining how men think.  
 The endocrine system is a complicated business. This book can be read by a student, or interested lay person, if only to get an overview of how the endocrine system works and when it fails to function properly. The reader can find out what diabetes and high cholesterol means. I was somewhat bothered by the detail. 
 A forerunner to Friends and a Brat Pack movie with the most...Brat Packers, St. Elmo's Fire was a romantic comedy that bowed out to theatres in 1985.  Seven of the eight stars were in the enviable "Brat Pack" group, young and precocious actors and actresses that were considered the best of the best of their generation.  While St. Elmo's Fire is often considered a mellow and almost overblown teen romcom by the starchiest of critics, it's a favorite of many 1980s film lovers.  Summary in 13 words:  Seven college graduates try and struggle with real life, some succeed, some don't.  DVD Details 2.35 Anamorphic Widescreen 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround (English), 2.0 Dolby Surround (Director's Commentary) English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Thai, Korean Subtitles Release Date: 1999 Single-Sided Single-Layered Disc  Suggested Retail Price: $14.99 Black Amaray Keepcase  Video and Audio  The video is remarkably clean.  The film was issued in the early years of DVD, when most transfers looked more like cable TV quality, but the video here is exceptional.  Presented in its original widescreen is always a good thing, and the print quality is great.  The colors are vibrant and accurate, and there's little to no grain or dust.  One minor complaint would be the main titles, in its unsettling red font, but other than that, the video is great.  Audio is offered in English, but the subtitles are in so many languages that if you wanted, you could learn Chinese by reading the film enough times.  It's pretty balanced in terms of dialogue vs. background noise/music.  Bonus Features  A commentary by Joel Schumacher is one of the many audio tracks given on this disc.  He does a pretty good job talking about making the movie, including various tidbits about the actors and the story (which he wrote).  The guy's pretty good with a microphone.  If only he could have done a commentary for his film The Phantom of the Opera in 2004.  A faded and dirt-filled 8-minute EPK about the making of the film is also presented, made at the time the film came out.  It has quick interviews with the cast and director, with a narrator talking during much of the behind the scenes footage.  Is it an exhaustive documentary?  No.  Is it a useless 8 minutes of your life taken away?  No.  It's pretty rewatchable, though a longer more substantial featurette would be welcoming.  "Man in Motion" is the music video that uses the St. Elmo's Fire theme with lyrics.  It's got a real 80s look to it, and features most of the cast as well as video clips from the film.  There are four trailers: St. Elmo's Fire, About Last Night, Groundhog Day, and Jerry Maguire.  The trailers for St. Elmo's Fire and About Last Night are not the best video-quality-wise, while Jerry Maguire is not the best movie-quality-wise.  Groundhog Day is okay for what it is.  There are also cast/director biographies and filmographies up until 2000.   Closing Thoughts  Perhaps the second best brat pack movie of the 80s (The Breakfast Club, of course, is THE best), St. Elmo's Fire is a wonderful "coming-of-age...now what?" kind of film that is best enjoyed in the company of your closest friends. 
 Version 7 installed without a hitch and has increased the productivity of my business because it also works much better than Version 5 
 The art work in this book is lovely and the writing is very nice but there is something about it that I find a little creepy.  As an adult I appreciate the book but some children may not 
 I will admit that I am perhaps viewing (listening to?) the record with a jaundiced eye (ear?), but as an occasional fan of Hootie and the Blowfish, it seems to me like this, of all their records, is the one that has aged with the least grace and comportment.  That's not to say that it's a terrible piece of music, but rather that, at this point in my life, it is almost never what I want to listen to.  Perhaps I should clarify.  This record is overplayed in ways that only truly abnormal cultural phenomenae can be overplayed.  This record is overplayed the same way that Stairway to Heaven (and pretty much all of Led Zeppelin IV) is overplayed on classic rock stations.  I was an adolescent in the nineties, and between listening to this music on the radio and listening to it on my own, I'm pretty much done with it.  That costs the record a star.  Well, not just that.  It's also not really the greatest musical adventure the group ever embarked upon.  It's good, but I'm frankly a bigger fan of Fairweather Johnson (as an album) or Musical Chairs (for individual songs).  But, buying recommendations are what we're here for.  If you're just a regular person looking for pretty much every Hootie and the Blowfish song you want, this is the record to get.  This is the one that launched the band, and the one from which most of their radio songs are still drawn.  And, truth be told, it's a solid record and a good addition to any collection.  If, however, you're looking for the best that the band's done to date (to the extent of my knowledge--I lost track of them during the hiatus after the failure of Musical Chairs), I'd go to Fairweather Johnson first.  If you don't like pop music at all, I'd steer clear entirely--you'll find nothing on this album to transform your opinion of the genre 
 I would put this in the top 5 Stephen King books. I loved that Flagg was in it. I read The Stand about 5 or 6 years before I read this, and it was nice to get a background on Flagg. I could not put this down. I also think this would make a great movie. 
 I knew while I was watching this film that I had to have the soundtrack.  What I didn't know was how difficult it would be to find it.  I wrote to Sony Pictures, and to the music reviewer of the LA Times (which gave the soundtrack a rave review), but no one answered my emails as to where I could buy the soundtrack. I finally found it at Amazon MarketPlace and I was just thrilled.  (It is, by the way, listed as an import.  From China, I guess.)  I love the music.  It's all delightful.  I want to say it is "hardy" and soft and surprising from track to track.    This is not the first time (by far) that I have tried, with no luck, to buy a soundtrack after having seen a movie... I wonder why this is?  Film distributors and studios don't want to sell soundtracks?  Ah well, I think they live in a world of their own anyway..... 
 This captured my interest from the very beginning.  It was entertaining, witty, with a good mystery and just a bit of the supernatural.  I have read the first two of her Darcy mysteries and have pre-ordered the third 
 Great book on different drawing techniques and the basics of perspective drawing as well as more advanced composition samples. The step-by-step instructions are easy to follow and create immediate results. In my opinion a good source for students to either acquire some sketching-skills or fresh up on the basics. Another great feature are the many sample-drawings of different drawing styles. The only draw-back is that the drawings are being too much reduced from their original size. But if you take the time to scan the ones you are particulary interested in and get them back to a decent size, you will get a lot out of this book. "All in all": a valuable source in my opinion 
 This may be the most action-packed book I have ever read.   This novel follows about a 48-hour period in the life of US Marine Lt. Shane "Scarecrow" Schofield and his Recon team as they answer an abbreviated call for help from a US Antarctic research station "...our divers said they saw a spacecraft of some sort...and now we've lost contact with them!  The last we heard...they were under attack in the water..."  Schofield (along with the reader) plunges headlong into an unknown situation that involves espionage, treason, killer whales, murder, international warfare, exploding glaciers...  This book was written to be enjoyed and it is fun!  The action is fast, creative, and varied. On his website author Matt Reilly comments that he wrote this book with an action movie in mind, but without having the limitations of a budget.    This is not a work of literary merit; don't look for character development or subtle use of metaphor.  However, if you're looking for a fun, action intense, leave-on-the-airplane novel, this is it.  
 It is very dissapointing that VH1 format allows less than an hour (10 songs at the most). We own Rod Stewart, The Doors & Meatloaf concerts as well and same thing!   Many great songs were left out. Thought that comments behind songs were to be a bit more extensive. Great interpretation. Great edition. Great buy for a Sarah fan 
 I recently returned from 5 days in London - no tour group, no guides, and no prior knowledge of the city.  Not wanting to carry around a large guidebook, I took this mapguide with me each day.  It was absolutely essential!  Everything from restaurants to tube stops is well-labeled and easy to decipher.  It fit right into the side pocket of my small, over the shoulder purse and was easily tucked away when I didn't need it.  I love to "get lost" in the small side streets and when I did need to find my way back to the main roads, it was simple to see where I was.  Quite frankly, this was as essential to my trip as my passport!  Don't leave home without it 
  As an intermediate photographer I found this dvd very enjoyable. Its packed with useful information, geared primarily towards the beginner to intermediate photograper. Jim keeps the terminology very simple and his instructions are easy to follow and understand. He covers many aspects of Photography from composition, lighting, locations, as well as camera functions, etc. And he doesn't overwhelm you with technical jargon.  All in all, a nice dvd for anyone looking to improve their photography. And even for advanced photographers, it could serve as a nice refresher course. I would also recommend his book 'The BetterPhoto Guide to Digital Photography' as many of the subjects and pictures from the dvd are included in more detail 
 I first heard Ave Maria(Deep Forest) a few weeks ago. Liking what I heard I searched for more on them. I was led to the World Christmas CD. When I had an opertunity to hear the entire CD I fell in love with every song there. Most of these artists I had never heard before. Believe me they do the songs justice. I would recommend the CD to all my friends.Even though I had a hard time finding it, I kept up the search until I did. I put in my order right away for fear of the CD being sold out quickly. Now I eagerly anticipate the delivery so that I can start listening 
 A friend/co-worker actually gave me this book.  She knew that I was stressed at work among other things going on in my life. What a wonderful gift to receive. I so enjoyed reading this book. No matter how stressed you are, how bad you think you have it or how anxious you are, there is a way to come out of it. In this book Dave points that out, he actually gives examples of his own life and what he did to overcome the obstacles in his life. Just knowing what this guy went through in his childhood and has the courage to share this with others. I have a great respect for him.  If you think your life is bad, you have tons of problems you can't possibly overcome then read this book 
 I'm a fly fisher who has fished (both fly and conventional) many of the streams and lakes (as well as the ocean) in Southern California for the last twenty six years. I've looked at many guide and how to books only to put them down, realizing that what I'm holding was not "definitive."  But Shaffer's book is definitive, and more importantly, it is very practical.  All of the essential items are in each of his entries, and the information is very up-to-date. Also, there are phone numbers, maps, directions, and other important pieces of data.    I was talking to a friend of mine of some of the places I had fished and camped at as a child, but I couldn't remember the names of these specific places--only the locations.  I very badly wanted to go back, but I couldn't find the information on the Internet.  As I perused this book, I found the stream in this book.  It was easy because it goes by region or area.    It also gives some tactics for dealing with certain streams and lakes.  Once again, the information is very up-to-date and practical.    Overall, I was very satisfied with this book and would recommend it to anyone who wants to fish Southern California.   
 There is probably not much more I can add in praise of this book. This book was actually given to me by my boyfriend at the time about 9 years ago. Thus began my love affair with Kevyn Aucoin. This book taught me the basics and much more. If you are a makeup lover this is a must have 
 If you are in graduate school and decide to do your thesis as a qualitative research project, I would highly recommend this book.  Even though the authors describe what qualitative research is, I would recommend that you read one of the texts they mention for the individual techniques. For example, even though it has a nice overview of case study, one should read Yin's book on case study research 
 Just finished the three movies in a row, and there are no regrets! This DVD is fun, and more: there are nice extras including an almost finished crazed strip act, trailers, picture gallery and all, and three flicks well presented. The picture/sound quality is not at all as bad as I suspected, in fact some "quality" classics can be found released in much inferior quality. And the movies... they are great, and if you love the atmosphere of the thirties, these films, especially watched late night, give you the wonderful feeling of really attending a wild party, even without actual reefer involved. Whereas "Marihuana" is really stupid and "Reefer Madness" beautifully overblown, "Assassin of youth" is actually quite grasping. All films involve some pretty people, posh clothes and wild lindyhop. What more to be desired?? 
 I am an avid reader of all types of books, fiction and non-fiction. This is by far, one of the best books I have read in a long time. The author did her research well and wasted not a word. This book is a bittersweet story of life. I didn't want it to end 
 I've reviewed many books for both my site and Amazon and this one is a real gem. I was a little skeptical at first but the recipes were great. The food tasted delicious when we took it on our trips.   Granted this book requires a dehydrator and a bit of work at home but it is well worth it when you can sink your teeth into a great meal on the 10th day of a wilderness trip.   Linda Fredrick Yaffe is an inspiration in the wildernes kitchen and this is a must have for not only the backpacker's bookshelf but for the canoeist's as well. 
 This is by far the best book I have ever read.  Ossie Davis says early in the text that his first love is writing.  As a professional writer, I am amazed at the depth of his thoughts and eloquence with which he puts them  together.  Davis and Dee's memoirs are less like reading than enjoying a  glorious symphony of essence of life.  This is a must read for anyone who  loves the English language 
 Gogol Bordello is hot right now, with their raucous, wild gypsy punk music and rousing concerts. But they started off a bit more low-key with their debut, "Voi-La Intruder," which relies more heavily on the gypsy part of their music than the punk-rocker aspect. Still, it's a dancey, wild album with their current persona creeping up under the table...   It kicks off with a traditional-sounding klezmer tune that slowly turns into a dancier klezmer tune, with frontman Eugene Hutz sounding as dignified as he can. At the start, that is. When he starts with the chorus ("My DARLIN'/DARLIN'/my sacred darlin'!"), he starts soundng like his usual wild self.   The traditional East-Euro-folk sound continues throughout the album, with the frenetic patchwork "Voi-La Intruder," the urgent tight-paced "Greencard Husband," and their biggest hit to date: "Start Wearing Purple," a schizophrenic little delight. It sounds a bit different from the version on their most recent album "Gypsy Punks: Underdog World Strike."   They even dabble in acoustic balladry, with the plaintive "Mussolini Vs. Stalin," which ends with a mournful chorus of voices that all sound like Hutz. But as folky as this is, we start to see the punk elements that make up half their music right now -- there are hints of it in the snarly lyrics about women impregnated by "Unvisible Zedd," and the wild electric guitar of "Letter to Castro."   Basically this album -- which reportedly had a different lineup -- relies heavily on Eastern European folk and pop, rather than the wild punk sound they have now. More gypsy than punk, more folk than rock -- and surprisingly it isn't any less appealing from a musical standpoint.   Call it klezmer with a twist. Gogol Bordello packs it up with thuddy percussion, accordions, and some very restrained electric guitar. In songs like "Letter to Mother," it sounds like it's aching to explode into a rock song, but instead it sticks to being spirited traditional music. You can see how gypsy punk grew out of this sound.   Eugene Hutz does both vocal styles here. He does the raucous punk howls about half the time, as he wails bizarre lyrics like "Start wearin' purple/wearin purple... all your sanity and wits/they will all vanish/I promise/it's just a matter of time." But he has a very pleasant singing voice as well, as shown in the grand finale, the folky "Against the Nature."   Gogol Bordello sounded quite different when they debuted with "Voi-La Intruder," but there are hints of what they would become. An interesting and pleasant album 
 -gave this as a Christmas gift to my brother-in-law, a church musician. He has listened over & over & thinks it is really outstanding. Thank you 
 I believe Audie Murphy was a true leader and set an example for us.  I am a woman and have been taught a great lesson in humility from this man.  He did not consider himself to be great, but just did what he had to do. Others recognized his greatness, and honored him. Audie Murphy spoke of those fighting by his side and honored them in his book.   My Father taught me about Audie Murphy as a child and spoke most highly of him.  My Father also fought in WW11, as a gunner and radio man in the U.S. Navy along with four of his brothers that fought in the Army,and Merchant Marines.  My Father gave true praise to Audie.  It is a great book and should be read.

 Consider yourself an Iggy/Stooges fan? If so, then you MUST own a copy of this. The 1st disc is a great remaster of that fine, fine album with loads of clarity and punch.  The 2nd disc is a selection of previously unreleased outtakes and alternate versions. Worth the price of admission alone is the almost 7 minute version of `No Fun'. And what a great version it is, too 
 This was one of the most inspiring books I've ever read.  After speaking to many people about what good "adventure" books they'd read, many people recommended this one.  I was impressed...  The author is very good at putting the reader on the deck of the boat and really getting the reader involved with the story.  It's hard to imagine sailing around the world much less doing it alone.  I forgot I was reading non-fiction at times.  I couldn't put the book down and recommend it as required reading for anyone of you adventure seekers out there 
 I felt that the book was basically the same as the previous edition, with the exception of aromatherapy, and electric filing.  Unfortionatly no one book can give all of the information that is required about a subject.  That is what teaching is all about.  I generally supplement the material from other books, and Florida law so our students stay on the right path.  Over all I would have to say that this book was above average, and addressed many of the changes in the industry to date 
 Tom Robbins is an oddball. His books are fantastic and original but cater to the hungry reader.  You must work a bit and enjoy irreverence.  After all, most of the main characters are animate inanimates; a can, a stick, a conch shell and a well worn sock.    This novel is a bit pedantic but thats because I'm not as talented. 
 I think this book covers the topic of risk adequately.  I got it last year and finally got around to reading it this week.  If I had to buy it today I would probably pass, at $55 its twice what I paid for it in November.  Someone must really like it?  I read this book to further refine my risk strategies.  What I found was a book that explained risk in detail, but did not seem to offer me much in the way of finetuning my system.  Although it did give me more confidence in my system and confirmed to myself that I am on the right road.  I liked the story of one risk manager from the book.  This person had pages and pages of complex mathematical formulas to arrive at his funds risk levels.  But if you turned over the page it said "equals five percent".  LOL.  So my 5% risk strategy has been correct all this time and I didn't have to use a Cray supercomputer to arrive at that number!  If you are new to risk assesment or need to figure out complex hedging risk strategies this is a good book.  If you have a pretty good understanding of risk already, you may want to pass on this book 
 Every once in a very long while, I am privileged to read a novel that is so compelling, so breathtaking and so utterly absorbing that I find myself holding my breath in awe as I turn the final page. "One Thousand White Women" is one of those novels!  In 1854 at a peace conference held at Fort Laramie, a prominent Cheyenne chief had the temerity (or so the white US Army negotiators thought) to request the gift of one thousand white women as brides for his warriors. Coming from the perspective of a man in a matrilineal society in which all children born belong to their mother's tribe, it seemed to be the perfect solution to the integration of white and native people, society and culture. In fact, white society of the day was appalled at the suggestion and the peace talks collapsed. This novel explores, in fiction, how events might have unfolded had the government acceded to the request and what the lives of the volunteer white brides might have been like in an aboriginal Cheyenne society that knew they were facing possible genocidal extinction in an unwelcoming modern world!  Fergus has done a positively masterful job crafting a fast-paced novel that could be read purely on the surface as a wonderful period piece in the 19th century American West! You'll find it all here - romance, knee-slapping humour, outrageous stereotypes, credible dialogue, a magnificent cast of wildly disparate characters, pathos, sex, violence, guns, battles, bravery and derring-do, political bafflegab and adventure! But even a moment's pause will furrow more thinking readers' foreheads as they question their stance on a wide array of socially and politically charged issues that persist even to this day - racially mixed marriages; men's roles vs women's roles in both modern and nomadic hunter-gatherer societies; homosexuality; charges of pedophilia in Catholic and Christian ministry; the efficacy (or even validity) of overly zealous Christian missionaries in pagan societies; the current status of aboriginals in modern society; the perennial flouting of treaties between white and aboriginal society negotiated in good faith; the demise of aboriginal language; the forced placement of aboriginal people into reservations, white settlements and parochial schools; and so very many more.  "Must read" is a term far too loosely bandied about in this era of marketing of blockbuster best sellers but I put it to those who enjoy historical fiction that "One Thousand White Women" easily earns it! (I'm willing to lay odds that more than one reader will find themselves teary-eyed at the close of this novel).  Paul Weis 
      I say "unedited" because this is the score as it was recorded in the studio, not how it was heard in the movie. As the 2 disc edition of Aliens explains, there were difficulties with scoring this film as "both director and composer didn't know how to deal with composers and directors". However, both composer and director have proven to have learned this necessary skill as was seen (and heard) in Cameron/Horner's Titanic.       This is actually quite an accomplishment for having been composed in a matter of weeks (two or three if I remember correctly). The score has some nice quiet, atmospheric cues, as well as some very hard, action cues. The booklet that comes with the CD is a detailed account of the score in relation to the film and how the score was re-edited almost completely to fit with the director's vision of the film. I personally couldn't really tell that this was different from the film, but I haven't methodically compared the two. Very good score for Horner's second ever. Great CD to compliment the music of an incredible film. 
 As soon as it was announced that a new, Hollywood version of "The Chronicles of Narnia" would be released, I said to myself, "I should write a book called, 'Christ in the Chronicles.'" Well, Christin Ditchfield beat me to it, and I'm glad that she did. As her main title suggests ("A Family Guide to Narnia"), Ditchfield focuses her insights on a level that will "make sense" to Narnia fans of all ages--especially children and young teens.   Whereas some reviewers, therefore, interpret her interpretations as shallow, I find them appropriate given her focus--a family-friendly reading of "The Chronicles." Other reviewers find her interpretations a tad parochial. Again, the subtitle and the publisher of choice, easily explain that "feel." Ditchfield is writing an Evangelical analysis of "Biblical Truth in C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia." Yes, the truths could have been deeper, and yes, some of the interpretations may stretch Lewis' original intent, but none are outside the bounds of Lewis' own belief system.  Others may debate how much Christian imagery Lewis intended. He and his fellow "Inklings" writer, J. R. R. Tolkien, both wrote from a Christian world-view--Tolkien's being Catholic and Lewis' being Protestant. Tolkien, in several places, emphasized that he was not trying to make theological comments in every character and every event. Rather, he was writing a broad morality tale about good and evil and the ongoing battle between them. And an entertaining, captivating one, at that.  Lewis also, being a true linguist, tended to downplay plot-by-plot and character-by-character spiritualization. However, it is clear from his own writings and from any fair read of "The Chronicles of Narnia," that his Christian world-view flowed through every word he wrote.  Christin Ditchfield has beautifully, if simply (but not at all simplistically), drawn out the spiritual messages as she sees them through her Evangelical grid. She's done so in such a way that families can discuss them together, forming their own opinions and drawing their own conclusions, while enjoying the story and the message and meaning behind it.  Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of "Soul Physicians" and "Spiritual Friends." 
 This book keeps you guessing as to what will happen next.  As good writers do there are twists and turns, which makes it all the more exciting.  It has it all: innocent man in prison for 25 yrs, behind the scenes of the Supreme court, inner workings of an ex-cop's mind, they are all there plus more.  This is a book you will not be able to put down 
 I absolutely love this popper.  It makes the best popcorn I have ever eaten.  And the flavor is just like Theatre popcorn.  It is easy to use and pops up the corn very fast and is easy to clean.  I would recommend this product to anyone who likes popcorn. I will never go back to microwave popcorn again!!! 
 I saw the feature length version of this film in the theater, then purchased this special edition.  The special edition has extra interviews with various experts.  It was really informative.  As with the movie itself, you probably have to watch the extras twice to absorb all the information 
 Lets see, we gay guys (sorry lesbians, it's mainly about the guys here) have been responsible for most of the asthetically pleasing and fun aspects of what otherwise might have been a world destined to drabness. It's nice to read a book that not only lays out the comprehesive contributions to civilization that gay guys have made, but also is a fun read by no other than a gay man's favorite friend, the proud, and in this case, self-proclaimed fag hag.   I love this book, Cathy tells it like it is and is proud of her relationships with her gay friends. Hmmm, reminds me of some people I know. And believe me, we gay guys truly do love our fag hag friends, who else "gets" the progresive ideas in language, design, and fabulousness - not to mention appreciate the campy gossip that we gay men of so oft known for. Plus in return we get that most important of input, the female perspective. Of course fag hags and faggots alike both appreciate the non-sexual male-female realtionship that only we really have.   From gay speak to gay food we pioneered the most civlized trends. No, I didn't metion fashion, why would I, everyone KNOWS gay men have locked up the fashion world for years.   Anyway, I am having a grand time reading it and feeling ever so prideful 
 One of the best and most delightful books I've read this year (2006). Farrington has it just right and I was rather convinced that he was a religious, but evidently not. I did have a problem with the monk explaining in a letter to his former superior what the Bible related about Mary and Martha, I mean, REALLY! While I understand the device, it was pretty silly. I don't know how else he could have done it, but had I been his editor (of which I'm very capable), I'd'a called him on it. Moreover, he had a bride walking toward her groom to Mendelssohn, which is a recessional, brides marching TO Wagner. Not only that, but it wasn't so long ago that there was no music permitted in church that wasn't WRITTEN expressly for the church. No matter, NO ONE would walk up the aisle to the exhuberant strains of A Midsummer Night's Dream, really, one would have to skip 
 The excellent Universal Music Group GOLD series continues with this great collection of classic cuts by Gladys Knight & The Pips.  What makes this compilation so special is that it contains all but three of the group's top-20 r&b hits (the three not on this collection are 1968's "Didn't You Know You Have To Cry Sometime" and "I Wish It Would Rain", and 1978's "It's A Better Than Good Time").  With improved sound and always great liner notes, GOLD is definitely the perfect introduction to this legendary group 
 This was an enjoyable book.  It communicates the general gist of militatry development of the era, illustrated by four blow-by-blow accounts of obscure but interesting battles.  This is no tome of historical reference  data, but a fun bit of historical storytelling 
 When Karen wakes up on Saturday morning her sister Kristy comes in her room upstairs.She left her new jeans at her mommy's house.Karen checks the ceral box to see if there is a surprise then she gets in a fight with her  friend Hannie Papadakis.Then she punished for 10 minutes and she askes for  a Cherry ice-cream 
 The book is good, but I would have loved to have more in depth study. Perhaps some day the biography of this director will com 
 A thoroughly enjoyable story told through the eyes of Rebecca, and three generations of her dysfunctional, albeit loving family. Family secrets abound in Rebecca's tale; a witty, humourous story rife with 70's and 80's nostalgia and some very memorable characters.  Rebecca's search for passion and meaning in her life is well worth a read.  She is sometimes a rather hapless character, and her cold fish of a husband is totally annoying, but Rebecca will ultimately find what she needs most in some very untraditional and wonderful ways.  
 Yes, I must admit Cooler's Revenge was better.  But this movie was still excellent, even if you haven't seen CR.  The story is as follows: New Namek is assaulted by a giant mechanical orb called the Big Gete Star.  Goku and friends arrive to stop the destruction of the planet, and ultimately have to face Cooler (Meta-Cooler), who has been resurrected as the alter-ego of the Gete Star's mainframe.  I'd admit the whole thing of Cooler's resurrection is kinda cheesy, but nevertheless he's really badass, having this symbiotic relationship with a seemingly indestructible computer.  The fight scenes are awesome, although I refuse to believe that Piccolo can survive having several barrels of machine gun fire directly into his head.  I mean, he is a Z-Fighter, and therefore can take minimal damage by sheer will power, but even that scene I find over-the-top . . . then again, it is DBZ.  Best of all is Vegeta's surprise appearance while Goku fights Meta-Cooler.  Without Vegeta's assistance, Cooler would've on hands down--which reminds me: this one has one of the most unusual and inventive villain-defeats ever, although I won't spoil it for you.  In short, this Dragonball Z feature is superb, and sadly underrated.  Peace 
 At last!  A Latin Dictionary with print big enough to read using bifocals!!!  The scholarship of this work is unquestioned, as is its comprehensive character.  No more looking in vain for some elusive term.  Others have commented fully on the substantive wonders of this magnificent dictionary.  I write only to add that this work is very accessible--even to those of us with tired old eyes.  I know it is costly, but it is well worth the price 
 With a bit of trepidation one buys a tribute album because generally the cover performances pale to the originals. With that said, most of the artists on this disc turn in fine readings of these classic Joe South songs.However, the Otis Clay version of "Walk A Mile In My Soes" is something else: he not only beats Elvis Presley's version but also tops Joe's.  It is that incredible!. Also, I give high praise to the performances of "Down In The Boondocks" "Hush" and "The Greatest Love" . The sound quality of this compact disc is stellar and there is some nice linear notes.However, they fail to mention anything about what Joe South is currently up to (just a nit pick). Thanks to the artists and the producers for putting this wonderful project out 
 I have a large laptop Toshiba qosimo and had no luck locally to find a case to carry it in. The description of the Targus case was accurate to the letter and accomidated my laptop, allowing me to take it on trips. For luggage, it totally fulfilled my objectives. I easily recommend it to others with wide laptop computers. 
 After you have read all 20 1/2 of the Aubrey Maturin Series, read this book and Unknown Shore for more O'Bria 
 I just read the third John Rain Novel, having read #4 out of order. Certainly one of the best. Rain is the assassin born of an Asian father and a Caucasion mother. He goes to Vietnam where his deception and killing skills are heightened as he goes on LRRPs, long range reconnaissance patrols. His despair at what he does is also heightened.   There is a nice play on his being caught between two worlds, which at first it may seem that Mr. Eisler is talking about Japan and the US. But I submit that like his character, it is Barry Eisler's 'feint' to hide from us from the fact that all of John Rain's life is a duality, a struggle between one precept juxtaposed against another.  He is caught between two worlds but maybe they are violence and peace, trust and cynicism, the need to love and yet the need to walk away from it, the need to be with someone (Midori, Naomi, Delilah), and the need to be alone.  John Rain is intriguing but there are other intriguing 'men with no name' (to paraphrase a Clint Eastwood movie) like Hawk from the Spenser series or Jack Reacher or Joe Pike or Luther Ewing.   The difference for me is Eisler's writing, which may be the best at this genre today, and getting better. The sounds of the street, the posturing not of the prostitutes but of the middle-aged business men trying to catch the deceased breath of their youth, the smells of coffee, the trees, the leaves, the whitecaps, that's the canvas that we meet Rain on.   Here we meet Dox, the disenfranchised Marine sniper he met in 'stan, and the lovely Mossad agent, Delilah. What a great biblical name for Mr. Rain to fall in love with! Excellent work. 5 stars.

 311's albums are really hit-or-miss. Soundsystem and Transistor and the only two I can think of offhand that are really worth listening to all the way though. Their older stuff is much too rap-oriented for my tastes and their newer stuff sounds like your typical homogenized radio-friendly rock; maybe a little better than average, but nothing very exciting. Despite all this, they really have written some great songs, enough to put together a solid, classic album.   This is that album. Not all of the good stuff is on here (I personally miss "Rub-a-Dub" and "Freeze Time"), but there's still a quality selection that represents their career perfectly well. All three singles from the Blue Album are on this, as is "Flowing," which is one of the finest pop songs I've heard. The album does tend to lean towards songs released as singles, but it's perfectly fine with me if it does that; this is a greatest hits album after all. All in all, you get a good taste of everything 311's done so far and absolutely no filler. Perhaps that's what makes this album such a great listen; absolutely nothing on it is bad. As I said before, most 311 albums aren't best taken as a whole, so with a stronger collection of songs, the band is able to soar without overstaying their welcome.   If you're a long-time fan, you can skip this. However, if you just want a bit of 311, this is a great one-stop compilation. Ranks with Jar of Flies by Alice in Chains as one of the few "greatest hits" albums I actually like. Essential listening. 
 This book does a good job at covering many aspects of the conure family.  Detailed are the different species, thoughts about purchasing and housing consideration, daily maintenance and basic behavior modifications.  If you're thinking about obtaining a conure or general information, this is a great 1st read 
 This book is more dictionary, than actual hands on. Also this book is geared to the small business owner (schedule C) or possbile S corp. I was looking for more corporate accounting (C Corp). What you learn is all the most popular accounts to set up. If you already have some basic and immed. knowledge, then this book is more a refresher to you. More likely, I would have my future employees read through it. This way they can understand the basics. Overall, not a bad book, though not for me 
 I bought this book at least 10 years ago (maybe 12), and have found it wonderfully useful for advice and information whenever I'm foolish enough to try & live out my dream of writing a novel. It's a very entertaining read in and of itself, and is useful for anyone trying to write ANYTHING, not just fiction; I certainly found the advice helpful when engaged in academic writing (I've published several articles and a book)! Block's humour and common sense help make _Telling Lies for Fun & Profit_ a real friend in times of difficulty, especially when the (troubling kind of) writer's block hits 
 Vakama is a cool toy and I love it. 
 Overall, this is a pretty good cookbook.  The recipes include common vegetarian favorites as well as more creative dishes.  We have tried several recipes from this book, and they have all been good.  That being said, several of the recipes are very time consuming or involve steps that could be eliminated.  For example, a couple of recipes call for various veggies to be sauteed separately, then combined.  I'm sure there's a good reason for that, but I just don't have a lot of time to prepare dinner each evening. With some of the recipes, I have cut corners or made substitutions to save time and the results have been good.  Also, the book is lacking in photographs or illustrations, so if a process or dish is new to you, the instructions can be a bit confusing.  This cookbook is not for the beginning vegetarian cook, but does provide some inspiration for someone more experienced.  
 Wonderful writing style, not hard to understand explains most catholic beliefs and is a bullseye buy 
 I've had this Whistler for about a week now and it works great. I have been using a $300.00 escort for years but I wanted a new one and they are still over $300.00. Every other high technology item has gone down about 80% over the years except Escort and Passport detectors! I figured the other brand names should have caught up by now and so far, so good. The voice alert is very nice so I dont have to look at the display to see what type of signal is detected. The city mode has worked for me very well as on my daily drive there is usually radar being used and it warned me each time. The cheaper ones usually go off too much but this one seems to do a good job. It alerts to X band, which is the one used by door openers, but only alerts again if it gets stronger. You can also turn off that band alltogether but I leave it on as some older radar guns still use it. These settings are all adjustable in the city modes. The unit is small, which I like, and has a suction cup bracket for the windshield. It also shows up to 60 different text messages on the display if there is a road hazard or traffic jam and you are in an area with that broadcast signal, but I have'nt seen any messages yet (luckily). I give it 2 thumbs up 
 THE RIVAL 8550-X 5-QUART WOODEN ELECTRIC ICE CREAM MAKER WORKS VERY WELL AND IS REASONABLY PRICED.  I TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT FOR THE HOME 
 You have to give credit to the Dog Brothers for bringing realism to the stick-fighting arts. This video features numerous full-contact stick fights between fighters wearing minimal protection and different skill levels and approaches, all skilfully narrated by Eric ("Top Dog") Knaus. Knaus spins a running commentary throughout each fight, pointing out the important aspects of each fighter's techique, whether it's working or not, and any problems or mistakes. Interspersed with the fights are brief interviews with the fighters themselves, discussing what it was like to fight, get hit, and survive. Knaus is in several of the fights himself and as the senior instructor you can see the difference between his level of skill and technique and the less skilled fighters, but the quality of the participants is overall pretty good, I would say. This video shows that the basics are what count in a real fight, and that the fancier and more elaborate techniques such as double-stick normal and reverse figure-eights are easily counterable if you know what to do. The other thing I noticed is the complete absence of passing maneuvers. Apparently these just don't work that well in a real fight, despite many teachers who still teach complete systems of passing techniques. All in all a very practical, educational, and interesting addition to your stick-fighting video library. By the way, the style of stick fighting in this video is Indonesian Pekiti Tersia, not Escrima, Arnis, or Kali, but it's very similar to those arts, and Knaus mentions they've also incorporated elements of the Filipino arts into their style, such as the Ilustrisimo cross-step. I also have Christopher Ricketts and Reynaldo Galang's four- video set on Kali Ilustrisimo and they're also excellent videos on this originally southern-island Filipino art. I especially liked their coverage not only of the special flow drills and stick techniques, but also of the Lingua de Fuego ("Tongue of Fire") knife-fighting kata and its applications 
 I have a 16 mo. old Border Collie that likes to bark for any or no reason at all.  At first try of the Citronella spray (used with the Gentle Spray Bark collar) she became somewhat anxious & frantic not knowing where this spray was coming from.  But after about 3 or 4 uses, she adapted & realized what this collar was for.  Overall, the spray works 75% of the time with my dog.  If she is determined to bark, she will; but most of the time the spray is a deterent.  Amazon is the only place I would buy the refills due to it being the best bargin around.  Don't buy it at your pet store because you will be paying way too much 
 Harry Bosch is a detective working for LAPD's Open Unsolved Unit. Marie Gesto's 1996 disappearance, a case to which Bosch was assigned when he was in Homicide, was never solved. Her clothes were found neatly folded on the front seat of an abandoned car parked in the garage of a vacant luxury apartment but her body was never recovered and the case has eaten at Bosch ever since. Thirteen years later, Raynard Waits was pulled over in his van in the early morning hours in Echo Park but the traffic stop turned out to be far from routine. The officers discovered two trash bags in the van that contained the dismembered body parts of two women. In an effort to avoid the death penalty, Waits and his lawyer, Maurice Swann, negotiate a deal with the prosecuting attorney, Rick O'Shea, in which Waits confesses to nine murders including Marie Gesto's and promises to lead the police to the location of her long buried body.  But every good detective knows that the devil is in the details and there are a few things about Waits' story and the structure of the deal that just don't ring true for Bosch. So despite all evidence to the contrary, Bosch persists in the investigation, gets in a lot of faces and takes us on an amazing roller coaster ride to the astonishing solution that has avoided his grasp for so many years.  Echo Park is a brilliant piece of literary craftsmanship that isn't so much thriller as hard-core, rock solid police procedural - gritty, sweaty, dynamic, realistic, fast-paced, exciting, political and filled to the brim with a wealth of informative detail. But, make no mistake about it, the plot is still a hard-driving page turner and doesn't let up for a single page from start to finish. An old acquaintance and working colleague, FBI agent Rachel Walling, provides Bosch with expertise in psychological profiling and fleshes out Connelly's story with a romantic twist that ends in a much more down to earth fashion than we've come to expect from more run-of-the-mill novels.   Congratulations to Michael Connelly! He seems to be moving from strength to strength. The Lincoln Lawyer was outstanding, Echo Park was superb and there's certainly no indication that his momentum is flagging!  Paul Weis 
 This was a good workbook.  It was like being with your own personal pyschologist helping you figure out why you drink and what different methods there are out there to stop.  I liked it so much I got one for someone else too 
 This Cd is among Zakk's best. It continues the Black Sabbath legacy while establishing new directions for Iommi and Rhodes' heir 
 I just bought "Prime Cuts" and "Rapture of the Deep" by Deep Purple (featuring Morse on guitar). Both albums are enjoyable in different ways. "Prime Cuts" shows off Steve's guitar work on this instrumental disc. "Rapture of the Deep" shows Steve blending in with the other musicians of Deep Purple. A powerful rock album.  "Prime Cuts" = 4 1/2 stars "Rapture of the Deep" = 5 stars 
 This is one of the best books written in Psychology and is often overlooked my many people in the field.  It was last revised in 1970 and it is still a classic in the field.  If you want to see "future" projections of what is it is to be human, read this book.  The man was a genius 
 An established star in the firmament of dark psychological suspense, British author Walters has won numerous awards ('The Ice House,' 'The Sculptress,' 'The Scold's Bridle'). This 1996 thriller opens with Jinx Kingsley, fashion photographer and only daughter of self-made millionaire Adam Kingsley, hospitalized and amnesiac after a horrific car accident. A suicide attempt is suspected, particularly since she was earlier found unconscious in her garage with the car running - apparently despondent because her fiance had absconded with her best friend.  Only Jinx didn't like her fiance all that well. She was on the verge of breaking up with him herself, even claims she had done so, although the accident came after a week at her parents', making wedding plans. Then two bodies, a man and woman, are discovered. And police discover Jinx's first husand was murdered.  Meanwhile Jinx's father has had her moved to a sanitarium where she is having a strong effect on her doctor, Alan Protheroe. By turns prickly, manipulative and vulnerable, Jinx becomes a suspect. As does her father, a forceful, unseen presence whose ruthlessness is legend.  Walters keeps the sands of perception shifting. In common with the other characters, the reader's view of Jinx is ambiguous. Her memory returns (or seems to) in painful flashes as the police piece together a skewed picture of greed, betrayal and sexual obsession. An aura of mystery and menace shrouds Jinx's dysfunctional family, suspicion corroding the bonds between them. Walter's writing is literate, character driven and atmospheric, making comparisons - and favorable ones at that - with Ruth Rendell inevitable 
 Fine, fine, fine. If you own no other New Orleans music, own this 
 'A Thief of Time' was Hillerman's 'breakout' book and led to numerous awards, although by the time the book was first printed in 1988 Hillerman had been writing his Leaphorn and Chee Navajo adventure mystery novels for some 18 years.   This tale takes Leaphorn and Chee into the field work of anthropology and archaeology, as well as the shadowy world of 'pot' collectors. The desire to make a breakthrough and the wide availability of off-limits ruins can be too much for some experts to resist.  Hillerman's stories are just a very comfortable read. An interesting mix of history and Indian culture with a good msytery and a bit of adventure. Some of Hillerman's other award-winning books are 'Skinwalkers'(1986) winner of the Western Writers of America Spur Award, 'Dance Hall of the Dead' (1973) winner of the Edgar Award for the Best Mystery Novel of the West, and 'The Blessing Way' (1970)a finalist for the Best First Novel Edgar Award.   Highly recommended for fans of mystery, adventure, and Westerns

 Most people never think about the unavoidable tradeoffs involved in ameliorating social problems.  With opportunity costs in mind, may we must dedicate ourselves to a better world.  I have two respectful criticisms:  1.  If people focused only on the problems that we could do most to solve then that would reduce the pressure to solve problems.  However rational it might seem to shift all foreign aid from funding education to funding AIDS prevention, the result would probably be less total aid.  The way politics works, one big problem is sometimes treated less seriously than two problems that are half as big.  2.  It is difficult to quantify any of these problems, but some of them, like global warming, are much harder to quantify.  The "worst case scenario," unlikely as it may be, has the potential to do such incredible damage, that we need to act on it.  Reducing global warming might be conceived of as an insurance policy, whereas preventing AIDS is more likely an investment in mutual funds 
 I was very surprised by some of comments by those who gave negative reviews. This is a comedy and it was meant to be over the top. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Unfortunately, many of us have met folks who approach both ends of the spectrum presented by the two main characters. This fact and similar stereotypes are what make these two caricatures so funny. My wife and I were rolling during several of the scenes. Better than some LDS movies (RM, It's Latter-day Night), nearly as good as others (God's Army, Singles Ward, Saints and Soldiers), it's worth a view if you want to have a good laugh 
 A problem well-described is a problem half-solved. But only half solved! Bob Slocum's problems, which he defines in Something Happened with a precision bordering on mathematical formalism, took Joseph Heller a painstaking twelve years to put down on paper. To dismiss this book in a paragraph, especially with moral indignation, is to willfully ignore human suffering. To dismiss it with a chuckling "nothing happened!", as so many have already, is to be blissfully ignorant. How splendid it must be to find a book like this merely boring! How reaffirming it must be to find oneself enveloped in the warm and loving unconscious irony of finding shock value where none was intended!  Something Happened pits the narrator, a post-war middle management executive, husband, and father, against his own feelings of impotence. It inhabits an extramoral space in which human empathy is an unworkable idea whose time has passed, and there is nothing left for our narrator to be aware of but his own anxiety, seemingly condemnded to continue half-living indefinitely as a dispassionate spectator of his own lonesome life. The first words are "I get the willies when I see closed doors", the first of many motifs Heller amasses into an impressive arsenal of symbols and recurring thoughts he weaves into the fugue of dispair we know as Something Happened. We watch anxiously, pining for just one precious drop of careless hyperbole by which to dismiss this deliberate, sober, and masterful piece of work. But the book is possessed of a terrifying uniformity, it is ghastly in its mundandity, and Heller never falters. Kurt Vonnegut had this to say about Heller's sadistic and methodical patience:  "Slocum's sentences are so alike in shape and texture from the beginning to the end of the book, that I imagined a man who was making an enormous statue out of sheet metal. He was shaping it with millions of identical taps from a ball-peen hammer.  "Each dent was a fact, a depressingly ordinary fact."  Now to let Heller speak for himself:  ". . .people tend to grow up pretty much the way they began; and hidden somewhere inside every bluff or quiet man and woman I know, I think, is the fully formed, but uncompleted, little boy or girl that once was and will always remain as it always has been, suspended lonesomely inside its own past, waiting hopefully, vainly, to resume, longing insatiably for company, pining desolately for that time to come when it will be safe and sane and possible to burst outside exuberantly, stretch its arms, fill its lungs with invigorating air, without fear at last, and call:  "'Hey! Here I am. Couldn't you find me? Can't we be together now?'  "And hiding inside of me somewhere, I know (I feel him inside me. I feel it beyond all doubt), is a timid little boy just like my son who wants to be his best friend and wishes he could come outside and play. 
 It only took me 30 seconds to buy the book after I scan the titles of the chapters in a fantasitic bookstore in middle Taiwan...all matter to me even if I am a Taiwanese who's so different from those who are supposed to read  it.The subject is so universal that,after wandering among the shelves for  hours with limited budgets, I decided to take it.   The book provides us  with so many tips and give us so many substantial thoughts and agendas that  a man has to take to make himself rich, materially and spiritually.   I am  so amazed that,even books about the same subjects in the books are  countless,this is a real DIFFERENT book which is written on basis of the  authurs' financial expertise and their ideas of helping people, withour  meaningless preach and crabbs.    This book is a real life bible. I am so  glad that I have it 
 This is a good computer Bible, but for the money, I prefer a program like AMG Bible Essentials which has the Libronix Library System built-in and can be integrated with other Bible study software.  For about $15 more the AMG program has both KJV, Apocrypha and NASB, including a lot of other capability, like Greek translations, word study, exegesis, parallel Bible comparisons, etc.  The Rainbow Bible is an older issue and shows its age by not offering features as mentioned above.  Some benefits of this Bible include both NIV and KJV translations, color maps, Matthew Henry's commentary, Naves and a version of Foxe's Book of Martyrs. The various colors can be distracting at times, but overall it is worth considering, particularly if you like the NIV 
 A useful reference, well written of course, a bit humourous in spots, authoritative. Recommended 
 Hands downn the most comprehensive collection of recipes, methods and techniques i've used. This book is for chefs who need a quick reference for classicaly prepared items from the cold kitchen. Although I think a novice would not find this publication useful, it would still a great source of ideas for menus and presentation 
 My 6 yr. old son received this for Christmas. He loves it and so do I! I think he likes playing hang man the best. It's cool that it has a light so he can play at night 
 This is the 10th volume in the ongoing manga series.  It is the ongoing tale of Negi Springfield, boy wizard and teacher at a Japanese girl's middle school.  This particular volume features the first day of the Mahora Academy Festival.  Negi has set too full a schedule for himself, and it seems like he will not be able to fulfill all the commitments he has made, unless he can be in three places at once.  Which he can, by a way I won't give away here.  He spends several hours on a "date" with Nodoka, the shy girl who is in love with him.  It may seem strange for a 13 year old girl to be in love with a 10 year old boy, but he is very mature for his age, and the situation comes off as being very sweet.  Oh, she's not the only one of his students who's in love with him, either.  Anyway, the last part of the book is about a martial arts tournament, or rather the first round of it.  I don't think it's giving away too much to say that Negi gets past the first round, as do many of his students.  The tournament will presumably continue in volume 11.  This continues to be a delightful series, but there is still the problem of having so many characters, it's hard to keep track of who's who 
 Excellent book. Very thorough. Helped me pass the exam 
 I've always shared my love of travel with my children. When my granddaughter started searching for a summer job - I told her to dream big- She is already applying to cruise lines using this book. She's a fine girl and I'd like her to have the opportunities I've had - but right now- she needs to earn money--I feel secure learning more about possible jobs from reading Miss Miller's book. I recommend it 
 Zorba is a classic, beautifully written. A picture of post war Crete, and a snapshot of unusual customs, beliefs and actions from another time. Not a great deal of action, and not a thirller but a portrait of a man and his struggle with his soul. The man in an imp, a heretic, a collosus - who just wants to be free. He is untroubled by the world around him, but he is concerned for those nearby. A thoroughly good read 
 Like du Maurier's Rebecca or Tolkien's Sauron, Julius Caesar is to the play which bears his name less a focal presence than a force largely off-stage which provokes the choices and actions of the more evident characters.  Caesar does put in several brief appearances during the first three acts, but it is Marcus Brutus whose nobility, naivete, seduction, treachery, rationalization, and ultimate downfall make up the overarching plot.  Shakespeare here avoids taking sides, however, and so provides us with a shrewd study in the diverse motives and attitudes that always precede insurrection, and in the chaos that inevitably follows.      As with most of the Arden series, this critical edition represents superior scholarship and valuable reader assistance.  Its extensive footnotes should illumine most instances of unfamiliar language or allusion, and an Appendix provides relevant excerpts from Plutarch's LIVES, which Shakespeare consulted for many of his details.  Those new to JULIUS CAESAR, however, are best advised to begin with the text of the play itself (in the volume's central section), saving the so-called 'Introduction' until afterwards; for Daniell's excellent discussion relies heavily on citations of the play's content, and his insights are apt to be lost on the reader who has, as yet, little or no frame of reference.     It should be noted, too, that the Arden Shakespeare editions are best suited to serious students and amateurs already acquainted with the Bard and aspiring to more advanced appreciation.  Having come late to the field myself, I mean no condescension in suggesting that someone just setting out may find the wealth of material here a bit overwhelming.  The potential rewards of Shakespearean discovery are incalculable, and it is always tragic when worthy ambition burns itself out, for want of patience, by attempting too much too soon.  I began with more modest editions, such as the Signet Classics or Pelican, which I found very accessible and sufficiently annotated to provide the help I then needed.  Arden, which has been issuing and revising its series since 1899, will still be around when one is ready for it.         
 Meditations of Marcus Aurelius is really a manual for living.  So much of what he teaches is very relevant for today.  "If you don't have a consistent goal in life, you can't live in a consistent way."  The book is actually a lot of short to the point lessons for living a better life.  "If you seek tranquillity, do less."  "Which brings a double saftisfaction to do less, better."  That is a philosophy that we all would do well to ponder and then employ.  Another of my favorite bits of wisdom, "Not to assume it's impossible because you find it hard. But to recognize that if it's humanly possible, you can do it too."  Marcus Aurelius spends a lot of time on death and how to approach it.  Some of that is very good.  However he also spends a lot of time thinking about man's right and priviledge of deciding if and when to end live voluntary.   There is an excellent though somewhat long introduction to the book.  Hays also provides a list of persons referred to in the book.  This is very helpful to at least know who Aurelius was talking about.  I only rate the book four stars because I found The Emperior's Handbook by David Hicks easier to read and understand.  I recommend that everyone read at least one of the books by Marcus Aurelius.  If you can only read one, pick The Emperor's Handbook 
 Hello, I'm glad with this product, I haven't try it yet outside my house but in a really dark condition it works pretty well, I need to turn on the IR button and clearly I can read even a sign on a bottle in total darkness. this thing really work 
 I LOVE THIS CAMERA!  I bought it to keep in my diaper bag so I always have a camera with me.  It's small, easy to use and takes great pictures. I recently sent a few in to have them developed and they came out great.  The only recommendation I have is to purchase a larger memory card - the one it comes with only hold a few pictures 
 I think the other reviewers have been a bit harsh. The book is a good resource. It gives general information on a variety of common birds. I think it would be particularly helpful to those new to birdkeeping. It has detailed instructions on cage selection, breeding information, and first aid.  P.S. ask your vet about gri 
 Overall an excellent & informative film- visually stunning and well integrated, progressing through the history and politics of nuclear weapons.  I thought from a scientific persepective, no one explained the phenomena seen- the various pressure waves, radiation aura, and condensation clouds and what causes them. Perhaps it would be less interesting to a non technical viever but after awhile, I found the stunning colors & clouds with symphonic music a  little tiresome- perhaps some scientific explanation would be nice 'special feature' on the DVD. Overall though a worthwhile purchase. 
 Being a pianist, I have an inevitably biased view for my instrument. But Charles Rosen's book "Piano Notes" is intended for everyone, even people who have no formal training in music. It covers just about all aspects of the instrument, including famous pianists, the idea of recording, and music appreciation in the broad sense. Rosen's experience as a pianist and a pedagogue adds invaluable touches to this book. Living in a country where classical music is largely neglected in the culture, I think this book should be read by all cultural people, at least all music majors on college campuses 
 Although the book is about Reincarnation, it is just as much about how to live a good life in the first place - so that you have a fortunate rebirth or go on to that better place.  I have a feeling that I'm going to be referring back to it as much as I do The Way of the Bodhisattva by Shantideva or the Book of Proverbs in the Bible 
 Hi everybody. I am almost 38 weeks pregnant now and I started working out with Kathy Smith's DVD since I was 16 weeks pregnant. I strongly recommend this workout for perople who might expect the outdated music and outfits, buying the workout from late 1980s.  I can compare 3 DVDs: I tried them all. 1 is Kathy Smith, 2nd is The Perfect Pregnancy Workout by Elisa Llamido and the 3d is Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rea.  All of them have good excersizes, but after 2 other ones I always felt back pain after the workout. I work out 3 times a week, and I know if I didn't have Kathy Smith's dvd, I would hate pregnancy thinking that back pain is one of the things I need to go through during pregnancy. But it is not! Kathy Smith's workout: reduces the back-pain, boosts your energy level, reduces swelling (really important for moms in the 3 trimester). Besides the dvd has FAQs and Video answers about postnatal workouts, advises from the doctors, and more. It is actually the most pleasant and non-stressfull dvd I found for pregnancy. 
 Perhaps it's political intrigue which interests; if so, Vince Flynn's CONSENT TO KILL is now in paperback and provides a thriller based on modern headlines and terrorist concerns. Mitch becomes the target of an international conspiracy for his struggles to preserve freedom: CONSENT TO KILL shows his evolution from hunter to prey as he's stalked by dangerous, unseen forces for his past 'crimes'. An outstanding and engrossing leisure choice 
 OK, I'll admit it -- I was a terrible cook.  My meals were nutritious, sure -- but spices eluded me -- and so the food was only suitable for monks who have taken a vow of pleasurelessness. This book changed my cooking forever.  Not only is the book pregnant with spectacular images of spices from their natural to processed state, but very thoughtful information is provided on complimentary herbs and spices that would inspire any on-the-fly cooking adventurer!  You will guard this book like it was your tax information once it's on your shelf.  But it won't sit on your shelf very much -- Mine is on my coffee table.  The book is impressive in it's scope and aesthetics.  Get it 
 This is an inspired work by Manly Hall. It should be read more than once to truly absorb all of the symbolism and meaning. Another great book by this author is: 'Freemasons and Rosicrucians - the Enlightened' which actually includes 'The Lost Keys of Freemasonry' in the book. Great collection 
 this series is so smartly written and wickedly witty.  it's a wonderful ensemble comedy that tugs at your heart at times.  it's an interesting depiction of life in a professional theatre company, but it gives you a different insight into the business aspect of theatre outside of actor, director, tech drama.  mark mckinney and paul gross are outstanding 
 If you liked movies like Twister, the Day After Tomorrow, and Volcano, you'll love this.  Not as action packed as "Volcano" was, but in my opinion a better movie as it is a bit more scientific, and holds more of a realistic plot.  Great movie and I highly recommend 
 "A Million in Prizes," like other two-disc compilations by acts like The Fall, Devo and The Damned, features an essential first disc with Iggy Pop at the peak of his powers (with the Stooges, James Williamson and David Bowie).  Featuring remastered versions of the Stooges best songs plus the remixed songs from "Raw Power," this stuff is blood-curdling, head-banging rock n' roll of the highest caliber.  Topping it off are newly cleaned up versions of Iggy's pre-hardcore classics "I Got a Right," "Gimme Some Skin" and "I'm Sick of You."  This material is followed by the best songs from his first and best two solo albums, "The Idiot" and "Lust for Life."  Once again an improvement over "Nude and Rude," the previous official Iggy best-of, this disc features "Success," a wonderful, unheralded cut from the latter album.  Then ... there's disc two.  It starts off solidly with a holdover from "Lust for Life," "Some Weird Sin," and the best cut off his underrated "New Values" album, "I'm Bored."  Even "I Need More" is listenable, as Iggy's voice is still thunderous and convincing.  After that, however, Iggy's records fall victim to bad 80s production and a seeming complacency on his part.  "Real Wild Child (Wild One)" represents Iggy at his most commercial ... something akin to David Bowie's "Let's Dance" album, only much less satisfying.  Despite the dropoff in quality, Iggy's energy and commitment to musicmaking is praiseworthy, making "A Million in Prizes" an essential part of any respectable music fan's collection 
 Not only should this book be the literary book-fellow to any Classics student, but an absolute must for every human being on the face of the planet. Griffins' translation is not only beautifully rendered/translated  but extremely funky and contemporary.  It is so applicable to our own  modern interpertations of life, the universe,and everything, that you will  easily forget than it was written over 2,500 years ago.  In addition, the  book design values are astounding.  The fonts, both English and Greek, are  lovely that even the reader who has never studied Greek will fall in love  with the flowing lines 
 For anyone who loves America, please watch this film about an extraordinary historian and activist.  I remember when Howard Zinn was at Spellman here in the Atlanta in the 60s. He has always had the courage to speak out -- frequently when no one else did.  As America once more goes to war -- this time for oil and George W. Bush's ego -- Dr. Zinn's voice should and must be heard.  
 If you have read Karen Rose's books starting with the first book "Don't Tell" you can tell that her progression of story telling is vastly improving. I do not mean to imply that the other two were not good books, because they were but this book had me up late trying to finish it. I have read this book so much that I will probably have to buy another copy. She blended the right amount of suspense and romance to keep the reader interested in the book, but also caught your attention from the beginning to make you want to read more. If Karen should read this I must say congratulations because you have became one of my must have authors which puts you right there with J.D. Robb, Laurel K. Hamilton, Erica Spindler, Linda Lael Miller, Sharon Sala, Linda Howard, Lisa Jackson, Patricia Cornwell, Tami Hoag, Christine Feehan, and Sherrilyn Kenyon. Those are just a few of my favorite authors and my must have books. 
 It pains me to read the other reviews of this book because I feel that poor Mary Balogh is held to a higher standard than other Regency writers. She is still by far the best writer concentrating on the Regency era. She still captures the atmosphere, the mores, the dialogue, and the thinking of that time period better than any other writer on the market. And, the characters are always different. While some of the reviewers didn't like these specific characters' traits or reactions to events, they are not taking into account the fact that Balogh created their distinct personalities years ago. The character of Peter, Viscount Whitleaf, showed up in a book written five years ago!  That's impressive to me. She can create characters in her mind and keep a running thread of their traits through many books and many years. Their personalities may be too mild for some readers, but I enjoy the fact that Balogh sees the world through very differing kinds of eyes. She has written many of the archetypical dark, tortured heroes in her day and will definitely do so again, but this hero happens to be outwardly kind and flirtatious. What is wrong with that? He is still interesting.        The story, to me, is compelling as well. How can the reviewers find tepid the idea of a young woman falling in love (but trying not to) with the man who is linked to the cause of her father's suicide?! I think that Balogh does create "angst" (as one reviewer wanted) in the conflict that their love will always be tainted by the reasons for her father's suicide. They must find a way to overcome that dilemma.        Her books are politically correct as one reviewer stated (her heroines do always seem to need some career or self-sufficiency in their lives before they agree to love the hero) but that is certainly the fault of the editors and publisher, not Balogh. I still think that a Balogh book is ten times better than any of the other ridiculous, amateurish, poorly written books in the Romance section of the bookstore these days.     
 This book is laugh out loud, pee your pants funny!  Jill Conner Browne has said what most of southern women have thought.  Her wit and humor will have you snorting in a very unladylike fashion and having a strange desire to throw a tiara on your head and proclaim yourself Queen of your life! Not only have I purchased eight of these books for my nearest and dearest but jumped right up and started my own chapter of the SPQs!  God save the Queens 
 There are few actors who could deliver such a performance as Patrick Stewart. His recital of A Christmas Carol is by far the best avaliable. The story's tone and Dickens' characters are truly brought to life through Stewart. Highly recommended for the holidays, the classroom, or for any fan of this classic 
 I got this for my niece when she was about 6 months old and even then she liked it because of the sounds and the figures. She is one now and its one of her favorite toys.  And my 4 yr old daughter has a blast playing with it too. I will most likely buy this for my youngest daughter's first birthday next month. We are crazy about Mega Bloks and Little people 
 I did not have the original so this was an easy decision to make.  My understanding is that Burnin' was the last wailers release to include Peter Tosh.  Serious Bob fans will want to add this 2 cd deluxe set to their collection.  Not only is it crisp and clear but the band is tight and focused - especially true on the live selections (disc 2).  The remastering effort is excellent.  The first disc makes you feel like you are standing in the studio with the band and the second makes you feel like you're in the audience.   About the live disc: the band is on top of their game here.  It's a tight show that features excellent versions from the Burnin' album. If you're new to Bob you might want to start with Exodus (or at least make Exodus part of your collection at some point) but experienced fans will not go wrong with this 2 cd set 
 This Atlas is fantastic ... very large but the scale s so large it gives you and excellent idea of what one can see 
 Following the advice and information in this book has virtually saved my life. My blood sugars have finally normalized, thank goodness. A superb book by THE true expert in the field, with clear, concise advice. A Must-have for all Diabetics!! Highest recommendation!! 
 Love it!  I had heard of Josh Bell but never had purchased any of his music.  I am a full fan now.  This cd is wonderful.  I am a Gershwin fan and have been for years.  Bell breathes new life into the old classics and the result is breathtaking.  His touch with the violin is beyound discription.  He even plays with George in one cut, Sweet and Low Down.  That alone is worth the price of the cd.  Buy this cd and expect to be enchanted.  It has been in my changer for weeks now, I can't get enough 
 I bought about a dozen of these for Christmas gifts - for our daughters, our son's girlfriend's, work friends, sister and sisters-in-law, myself (!) and everyone loved them!  Even though I subscribe to Ophrah's magazine the book wasn't a repeat...it's a beautiful book compiled in a reference format with great articles for quick reading on particular subjects that every female needs to know!  The pictures throughout the book are gorgeous, in full color on heavy, glossy paper. There's a picture of a naked couple - tastefully done, very discrete for full nudity.   This book is a gift several times over - it's a gift in itself and then the advice within is enlightening, uplifting, encouraging, fun and inspiring - the best gifts you can give yourself and anyone you truly care about!   There's mention of this being an annual..I hope so - I know just what to get everyone again for Christmas this coming year! (And one for myself!) Enjoy!   
 In "Securing Windows Server 2003" the author does a superb job of providing a blueprint on how to secure a Windows 2003 system that is accessible by the world.  Similar to a checklist, you will find yourself going through this book using it as a guideline as you rollout your Server 2003 installations and double-checking existing ones already live.  The author does a great job of focusing on the task at hand, security, and does not try to do what so many others have -- make this an entire book about implementing 2003.  By keeping to the point, the book itself becomes a desk reference instead of another bookshelf weight.  Many of the tasks focused on in the book can be bookmarked and refered to for case scenarios during any 2003 implementation.  From understanding the basic security of a Server 2003 system, implementing Group Policy Objects, all the way up to understanding Kerbos and PKI cryptography, this book covers each topic in enough detail to give the reader a firm ground on which to check and implement procedures.    One of the strong features of the book is the author actually walks you through many of the steps you need to take -- with screenshots where appropriate.  He does not leave you stranded in the middle of a procedure with only a vague mention of what task to perform next.  Experienced administrators will appreciate the fact that he goes into detail to cover all the bases while newer administrators will appreciate the hands-on approach and step-by-step instructions.  Overall, a great security book that should become a standard on any System Administrators bookshelf.  Server 2003 has introduced a new era into the Microsoft Server family, one which not all the old tricks and practices of Windows 2000 apply -- this book will help you learn the new ropes and get up to speed quickly 
 Reyita describes her life as a black woman, being born in 1902 and growing up through all the violence and poverty of Cuba in the twentieth century.   In 1912 Reyita,  was living with her godfather and his wife, the latter being terribly abusive. This lady was also head of the women's section of the local branch of the leading Afro-Cuban political party, the PIC. The PIC had been formed in 1908 in order to fight against racial discrimination. It was been banned by the Cuban government in 1910 on the false ground that it was anti-white. As a result of what Reyita claims was a trap laid by the Cuban president Jose Miguel Gomez, the PIC launched a revolt. The Cuban military responded by executing and torturing thousands of ordinary Afro-Cubans. Reyita's aunt was arrested on bogus charges and thrown into prison.   Reyita  spends a great deal of time in this book discoursing  her use of herbal remedies and other home-grown medicine to cure various ailments of her neighbors. In this way, as a medicine woman, also as one with a reputation as receiving accurate visions from the spirit world, she found a certain niche for herself in Cuba's patriarchal culture.   Reyita was alert to any opening in Cuba's political sphere which might serve as veichle to better the condition of her people. The PIC seemed to offer a ray of hope and Reyita tried her best as a young girl to support her neighborhood chapter. After the PIC was crushed, Afro-Cubans were virtually terrorized into submission. The biggest attraction after this was the fatalistic "Back-to-Africa" movement of Marcus Garvey, which Reyita was enthusiastic for, roughly, in the 1918-22 era. This movement was also repressed by the Cuban state. Then there was Reyita's involvement with the Cuban Communist Party, the PSP, in the early 1940's....  Reyita married a white man who was virtually disowned by his family as a result of this inter-racial marriage and had problems with some of his neighbors in places they lived. Her husband, of course, never brought Reyita along when he was invited to dinner at the houses of his bosses at his factory. Reyita admits that she married this man in order to produce light skinned children who would have a considerably easier time of it in Cuban society than she did growing up. In spite of his steadfast commitment to his marriage to Reyita in the face of society's hostility, her husband was at the same time a rather traditional and dull fellow. He was very controlling towards her and their children.  Reyita tried to engage in small activities that would earn her own money and which could give her a measure of independence from her husband. For instance, in what is perhaps the most vivid and interesting section of the book, the family's life in the 1940's living in the poor neighborhood called Barraccones in Santiago De Cuba, Reyita first opens a diner in her family's home.. She reports how several of these prostitutes lifted themselves out of their [...] and their children that Reyita took care of while their mothers were trying to get their lives together, turned out well. Many of these prostitutes were white, but they shared a bond with Reyita because they were all very poor. Reyita also briefly mentions the gay men who patronized her dinner and she speaks about the lifestyle they practiced with no hint of any disfavor whatsoever. A very tolerant woman was Reyita.     On the years after the triumph of the revolution, Reyita mentions that great progress has been made, but that discrimination is still present, that black candidates for jobs can be excluded in favor of less qualified white ones and so on. She mentions that in film and literature, some of the old stereotypes of Afro-Cubans remain. She notes that oral historians in Cuba post-revolution, made little effort to interview people like her, who had witnessed such events in Afro-Cuban history as the massacres of 1912.   This book does not exactly evoke great feeling in the reader, though at times it can. The  stanzas of poetry that open each chapter, apparently selected by the poetry buff Reyita, are quite beautiful. 
 this is well cool i have never seen somethin like this i cant wait to get this i found out theres an tamagotchi town for v3 on tamagotchi.com p.s i cant wait to get my hands on thi 
 We all know that love should be more than just physical attration, and yet few movies go beyond surface appearance and sugar-coated banter. Prelude to a Kiss is the wonderful exception. It takes us beyond the usual preditable plot and gives us a rare insight into what is really important in love.   An enchanting and well-wrought script supported by excellent performances, this movie speaks to any who listen with their head and heart.   Humor, magic, and mystery are interwoven as a husband searches for his wife who is missing but still there. I don't want to give the plot away. Watching the story unfold is part of the movie's charm. I will say that you will be surprised and, I hope, moved by the story and message this fine piece of filmaking brings to us. One of my all time favorites. Don't miss it. 
 I think this is a very funny book.  Mike Greenberg has a wacky way of expressing the things that happen in his life.  I enjoyed it very much 
 This music video compilation is a must have for any 80's music fan. The main problem with most such video compilations out there these days is that they are too scanty. The average music video DVD contains like 5-7 songs at the most. Wouldn't you rather spend a few dollars more and get a disc which contains more good hits in one place? And this collection does exactly that. It puts (videos of) 14 of the 80's best hits in one place. Agreed, there is still a lot more space on a DVD to get three times as many videos, but this collection stands out compared to the other collections out there today. The other good thing is that there were a lot of one-hit-wonder bands back then that you cannot really find videos of now e.g. Dan Hartman or Berlin. You can easily get a DVD of Tears For Fears videos but not these other bands. Even if you could many people wouldn't buy them because they only had a few good songs to their credit. So it is great to get your hands on a DVD where you can find all these good numbers in one place. In a nutshell: there's room for improvement, but that shouldn't blind you to what it's worth and pass it over 
 While doing a search in iTunes for something else altogether I stumbled upon this gem, immediately downloaded the entire CD and proceeded to jam. The memories came flooding back as I listened to Rock Island Rocket, and drummer John Guerin's single headed toms, a sound he was almost singularly responsible for making popular. It was that distinctive dry tone that attracted me to his playing along with an awesome sense of changing direction at a moments notice. Max Bennett on bass rounded out one of the best studio rhythm sections in Los Angeles in the 70's. Robben Ford's acoustic solo on Refried is one of the best and ranks right up there with anything Larry Carlton did without 110 volts. It was a complete package with great cover art and some of the best fusion of the 70's. You won't be dissapointed 
 If you like The Beatles  or rock n roll, in any capacity, you NEED to have this CD in your collection. It is simply incredibly and horrifically impressive. John Davis is a music genious as plays almost 20 insturments himself on this record. An incredible deal for such powerful and amazing music 
 This is required reading by many Embry-Riddle Aviation Safety teachers.  It is broad in scope and recent, regarding coverage of the latest technology and events. It is not just a reprint of an out-of-date textbook with a new cover and a little new stuff thrown in, although I have not read the previous edition. I was surpised to see references to recent events and new technology that is barely being used. With the industry moving as fast as it is, I believe this is the book's strength. (Copyright is 2004) 5 of 5 stars for information.  Sure it may be dry, but it's a textbook. I haven't read too many textbooks that were written in a lively manner. Personally, I want information, not a entertainment or an agenda.  I particularly like that there is very little 'word fluff'. The writing is concise and straight-to-the-point, without excessive writing or stories to try to make a point. It encompasses a very wide range of Aviation Safety topics that one would need to know for general knowledge of the subject.  For a typical expensive textbook, I was surprised that there are NO pictures, and the book is printed on cheap 'copier paper' rather than fancy glossy paper. Otherwise, the binding and cover is rugged and secure. The absence of color or pictures, or fancy paper doesn't detract from the information which is top-notch. 3 of 5 stars for appearance and quality.  If you want fancy, get something else. If you want concise, up-to-date information, get this 
 when I look this product I was tryng to buy a monitor only to my son's bedroom but this LCD comes with the TV input!!!, great because I take out the TV and install the LCD to the PC, now my son when want to see TV only switch at the remote control or back to PC... two in one!!!, the graphics quality are great, maybe the sound power should be better 
 I recently purchased book locally - sorry Amazon.  Will help your snare drum technique  immensely. Even looking through the book without practicing on snare or drum pad will guide your mind and playing to better musicality.  One of my students seems more interested in it than other books on the market.  More for snare study, although, as I usually say, once you learn it one place, you can apply it anywhere - i.e. drum set, aux. percussion, etc. 
 This album & movie is the original of hip hop, and rap.  Rap would be nothing without the mc's on this album.  something everybody into hip hop should have 
 While some of the more well-known underground groups are known for being relatively throwback and such, the same could not be said for Blackalicious. Their music is innovative, and should set a standard for hip-hop. They are unique and exciting to listen to. Not the entire album appeals to me, but I respect the entire thing. It's an underground album that I think more open-minded listeners should be exposed to and would appreciate. I bought this album because of the song "Chemical Calisthenics," I thought it sounded so cool how they did that with the varied tempos and raps that were precise with those beats. Besides, I found many other tracks to be aural pleasure (hehe). There are plenty of memorable moments on here as well, my other favorite probably being "Paragraph President." The energy here is wonderful and there's also kind of a maturity in here that helps. However, there are a few tracks that while I don't dislike them, they don't really appeal to me. That's the only reason why I gave it a 4 rather than a 5.  As for more well-thought out reviews, look elsewhere. I meant to be simple. And want people to know of this product's existance. 98% of people who view hip-hop as low-brow have never heard this album, without a question 
 A local radio station was playing "Atlas" and "One More Day". I bought this CD expecting to be at least a little dissapointed. Boy was I wrong. There is not a bad track on this CD. My favorite is "Luckiest Man" but they are all good. The lyrics are incredible. From the thought inducing "Tried and Tempted" and "The Truth is the Light" to the light hearted "Chocolate on my Tongue". The last three tracks have a gospel feel but don't let that scare you off if you aren't in to that. They all have a light feel. This CD needs to be heard to be appreciated. I can tell you all day how good it is but you NEED to hear it 
 This cookbook is a delight!  Wonderful, tasteful Italian receipes that are simple enough for the non-gourmet cook to prepare, but as tasty as a meal prepared by a gourmand.  It is organized in that wonderful European style of simple, easy to access design.  For a wedding gift,a holiday surprise for a friend, or a fun, joint project for a couple who loves good food at home, this is the one.  T.White-Kansas Cit 
 This bag has it all...  Perfect size. I disagree that it is "too big" for daily use. I am 5'8", so perhaps people of smaller stature might feel differently. It is big enough to carry my bookd and some files, in addition to computer, phone, and misc. junk I need for work.  Quality. Have not had it too long, so only time will really tell. BUT... construction definitely suggests that it will be a long-lasting bag. It looks like I could add a ton of books or heavy materials and not strain it much. I love the extra padding for my computer (removable, of course!)  Style. Very attractive and professional. First day of use got several compliments.  I really can't think of what I would change. Even the price is good! I plan to order another one for future use since they are on sale.  It did come in a GIGANTIC box and the bag itself was in another Mobile Edge bag, so for a moment I thought they had shipped the wrong order. It really did not need all that bubble wrap, but I'm glad it arrived from Amazon in pristine condition 
 Autocad is the dominant CAD package, in market share and mindshare. But Howard shows that SolidWorks is perfectly capable of doing much  the same tasks as Autocad. The modelling is intuitive. And much thought has clearly gone into the deployment of the user interface. The numerous options available to you should not prove overwhelming. Though perhaps that might be the initial impression, as you start the book.  Howard deliberately does not explain all the methods in SolidWorks. To minimise information overload on you. SolidWorks can certainly do far more. But here you can swiftly learn the most common methods and start designing

I used excerpt from this excellent book in a time management presentation for my coworkers.  How else can you perform at your peak unless you are doing something you absolutely love.  When you know your strenghts, it's easier to focus on being successful where you are.  If you are concerned about weaknesses, then you are spinning your wheels.  It's like Pareto's Principle.

 Although some of the dialogue is rather shallow, I really enjoyed reading this story.  Yes, he is a little preachy, and having senior staff in the department of homeland security neatly sum up the geo-political environment for the reader is rather annoying.  Yet I had a very good time reading this story.  I enjoyed the romantic tension between Alex Ford and Kate Adams, and I was very excited by the prospect of a certain someone having a family reunion with a child thought dead.  Balducci is excellent at controlling pace and keeping lots of variety and tension up in the air.  When a book is that well paced, it's easy to overlook some incredible dialogue.  The accent of the Russian Adelphia was terrible, but oh well.  This is the first Baldacci book I've read, and when I'm ready for moderately smart, somewhat unrealistic but exciting fiction, I'll definitely read him again--especially while on travel.    I've lived in the DC area five years, and his geography's a little incredible--particulary one afternoon where the club strolls from the Smithsonian metro to the FDR monument but still not finding privacy there, ends up at Stone's "home" so they can chat.  That's a trip that would take all day and night (let alone an afternoon walk).  DC's like Las Vegas...objects appear much closer than they actually are.  I really don't expect a life altering or profound experience when I pick up a thriller.  As such, it had great action and thought-provoking "fictional facts" about modern anti-terrorism and espionage, in general.  It made me really want to visit the Library of Congress 
 In this new classic and hot-seller, Neil Rackham and John DeVincentis write convincingly about the need for sales forces to change with the rapidly changing times, and about how they can successfully adapt. Devoid of cutesy gimmicks, the book takes a solid look at what it takes to sell in todays market (no matter what your product or service). It gives plenty of strategies and corporate examples, all focused on the new imperative of creating value, as opposed to just communicating it. We [...] recommend this thorough, intelligent, and conversational book to executives, managers and everyone involved in sales and marketing 
 A wonderful and thought-provoking book full of insight. A must read for anyone with intelligent questions about spirituality, feminism and religion.

 "If you believe that in America you are innocent until proven guilty, this book will shock you. If you believe in the death penalty, this book will disturb you. If you believe the criminal justice system is fair, this book will infuriate you."  Whenever I think of John Grisham, I think of all the joy that he has brought to me through his writing, and I am always happy to see his new arrivals.  An Innocent Man is a work of non-fiction taking place in the state of Oklahoma, in the small town of Ada, in the eighties.   When Debra Sue Carter, a cocktail waitress is raped and murdered one night after leaving a bar, the police pounce immediately on Dennis Fritz, and Ron Williamson; two young men of Ada. With no evidence or witnesses, it seems as though the Law wanted to have someone to bring before the courts to prove they were doing their job. These two unfortunate men kept claiming their innocence over and over again, but all to no avail.  Their appeals fell on death ears.  Eventually, Mr. Fritz was given a life sentence and Mr. Williamson sent to death row.  How did the judicial system work that out?  Why did they not spend some more time trying to get at the truth of what really happened that night?  They spend their hopeless lives behind bars until one day; someone gets the guts to tear this charade to pieces, bit by bit, revealing the plain truth of that night.    What makes you mad about this case is to see the amount of precious time these guys wasted in jail. It took a toll on their mental and physical health, and someone should have to pay for incriminating these poor guys. Reviewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar (SUGAR-CANE 23/11/06) 
 I found this book to be a great resource for a first time mom.  Not only does it give a general idea of the things your baby may be doing at different times it also gives suggestions of fun games to play every week.  Since I never spent a lot of time around very young babies this really helped me to figure out which games were best to play at which stages and gave me some great ideas when I was running out of new ways to entertain my son.  It also had some special notes that highlight where premature babies may fall developmentally at different times.  I know this book may rub some breastfeeding mothers the wrong way but I was not bothered by it.  As the breastfeeding mother of a 5 month old I felt that it highlights the importance of breastfeeding but also supports the decisions of formula feeding moms or moms who find it necessary to wean to formula.  There is even a section with tips on weaning from the breast to formula at 6 months which I found refreshing and guilt-free in comparison to other books.  Some of the advice is not the best but as with any parenting book use your own judgment before using any book as your bible 
 justine levy takes us from the pits of hell, spins us around a couple of times, and spits us back out. refreshing in its strong (and totally vulnerable) female narrative, utterly indulgent in its darkness but wonderfully redemptive in its transformations. i was surprised to read such an insightful ending to the novel. like an unabashed journal, it is totally raw and honest, and worth the read 
 When I first started reading this book, I was pretty reserved about how it would all unfold and I set myself up not to like it.  As a general rule I'm not a big reader of Christian fiction because I believe that most writers of the genre are not as good a writer as they are a Christian.  And I'm not trying to sound mean, but I believe the rules are more lax for someone to get published in the Christian fiction VS. general fiction.  But I'll admit, I started reading this with a jaundiced eye, waiting to find it was a ridiculous book, but I was pleasantly entertained.  Gist has a great sense of timing and style and she wasn't afraid to push the barriers and treat readers like adults.  She brings in a sense of modest "spice", if you will, to let readers know that not only to the two protagonists love each other, but they desire each other too.  It's tastefully done and in no way detracts from the message of how God guides us in our lives.  The Colonial times were brought out and seemed like true research was done to show readers the living standards of that age.  Gist's writing itself was bright and crisp.  She ought to consider writing general fiction, she'd excel at that, I'm most positive.  Readers who even enjoyed Francine Rivers' Redeeming Love will appreciate this author's talents and are sure to have this book on their prized shelf.  I recommend this book to any Christian who would like to enjoy a delightful read of love and life in the colonial times.  My other Recommendations:  The Vanishing Point (a historical fiction book based on two sister in Colonial times) by Mary Sharratt; Redeeming Love (historical Christian Romance set during the California gold rush) by Francine Rivers. 
 The sad thing about it is, that this debut CD which I think came out in 94' sounds thousands of times better than CD's put out by bands today in 2006! The sound quality is not that great, but the music is awesome! Straight forward heavy rock, no mathematical complex riffs here. Probably Maynard's most angry lyrics out of their whole discography, but nevertheless graet. Opiate was the start of a legendary band that puts out 10/10 CD's all the time. The only other band that puts out 10/10 release all of the time is Opeth 
 GFTN draws some frightening pictures and equally frightening conclusions.  My attachment to this book is that it is essentially fact-based and scientific.  I might not like the tale, but I believe the authors have done a good job at setting forth their case. And, whether or not one agrees with the authors' methodology. conclusions or recommendations, one must read this book and understand its message 
 THE BAND: "Lonesome" Dave Peverett (lead vocals, guitar), Rod Price (lead guitar), Craig MacGregor (bass), Roger Earl (drums & percussion). *R.I.P. Dave Peverett and Rod Price.  THE DISC: (1977) Six songs clocking in at just under 39 minutes. Included with the disc is a minimal 2-page foldout containing band pictures, song listing, band members, and thank you's. All songs written by Foghat, except "I Just Want To Make Love To You" by Willie Dixon, and "Honey Hush" by Big Joe Turner. Recorded at Soldiers Field, Chicago. Label - Rhino/Bearsville Records.  COMMENTS: One word - ENERGY. "Foghat Live" was always my favorite Foghat album. Honest blue-collar rock & roll with a touch of blues & boogie, with no added audience noise (as so many live albums are guilty of). As it goes, "Live" was the band's best selling album. Two concert staples, "Slow Ride" and "I Just Want To Make Love To You" clocked in over eight minutes each. Along the lines of Peter Frampton's material, I always felt the sound from Foghat's live album was head and shoulders above their studio releases. Commercially, in the studio, Foghat peaked with their album "Fool For The City" (1975 - featuring the title track and their highest charting #20 single "Slow Ride"). 1976 found them perhaps stuck in the middle with their album "Nightshift" - a good release, but it simply went nowhere on the charts (no hits, and no songs featured on "Live"). Then came '77 and their famed double-platinum "Foghat Live". Though a short album, the songs here are the cream of the crop... each absolutely rocked in the traditional rock & blues Foghat style (I have to believe there are other songs missing that could have made this a double-length release). This live album gave their careers a huge boost... at least for a few more years. Decades later, their music is referenced on TV shows like Seinfeld, King Of The Hill, Family Guy, Malcolm In The Middle, Newsradio... as well as several movie soundtracks. I can easily put this 'live' album on the shelf with other 'live' classics like UFO's "Stranger's In The Night", Kiss' "Alive!", The Who's "Live At Leeds", Lynyrd Skynyrd's "One More From The Road", Ozzy's "Tribute", and Deep Purple's "Made In Japan". Foghat was always best LIVE and this is a classic album (5 stars).     
 Years ago, Annie Fortenberry promised her grandmother she'd never sell the family home. In the 1850's the estate was one of the most famous bordello in the region. Though Annie now uses it as a bed and breakfast, the drama at the house hasn't died down. Between the growing bills, a prankster ghost, eccentric tenants and neighbor, and a lush of a handyman, maintaining the estate and keeping her promise are virtually impossible, thus she has no time for distractions. In rides 6'2" of glorious distraction, Wes Bridges. Annie's husband, Charles, has been missing in action for three years. She believes he ran away with another woman, thus the only thing keeping her from enjoying what Wes has to offer is she is still legally married.    Unbeknownst to Annie, Wes Bridges was hired by Ms. Eve Fontenberry to find out what happened to her son. Eve doesn't know what to believe, but knows her son would have contacted her if he were able to. Charles's body is found on Annie's property, and she becomes the main suspect in the murder. Wes has grown fond of Annie, and he knows she would never kill anyone, thus he sets out to prove her innocence. As Wes and Annie work to solve the mystery, sparks fly, and they soon share a passion neither had ever imagined.   Simply put, FULL BLOOM is a hot mess in the best way. The authors have talent for writing loony support characters that kept me in stitches. At times, the novel went from funny to overly silly, but for the most part, it was quite entertaining. The development of the mystery was also on par and kept me guessing until the end. I highly recommend FULL BLOOM and look forward to future works by Janet Evanovich and Charlotte Hughes.

 "I Wanna Know What Love Is" makes this cd worth getting alone. The song is an incredible song, and the mix is sick. I can't stop listening to this song. I also like "Surrender", though to end the cd with a song with such strong beats wasn't the best idea in my opinion. The other songs you should know from the radio. I won't go into detail on every one of them, but they are all worth a listen on here. I enjoyed the mixing and definitely feel this is the best cd to listen to the hits of 2004 vocal dance 
 This book is filled with fabulous recipes for tasty, fresh food that can be fixed in a relatively short amount of time.

As well, the recipes are so easy, if you're cooking for just one, you can quickly divide the portions in half! 
 If you haven't noticed already, Chris Carrabba wears his emotions on his sleeve. I love this album, and the first track (hands down) is my favourite song ever. I fell in love with it the first time I heard it and bought the album immediately after without hearing any other DC songs. I soon went back to SAR and TPYHCTFTM and now that Dusk and Summer is out nobody can deny the genius that is DC. This review is long overdue.   = 
 Everything he says is true. It's almost universal throughout America, regardless of the economic factors around the school. The system thwarts caring teachers and interested students at every turn. You can't grade people on a uniform scale like some mass-produced good and expect their uniqueness to ripen and shine.  When I was 3, my mother, a single mother and a public school teacher, was able to see the then-private internal rankings of quality of schools in the county. She moved to the area where the elementary, middle, and high schools were rated the highest. By all rights, my brother and I got a good education.  Except that it was terrible. I was in the gifted & talented section of a very well-funded school and so I had more caring teachers than most people do, but even together they could only do so much to offset the rest. I was terribly depressed every Monday from 3rd grade onwards, because I'd spent a weekend learning and doing things that made me feel good -- reading, writing, learning graphic design and programming, hiking, etc. -- and then I had to go back to school. I worried myself sick, I developed an ulcer, and I became cold and callous and joyless. More over, my peers behaved in other ways he predicted, being incapable of individual thought and freaking out as soon as they were in a situation they didn't expect -- and a number of them were vicious or extremely promiscuous (at 12 and 13!) and the parents and teachers never even saw it.    I hated my life. When I was 15, I found "The Teenage Liberation Handbook." It's poorly written, but inspiring. I told my mother that if she didn't let me escape school, I'd never forgive her. Despite my parents' doomsaying, they let me do it, and I've had a better life than either of them so far (happier, earning more, more friends, far fewer destructive problems -- alcoholism, depression, prescription drug abuse). Moreover, they didn't teach me -- I taught myself, and sought out help when I needed it.  But TTLH never explained why school made me so miserable. Arrogantly, I thought it was because I was so much more intelligent than my peers. This may be true, but who knows how intelligent they'd have been if they had been as resistant to the schooling as I was. I learned this from John Taylor Gatto, who eloquently captures it all in every essay.   He has pinpointed the symptoms, ferreted out the problem, and been more honest about his former profession than any other teacher since John Holt. He's also more realistic than Holt, and a better writer, so points for that.   If you or your kids are unhappy with school, do something about it. Read these books, get inspired, and live the life you want to live -- or help your kids live the lives they want. You only get one life and don't believe the people who tell you you must waste the first 22 years of it to "prepare" for the remaining two-thirds.  Education is not preparation for life, education is life itself. -- John Dewe 
 This was the text required for my personnell management class. (200 level) I have the Bohlander 13th ed. which is a better text, being better organised.

  	American academic Ido Oren started his research by looking at the common idea that democracies do not fight each other. He shows how studies only support this idea because our concept of democracy is produced by the same historical patterns against which the claims are `tested', a history partly shaped by the USA's international rivalries.  So, before World War One, Woodrow Wilson, the political scientist, described Imperial Germany as an advanced constitutional state, a model for administrative reform. Yet when he became President, Woodrow Wilson took the USA into war against Germany, and described it as an autocracy.  Oren looks at American political science as an ideology: its claims to uphold the ideals of liberal democracy, as expressed, for instance, by Samuel Huntingdon, a past President of the American Political Science Association. Yet the apartheid government used Huntingdon's writings, as when he backed it against `the worse alternative' of a government led by `the revolutionaries of the ANC'. He advised the apartheid government that increased authoritarianism might be necessary for reform, rationalising its repression, and he backed its `centralization of power'. Typically, the CIA funded some of his research.  Oren studies American political science's characterisations of the USA's chief enemies last century, its concomitant characterisations of the USA, and its involvement in the wars against Imperial Germany, Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. "I document a systematic pattern of change in the portrayals of these enemies before and after their conflicts with us." Also, he shows the pattern of concurrence between US wars and transformations in political science's visions of the USA. The Soviet Union was seen as all state, no society, the USA as all society, no state.  He chronicles the growth of intimacy between the political science profession and the State Department, especially during the US attack on Vietnam. Oren asks whether `American political science might be more attached to America's regime than to democracy'. He concludes that it indeed works from the US state, not an objective, perspective. 
 "Vampire High" by Douglas Rees was a great read.  Cody Elliot is a normal high school kid who ends up at a school of all vampires.  Well almost all vampires- the water polo team is made up of humans (apparently water is harmful to vampires).  Cody tries his best to fit in, and ends up in more trouble then he bargained for.  But armed with his new best friend, he's ready for anything.    The book was 226 pages, and I was sorry to see it end.  I've found myself hoping that Douglas Rees will write a sequel so we can learn more about Cody- or even about Rees' vampire dwelling world.  I thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys lighthearted, and/or amusing, supernatural novels 
 Film footage was really important.  I did not know that Bush had his car egged when he was inagurated the 1st time.

 Larry Niven may have invented the Kzin, but Paul Chafe has revealed them.  There is more brilliant imagination and invention in this novel than I have seen in almost any other story in the MKW series.  The story starts fast, then picks up speed.  I usually read novels in fits and starts, often taking weeks to finish them; this one I completed in less than a week, making preferential time for it over other reading and tasks.  And I was sorry to see it end.  And Mr. Chafe, among other fine touches, draws in an element from the work of Cordwainer Smith.  Bravo, Mr. Chafe!  I am envious of your talent.

 Final Gifts is a VERY SPECIAL BOOK.  It is a guide for those who have never witnessed the death of a loved one or someone who is approaching death.  The authors are exquisitely sensitive to the needs of the dying.  The book is a vehicle for enabling the grieving living and dying to come to terms with fate and appreciate the wonders of life's final journey.  Although not esposing religion, the experiences expressed have considerable spiritual content.  It is a book one can read quickly, or as I preferred, to read in sections, contemplate, and read on 
 I am mostly a low energy, armchair traveller but enjoy photography and reading about exciting new places and activities. This magazine has fit all these criterias. Outside focuses on exploring different locales that are extremely exciting as opposed to standard vacation hotspots such as Florida, the Carribbean, or Hawaii. The articles transport you to rafting Victoria Falls, deep water dives in South Africa, Alaskan fishing and hiking, plus lots of remote places such as Dominica or the Seychilles. I love how vibrant and rich the photography is and how well covered the articles are. Mind you there is something wondeful about reading magazines that highlight typical vacation spots, but for the adventuresome who like off the cuff travels, reclusive lodges, eco-villages, and remote islands this would be more your speed.   
 David Horowitz started out as a hippie and like Cartman, I wanted to kick him in the nuts. He eventually figured out that life is very much NOT like the commune and straightened out. It has been said that the difference between a liberal and a conservative is a job and the job that David Horowitz has taken upon himself is that of defender of the faith. He sees that the Hippie-holdover crowd has now moved into the system to bend it to their vision as they were unsuccessful influencing it from the outside. Just as the liberals have had little success with legislation-based change, they have instigated change by judicial fiat and litigation-imposed law, completely bypassing the legislature and the people's will.  I was particularly amused by the review which states: "One has to ask: What is the credential to write such a book? Must peace be studied only by certain professionals narrowly trained in political science? Remember, when the United States and the Soviet Union were locked in the all-out nuclear arms race, mathematicians such as John von Neumann made a great strategic contribution to prevent the doomsday scenario from becoming reality for Americans. If Barash is discredited for being a zoologist originally, can we discredit Newton as a mathematician just because he was a physicist?"   Yes, like Linus Pauling had no reason to express an opinion on nutrition, a zoologist has no opinion worth hearing on 'peace'. What is military strategy, but mathematics? The oblivion-nature of this thought (or lack of same) was highly amusing.  Read this book.

 I read this book cover to cover, and remained interested throughout.  It covers a wide variety of topics - just about everything you want, and a few you don't, including how to straighten a wheel (simple answer - get someone else to do it).  Some of the content isn't explained enough - like what bike to do this on, where to get special tools, etc.  Also, the info on fiberglass repair isn't quite correct - you need to fiberglass both sides of the repair, not just the inside as instructed.  All in all, great book, great pictures, well written

 Released at a time when the publishing industry rarely released novels which weren't inspirational or traditionally wholesome, Grace Metalious's still critically disregarded Peyton Place (1956) radically changed the course of American publishing. Reputed to have outsold every other title of its era with the exception the Bible, Peyton Place was considered scandalous at best and obscene for its frank assessment of human sexuality at worst. The novel was typically purchased and read in secrecy; despite its publication in the post-Kinsey era, a generation of readers looked to the book as a potential instructional manual in the rudiments of sexual intercourse.   But Peyton Place was hardly unprecedented: Erskine Caldwell's hugely popular Tobacco Road (1932) and God's Little Acre (1933) both contained tart and undisguised sexual content, while Gore Vidal's The City and the Pillar (1948) provided its audience with a straight forward examination of homosexuality.   Peyton Place is a well written (a single short chapter, intended to be humorous, about race and flatulence, which certainly should have been cut, mars the otherwise pristine prose), economically told, and psychologically astute expose of the lives of the citizens of a small New Hampshire town. Though the town is divided into warring Roman Catholics and Protestants, it is the high WASP culture that receives the brunt of Metalious's umbrage throughout. Taking place in the 1930s and 1940s, the book immediately assumes--and never relaxes--an unblinking ethical and moral stance against the hypocrisies of American cultural life. Like a Fury out of Greek myth, Metalious mercilessly pursues--and eventually punishes--those who marry for wealth, prestige and other forms of personal gain, the arrogant, the pretentious, the greedy, the actively insensitive, the coarse, the cowardly, and the brutal.    Peyton Place is a town with at least one literal skeleton hanging in its closets--as well as a hotbed of scheming wives, adulterous husbands, abusive and domineering spouses, calculating couples, daughters who have been raped by their stepfathers, sons smothered by their `devouring' mothers, and children of privilege spoiled in every conceivable manner. There are alcoholics who collectively go on six week binges, ethics-torn doctors, passive young boys who learn to crave enemas, romantically frustrated "widows," despairing teachers, callous paramours, sexually licentious young girls, faithless church leaders, petty minded, vengeful gossips, and at least one reclusive woman considered to be insane by the surrounding community.   But despite their stereotypical modes of behavior, Metalious's characters are never mere stereotypes or reductive caricatures. Nor is Peyton Place wholly a cesspool, though most of its very human characters are actively tainted with `sin' of some kind: both Allison McKenzie and Selena Cross, the protagonists, are intelligent, curious, and inherently decent young women who strive to improve their lives. Mother-dominated Norman Page reads Swinburne and Thoreau and has intellectual aspirations, the influential Dr. Swain fights for the rights of the poor and the oppressed, while virile interloper and school principal Tom Makris, perhaps the most balanced, rational, and realistically drawn character, speaks the blunt and unadorned truth to everyone he encounters.   In addition to the book's sexual content--which is indeed crisply pointed at times--what probably outraged most social leaders of the era was the presentation of the American small town--as well as the character of the typical American--as harsh, desperate, unforgiving, predatory, bigoted, shallow, and mean-spirited. While the author's barbed vision flew openly in the face of Fifties cultural sentimentality, Metalious, who died at the age of thirty-nine from alcoholism, was clearly an early rider on the wave that would sweep across the next decade, leaving little, if anything, of American's formerly emotionally idealistic opinion of itself intact.   Nor surprisingly, the novel, which was followed by a creatively and commercially successful sequel, inspired a fairly diluted, if rather polished, film adaptation (which in turn produced a sequel of its own), as well as a long-running television series.    
 This sad, moving film showcases emerging brilliance of young DeNiro, with the underrated Moriarty also turning in a superb performance. Both baseball fans and devotees of great film alike should readily agree on this title.  
 Terrific information, a must buy for anyo camper/hiker visiting New Mexico 
 This was one of the most enjoyable books I've read all year! Very funny and full of interesting information. The guy is a hoot! I especially loved the chapter about his trip to Myrtle Beac 
 Public Relations on the Net successfully covers all the basics that pr pros should already know.  Neophytes would be well-advised to learn these basics.  But, that is where Holtz stops.  For learning more advanced methods about pr on the net, I found Guerrilla PR: Wired by Michael Levine to successfully handle the advanced techniques.  Holtz's book is not without merit, but if you're in the industry, then it's highly unlikely you'll learn anything new here.  Well-written, though 
 I have the original 1957 book which is falling apart because of use when I was a child.  I recently purchased two Betty Crocker's Cookbook for Boys and Girls to give as gifts for two young women who were looking for a great sugar cookie recipe to make with their children.  The one in this cookbook is the best!!  In fact I used it so much growing up I gave the recipe to my grandmother who continued to bake these cookies and send them to me when I was in college.  With so many complicated and fancy recipes out there today, it was great to see this book still in print.  A must have for families with young children!   
 It was a very good book! It got exciting sometimes and sad other times. That is why Iliked this book. 
 Excellent primer about this modern conflict minus the spin, controversy, and commercial interruptions...  1. John Keegan is without a doubt, one of the most highly respected military historians alive. If you're not familiar with his work, I'd highly recommend The Mask of Command (Alexander the Great, U.S Grant, Wellington, Hitler) and The Face of the Battle. (Waterloo, Somme, Agincourt)   2. In The Iraq War, a short book and quick read, he starts with a brief history of Iraq, the rise of Saddam, the first Gulf War, and the most recent conflict. He ends with a postscript that details event in Iraq as recently as October 2004.   A few points:  In the minds of many, the decision to go to war, the actual conflict, and the handling of recent events is politically charged, controversial, and even questionable in terms of the legitimate use of force. Regardless of your position, this book is a good informative read. Keegan skirts almost all controversy to describe the motives to go war and the execution of the conflict with complete clarity. It's a quick read. He takes you from the allied forces crossing the Kuwait border to the fall of Baghdad in about 40 pages.    The brief section regarding Saddam's rise to power is fascinating. Appendix 2, which is a summation of his discussion with General Franks is also interesting and well organized: esp. Frank's description of the five fronts in Iraq and the use of deceptive operations.   Hardcore fans of Keegan will no doubt be disappointed. (This is the historian with the ability to take you into the minds of Alexander the Great, Wellington, and Adolph Hitler with ease; and describe their campaigns with the same effortless and highly readable prose.   You have to take this book for what it is: a brief expose on the current conflict. Also, towards the end of the book, Keegan even states that not enough time has passed to give the conflict true historical perspective.   If the only thing you know about the Iraq War, Saddam, and the history of Iraq is limited to television news coverage, I'd highly recommend this book 
 This book picks up where the author's Anxiety and Phobia Workbook left off.  The affirmations in the back alone are worth the price of the book, which presents a wide variety of ideas for living a more peaceful and satisfying life. The author is obviously a highly sensitive and caring therapist with a deep understanding of these problems.  Highly recommended 
 William Dufty's book was an addictive read, very hard to put down. Read it, get the motivation to go sugarfree, feel great, but warnings - research sweetener alternatives before using them. Make sure the research did not come from the company that made the product, to avoid bias.  My suggestions are Stevia for tea, xylitol for anything else. We found like others that the first month was the hardest, but after that, sucrose cravings went away, and a piece of fruit or some sultanas were enough to stem any desire. 
 I bought this book to find out how to help my 10 year old with some basic friendship issues.  This book was VERY basic and geared for a younger child, but I feel that it is a great book for any parent.  My daughter read it also and said that she thought it was very helpful, but a little too "kiddy" for her taste 
 The Race delivers on the promise of an intensely educational and suspenseful read. I learned much more than I expected to about multihull design, sailing history, and the characters involved in circumnavigation adventures, but I was also viscerally "there" during the more stressful parts of the Race itself. Zimmerman provides exceptional context as well as insight into what makes these men and their sailing machines run. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone curious about the quest for speed across the waves 
 I absolutely LOVE this book. The ending shocked me and it was a riveting page turner. Do not miss this book! I've read SEVERAL of Robert's novels and find this one to be the best!! 
 In this book you will learn alot about your ability as a healer and about yourself in general. Master Chau Kok Sui teaches you how to proform pranic healing...this is a cook book for pranic healing, no frills and very easy  to read.  After reading just the basics of getting started, I was able to  heal my wife of her neck and shoulder pain and her head aches. For years I  have been trying to find what I wanted to do with my life. Now that I have  read this book I know exactly what I want to do...  Thank you so much  Master Chao Kok Sui 
 I've been facinated with motorcycles most of my life.  Reading this book just reinforces my "hidden obsession" -- one I hope to make a reality soon :)  The real stories of women and their rides will inspire anyone to get out there and ride -- no matter your background :)  From historical women who pioneered the road (before the roads were ANYTHING like we know) to today's high speed racers.  Pictures in the book add to the story, they don't detract.  The book is so awesome, my husband reads it :)      
 ... Do it now!  The filter hidden in the bottom of the water resivour is a necessary item that can be easy to overlook.  About two weeks ago it just popped into my head that the filter was coming up for it's recommended change-out, so I ordered a replacement pack.  My jaw about dropped when I saw the filth and garbage that would have made it into my beloved morning coffee had it not been for this small packet of charcoal.  Seriously, it was very gross.  If you have the Krups, get the filters.  If you live in a third-world trash-dump, change them often 
 This is a great novel. It is easy to ready but not easy to get into since it is a little bit slow and dark from the first page. However, the story evolves and slowly grows on you.  I found the book a great description of one perspective of love, an unsatisfied love that keeps growing until it finally consumes the lovers.  Some of the paragraphs are great to read in the way they explain the emotional struggle of the characters.  Highly recommended 
 Rarely does one come across a book written in a manner easily understandable and explaining the secret of the universe.  It is easy to talk about a book, but difficult to talk about what a book is about.  Nevertheless, for those on the path with diligence and fortitude the secret can be obtained.  The path is illuminated not by one who points the way and says go get it, but by one who is there and says come here.  I have read a few other books on the subject and whilst other authors become hazy or pontificate, giving me the impression of at best second hand knowledge and not true understanding, Sifu Kit makes it all seem so self-evident.  As a man with true understanding, Kit approaches the subject from several directions allowing the reader to chose the path he is most comfortable with.  He explains that in many cases help may be required in the form of a master, but the secret is waiting.  I look foreward to our meeting 
 Well for one, Do you even own this rifle?  And two, you're ruining the moment pal, I mean c,mon! "Airsoft Forums" please.  It's a waste of time.  Why not try actually going to one of these tournaments.  I don't wanna sound like a jackass, but it's true.  I own over a dozen high quality rifles and SMG's that price way over two hundred bucks and this one is the only one I was willing to spend the least on.  Let's just say I was bored to I buy rifles and whatever else relating to airsoft.  To put it short for whoever's reading this, THIS RIFLE ROCKS! GET IT!  GET IT WHILE THERE'S STILL TIME 
 Out of prison & unleashed on Flatpoint once again, for the first time.  A prequel to the best politically incorrect TV comedy perhaps ever (at least besides All In the Family).  Laughs galore as Jerri tries to adjust to life outside the harsh penal system.  It is not easy, especially for everyone inside Jerri's "chow zone".  You may take a beating or perhaps loose a finger, but Jerri is loyal to her bitches.  If anyone messes with her friends, she'll stick 'em with a shive in the showers.  Violent slapstick, vulgar sexual content and other delights await 
 Enter W.T. Melon Elementary School and join the third-graders in the classroom at the end of the hall. Some very odd things happen in that special classroom. Mr. Leeks, the custodian, tells everyone who will listen that he hears noises coming from inside that room, even late at night. Once, Mr. Leeks was outside cleaning and looked through the classroom window only to see someone sitting at the teacher's desk! Mr. Leeks promises that he saw the ghost of W.T. Melon sitting there, plain as day, teaching an invisible class. Of course, that is impossible since Mr. Melon died over twenty years ago.   While you read about the third-graders in the classroom at the end of the hall, you will watch nine kids have some amazing things happen to them. For example, Roger is the class Pain-in-the-Neck. But after a visit from a dust genie that changes. Then there is Emily who is a very tidy girl, except for her desk. When a desk pest makes her desk his home, she changes her ways. Let us not forget Kenneth either. He finds reading to be difficult. But a magical book that tells the future makes reading a joy.   ***** Nine tales grace this book's pages. Each story is accompanied by wondrous illustrations that will bring any young child's imagination to life. This is perfect as a first chapter book for pre-schoolers, if parents have been helping their child to read early. Most kids will be able to read it by first or second grade. Parents would do well to purchase this book and read one story (one chapter) to their children before putting them to bed. It not only makes for wonderful bed time tales, but also help the kids get an early start on reading. The stories are so delightful that children may ask for a story from this book, instead the normal ones. Very well done! Highly recommended! *****   Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews 
 We got this corkscrew as a wedding present over two years ago, and it is one of our favorite and most used gifts.  I was a bit intimidated of it at first, but once I figured it out, it was a breeze!  It opens both rubber and cork with equal ease.  The only problem we have experienced is that a little plastic piece of the foil remover broke off and now it doesn't stay locked in very well.  Otherwise, we love this corkscrew and highly recommend it to all 
 Sing to the Lord is a pretty good effort from the PAJAM crew.  Most of the songs are up-tempo and there's not a great offering of worship songs (i.e. - songs that really take you into the presence of God).  "Worthy is the Lamb" is good though.  I have heard some of the arrangements of CCM artists', and enjoy them better than some of the arrangements on this CD.    I believe "Sing" and "All About You" have been sung by Martha Munizzi.  I like her renditions better.  Sing is written by Israel Houghton and Aaron Lindsey.  All About You is written by Israel Houghton and Cindy Cruse Ratcliff.  "Trading My Sorrows" is pretty nice, but again I like Israel Houghton's rendition.    I agree that praise and worship should cross racial boundaries.  It helps that black artists have been putting an urban spin on some of the CCM arrangements; however, in my opinion, some of the songs on this project slightly miss the mark.  It seems as if some songs invite the presence of God, while other songs seem empty, if you know what I mean.    My favorites include "I Need You More," "Worthy is the Lamb (I like the vocal arrangement)," "Open the Eyes of my Heart," and "Rescue." 
   I really liked this version more than the modern remake in some ways. The sketchiness of the effects served to make them more frightening, actually; more potential for collateral damage. In an odd way the Martians, with their frighening but alos less precise weapons were strangely intimate villains, like humans in their lack of precision.  Except for the occasionally shreiky heroine and the sappy religiosity, this movie was a good show.  The director took time to actualy make characters out of the characters, so everyone had a personality. They also painted a broad picture of the wohle world under attack, not just America, and there was something poignant about the way nations were depicted as handing off information at great risk to themselves.       In short, I wish they made more movies like this.  
 I recall most critics trashing this film 15 years ago when it was new. I heard an especially vicious critique on NPR, of all places. Then I saw it, and liked it very much. Of course it is sentimental and manipulative, but all films are manipulative. I liked Harrison's work, and I even liked Annette Bening, which does not always happen for me. Most of us wonder whether, if we suffered a serious brain injury or a spinal cord break, if we would survive, and cope. This film shows one fictional guy facing that crisis, and becoming a better man for having lost some of his mental toughness and job skills. Those who sneer at this touching film perhaps have already lost the humane sense that Harrison Ford's character acquires through suffering. 
 "Boogie Nights" is an entertaining soundtrack that is a lot of fun.  Melanie's silly tease "Brand New Key" with its simple melody & her coy vocals put a smile on my face, "For somebody who don't drive, I've been all around the world; Some people say I've done all right for a girl."  The Emotions' "Best of My Love" pumps hard with its infectious beat and their soulful vocals.  "Spill the Wine" by War with Eric Burdon on lead vocals is a timepiece with the flute giving it a Jethro Tull feel, "I dreamed that I was in a Hollywood movie & that I was the star of the Hollywood movie."  Walter Egan wasn't around long, but "Magnet & Steel" is a sweet retro track that has a pretty melody, great background vocals and a full arrangement to back his tender vocals, "With you I'm not shy."  The Beach Boys' "God Only Knows" is a dear Brian Wilson melody that I used to turn up whenever it came on the radio.  This soundtrack is a blast from the past but wears well with its excellent selection of sounds.  Enjoy 
 Every album the Jackson brothers put out was excellent, but DESTINY is THE one. I have not found one flaw with this album. The brothers pretty much took over songwriting and production duties by this time, and it just goes to show how much talent they really possess. Without a doubt, much of the magic here must be pointed towards Michael with his amazing vocals.  BLAME IT ON THE BOOGIE - A fun dance tune with a very catchy chorus and great rhythm.  PUSH ME AWAY - Deep, deep lyrics and Michael's oh-so-emotional voice place this song up into one of my many favorites.   THINGS I DO FOR YOU - Great dance tune with a very good subject! The Jackson brothers do not hesitate to speak their minds.  SHAKE YOUR BODY (DOWN TO THE GROUND) - Words can't describe this magic song! Very simple dance epic. Break out your dancing shoes and get a workout with Michael and company.  DESTINY - a very nice song and a unique sound for the Jacksons.  BLESS HIS SOUL - beautiful song with a great chorus...love that "dangerous" part.  ALL NIGHT DANCIN' - another dance track, not as powerful as SHAKE YOUR BODY, but very energetic.  THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR BEING POLITE - Wow! Michael and Randy have touched on a subject that is so very true. Lyrics are very deep here, yet the song doesn't touch "depressing". Just a simple song with a very deep subject.  This album is a must-have. I think I'd have to say it is better than TRIUMPH, which is a superior album in its own right, yet not as original in my opinion 
 'Jane and Prudence' is what I would call a 'universe' novel, rather than a 'things happen' one.  Pym draws one into the quietly complex world of her characters.  Jane is a charmingly dithery clergyman's wife, deep in her own  literary world and consequently always saying and doing not quite the right  thing.  There is much irony in this novel, especially in the way characters  relate to each other.  Pym exposes the petty prejudices and selfish  scheming manouvres of ordinary people.  Although this is not what you'd  call a nail-biter, I found 'Jane and Prudence' very engaging, and a  pleasure to read 
 If you have never sewn before or are just starting, this book is not for you.  The author assumes someone reading this book has some intermediate sewing skills.  The techniques in this book are useful, when you want to go from making a plain old patch/seam pocket to a double welt, bound buttonholes instead of the ghetto machine stitched ones, and there is really good information about facings, interfacing, and lining.    The best part of this book, the clincher, was the back section on drafting, altering and copying patterns.  As a self-taught fledgling fashion designer, I need all of the references I can get on pattern drafting.  This section is pretty thorough, with different copying methods on a variety of garments and garment parts.  There are two things I don't like about this book, however.  The first is the name dropping, while it was nice to know which designer the certain techniques were used by, it could have been toned down a bit.  The second was the Design Worksheet in the very back, the body template drawing is horribly ugly and way out of proportion 
 THIS IS AS CLOSE AS FLEETWOOD MAC GETS TO AN OPERA OUTSIDE OF"RUMORS". EVERY SONG ON THIS CD HAS DEEP MEANING. DANNY KIRWAN IS JUST INCREDIBLE, HIS SONGS SPARKLE AND SHINE.

 From an interesting time when the world was a more friendly place for searchers. Still a sign of hope for those who are perplexed in some way 
 Great book! Fast Service. Must read for the church leaders of today 
 We have 3 girls all under the age of 5, and we're huge fans of Dora. So, the familiar characters, themes, colors and storylines keep our girls' attention and interest much better than the highly recommended Bob Books. Our 2-year old screams out the correct answers, our 4-year old works on her sounds & phonics, and our 5-year old is determined to read all the short sentences herself...and we just bought the series 4 days ago. 
 Anything from Dahl is wonderful, even if it's not his. 
 Janis Joplin put out a handful of studio albums in her lifetime, and there have since been scores of Janis compilations after her passing. This collection is unique in that it really shows how powerful Janis Joplin was in concert. Whether she belts out heartbreaking songs or raps with the audience, this album shows how much fun she must have been to see live.  I read her biography "Buried Alive" by Myra Friedman, who was one of Janis' managers. One of the things that sticks in my memory was that seeing Janis Joplin live was a "roll of the dice." When she was on her game, you would see a fantastic concert you would never forget. When she was having a bad night, it was a thorough disaster.  Many of us are too young to have seen Janis Joplin live, but this CD has probably captured some of her more prime moments. I mean, if these tunes were her off nights, then her good nights must have been the purest of epiphanies!   The album starts off hot with "Down On Me," a song she recorded with Big Brother & the Holding Company. The studio version was good, but this live piece leaves the former in the dust! Ditto with "Bye, Bye Baby," a whimsical but almost upbeat song of lost love.   Before going into "All is Loneliness," she introduces the tune by telling the audience about Moondog, the 60s underground poet who penned the song. Moondog, who passed away in the past few years, is one of those counter-culture figures who will never be remembered on the level of the Kerouacs and Dylans. I love when these little near-forgotten icons and tales of eras past make the final cut of concert albums, like a little historical footnote for future generations of music buffs.   One of my personal favorites on this album is "Flower in the Sun," a fall-from-grace tune that, if you didn't focus on the lyrics, would sound like an high-energy song of empowerment. When you listen closely to the lyrics, it works surprisingly well with the contrasting pace of the song.   While hits like "Piece of My Heart" and "Half Moon" don't soar above the studio cuts like the abovementioned songs, they are still excellent takes. And "Ball and Chain......" I would lay odds that even on her worst night, Janis Joplin could hit that song home. There is something about the way she belts out that song, be it studio or live recording, that will give you goosebumps.  This is one of those great albums that was always readily available in the days of LP past, and is still very available on CD. "Joplin In Concert" is a rare gem of a live album that any Joplin fan should pick up in case it goes out of print.        
 This book was excellent!  It was a prime example of what not to get used to!  All the characters were well developed, the storyline flowed without being boring or long winded.  I could see the characters and surroundings as I read.  I would love to see this as an HBO or Showtime movie.  I have no complaints at all about this one 
 Particle physicist and cosmologist Alan Guth has a very logical mind. This is not surprising, since it was his painstaking and persistent analysis of magnetic monopole production in grand unified theories that led him, step by step, to one of the great breakthroughs of 20th-century science, the discovery of the cosmic inflation that conjured our universe out of a speck of vacuum far smaller than a proton.  Guth's systematic, thorough qualities come through in _The Inflationary Universe_, his 1997 history of the discovery of inflation. He starts at the beginning, with the principles of conservation, Newtonian and relativistic views of space, time, matter and gravity, quantum theory, the discovery of the expanding universe, etc. It's not until Chapter 10, 167 pages into the book, that Guth starts to explain inflation.   It's well worth the wait. I found his explanations thoughtful and lucid. For readers who want more detail, he provides even more thorough explanatory footnotes, endnotes, a very helpful glossary, and appendices on why the energy of a gravitational field is negative, Newton's idea of an infinite static universe, blackbody radiation, and units and measures.   Of course the book is now eight years old. Guth mentions the possibility that the rate of expansion of the universe is speeding up, which we now know to be the case from observations that came out a year or two after his book. And he just touches on string theories.  On the other hand, Guth's speculations at the end of the book on the existence of an infinite number of universes, and on the possibility that a super-advanced technology could be used to create new universes, are as clear, convincing and mind-bending as any I've read.  Anyone who takes the time to read the entire book will come away with a very solid and authoritative understanding of the development of modern cosmology from its roots to the current bouquet of inflationary theories.  I recommend it strongly to readers who want a deeper understanding of cosmology, both in terms of the history of the field, and the underlying physics.

 King Turd is a French play written by Alfred Jarry. At the time he wrote the play he was 15 years old. King Turd is a collection of three plays Ubu Roi, Ubu Enchaine, and Ubu Cuco. He wrote the play Ubu Roi to perform with marionettes for some cash in 1888. The play was first performed with live actors in 1896.  Ubu Roi was the first to be written, it follows the story of Papa Turd and Mama Turd who try overthrowing the government to become the king and queen of Poland. Ubu Enchaine was written after Alfred Jarry some wrote other plays. It is the exact opposite of Ubu Roi following Papa Turd and Mama Turd as they try to become slaves. Ubu Cuco is a considerably headier story then the previous. The plot follows Papa Turd's encounters many gods, the higher class, and his conscience.  The story is usually considered a satire of Shakespeare. That is true, many of the characters are very similar to characters in plays by Shakespeare. But Ubu is also a satire of everything in late 19th century France. Things like money grabbing politicians and a stupid public are still around today. Therefore it is still relevant. Because Ubu Roi was written by a 15 year old it contains very simple language and is often nursery rhyme like. If you can read French it is better to read the book in French to catch all the word puns that Alfred Jarry wrote.  The character of Papa Turd is one of the most interesting characters I have ever met in a book. He was one of the first characters in a novel to use language that is still considered naughty over 100 years later. The character of Papa Turd can be seen through his master plan "start by grabbing all the money, then kill everybody and leave." King Turd is an extremely humorous book. It is highly recommended to someone who wants something more then Shakespeare and the Family Circus. 
 If your interested in west African Cichlids this book is a must.  Includes detailed pictures of Pelvicachromis, Nanochromis, and many more species, with both male and female identified. Also includes short description of species habitat and water parameters. This book makes identification easy 
 Crime and Punishment is my favorite book, but that's not what I want to say here. What I must say is simply this: you are not required to read this book, and you are certainly not required to *like* this book, but to dismiss it, to disrespect the fantastic amount of painstaking artistic labor that Dostoeyevsky put into his masterpiece is both ignorant and wrong.  On a side note, I do recognize that some people actually *are* required to read Crime and Punishment for their course work. I find this deeply regrettable; I probably would have hated it too if I hadn't read it by choice 
 There are a few books one would like to give six stars, and above all of them there is this ten star book. As everyting has been said about The Elements, I would review this particular edition rather than The Elements itself.  First of all, this is a one single volume (be aware of Dover's 10$ book, it is only one thrid of the whole). This is usefull, of course, but to me it adquires an extra relevance in this particular item. The Elements may be the best math book ever (including Newton's Principia), so I just didn't want a book, but a beautifull book. This is the only time I chose the hardcover edition, and I think I did right. The book is printed in high quality paper, and the typeface is also beautifull.  As someone has already said, when you are reading through a proposition, and you turn the page, you find the diagram repeated, so that you don't have to be continually back and forth. In this book, where every propositions includes a diagram, this is not a minor advantage.  The final pro is that it is not interspersed with Heath's notes. "Euclid Alone has looked on beauty bare", so you better take this edition rather than the Dover's one. The book can be followed from the first proposition til the very last one, so no coments should be interspersed. Any critical notes about the propositions should be either at the end of each of Euclid's books, or if they are very extense, as Heath's ones, in a separated volume. To understanding The Elements, this edition prefaces suffice (and I even think that some parts are unnecesary, sometimes becoming redundant).  Green Lion Press has done a good job in providing us this beautifull one-volume edition 
 If, like me, you are an old-fashioned Christmas-season lover, you will love Solstice IV.  It provides a quality variation from the Top 40 Christmas renditions.  This is "quiet by the tree and fire" music.  My other favorite Soltice is #II. I play them in all four seasons 
 A fantastic addition to the Vampire Chronicles depicting the life/death and Undead times of Marius, the vampire guardian of Those Who Must Be Kept. As entertaining and enthralling as all the other installments 
 Peter Lynch writes well and this book has some classic wisdom that lets you into his mind.  One drawback is that Mr. Lynch may sometimes forget just how smart he is and tends to over simplify some aspects of investing analysis that come to him naturally.  For example, asking a clerk at a retail store what sells well is a technique Mr. Lynch will use on occasion to evaluate a stock.  However, it's key to note that he also has a great deal of resources in the form of advanced technology and research tools, not to mention personal genius.    This book is highly recommended and can be a great tool for a business owner or investor but I'd caution most non-professionals on reading this and thinking they can become the next Peter Lynch with little more than a computer and a brokerage account.  Good book, thanks Mr. Lynch. 
 This book is possibly just as important, if not more important now as ever before. Dewey asserts that true learning occurs by experience (labs, experiments, hands-on activities) and not by fact-learning and regurgitation of statements. It is important to note that he also claims that not all experiences are "educative."   As contemporary educational philosophy shifts to more a more standardized curriculum and testing methods (i.e. No Child Left Behind) educators need to review this American philosopher's ideas because the quality of education is becoming more "miseducative." If the current trend of education continues in the same direction I can only assume that Literature classes will also be reduced to multiple-choice tests. One can only assume that Dewey is cursing contemporary education from his grave.  This is a great text for the message and philosophy contained within its pages. It is extremely concise and takes a couple of hours to read. I recommend this to all educators at every level.  Also recommended: "The School and Society & The Child and the Curriculum" by John Dewey 
 My husband had been telling me about this movie for years.  Most of the lead actors have unfortunately passed away.  A very young Denzel has a small, but pivotal role.  This is a great movie 
 my granddaughter turned 6 the day after Christmas so she had too many toys. My daughter says that she feels that Amazing Allison is so real that she scares my granddaughter a little. Maybe she would be better with an older child. The ethnic part is great because my granddaughter is hispanic. We feel that once the christmas gifts calm down that she will start to enjoy Allison. 
 I watched this again just before Peter Boyle passed on.  Superb movie with great actors.   A classic you'll watch more than once 
 Stereotypes are created not born.  Living in a post-9/11 world and the attitudes that Americans have on Islam, Muslims, and Arabs, we can see how Hollywood has place a bit of a role.  Jack Shaheen catalogues over 900 films, most of which have negative stereotypes about Arabs and Muslims.  With movies and other media being constantly consumed by the masses, when something it shown to them over and over again, it becomes ingrained into the psyche. As for the reviewers who say that the stereotypes are the truth are probably that 13 % who hate Arabs and Muslims no matter what. We cannot blame an entire religion or race for the acts of a few. This book exposes the danger of presenting stereotypes in films and how a people get villified for it 
 Joe Cocker's first studio release of the 90's proves to be an enjoyable listen.  "Night Calls" sold over 2 million copies in Germany alone upon it's release.  The cd opens with the Bryan Adams tune "Feels Like Forever" which is a fantastic ballad that would have been a monster hit if radio stations in the U.S would have given it some airtime?  It's so true that Joe can make a song his own.  The majority of his covers usually outshine the originals.  Wait till you hear his takes on "Can't Find My Way Home" and "Love Is Alive".  They blow the original versions away by Steve Winwood and Gary Wright.  The title track has a little ELO overtone thanks to a great production job by Jeff Lynne.  Joe also lends his vocal chords to a fantastic gospel feel remake of the Beatles "You've Got To Hide Your Love Away" complete with a church like chorus.  Joe is like fine wine that keeps getting better with age.  The most disticntive growl in rock n roll never sounded better 
 The strength of this book is in combining thorough coverage of the published research with practical, easily applicable advice.  The authors know all the academic studies, explain them in a way that we nonspecialists can understand, and digest them into a clear, very usable strategy. Both authors have years of real-world, top-level bond trading experience, which also makes their advice especially useful; but the coverage of research, for me, is what sets the book apart. If you know nothing at all about bonds, I wouldn't necessarily start with it (I think it assumes you are not an absolute beginner); but once you have a sense of the basics, this book is essential reading, on the shortest short list. 
 I enjoyed KAREN'S SCHOOL MYSTERY because it was interesting and fun to read.  It kept my attention focused on what would happen next in the story.   As members of the Red Brigade they were kind in the way they used their power. I also liked how Karen and Addie worked together as a team. Neither one of them tried to be the boss. They worked together as equals, and at the end of the story, they were both honored for their work in catching the thieves 
 I have read the entire series and am not a Christian fanatic or anything like that but this is great!  I am totally consumed by the characters and the correlation to Revelations the author has produced. I keep wondering what will happen next, between the skies burning and the winds moaning, I cannot put these down once I start. If you have ever wondered what might happen based on the teachings of the Book of Revelations, these are must read fiction. The inter-twining of the characters makes the series encompass all types of people and how they would react if they thought the world was coming to an end. Absolutely the best series I have read in 35 years. I can't wait for Book 5!    
 First and foremost, The Deep Dark is a really enjoyable read.   If you've ever worked or lived around men who work hard for a living, whether it's in mines, steel mills, logging or commercial fishing, you'll recognize the men in this book.  They range from hard-drinking live-for-the-moment types to family men who garden, work on their cars or collect stamps. It never felt like I was reading an important history of events that helped transorm an industry - but I was.  For many of us who grew up in the 60s and 70s, network news was how we learned about what was going on in the world.  History books in school ended around WWII, but classes rarely made it past the Civil War.  Gregg Olsen has done lots of research and covers the human aspects of this event that would never make it into  books or onto the news though.  I am really grateful to have the opportunity to get enough information, in such an entertaining way, that I feel like I have a little bit of real understanding of the events of that week in 1972.  The pace kept me up late at night and and the intensity of the story filled my eyes with tears more than once.  
 Wendy McClure's memoir is a funny, heartfelt story about modern life as a twenty- or thirty-something.  McClure happens to be larger than the average/ideal/typical/whatever single female.  She's a girl who sits in a bar, waiting for friends, and gets told by an older, drunk man that she would be much happier and fulfilled if only she could buckle down and lose thirty pounds.  When she does decide to lose weight, her goals include being able to shop in any store she wants, to be judged on something other than her looks, to blend in like any other smart, funny, single woman.  While a weight loss journey is what ties the entire narrative together, the success of the book rests on McClure's spot-on observations and humor.  I enjoyed my time with Wendy, and I'd love to read more about her life.  Don't miss out on her book of kooky Weight Watcher's recipe cards:  The Amazing Mackerel Pudding Plan 
 This book is honestly the most thorough guide I have come across for sex.  Far beyond just typical, and not so typical, intercourse facts!  I loved the chapters that dealt with fantasies and S&M.  I knew the book was special when I checked the index before purchasing it to see that it actually acknowledges female ejaculation!!  This is an elusive topic and an even more elusive event in most women's sex lives and I was so pleased to see a book that will educate partners to help achieve this mind blowing effect!  A fantastic book that all of my girlfriends have now read after my recommendation 
 This compilation of short stories was used for my Intro. to the Short Story college course. Our professor only picked out certain stories but I found myself reading unassigned stories myself. Some of these stories are wonderful. My favorite was "The Widow's Son" by Mary Lavin. Some other noteworthy stories: "Hills Like White Elephants" Hemingway, "Girl" by J. Kincaid. Too many more to list, a course book I am actually keeping so I can finish reading it. Usually I can't wait to close them after the course and not see them anymore! : 
  It's never too late to get with the program.  See my primary review of "The Five Love Languages" for additional details.  This author has a simple formula, easy to understand and easy to apply.  This book is the best possible gift for both new and long-standing parents, especially in this age to two-income families, striving to fit too much into each day, and in the face of the Internet and television as a corosive alternative to parenting.  I'm no saint--barely competent as a parent--this book is in my case a badly needed intervention.  It took three children for me to figure this stuff out.  Buy five copies and gently make a difference to five families 
 A spectacular book everyone should have the pleasure of reading 
 This is a great DVD for anyone researching the character and personality of Idi Amin 
 Great for home theater, just as good for listening to music.  Very happy with the product, has more features than I need.  Easily adjusted, easily connected 
 This is wonderful, mellow album takes me to higher place when I lay back and listen. It makes Nick of Time sound like overproduced 80's pop. Bonnie felt this material deeply and it shows in every song. This isn't an experiment, but a smooth, natural sounding recording with rich, clear vocals. Close your eyes and it sounds like Bonnie and her band are right in the room. Her latest, Silver Lining is also very strong, but I am one of those who think Fundamental is superb. Bonnie Raitt continues to record brilliant albums 
 Well, there he is, the fat kid from Long island who finally gets a record deal and gets his first record produced by the powerful (Cream) and brilliant (just listen to later Mountain in the studio!) Felix Pappalardi.  This is no crack back-up band as some have said---while the drummer wasn't the best, and would be replaced by the Hard Rockin' Corky Laing on the first true Mountain album, 1970s 'Climbing!'---the bass player is one to listen to:  none other than Felix himself!    Just listen to the grinding unison riff of Blood of the Sun----what you are hearing is the beginning of one of the most ferocious, hard rock bands ever---their signature 'heavy', driving sound, as in Mississippi Queen and Never In My Life.  The fact is, ONLY Mountain sounded like that...They were clearly one of the great American Hard Rock bands of that era (as were Grand Funk Railroad, though constantly maligned by the press), and could be outstanding Live on a good night.  This is a raw, in your face example of a young talent and experienced producer, and the result was very good.  Some of the highlights are the gutsy blues 'Blindman', 'Southbound Train', and 'Dreams of Milk and Honey'---the last one a song which would later become part of the band's long, improvisational jam piece live:  the 'Dream Sequence' which can be heard played flawlessly on 1971's 'Flowers of Evil' album.  So while it is not Leslie West at his best---Felix had yet to hone his skills as a guitarist---it is some of his most freewheeling, let it hang-out there playing, a very good first record, and would lead to much BIGGER and better things!  I would say that for all of us hard rockers of the late 60s and early 70s, this record is a classic, and a must have, especially for any youngsters who are interested in what good hard guitar driven rock sounded like in 1969.  American style.  And the record stands the test of time.  'The Lorp 
 Everyone, one way or another. Everyone except maybe Marlowe.  This isn't one of Chandler's better-known stories; as far as I know, it was never made into a movie. Maybe it's just a little too complex for a movie. It starts in the usual way. A young woman, beautiful (if she lets herself be) and in trouble, asks private detective Marlowe for help. She needs to find her brother, a small-town boy who's lost his way in the big bad city.  She's not quite what she claims to be, though, and the brother isn't what he should have been. As the story progresses, Hollywood and all the people in it lose their shine, and get darker and dirtier. And the bodies start to pile up ---  Maybe Chandler didn't invent American noir of the post-WWII era, but he certainly made it his own. If you liked 'The Big Sleep' and 'The Long Goodbye', you're sure to like this as well.  //wiredweir 
  	The Shadow of the Hegemon picks up where Ender's Shadow left off. The children have returned to earth and are trying to restart their lives. From this introduction the book would seem to be a highly boring tale of a bunch of kids trying to get along in life. But Card takes it farther then that. He writes in such a way that you feel a sort of connection with the characters. 	 Card makes this connection easy for the reader. They don't think like you would expect a normal kid too, largely because they are geniuses. They think on an adult level yet their motives are that of a child their age. This combination makes the characters very intricate. It also draws you in as a reader.  	You are able to sympathize with Bean as he struggles against Achilles because his motives are pure. You can see his frustration and his happiness. The fact that the reader is able to connect with the characters is what makes it a good book. Otherwise it's as if you are just along for the ride. But if you feel connected to the characters then the book becomes more then a ride, it becomes a story. 	 As good as the book is, there are still some parts that are a turn off. If you don't appreciate politics then the chances of you enjoying the book are severely diminished. It is vital for at least some of the other books in the series to be read before this one. Otherwise you are left highly confused and it takes away from the book in a big way.  	So if you are looking for a book in which you can connect with the characters, I highly recommend this book. But if you are looking for a child's story to read to your kids, then I recommend you looking somewhere else. 
 This is a good miso base. I make true miso soup, by adding nori seaweed, cutup scallions, tofu, etc. I almost didn't buy it, based on the poor review on a similar product, but I'm glad I did. It's tasty 
 This CD of "The Art of the Theremin" by Clara Rockmore, exceeds my expectations of what I hoped to hear.  It is pure ethereal sound.  Clara Rockmore allows her soul to play an instrument that is soothing and better than a visit to a spa 
 Some seem to feel this book is valueless because it is similar in content to the earlier "The Edgar Rice Burroughs Library of Illustration, Volume One."  Although this may be the personal opinion of one that already owns the earlier collection, I feel there are reasons why this books still deserves a high rating.  Let me start out by saying that I do own the Library of Illustration Vol. One, and that it is a superior product, with high quality reproductions including, color versions of limited color pieces and full color paintings.  It is also out-of-print and expensive on the collectors book market.  I payed $150.00 for my copy, and was only able to get it that cheaply because it was being sold as an isolated volume rather than as a full set.  I purchased this one volume specifically because it was the only book I could find at the time that contained a collection of J. Allen St. John's art.  Although I grew up as a Burroughs fan and a fan and collector of fantasy art, I had never heard of St. John until just a few years ago.  Once I saw a few samples of his art and realised the tremendous debt that artists like Roy Krenkel and Frank Frazetta owed to his pioneering illustrations, I became obsessed to find more of his work.  At the time I found that to be nearly impossible.  I just received my copy of "Grand Master of Adventure Art:  The Drawings of J, Allen St. John" a few days ago and am quite happy with it.  The paperback is perfectly priced for those that want access to a collection of this under-rated master's work.  There are a number of illustrations in this collection that are not in the earlier volume.  This alone might be enough to convince many to pay the very reasonable price of this book.  The second reason to support and laud this book is that it exists at all.  St. John has not been given his due in the history of illustration, and very few still even have heard his name.  Vanguard is practically doing a public service, in my opinion, to get a collection of this man's art back in print, and at a price anyone can pay.  The biographical information provided is sparse, but one can still hope that the upcoming edition of St. John's paintings will contain more.   Personally, I'm just happy to see this great artist back in print and hope that because of that many people will learn about him and the influence of his work on the field of heroic fantasy art 
 Not only is this book funny and entertaining, it cuts to the truth about Hollywood, West Hollywood and the entertainment industry.  Andy took a fresh and candid out look on a subject that many people have written about over and over again. I congratulate him on his honesty and owning up his experiences that led up the conception of his book, now go out read and enjoy 
 This is an excellent scholarly work that discusses how Americans waged war against Native Americans on the frontier from 1609 until 1814. The author contends that the early Americans developed a way of war that targeted non-combatants by attacking villages and destroying crops and deliberately targeting women and children. The author does not pull any punches and takes a harsh look at the practice of paying bounties for scalps and the effect that had on the conduct of frontier warfare. He also traces the development of the rangers and discusses how they did or did not integrate with regular forces. My only minor complaint is that the maps could be better in order to follow the narrative, but don't let that stop you from reading this book.  
 As a Ferrari fan,I collect and read many books of Ferrari.This is one of the books that make me feel I have got a lot of knowledge.It has more than 220 color photographs and detail introduction of  engine,transmission,facia...etc.This book keep the same class of the other  one:"Ferrari V8".So,I just can't wait for this series books !  (Because this book just introduce from 1965 to 1973 ! 
 This ia an excellent example of well written and exquisitely performed original music.  The entire CD in a gem 
 Enjoyed listening to the book.  It was in good condition. Took longer to get here hand expected 
  A Walk to Remember.  To those that know Sparks's writing, may just be able to read the title and know that crying will be involved.  This was the first book I read by Sparks. Afterwards, I am eager to read more.   A Walk to Remember is told as a narrative through the main character, Landon.   It's compelling to see how Landon's heart is changed due to the presence and good will of Jamie Sullivan. Jamie is a senior that no one understands. She is always carrying her Bible and is always speaking of the Lord's plan. Landon is sure that he will never fall for a girl like her.   The book takes your emotions on a rollercoaster with loops and turns.  It will having you laughing out loud and crying in bed, nothing can prevent that.    It really is a story of hope and love. A story that tries to tell you what love can do and what it may overcome.  Even though you may guess the ending or figure it out before you read it, it still hits you harder than ever when you read the words.   Beautifully written, wonderful plot.  I loved this story. 
 The value of this book is in the depth of the coverage it gives to every topic. As opposed to the usual code fragments glued together with the necessary minimum of expository text, this book takes it's time to explain topics in detail. It's clear that in it's third revision the author has learned how to teach the Java network APIs.  Topics covered include both client and server code with sockets and UDP, non-blocking I/O, and protocol and content handlers, as well as many others. This is very in-depth, very well written with effective use of graphics. And better yet you will learn about the protocols themselves as well as the APIs.  This is an outstanding book, easily the best book, on the Java network APIs 
 Why isn't this book a huge best-seller?  Probably just because it's too amazing.  It's both a terrifically smart piece of literary criticism, AND a laugh-out-loud, snort-your-orange-juice-out-your-nose funny FUNNY book.  Do  you like P. G.  Wodehouse?  Or Terry Pratchett?  Or . . . ?  Even if you  aren't a literary critic, you'll be amazed by this book 
 I like this larger version of The Lean Office Pocket Guide because the forms are easier to read and use.  There is quite a bit of information on each page, and this larger version, allows none of it to be skipped over.  We use these in our training course which everyone can take notes in.  
 This is one of the better grades of film I have started using. It has great saturation and sharpness of colors, exceptional film 
 Excellent analysis of the methodology behind totalitarian regimes, with emphasis on the persecution of Jews. Personally the most redeeming part I found in this book was Timerman's personal methods to cope with the  traumatic torture, and, most applicable to myself, an existence without  tenderness and love. His words ring loud and true, his advice is sound,  sound, sound 
 This book has given me new insight to my childrens' behaviors.  As the mom of 2 spirited boys, I really was struggling, but this book has been very helpful.  It has given me ways to understand my children, and to help them turn their spirited qualities into assets, not just try to change them.  I highly recommend this book 
 This is my favorite movie. I like it all: screenplay, director, actors, etc. Believe it brilliant 
 Norman Cohn's history of the Zoroastrian idea is one of the most informative and useful studies of a complex subject available. The influence of Zorastrianism on the emergence of monotheism should be common  knowledge, yet seems to escape public attention in its exclusive focus on  the Judaeo-Christian tradition. Highly recommended for students of  religion, and/or of world history 
 I have enjoyed all the Alan Lewrie Naval Adventures previous to "A King's Trade" but this one is outstanding...looking forward to the "his" next adventure...hope I don't have to wait as long 
 This is truly a spectacular movie.  It works as a comedy (much funnier then most, including those that belong solely to the genre), a study of the callousness of human beings (Ellen, playing a detective, picks food out of her teeth while taking the statement of a newly widowed woman, and that's more personnable then she is the rest of the movie), and a suspense movie (The plot keeps you guessing, and the ending is pure gold).  Ellen and Patricia play their roles to perfection, and the rest of the cast holds their own.  Although the DVD's special features are a little disappointing, the trailer alone make it worthwhile 
 When reading this book, you need to throw reality out the door to some extent, but it is still a highly entertaining read.  Three high ranking politicians are assassinated for various reasons, and congressman Michael O'Rourke finds himself in the middle of the mess.  It all goes back to an operation that was blown years back thanks to a politician who couldn't keep his mouth shut.  Most Vince Flynn fans are very familiar with Mitch Rapp, who does not appear in this book.  However, there are a lot of characters here who make appearances in his other novels.  Not required reading if you want to read about Mitch, but still worth the time just the same 
 This item can"t be beat for a price point . It is a nice addition to my silver wardrobe.Only problem I encoured was that it is a bit stiff and hurts my wrist at the time of Putting on and taking off, but I am a plus size lady so that may be part of the reason .This is a really neat item , shiny and attetion getting .. 
 This CD is way too under rated so I think people need to really start listing to it..... Best are "That's Crazy" and Dance With Me/ "peaches and cream" remix........ 
 Every year there's one can't-miss much-anticipated red-hot big-budget title with the right combination of star, director and subject matter that fails miserably at the box-office. This year it was Superman Returns. In 1982 it was Blade Runner. In 1957 it was Billy Wilder's The Spirit of St Louis, a film that had everything - top director, huge star, best-selling true story about an American hero - except enough of an audience to cover its costs. Maybe the public still remembered Lucky Lindy's anti-Semitism and his loud admiration for Nazi Germany's achievements before the war (neither covered in the film, which ends with his arrival in Paris before the legend got too tarnished). Maybe because they thought they knew the story or that it was just going to be one guy stuck in a cockpit for two hours. Certainly Wilder and co-writer Wendell Mayes are aware of the dramatic pitfalls of Lindbergh's relatively uneventful flight, alternating between a well-executed flashback structure to key points in his life and the build-up to the flight itself. Once the film is airborne, it's both surprising and suspenseful, finding genuine drama in his attempts to stay awake and to navigate without proper instruments.   It also builds up a quite remarkable sense of dread that's unlike anything else in Wilder's filmography, allied to a real sense of the epic: shots like the ominous storm clouds over the hanger the dark dawn before the flight carry a real chill of foreboding to them. Even the typically muted and problematic WarnerColor adds to the film rather than detracts from it. Along with the superb use of CinemaScope, there's a remarkable score from Franz Waxman: majestic, soaring but filled with understated menace, and cleverly used as part of the fabric of the film rather than mere musical accompaniment. The film does lose points for implying, though never actually saying outright, that this was a race to be the first to fly the Atlantic - in fact, Lindbergh was the third man to fly across the Atlantic after almost completely forgotten Brits Alcock and Brown's astonishing flight eight years earlier - but it's still a remarkably tense and engrossing adventure story that deserved the success it never found.   Warner's new restoration is light on film-related extras - only footage of the star-studded premiere and the original trailer, alongside a likeable Joe McDoakes short and a Speedy Gonzalez cartoon (Tex Avery's Little Johnny Jet, included on another James Stewart title, would have been a more appropriate choice of toon) - but the 2.55:1 widescreen transfer is quite excellent.  
 Ray Didinger does a great job including all of the best and worst of The Philadelphia Eagles history in this fascinating book 
 What I found particularly helpful with this little book, is that it fits into my handbag(purse) which means that if I am having to wait anywhere like at the doctor, I always have something to read. Not only is it small enough to always keep with me, but the contents are big! I have learned so much about the process of writing that I never knew before. I like the way she has broken the book up into chapters, just bite sized to encourage one to try and apply practically what one is reading in theory. I love the way the author encourages one to approach things from a different view point, instead of the accepted way. All in all, I feel this is a book for all aspiring writers that need to take a new look at "the how" of writing 
 1. 4 stars is slightly above average but not overtly hyped as the best.  2. Book offers valuable concepts that should be taken to heart for any investor.  3. Book really offers no major details or plans on value investing.  Just concepts, philosophy, etc.  But for the price it's ok.  For more recommended books, see my other reviews.  
 I had never seen this movie before but it is one of my husbands favorites.  It made me laugh and think!  I hope you will enjoy it as much as we have 
 What astonished me the most about this true story was not that the men pushed farther and farther into the unknown oceans, and not that they resorted to cannibalism under the most desperate circumstances... it was their discipline throughout their three month ordeal that fascinated me the most.  The ability to regulate and control your most piercing need for food and water in the face of imminent death is beyond anything I can comprehend.   It's stimulating when you are forced to question your own character while engrossed in a story (let alone a true story)... Would I have behaved the same as the other men had I been adrift for all that time?  My answers fell a little short of what would have kept me alive back then; and the failure of my character test made the story even more amazing.    I recommend this to all readers as a great history lesson and as one of the most amazing survival stories, ever.  Philbrick lays it all out - with intense description - from beginning to end... he did his homework on this one and you'll enjoy it.  Have fun,  David Tobias Redondo Beach, C 
 Warriors is an excellent book that delivers a diverse group of viewpoints on what it means to be a warrior.    The most interesting aspect of this book to me was the different perspectives provided by the contributors based on their life experiences.  On one hand, you have police officers, soldiers and martial artists; and on the other hand, you have those who were victims at some point in their life and who currently work with victims.  Although they all seem to agree that we live in a world with dangerous people and each person is ultimately responsible for their own safety, they do not all agree on how to deal with those dangerous people.  The one common element seems to be that this group of warriors all have their head out of the sand and are clearly focused on the world around them.    Some of the articles are absolutely fantastic, and some are marginally OK.  That should be expected when you pull together such a diverse group.  When something bad happens (i.e. gunfire or catastrophe) there are those who run toward it and those who run away.  The people featured in this book are the ones who run toward danger. If you are trying to understand why, this is a great place to start.    
 "Organizing for the Spirit" fits perfectly with my hectic, working-Mom, juggling a zillion-things-at-once lifestyle.  It's helping me learn to make "me" time and understand and except my personal style.  The approach is straight forward with wonderful story-telling that made me feel as if I was having coffee with a friend.  I tend to keep a lot of stuff, but now know that thoses things are important extensions of who I am.  It's true that the organizing approach highlighted in this book helps the spirit in all of us shine bright 
 My colleagues and I have been designing and facilitating leadership development programs for about 20 years.  I've also served as a VP of three Fortune 500 companies.  I recommend this book to everyone who is a leader or who wants to be one.  Not only does it contain THE secret to true leadership, Mr. Jaworski has written his account so that it reads like a good mystery novel.  You wonder what will happen next.  And he has written this book from his heart.  I hope our paths cross one day soon 
 Both Junior Wells and Buddy Guy Shine on this recording. Junior with his all out raw vocal style and killer blues harp and Buddy Guy with a solid riffing rythym.  Not enough can be said about either artist on this recording but Buddy is not the Buddy Guy we all know on this album.  This Album shows a whole different side of Buddy.  Here he is not the bombastic screamer on a fender stratocaster we all know and love but a strong and steady side man with a real heavy groove.  Almost no solo's for Buddy on the whole album but his rythym playing shines through and should be an inspiration to every guitarist proving that even the high and mighty can play rythym when needed.  The songs are all solid blues and the liner notes well worth the cost of admission.  I love everything about this album.  One of my favorite spots is "Chitlins Con Carne"  A tune written by Kenny Burrell and I have heard many others play it but none quite like this version 
 The book is mostly a standard history of the Ottoman Empire, covering the military, political, economic and cultural aspects of the empire from its rise to its fall. But beyond this, the book discusses the `image' of the Ottomans in Europe, that of the savage, sensuous, opium addled oriental who lacked the refined civilization of the Europeans, and which was "woefully separated from the reality". (xix). The final two chapters of the book are titled "The Lustful Turk" and the "The Terrible Turk", the two stereotypes well established in Europe by the nineteenth century, which enabled the Europeans to dismiss the Ottomans as lesser beings. Many of these stereotypes can still be found in western accounts of the Middle East to this day. With this he touches on some of the same themes as Edward Said's Orientalism, but in a manner that is much easier to understand. I read this book before I read My Name is Red, and they went well together, with this book giving the historical background to the fictional account of the novel. I found this book to be written very well, a clear and concise history without a lot of academic fluff, and for that reason I could definitely see myself using this book in a class someday 
 Essential is true to the point. It is a gathering of the works of the great, such as Attar, Dhu-l-Nun, Sheikh Badruddin,  Bistami, and much much more.   A source that will allow you to familiarize yourself with not only great work, but also the levels of contemplation in which each statement falls in.   A quote from Bayazid Bistami,"If I only knew that I had taken one single step in sincerity I would find no value to anything else."  Sufi knowledge can be compared some what to Koan's, since they touch upon awakening the consciousness, or centering thought. Contextually the knowledge is full of meaning for all and all disciplines. Spiritually, the path of departing one from the self is revisited for guidance's.    The chapters offer a great set of guidance in explaining the self, then introducing Hadiths, experiences, actions, remembrances, and finally transformations. It's enormously helpful to fallow these sets of orders, all in all through the many voices of the eternal intellective Sufis.    
 This is a solid introduction to the basic tenets of Sufism. Described as the impatient mystics of Islam, Sufis seek God all the time in all living things and actions, rather than just waiting for the hereafter. Interestingly, they also call themselves "lovers" because they have an active and continuous love for the Almighty. Sufism can be of interest to non-Muslims because it is made up of many tenets that are beyond particular belief systems, not unlike Buddhism or Confucianism, and can be applied while practicing other religions. (Though I am not claiming to be an expert on comparative religion here.) After some useful introductory descriptions, this book contains mostly parables and aphorisms, some from the Koran but mostly from later poets and mystics, that shed light on the Sufi belief system. Included are interesting takes on key concepts like charity, daily life, education, and one's place in the universal scheme of things; as well as refreshing stances on Satan and death that may seem alien to the Westerner but make a lot of sense. This compendium may not be intensive enough to make you a convert, but it certainly provides much enlightenment and spiritual food for thought. [~doomsdayer520~ 
 When a bright and beautiful teenage girl is murdered lawyer turned author Penn Cage finds himself in the awkward position of wanting to defend his best friend who is accused of the crime while half-believing him guilty.  His friend, a respected doctor who saved Cage's life when they were boys, admits to having had a torrid relationship with the girl. With loyalty overriding suspicion, Cage agrees to help him. Before long, both men are drawn into a web of increasing violence involving drug traffickers and a legal duel with an ambitious black district attorney.  Iles offers the enticing combination of lyrical prose, intriguing characters and fascinating plot twists that kept me reading long after I'd guessed the outcome of this novel. There were places where I had to suspend disbelief to continue, particularly Cage's willingness to place his daughter's teenage babysitter in jeopardy. But, he paints an interesting look at a small southern city struggling to survive, the ramifications of loyalty and the lives of teens maturing way too fast.  Since it was the first of his I've read I can't compare it with his others. But, I liked it enough to say I'll definitely be looking for more.

 Great book, as always.  Read the series from start to present, they're worth it 
 I love this book!  It makes these business topics within reach of anyone willing to read and study. This book covers the basics thoroughly. Remember, it is a book on the basics only and not a textbook; funny how some people rant because it doesn't cover everything a "real" MBA knows.    Well for the rest of us who couldn't and didn't have the means to go for an MBA this really is the next best thing. You'll be ahead knowing that there's a basic topic covered here that you can do more thorough research on if need be. The tone of the book is very reader-friendly; none of the snobbishness which infects too many business books. Well Done 
 This book reflects the profound intellect of one of the most highly regarded jurists in American history.  Despite its age, Justice Cardozo's classic treatise provides insights into the "real" workings of  the judicial decision making process that remain relevant to a modern  analysis of American jurisprudence.  His exploration of the motivations,  ideals, and even prejudicies of judges serves to demystify this crucial  aspect of the legal system.  His insights into "legal realism"  provide an appreciation of this judicial approach and offers an  understanding of its underlying rationale, as well as an argument for its  continued utility for modern jurists.  Most importantly, he strives to make  the judicial process comprehensible and, even, approachable to the  non-practitioner of law, as well as law students, thus attempting to make  public law, truly, "public.&quot 
 I just completed reading Ed Brodow's book! It is rare for me to pick up a book and read it all the way through without taking breaks in between to read or do other things. I read his book in its entirety with great joy. I appreciated the flow and ease of his words and the deeper meaning behind them. Beating the Success Trap has a solid purpose and message about getting real with yourself and what success means to you authentically. Ed gives you the deeper insights and examples on how to get there 
 Those who know the language who find the quality of this work to be superb 
 Julia Roberts pre-Pretty Woman. In Mystic, Conneticut, four Portugese-American friends (including 2 sisters) have one last summer together before heading off to begin their adult lives. One bound for Yale, another headed for a walk down the aisle, and two more working as waitresses trying to find themselves. Each find romance and the challenges of it. It's a great take on how the one summer before we must grow up, is one to savor 
 In my opinion Oho is great in theory ... but is not always easy to put in practice what he said. In this case is a little bit different since he comments on a writing that is 100% practical. So great theory, great practic 
 Me encantó este libro porque contiene muchísima información sobre la Wicca, su historia, rituales, herramientas, métodos de adivinación, diferentes tradiciones wiccans, una lista de hierbas y cómo prepararlas y para qué utilizarlas y muchísimas cosas más. Además el libro está organizado en forma de lecciones. Tiene unas preguntas de comprobación de lectura para asegurar que entendistes el material y otras preguntas de reflexión que te ayudan a organizar tus ideas sobre cada tema. La única limitación (y no es tanto una limitación) es que el libro está mayormente enfocado en la tradición Gardneriana y la mayor parte de los rituales están hechos para hacerse en grupo. Claro que esto fue una pequeña limitación para mí porque soy wiccan solitaria pero para la persona que trabaja en grupo no sería limitación alguna. El libro incluye también un capítulo para las personas que practican solas así que esto resolvió bastante mi problema. Además, todos los rituales son fácilmente adaptables para un solitario y es mejor adaptarlos y reescribirlos, así son personalizados y funcionan mejor (a mí me funcionó hacer esto). Le recomiendo este libro a cualquier persona que esté comenzando en la wicca, sin importar a que tradición pertenezca. Es un libro con información bien valiosa e importante y además del mejor autor sobre el tema (o uno de los mejores) 
    What a group of women they were, nonpareils all. They tossed aside convention to illuminate a period marked by freedom of expression, a disregard for racial barriers, and amazing creativity. The Victorian Ea was on its way out, and they were high kicking it aside. The years 1913 - 1930 in New York City were described as a period of "Going Public with one's animal nature." This was especially true in Greenwich Village and Harlem where white bohemians joined Black Americans in a celebration of jazz and the blues.  Consider just a few in Andrea Barnet's remarkable cast of characters: Bessie Smith, Isadora Duncan, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Margaret Sanger, Gertrude Stein, and that's only a sampling.  Each chapter focuses on a different woman - her life, her pals, and her contributions to this electric change. Mina Loy was an artist and poet. British born she lived in Florence with her husband and two children, ages 9 and 7. When her husband ran off with his mistress Loy determined that she must chart her own course and, in order to do this, she must go to New York City. Leaving her children behind with their Italian nurse she set sail. Tall and extremely attractive she was an eye-catching beauty whose poetry would be widely published.   Edna St, Vincent Millay, a young Maine poet already published in her mid twenties, set tongues wagging with her celebration of the Armistice in 1918 - she and two fellows rode back and forth all night on the Staten Island ferry, chasing along beaches the trio drank jug wine until dawn. At that time Millay returned to her cold water flat and sat down to furiously pound out more poetry.  Who could forget Bessie Smith, all six feet and 200+ pounds of her? "The funk is flyin'" was one of her favorite phrases and she happily ate at a generously laden kitchen table, washing down her food with homemade liquor.  With more than 50 unforgettable photographs and an exciting, comprehensive text Barnet has painted a colorful portrait of the Harlem Renaissance and the women who made it happen. Equal parts history and biography, "All-Night Party" is not to be missed.  - Gail Cooke  
 I swear by this book, the techniques work like magic, and it made me feel okay about letting my baby sleep in the swing.  I would not only recommend this book to all new parents, I would say that it is absolutely a requirement to read if you have a new baby or will soon.  Don't have a baby without it!  It's also a very interesting read.  I absolutely loved it 
 Dr. Bandura has written an excellent book for scholars, researchers, as well as the casual observer of human nature and behavior. It is comprehensive and well documented. He helps one understand why some people seem to get what they want and need out of life and others do not. I give it my highest recommendation 
 This book describes the adventures of a nineteenth-century peasant who spends much of his God-centered life wandering around Russia. It is an inspirational story about the value of praying. In fact, I cannot think of another book which contains as much valuable information about the incessant prayer mentioned by St. Paul in 1 Thessalonians 5:17 
 This is a wonderful children's story.  Young children are able to relate to the main character.  A good book to accompany this is Charlie Anderson. Well illustrated 
 This album is a wonderfully eclectic collection of Rickie Lee's music from laid back chart toppers like Chuck E to the original rendition of classics like Bye Bye Blackbird.  Should be in every Rickie Lee Jones fan's collection 
 Peter Gabriel's Real World enterprise has thrown up some marvels to world audiences.Yungchen Lhamo is a voice the world needs and may easily have been denied: and the biographical data is carried in the songs of'Coming Home', a quietly moving document. In this instance, the expatriate's loss of a home, is our gain. I'm reminded of Reen Kelani's awesomely poignant,'Sprinting Gazelle' for these reasons. This is simpler musical fare, but none the less effective. Lhamo has written historically, peronally and of her buddhist spiritual life. The Tuvan throat lads guest with complementary sweetness given their approximation to Tibetan temple chanting. The Real World maestros have stood back to allow Lhamos the spotlight:a bit of Gabriellesque droning, but thankfully light on his operatic flourishes 
 The combination of Tom Waits and Crystal Gayle is inspired. Like one of those chocolate-covered pretzels, the salty and the sweet mingle in a way that makes you want more and more. These songs blend Waits' haunting, humorous and insightful lyrics with the lush vocals of Gayle, whose voice is stunningly versatile in this collection, from instrumentally coarse to achingly ethereal. It's one to listen to again and again, but especially on a rainy, gloomy day, with a scotch 
 Excellent book!  If you're a beginner learning German grammar, such as declension and word order, this is an excellent resource.  The material is presented in a logical and easy to use format, that makes understanding and learning very easy 
 This book is an awesome resource for people who hope to become cooks or chefs. In it you will read about the lives of people who started out doing something they thought they loved and then just decided that they wanted to cook and ended up becoming great at it. Then there is also the stories of people who had an intense desire to cook and had to struggle just to get someone in the culinary indusstry to even look at them. The people in this book either own their own restaurants or are working in the most top quality food establishments there is. It evens gives some of these chefs most favorite recipes. It gives you alot of valuable informaiton from the top schools to attend,to what can shut down a first time restaurant opener's establishment. It's a great book to read and it's guaranteed to lead to great success 
 "Enemies unseen... Fears unspoken...... A dark wind has entered his soul"   Navajo Tribal Police Sgt. Jim Chee seems to be batting zero; so far he has not been able to solve a series of seemingly unrelated crimes. In an area that was joint use land between the Navaho and the Hopi (now Hopi) Sgt Jim Chee is given the task of finding the vandal that keeps destroying a windmill placed there to make Hopi life easer. He hears an airplane landing in the dark of night with no lights. The plane crashes and leaves a dying pilot. Also a dead man sitting up against a rock with a note in his hand saying if you want it back contact...  Sgt Chee is told that it is probably drugs and federal jurisdiction. Chee is not supposed to go anywhere near or have anything to do with the case. He has his own problems with the mill, a missing thief, and a mysterious ritual death. Naturally he listens, and can not help it if they overlap.     One of the reasons for reading Hillerman's books maybe more important than the overlying mystery is the descriptions of the area and the Ways of the Navaho and Hopi. Hillerman suggests you also read "The Book of the Hopi" by Frank Waters.  Not as intricate as the book but still fun is the movie "Dark Wind" (Lou Diamond Phillips as Officer Jim Chee, Fred Ward as Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn 
 Even though the original crew decided to take the silly route after "The Wrath of Khan," at least we had the "Next Generation" crew to give us great and serious sci-fi again.  Season 5 is one of the best seasons, with episodes like "Redemption Part 2," and my favorite from this season, "Cause and Effect."  "Unification," a two-parter, is good as well.  This episode features Leonard Nimoy as Spock, which was possible because of the long Vulcan life-span.  I can accept that, but I don't think Kirk, Scotty and McCoy should ever have met the "Next Generation" crew.  And the excuses the writers used to make this possible were really contrived.  McCoy lived to the time of the "Encounter at Farpoint" episode, simply because he "never died." Okay, whatever.  Scotty met the "Next Generation" crew because he got stuck in a transporter signature.  Ya, okay.  Kirk meets Picard in "Generations" because he got caught in the Nexus.  Alright, it's starting to get a bit much now.  The only episode in season 5 that I thought was a drag was "Ethics," where Worf gets severely injured in an accident, and a visiting doctor comes aboard, whom Dr. Crusher is wary of.  The episode goes into the issue of medical ethics, but this could be told just as well in shows like Quincy, E.R., etc..  We don't need Star Trek for something like this.  But highly recommended DVDs.    
 TR Reid, who studied ancient Greek and Latin at Princeton, has written an excellent short history of integrated circuits, or microchips, which is accessible to any high school student.  The basic concepts and main figures, such as Kilby and Haggerty at Texas Instruments, Noyce at Intel, and others are described extremely well in language that is easily understandable, interesting, and enjoyable to read.  On top of that, it is good pointers to other, more detailed books at the end.  If you have a PhD in electrical engineering, or are a veteran of the industry, you may, on the other hand, feel that this book is to short for your liking. 
 This beautiful volume examines the first century of Portland's domestic architecture with a critical but sympathetic eye.  Many of its finest examples have disappeared in all but photos, and others exist only in  misshapen form, but the author is able to recall the grace, dignity,  pretension and whimsy which went into their original design. This is a book  for both new and old residents who may have decided that our  "Stumptown" had little adornment in its early years,and proves  that Portland was already a place of discernment and competitive display  long before the 19th Century turned, when Seattle was a fishing camp and  jumping off point to Alaskan gold. Besides the implicit social and artistic  history lesson, the book's black and white photos are a memorable eyeful  for anyone who loves American homes, furnishings, or decoration.  A very  rich read, indeed 
 Ann Patchett, author of the astounding "Bel Canto," writes novels that are remarkably different in time, place, character, and voice. Three things, however, remain consistent in each one. Each concerns the collision of people from different cultures or social classes, each is concerned with love and loss and the transcendent strength of the human spirit, and each is superbly wriiten. "The Magician's Assistant" is no exception. When Parsifal the Magician dies in Southern California, his assistant of 20 years and wife of 1 year finds that his life held secrets that she could never have imagined. From the affluence and urbanity of her home in Los Angeles, she finds herself in rural Nebraska in mid-winter, living with a family struggling individually and together to make sense of the past and decisions about their future. Patchett's respect for the complexities and nuance that lie within every soul, no matter how imperfect, comes through in every page. A remarkable book from a remarkable writer.    
 I'm not usually a classical listener kind of gal.  The only reason I stumbled onto this cd is because my favorite tune from a movie is on it. Sarabande is also played on the movie Persuasion (author: Jane Austen).  I wanted to have that tune.  Followed the links and landed on the Baroque cd.  Ordered it.  Sarabande is my favorite, followed by Canon, four seasons: spring, etc.  I love this cd!  It feels happy and light.  For me, as a writer and an animator, it adds extra emotional impact when creating as well as influencing my imagination more.  I recommend this cd when people want to feel like spring 
 After being disappointed in the remastered version of Blue Bell Knoll, I was having trouble deciding whether to purchase another in the Twins' new remaster series. After I tentatively gave HOLV a shot, I was flabbergasted. The sound has come alive! What was previously leaden and muffled has been set free into the sparkling ether. And keep in mind-- I had never considered the production on the original album to be lacking-- maybe a tad overreacting to the bright sound of Blue Bell Knoll two years previous, but rich, full and melodic nonetheless. What a difference thirteen years makes! It's like listening to a brand new release. The sound is no longer so midrange-heavy; the instruments have been lifted and separated just enough to delineate them, while preserving the gauziness of the original. The vocals have a newfound space and importance, as if Elizabeth just got through clearing her throat. And the bass! Chunkier, crunchier, it actually makes my Grados pulsate during 'Cherry-coloured Funk'. This newfound clarity is even more apparent on 'Fifty-fifty Clown', which must be one of the most timelessly futuristic pop songs ever produced. It shimmers more forcefully now, chugs along more insistently, and leaves you wanting more. It's amazing how a good remaster can change your feelings about a song; I had never been a huge fan of the title track, but now I have rediscovered it--it's more balanced, less honk-y. I can honestly recommend this remaster as a must-have for real Cocteau Twins fans, it's that much better. One of the richest, most luxurious albums ever.  *** Oh, and fellow Twins fans/reviewers: hey! don't be blithely glossing over the song titles. Elizabeth worked too hard on them for you to dismissively call them "Track 1" or "Track 9". Sheesh. Learn them and use them-- they're windows into the songs themselves. They cross-reference each other and provide a huge chunk of the only insight into Elizabeth's lyrics that exists. Show some respect 
 I would encourage everyone who was around during the World War II era, or who remembers the old and true Maxwell Street and the magnificant boxer Barner Ross, to read this book.  I only wish it were a little longer as Mr. Century paints such a vivid picture of those times.  Several days ago he was in Chicago and gave a review of the book followed by a film of one of Mr. Ross' amazing fights.  A very special evening 
 The Torrents of Spring is important because of who wrote it.  It is supposed to be a parody of Sherwood Anderson's work.  I don't get it.  The book reads like Hemingway's high school work (he wrote it in his 20s).   Both are important because they reveal something about the development of a  giant.  There is some interesting byplay in the book between protagonist  and others, some good place descriptions.  It was not fun or absorbing to  read but it has importance for one who studies Hemingway's body of work.   It is contemporary with In Our Time.  The literary gulf between the two  books is vast 
 This collection of Whitman's poetry has the ulitimate selection for any reader, whether one is experienced in the composition and analyzation of Whitman or simply reading for pleasure. The book contains every known work by the author, as well as numerous editions of poems such as "Song of Myself" which was revised and reprinted by the author several times. If one is a fan of Walt Whitman, this is an excellent source of all his poetry compact into one book. If a person is just begining to experience the poet, everyting someone would want to read is at his or her fingertips 
 This curling iron is perfect.  It heats quickly and has a sturdy design that does not pull hair out.  Delivered within two days of order.  Highly recommended 
 This is a small book perfect for small hands. The illustrations are true to Eric Carle's other book illustrations as you would expect. Learning a new concept is never far away in his books and you won't be disappointed with this one. They are boosted for understanding by the features of the page fold-outs, fold-ups, and fold-downs. It's wonderful as a board book because those fold-flaps can handle the frequent times they are used without tearing as a page does. This story is also presented on an Eric Carle DVD or VHS which I have also rated. 
 Its very hard to find newer christmas albums with any traditional feel to them. Mariah though does a very very good job of capturing the christmas spirit with a more traditional sound. Kudos to her for a great christmas album. I love to listen to it as it reminds me of christmas as a child 
 Absolutely Positively is a good story about a Woman named Molly Abberwick owner of The Abberwick Tea & Spice Company and trustee for her father's foundation for inventors, Harry Trevelyan is a scientist and a consultant for the foundation who Molly clashes with and is about to fire when she begins to receive threatening letters and Harry tries to find out who is tormenting Molly and they soon find them selves attracted to each other, the plot also deals with Harry's psychic abilities which he has never been comfortable with and how he deals with it 
 This is the best game ever! If you want to play with your love ones, this is the best game to have with. You can be addicted to it sometimes, but that's a good sign for a good gam 
 After being introduced to the studio albums 'Siren' and 'Oyster' I decided to give 'Wonderlust' a go. Normally, I am a bit wary of live albums, as I usually find them a bit flat, and not as spirited as studio albums, lacking in enthusiasm and energy. However, this album was a pleasant surprise.'Winter Blue' is one of my all time favourites, so I could not have disliked it, it still held out as a powerful song, it's composition heart sung, with strong instrumentation and a descant backing up the chorus...gorgeous. I prefer the live rendition of 'Paper Cup' to the studio one, somehow it is more deep and catchy. 'London Rain' is pretty much the same to the studio version coming out of the same vein. 'Doubled Up', another beautiful ballard is somewhat disappointing, as though Heather Nova is not giving it her best it is lacking in feeling. 'Heal' is striking, particularly the instrumental arrangement in the chorus and bridge along with her wailing voice, full of lament, there is something simple but very striking about the line ''and the sea glistens ''. 'Heart and Shoulder' is full of  heart-felt pity, and 'Walk With Me' command and force to the urgency and alarm of 'Island', not lacking in strength. All in all, a good compilation of songs from 'Oyster' and 'Siren' with the exception of a non-Heather Nova hit 'I'm on Fire' which is a bit non-descript.However, on the whole, it is great music to draw anyone into the talent of Heather's great talent and voice

 Every year I read about 5 books about cosmology and physics. So I know what I'm saying: this book really is great.  Sure, it's about 8 years old, too old in cosmology. In particular, the discovery that the universe is accelerating has changed a lot of the questions that cosmologists contemplate. But even if you read a book that was published yesterday, it'll be out of date next month. So you have to either hang out in the physics lounge at Princeton, or accept that you're gonna be behind a bit. As it goes, I think that this book is so good that it's certainly worth reading even though it's a bit old.  I especially recommend this book if it will be your first book on cosmology.  I bought it because of the discussion of the structure in the universe: superclusters of galaxies, and beyond them to the sheets and bubbles that seem to be the largest structures in the universe. I'd been curious about these things, and never read a good account of them until this book. He covered it all, including reviewing our local intergalactic neighborhood, the Virgo cluster and supercluster, and the mysterious Great Attractor. He discussed the formations of galaxies and stars and planetary systems, including our own solar system. Not since Sagan's "Cosmos" had I read such an enjoyable discussion of this topic--the one that fascinated me so much as a child.   That's high praise.  But I was also surprised by how well other things in cosmology were explained. Of course the question of the geometry of the universe was well explained; even better, the discussions of inflation and Linde's chaotic inlation and multiverse were great. The issue of dark matter was very well covered. Relativity was explained well enough, and the world of quantum physics was explored enough to make the points Ferris wanted to make. (He didn't explain Smolin's black hole based multiverse, probably because it's a lot more speculative than Linde's inflationary multiverse.)  Every pop science writer has to simplify things, and at some point offer explanations that someone will consider inadequate. I thought his discussion of the principles of life on earth and the possibilities of extraterrestrial life were great, but they were probably a bit too brief for someone completely unfamiliar with the topic. I think a first-time reader would not understand several points in his description of quantum theory. But hey, when you're sure you don't understand quantum theory, that's evidently about as close as you'll ever get.  The same goes for his discussion of the anthropic principle and God. Now, actually I basically agree with Ferris' worldview (strong agnosticism), and I think his discussion of it was spot-on. But if I had to write it, I would have gone a bit more slowly, explaining things in a bit more detail. You can find among these reviewers some who criticize Ferris for saying that cosmology doesn't prove God's existence. Well, it doesn't. Ferris also explained that it doesn't disprove God's existence. But Ferris doesn't flatter theists as much as some other writers in the field.  All the same, the general discussion about the universe was great.  Incidently, if you're primarily interested in quantum physics rather than cosmology in particular, I recommend Brian Greene's "The Elegant Universe." Not so well-written, but in greater depth is Nick Herbert's "Quantum Reality." If you're primarily interested in multiple universes, look at Smolin's "Life of the Cosmos" but especially at Guth's "The Inflationary Universe." And if you're interested in the end of the universe, I suggest Davies' "Last Three Minutes." And finally, although it's a bit dated in some respects, the best exploration of the theological implications of cosmology (which bothered some reviewers of this book so much) remains Paul Davies' "God and the New Physics."  If you haven't read about cosmology yet, get one of these books and enjoy it. Regardless of which one you choose, scientific cosmology is one of the most fascinating, mind and soul expanding topics in the world 
 In typical Goldsmith fashion Jerry put more creative energy into his score than the filmmakers did in making the movie. This score is a mixture of orchestral and subtle electronics put together in excellent arrangements.  Skip the movie, just buy the score 
 A great autobiography by the founder of USA today.  I read this book in one sitting and totally admire his fierecely competitive attitude.  He made no excuse for being an sob, and did everything to get to the top.  He admits that he can be funny, charming to his friends, and a nasty sob to his enemies.  His adaptability while maintaining a laser-like focus on the ultimate goal is a lesson for young people to emulate 
 This is a marvellous book. Although the cover and back-cover illustration and summary are sensationalised the book itself is not. It is the spiritual insight gained by Tom Brown as he learns both from his Apache teacher/mentor/guide and the world itself that stands out in this book. His period of four years as a kind of apprentice of the old man and the deep friendship with Rick, the old man's grandson, are the cornerstones of a great story. It resounds, to some degree, with the adventures of Tom Sawyer or Huckleberry Finn although his was a clearer instruction to the spirit that moves in everything. There is no question that the teacher's continuing appearance of looking at the spirit itself acting in the world is true. This can be seen by anyone paying enough attention for long enough.   I'm glad I bought this book and gave it to my father to read. It is good to know that such stories are still possible in this sanitised world. I am looking forward to reading more of these stories. Its worth every cent and then some 
 You can't go wrong with this if you are looking for some fun music for Halloween.  Whether you're planning a party or just want to listen to this while distributing candy, this is probably the best Halloween music collection around.  Now if only RHINO would come out with a Part 2.  Great fun here for everyone 
 Inspector Banks is such a enjoyable character thats there's no way you can go wrong with 'Innocent Graves'. The story is well written intertwinning the suspects to keep you guessing. Here's hoping that more people discover  and enjoy Mr. Robinson's books.. 
 This is my favorite film of all time! I am sad to say that most people have never even heard of it -  It was an Acadamy Award winner, so I don't understand why it's not gotten much attention over the years... I find it  superior to other classics which seem to have withstood the test of time better than Captains Courageous. I don't know why this is the case, but I am it's biggest advocate - urging all my friends to see it... It is a wonderful and moving story, that will bring me to tears time and time again the same way as "It's a Wonderful Life Does"... If you have strong values and a warm heart - this movie is for you! Do not miss it 
 My mom has most of the Royal Albert Collection.  These just added the elegance her collection needed 
      In a little under 50 pages, Ms Lange has captured the essence of what life was like in the New World in first decades of the 17th c.  She provides an even-handed treatment of Native Americans, the strengths and follies of the English and the terrible ordeals that beset both groups.  Her coverage of the most recent findings of archeologists show the misconceptions and biases that have crept into the history books over the ensuing centuries--until now.  My 16 year old son used 1607: A New Look at Jamestown as one of his sources for a report in AP US history class, and it was a real eye-opener to him and to me.  With wonderful photographs of found relics and recreated scenes, this book brings to life a period and a people who have always taken a back seat to the Pilgrim story.  I would highly recommend this book to any parent of a child, pre-teen or teen that shows a curiosity for history.  Rather than dumbing-down, Ms Lange dazzles 
 As stated in some of my other reviews, I have been greatly disappointed in the choice of quality gay literature and the talent of gay authors that we have to choose from to date.  I was pleasantly surprised by Bart Yates.  In all actuality, I give his writing style and ability five stars.  He is clever, intelligent, witty, sarcastic--a master story teller.  There is only one flaw in this book (and in some ways it is a strength).  Albeit unfair, I judge gay books by a higher standard than I do the more mainstream fiction.  I feel that gay authors have an obligation to write about gay men and women who are moral, relatively well adjusted, and non-suicidal, alcoholic, drug infested wastes of space.  I take away one star simply for that reason.  Again, the examples put out of gay men in this novel are nothing I would ever want any human being to become.  That being said, Yates proves his talent by having such flawed, seemingly selfish, corrupt character that you can not help but fall in love with.  Even as you are repelled by some of their actions and choices, you care about their lives.  That is what I look for in a book.  Make me love the unlovable.  Help me understand their motives and reasons in spite of myself.  Yates did this beautifully.  I respect an author that can make me uncomfortable in my own skin and still entice me to continue to turn the pages.  I have ordered his first book and I look forward to seeing how it compares.  While I still hope to find quality crafted literature with uplifting, realistic gay men, I am proud to have Bart Yates be one of the authors that represents the talents and passion within the gay community.  Be prepared to fall in love, be horrified, laugh out loud, shed some tears, and not be able to put this book down.  Truly an outstanding work of art.  
 I love Dr. T. Berry Brazelton! He puts things in such basic terms that you almost want to slap your head and say "why didn't I think of that?".  It is a must for anyone with children, even the "veteran" moms and dads. I also VERY HIGHLY recommend "Touchpoints" by Dr. Brazelton. It is my bible 
 The Tawny Man Trilogy picks up the tale of Fitz and the Fool some fifteen years after the Red Ship wars. Queen Kettricken is determined to secure her son's throne by arranging a marriage between Prince Dutiful and Elliania, the daughter of their old enemies in the Outislands. But the Six Duchies themselves are restless. The Witted are weary of persecution, and may choose to topple the throne of the Farseers by revealing that young Prince Dutiful carries an old taint in his blood. The Narcheska Elliania sets a high price on her hand: Dutiful must present her with the head of Icefyre, the legendary dragon of Aslevjal Island.   Meanwhile, to the south, The Bingtown Traders continue to wage war against the Chalcedeans, and seek to enlist the Six Duchies into the effort to obliterate Chalced. Bingtown's temperamental ally, the dragon Tintaglia, has her own motives for supporting them in this, ones that may lead not only to the restoration of the race of dragons but also to the return of Elderling magic to the Cursed Shores.   Fitz, in the person of Tom Badgerlock, will accompany the prince on his quest to secure the dragon's head. For reasons of his own, he decides that it is of the utmost importance that his old friend, The Fool, not accompany him. Chade agrees with him, and thus Fitz sets out without his companion, to face an enemy from his past and also decide what future he will claim for himself. 
 Valuable information written in simple English. Perfect for common people without a fashion background. Good pictures and lots of tips and useful hints 
 No gimmicks, no forbidden foods, no endless chapters of vague promises about the program to be described later in the (usually too large) book.  This is a slim volume of tips and facts that make perfect sense and are completely doable.  The author is a dietician who ironically packed on 40 pounds obtaining her bachelor's and master's degrees and has been through the weight-loss process herself.  Unlike most "diet" books, the testimonials are kept to a minimum and there is no sales pitch for packaged foods, tapes or DVDs.  Each short chapter outlines an important step to permanent weight loss in straightforward language, and the chapters address psychological, social, and physical aspects of achieving weight loss in a healthy way.    Whether you need to lose weight because you feel unhealthy, can't deal with the huge restaurant portions presented these days, are overstressed or too busy to think about your eating habits, you'll find the information in this book helpful.  
 When it came down to it, price was the motivating factor in this purchase. I use the modulator on an old TV in my home office, where I don't really need to watch DVDs, so I was not willing to spend a lot of money on this device.  I just wanted the cheapest thing that works. This model fit the bill perfectly. For way less than the prices at local stores, I was able to get this modulator shipped to me quickly.  It was easy to hook up, and works perfectly 
 This is a haunting work, very much looking at life in a minor key, but no less beautiful for that. This music cuts really deep into the soul. Buy it now 
 2 of the 'major' songs from the movie are not on the cd. I still love this cd, also because alot of the artists on the cd got some great singles, even though they didnt get released in Europe.. 
 I believe this accounts listed in the book are true, and so my title wasn't written to indicate that I don't believe the book...but rather to indicate how serious our situation could be.  I say could be because I think the countries of China and India still need us in a big way...because we are the #1 consumers. But as we lose that benchmark and sink to 2nd or even third behind Europe and Asia, they will no longer have an interest in supporting our unbridaled spending. (lets face it, we spend more money than we actually have....not everyone, but as a whole as a country!)  This book outlines all the numbers, and reasons for the current situation. I actually feel it is somewhat positive in it's progonosis for the future. There are other books that have us jumping right off the cliff....but the outlooks given here are not all rosy, but don't all end with a 100 foot plunge to our end.  Very good book...I recommend it highly 
 Very inspiring.  The topics chosen by Rabbi Levy and the prayers she has composed resonate deeply.  I use this book as a constant reference.  The prayers are simple and personal.  They are  useful by themselves but are also wonderful guides to help us find our own voices, spirit and direction to draft our own prayers 
 To sum up what I think Mr Steele was saying in this book, is that African americans should stop thinking about the past, and look to the future, and at the process that african americans have made. He also point's out that most whites think they have to act a certain way because of guilt.  In chapter 5 he implied that black students should be more worried about their grades which he says is always lower than the white students, than racial problems that might be going on. Again I think Mr Steele was saying don't blame racism on everything 
 Being the "Orientalist" that I am, I simply loved "A Passage to India" E.M Foster does an excellent job on character development and the relationships that build up to fall; then of course, build up again. The entire book is a rollercoaster of friends and foes. The book will keep you puzzled at who really is the antagonist and protagonist of the story.  The book has many symbolic meanings within itself that deal with humanity and conflict in general.  My favorite character in the book was Mr. Fielding. He related to my own character in so many ways. He seemed to be one of the few who wanted to understand the Indians (Muslim and Hindu).  The book is dealing with the conflict that the British and Indian people had when the British Raj was in power. Looking from both sides of the spectrum, it really exposes the prejudice one had for another. Not only is it a matter of separation in India by the Indian and British, but it also deals with another internal conflict in India with Muslims and Hindus. Truly, it was a divided India.  While sometimes a tedious read, "A Passage to India" plays out to be a very well-written story full of rich history, interesting characters, and very opinionated peoples. This book is highly recommended to anyone who would like to understand some very interesting customs of India. Check it out 
 Olivia is the greatest - though the only downside to these DVD's is that she did others that would have been nice to see instead of all the old ones.  She's evolved in her music and as a person and whoever produced these DVD's should show that 
 This is a great book for toddlers and preschoolers who are learning to put on their clothes.  It is not a book on music, but on dressing, just as the title states.  My son enjoys looking at the different ways people shower and put on their clothes and comparing how he bathes and puts on his clothes 
 I really liked this book.  I found it helpful for my therapy practice with both adolescents and adults.  The scripts for imagery were helpful and I use them in sessions.  Information and background are shared in straight forward, easy to read terms.  I have shared Naparstek's theories with clients as part of their treatment, and we have seen success.  With a concrete, more pragmatic client however, these techniques are more difficult to use 
 Joplin's Ghost is an interesting read, especially if one has an interest in musician Scott Joplin.  The story line concerns a young female musician who is being possessed by the ghost of Scott Joplin.  The author introduces various aspects of Joplin's life and then shows the parallels or similarities between our heroine and Joplin.  There is a lot of sex in the book, some of which seems gratuitous.  For me, the best part of the book was the insight the author gives into Joplin's life.  After reading this novel I had to go out and find some of Joplin's music for myself.  This novel is definitely readable, but hardly memorable 
 This book tells the "grass-is-always-greener" story of the city mouse and the country mouse.  One day, the city mouse wakes up and decide he is unhappy with his lot in life.  He and his wife pack a picnic lunch and go off for a holiday in the country.  There they meet the country mouse, who is enthralled by the smell of city cheese, and the mice decide to do a house swap.  However, they each find that they don't have the skills and knowledge necessary for survival in the other's environment.  Attacked by cats and besodden in a thunderstorm, they rethink the arrangement and return home.  Very young children may find some of the predators a bit scary, but older children should be able to handle the tension and enjoy the humor as well.  The book has about 1100 words 
 I would like to encourage any one to read "A Christmas Carol".  Whether you are not old enough to read yet, have someone read you this joyous story of Ebenezer Scrooge and his moments on Christmas.  For any adults, young or old, I would recommend you to read this to your children and to any other relative.  I think that it is one of the most interesting Christmas story that I have ever read.  Once you have read the book, take some time and watch the movie to follow the staves throughout the book.  Another thing, is that you should go buy "A Christmas Carol" at your local book store or right here at amazon.com . Thank you very much and a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year 
 This is one of the best books I've ever read on heaven.  I would highly recommend it 
 I began playing and tinkering with music in 2003. I finally purchased my own guitar in 2004 and have had a few instruments since then. I bought my banjo 1 month ago, have taken 2 lessons and absolutely...with loss of words, love this instrument, the way it is played, how it sounds and its history and how I plan to take my skills with assistance from this book. This book has changed my way of playing and I plan to study it thoroughly. I purchased the book/cd combo and it has over 50 tracks of practicing techniques that Earl has worked out for us. As said before, the history, over 40 tabbed songs, many techniques including scrugss style rolls and much more. The book is filled with every bit of useful information for the banjo player or enthusiast. Please consider purchasing if you are a beginner or finding yourself troubled with no instruction. My theory is that it is never too late to start a new instrument. The banjo and this book have changed my life. I feel as though I will devote the majority of my time towards the banjo and mastering scruggs style with this particular book. Start with this one for sure. Good luck.  
 Ariel Pink recorded this record by himself.  The songs are his vision of what good music is.  There is a decidedly 60's feel to the record.  He recorded this record using a home 8-track tape machine.  But to fans of uninhibited artistic expression (in bands such as early Pink Floyd/Syd solo and early Velvet Underground), this record will sound like a breath of fresh air in today's environment.  This is not to say the music is uninteresting, or too low-fi to really get into.  The soundscapes that Ariel creates are quite remarkable and unique.  The songs vary from quirky pop and heartfelt soul to stoner rock and experimental noise control.  Check out "Helen" or "West Coast Calamities" to get a quick taste of the world of Ariel Pink 
 This is the first book to provide a solid understanding of the Survival Stress Reaction. Aside from the new book "On Combat" by Dave Grossman, there are few books that compare. I would recommend this title to anyone who may be forced to face violent or life-threatening situations in his/her lifetime. The information is necessary for law enforcement, military, security officers, bouncers, and others who may work in similar fields. Get this title along with the Grossman title just mentioned above and you will have a physical and mental edge on most situations. That is assuming that you apply the knowledge that these great books offer 
 Gary Hart has made a significant contribution to the national discussion on the nature of our political system and our aspirations as a nation.   Very few scholars and commentators have seriously explored the serious erosion of authority and viability of our local communities and economies in the face of urbanization/surbanization, the ascendancy of consumerism, and the continued march of globalization. One writer who has explored the social and economic (especially agricultural) aspects of this problem is Wendell Berry. Berry, however, locates the problem in the larger culture and does not offer any detailed political prescriptions. I am not sure that Berry would agree, but I think that Hart's argument is a natural complement to his, coming at some of the same problems from a political perspective. Hart makes a serious attempt to articulate a vision for maintaining local control despite the centralizing forces in our national and international political and economic systems. Both Berry and Hart ask us if we can truly claim to be a "free" people when we give up all real control of our local communities and economies to distant unnaccountable political and economic elites.  Neither author offers ultimate solutions to these problems, but both ask the right questions and point us in the right direction.   In the conclusion Hart describes the extreme individualism, alienation, and "atomization" that afflicts contemporary American life.  He holds out the vision of a local republic as a response to these trends and their related social ills. (In response to the comments of an earlier reviewer, Hart is on solid analytical ground in pointing out Americans' lack of participation in local community and political affairs. His analysis relies heavily on the solid research of Robert Putnam [Bowling Alone], whom he cites extensively).  What I like best about Hart's argument is that it avoids the simplistic left-right divide in current American political discourse. Hart criticizes those on both the left and right who defend a narrow rights-based vision of the American political system, divorced from rights and obligations.  Hart's reminder that we can only preserve our rights through civic virtue expressed by our direct participation in the life of our local communities, is a timely one and fully grounded in the thought of Thomas Jefferson and the larger republican tradition. 
 One of the American masters of landscape painting in the nineteenth century was Sanford Robinson Gifford, and though he was highly celebrated in his lifetime, his name appears now only occasionally when the topic of the Hudson River School of art is discussed.  This excellent monograph, which accompanied an exhibition of his work in 2003 - 2004, serves to restore the reputation of one of our less widely known artists who captured Americana on canvas and was an important leader of the Hudson River School of painting.  More than seventy reproductions of Gifford's paintings and drawings grace the pages of this book - scenes of the Adirondacks and Catskills, luminous river scenes filled with the transparency of fog and light.  But the book also serves as an historical  document with photographs and information about Gifford and his travels abroad with the obvious influence of JMW Turner.  His perception and use of ambient light so distinct to the Hudson River Valley  are both discussed and illustrated.  This is a fine monograph of an important artist: it is also a superb study in art history of one of the most eloquent schools of painting in American history.  Recommended.  Grady Harp, December 0 
 I read this book shortly after reading Moral Politics by George Lakoff and find A Conflict of Vision superior.  The contrast in Sowell's book is between the constrained and unconstrained vision of man.  The unconstrained vision of man sees man as perfectable, a blank slate to be moulded into a morally superior being.  With the proper education and training any person can grow to be what can be termed perfect.  Those with this vision strive to create laws and institutions to better man and based on the future potential of man.  The constrained vision of man sees man as fundamentally limited in intelligence and capacity, with relatively stable characteristics from person to person.  People with this vision seek to create laws and institutions acknowledging these limitations, trying to minimize traits seen as bad, while maximizing traits seen as good.  Naturally, these two visions create a vast gulf between people with differing visions of man.  Because of this, when a person with an unconstrained vision of man talks with a person with a constrained vision of man, they often talk past each other because the basic assumption each are making are completely different.  Sowell, is, as ever, insightful, providing a clear writing style, which is easy to understand.  I highly recommend this book 
 If you're investigating this book, chances are you can benefit greatly from the information.  What harm can come from you feeling less shame in your life?  None.  And, believe me, if you act upon the information in this incredible book, your life will change.  You will feel less bound by shame.  You will feel more connected to love and to the people around you.  
 This was a great book...J.D. Robb always keeps you guessing until the end.  I would highly recommend.  Marge 
 Eagle Man makes a compelling plea for environmental and social responsibility, in a context of First Nations (specifically Oglala Sioux) history, spirituality, and worldview.  I found this book was a great introduction to Oglala culture including information on further resources and an extensive glossary of Lakota terms.  It has inspired me to pursue further study of Lakota spirituality.  I look forward to reading Eagle Man's other writings 
 Dr. Will Durant and his wife Ariel have created the twentieth century's classic masterwork of history for the general reader.    The Story of Civilization is brought to life in eleven volumes: (1) Our Oriental Heritage; (2) The Life of Greece; (3) Caesar and Christ; (4) The Age of Faith; (5) The Renaissance; (6) The Reformation; (7) The Age of Reason Begins; (8) The Age of Louis XIV; (9) The Age of Voltaire; (10) Rousseau & Revolution; and (11) The Age of Napoleon.    It will take some time to read through this incredible recount of history, but it is worth it.  I was fortunate to purchase the entire set at a chain national bookseller who was discounting the books by over 50%.  When I opened the box I was surprised to find an additional bonus book or "twelfth" volume entitled "The Lessons of History."   For the student of history, instead of paying a fortune collecting piecemeal books that cover various historical events and eras, buy this set instead.  It is the equivalent of one-stop shopping.  This set is a fantastic collection and if you are looking to find an all encompassing treatise of world history, this where to start.  You will not be disappointed.     Unprecedented and unparalleled!  I rate it at five stars. 
 The "One Hundred Men and a Girl" of the title are, respectively, the unemployed musicians who form a symphony orchestra in the hope of finding a sponsor and the plucky flibbertigibbet who, through her guileless charm and moxie, brings them together with Leopold Stokowski.  It's all incredibly far-fetched and corny, but it's an extremely likeable picture.  It is notable for the respect it pays to classical music:  in "One Hundred Men and a Girl," music actually matters; the out-of-work musicians are heroic figures who retain their nobility despite the holes in their shoes, the shine on their suits and the stains on their hats; the audiences who attend classical music concerts in this picture listen with rapt attention and respond enthusiastically at the end; when broadcasting plutocrat Eugene Pallette falls asleep at a concert (he's the only character in the entire movie who does), the joke is on him, rather than on the music:  it is comic evidence of his vulgarity.  As the intrepid "Patsy" Cardwell, Deanna Durbin sparkles more than is absolutely necessary, but she's a competent little actress, and she is surrounded by a fine supporting cast that includes Adolph Menjou, Eugene Pallette, Alice Brady, Mischa Auer and, of course, Leopold Stokowski.  Stokowski is the real surprise here:  he turns in a first rate performance that is both witty and subtle and, finally, quite moving.  The picture loses steam only when Miss Durbin is invited to sing, which happens no less than thrice; each time she performs, she does so before an increasingly august and admiring public.  Even Stokie confesses that her voice is "remarkable."  (It would be interesting to know how much Universal Studios paid him to tell such an outrageous fib.)  Her voice twitters without ever becoming air-borne.  Coloratura passages turn to mush in her throat.  The entire movie is so cheerfully diverting that watching it feels rather like spending a pleasant afternoon at an ant-free, cloudless picnic over which Miss Durbin occasionally casts her vocal wet blanket.  
 If I could give this rack 4.5 stars I would! I have owned this rack for about a month. First off, it was easy to assemble and has a quality feel to it. Once attached to my hitch it is easy to load and unload.You load 1 bike from the backside of the rack and 4 from the front. I put 3 - 26" mountain bikes and 2 - 20" BMX style bikes on it with no problem. The tie downs are easy to use and the optional lower strap holds things in place nicely. I was skeptical that this rack would actually hold 5 bikes, but it does!   My only complaint about this rack would be that the hole in the end of the rack that goes into your hitch receiver is only 1/2". So if you want to use your standard 5/8" receiver lock you are out of luck. The rack comes with a "no-wiggle" bolt that holds the rack to the hitch, BUT anyone could come along with a couple of wrenches and steal your rack. SO, I bought a 5/8" drill bit and made the holes bigger so I could use my standard hitch lock. Now I can easily take my rack on and off and not worry about the rack being stolen while out riding our bikes 
 The miniscule and sickly John Keats may not have been long for this world but he is an immortal of English language poetry.  The accesibility of Keats's great poems is the reason he continues to be read while those who  dismissed him in his own day have been swept into the ashcan of literary  history.  What's great about this complete edition is right there in the  title: It's complete, allowing the Keats enthusiast to travel through all  of Keats's romantic attempts, ranging from great to mediocre to poetic  fumbles... The Keats novice can start with the major poems and odes and  marvel, as I once did, how one so young created such a vast quantity of  work.  This edition also features valuable notes and the trajically short  biography of Keats 
 Speak Out! Debate and Public Speaking in the Middle Grades serves as a debate bible for the overworked innovative teacher.  The authors do an excellent job of creating a user friendly book for both middle school students and their teachers.  Although I have taught middle school debate for over ten years, I found myself saying "ah-ha" at an alarming rate while reading.  When I think of this book, two things stand out the most.  The book provides a number of creative activities aimed at giving students the  opportunity to practice all of the fundamentals of debate.  Secondly, the authors do a masterful job of addressing two of the most difficult concepts to teach, argumentation and refutation.  Most of the books on debate I have encountered require a PhD. to understand the meat and potatoes of debate, argumentation and refutation, but Speak Out!...scaffolds these concepts and provides ample opportunity for student mastery.  As a battle tested teacher that has been in the trenches for a number of years, Speak Out! is a breath of fresh air in today's stormy educational climate.  My only regret is I wish I purchased a copy sooner 
 This book was written around 1900, it seems, for those upper class ladies and gentlemen who delight in tea yet are ignorant of its artistic quality to life past and present.  I expected at least one receipe of Japanese tea unknown to the west but found not one blend but certainly a receipe for greater bliss, rapture with each cup.  I found the missing ingredient in my tea - perspective.  This little book takes you through the history, the philosophy, the poetry, and the religion of tea.  The chapters are as follows: -The Cup of Humanity -The Schools of Tea -Taoism and Zennism -The Tearoom -Art Appreciation -Flowers -Tea Masters  This book reads like poetry.  There is a chapter called "Flowers" which gives you the perspective of a flower in the grasp of man. It challenges you to gain feeling, to become alive by admiring life. "Tell me, gentle flowers, teardrops of the stars, standing in the garden, nodding your heads to the bees as they sing of the dews and the sunbeams, are you aware of the fearful doom that awaits you?  Dream on, sway and frolic while you may in the gentle breezes of summer.  Tomorrow a ruthless hand will close around your throats.  You will be wrenched, torn asunder limb by limb, and borne away from your quiet homes.  The wretch, she may be passing fair.  She may say how lovely you are while her fingers are still moist with your blood.  Tell me, will this be kindness?  It may be your fate to be imprisoned in the hair of one whom you know to be heartless or to be thrust into the buttonhole of one who would not dare to look you in the face were you a man.  Like all the Shambhala classics, this book is spiritual.  I hope you can read it and be forever changed.  Next time I will taste with my spirit not my tongue 
 This advice for writing serial romances, alternately attributed to Wilkie Collins, Charles Dickens, and Charles Reade, is epitomized in this 1860 novel by Collins, a story of thwarted love, a marriage of obligation, claims on inheritance, the victimization of women, and, most of all, engaging mystery.  Collins, often credited as the father of the mystery genre, creates a fast-paced story of Victorian England, revealing much about Victorian society and its values--the role of women, the laws governing marriage and inheritance, the social institutions of the day, the contrasting attitudes toward the aristocracy and the lower classes, and even the level of medical care and the treatment of psychological illness.  When drawing master Walter Hartright is on his way to teach Marian Halcombe and Laura Fairlie at Limmeridge House, in Cumberland, England, he meets a "woman in white," a young woman who knows Limmeridge House well because she was mentored by Mrs. Fairlie, Laura Fairlie's deceased mother.  The "woman in white" is Anne Catherick, who looks just like Laura, but who is an escapee from a nearby mental asylum.  Upon his arrival at Limmeridge House, Walter immediately falls in love with the beautiful Laura, but she has made a deathbed pledge to her father to marry to Sir Percival Glyde, someone Anne Catherick despises and blames for her own incarceration.  Throughout the novel, Anne visits various characters to offer help in combating Sir Percival and his cohorts.  The story unfolds through documents held by a variety of characters, each of whom tells the story from his/her own point of view.  The reader develops sympathy for the innocent and beautiful Laura, respect for her homely but bright half-sister, Marian Halcombe, sadness for Walter Hartright, and hatred for Sir Percival and his friend, the Italian count Fosco, with whom Sir Percival is in business.  Sir Percival and the count need financing, and it is Laura's inheritance that is at stake.  A series of consecutive disasters, along with arguments, revelations of abuse, the fear of exposure, and the contemplation of murder by Sir Percival and Count Fosco, draws the reader irrevocably into the action.  The characters are sympathetically drawn, with Collins showing an early awareness of the influence of psychology on behavior.  The descriptions of nature, presented realistically and in  minute detail, build suspense, as Collins creates parallels between nature and the details of plot.  As is usually the case with romances, chance plays a huge role in the unfolding action, creating cliff-hanging suspense which contributes to the excitement--and pure fun--of this seductive novel.  The conclusion, involving a subplot unrelated to the primary action, resolves issues conveniently.  The almost-forgotten author of twenty-five novels, Collins was one of the most successful authors of Victorian mysteries, and he is gaining new attention as a result of reprints of this novel and The Moonstone.  n Mary Whipple

 Victor Hugo's 1868 novel "The Man Who Laughs" (l'Homme qui rit) is the superb narrative of a young man who, as a child, was abducted, sold and deformed -- obstensibly for profit, but, as it turns out, for dark political reasons as well. To tell too much of Gwynplaine's story is to give away the plot's secrets, though the truth is its key secret is revealed less than 200 pages into the novel. Set in England at the end of the 17th Century and the beginning of the 18th, "The Man Who Laughs" skewers English aristocracy the way "Les Misérables" (1862) did French authorities. Gwynplaine's long denunciation in the House of Lords is obviously Hugo speaking, while depictions of the scheming Barkilphedro, the dissolute Lord David Dirry-Moir, and the strange Josiana (whose passive-aggressive sexuality would have fascinated Freud) are reflections of the Stuart dynasty's ugly corruption "its features hidden by a mask of joy". (Queen Anne herself is dismissed as a fool.) The only pure characters are Dea, a blind woman in love with Gwynplaine, and Homo, a wolf. Even Ursus, the itinerant philosopher, seems to fight his humanity, denying the love he feels for his three companions: the scarred man, the blind woman, and the animal. Why this magnificent novel is not better known is a mystery. One reason, perhaps, is that it would be difficult to dramatize. (There was a 1928 silent film version which is rarely if ever shown.) There have, of course, been several versions of both "Les Misérables" and "The Hunchback of Notre Dame", not to mention a megamusical based on the former. Hugo's prolixity and his penchant for sesquipedalian words must make translation an enormous chore, which is why Joseph Blamire's English translation (to my knowledge the only English translation to date) came out a full twenty years after the original publication. For the average 21st Century reader, this is nourishment not easy to digest. Hugo's style is a series of lengthy descriptions and digressions filled with obscure references. I've got one word for you: skim. But don't skim so rapidly that you miss some of the shining epigrams: "Aristocracy is proud of what women consider a reproach -- age! Yet both cherish the same illusion, that they do not change." Obviously, this is not junk food. On the contrary, for readers with rich tastes "The Man Who Laughs" is a literary feast 
 This book is my all time favorite contemporary Christian fiction!  Real life, real situation, real solutions!  A convincing lesson of Christian love bringing someone to Christ and His healing graces.  I've read "Wildflower" three times, and each time I vow to be just a bit like Birdie.  If we all tried to be like Birdie, the world would be a much better place!

 Professor Philip Zimbardo has done it again!  His The Shy Child offers great ideas and insight into shyness and its origins.  He analyzes the development and shyness and its effects on youth.  It is a great tool for  parents and anyone interested in discovering how shyness affets children.   I can't imagine an easier to read book that is chock full of the details  Zimbardo has placed in this one.  I strongly encourage everyone to purchase  this book and read it...you won't regret it 
 The pepper ans salt grinders are fabulous. Don't understand why it gets so many bad reviews! It works great, gives out as much crushed pepper as a regular small pepper mill does. And the pepper and salt coarseness are perfect too. Plus it is very handy unlike traditional mills where you have to rotate with both hands. Great product 
 Italian for Travelers was perfect for my trip to Italy during the Olympics. The book is well organized and is instantly useful! It has inspired me to learn more about the Italian language 
 It's a good season worth owning.  I assume you already know this if you are reading this.  The DVD set is presented with good sound, picture quality etc.....however....  I was really disappointed to see that Warner Bros. cheaped out on the English subtitles this time around.  Seasons 2-4 were awesome to watch with the subtitles for the hard of hearing, as it really helped with the comprehension of all the medical jargon that was being spewed out at 100 miles an hour.  As a medical professional myself, I got a lot out of this "special" feature.  My fiancee, who is NOT a medical professional, found that she was able to get a lot more out of the show by watching the subtitles as well.  It definitely helps a viewer appreciate the complexity of the show's writing.  The show is still great.  However, it is inexplicable why we had to wait 7 months for this DVD set to come out when they obviously didn't put as much work into it as the previous sets (ie. they didn't want to pay someone to transcribe the scripts and sync subtitles).  This is especially irksome considering that season 5 has been available on DVD in the UK for quite a long while now.  I had just assumed Warner Bros. was spending the extra time and cash to do the job right for North America.  I was wrong

 Chris and Rachel McCluskey coach couples into deepening their love and sexual enjoyment of each other---in very insightful and refreshing ways. I think it is helpful for everyone from newlyweds to those married for a long time who want great information with a desire to build a more passionate love life than they often have had modeled for them. Their Lovemaking Cycle is an especially helpful model for practically falling deeper in love and enhancing lovemaking. Buy this book and you are in for some fun, informative and exciting reading 
 I loved this book and I think it would be a great movie.  The characters are more realistic than many books you read today.  The situation that Mark face are like many we face in our lives today.  Many of us struggle with loving someone and them not loving us in return.  I could actually visualize the characters in this book as a real family that I knew.  Mark was a loving father and husband but his wife did not know if she loved him the same way.  She discovered she was pregnant and did not want the baby.  Mark was crushed and talks her into carring the baby through.  Once Maddie is born, Mark's life was never the same.  He was a wonderful father and would go to the ends of the earth for her.  The only thing that Mark is not capable of doing is landing a lead role in an acting position as like is wife who becomes a star overnight.  She has an affair on him while in Rome with the director and comes back to take Maddie away from Mark.  Now Mark faces so many obsitcles in his life that many of us can relate too.  His wife files for a divorce and accuses him of being abusive to her and her daughter.  Mark is forced into a deep hole in which he seeks God to help him in his darkest hour.  It takes Mark several tries before he accepts God's view on things.  However he stays strong and fights for his daughter.  The book goes on to further explain the everyday life problems that many of us know so well.  I'm not going to spoil the ending but it is an awesome book.  It is very intertaining and never a dull moment.  This book kept me on the edge of my seat as I rooted for Mark to suceed.  Many of us face problems in our lives and we fail to listen or spend any time with God, when God is the only answer to our problems.  Allow God to work in your life and watch your life change and the blessing to pour in 
 We are going through this book for a study and it has made a huge difference in how I veiw a lot of subjects and has made me be a better wife for sure it also is nice because it has a great study guide you can get to go with it that is great for incorporating daily scripture readings 
 Great movie with a positive message to preserve our principles and values. High recomended for the family 
 ...from a talking cartoon penguin.  ;)  Tom Tomorrow hits one home-run after another as he chronicles the worst years of our lives and our country as seen through the shades of Sparky the penguin.  In a generation where political satire is almost redundant,  at least we can share in Perkins' "Outrage Overload" and have a few good laughs while we're at it 
 Almost any of Alice Munro's long stories has as much humanity and as much development as most novels, but I suspect that her penchant for the story-collection format has unfairly limited her acclaim. She's my candidate for the most powerful contemporary writer in English. RUNAWAY is evidence that even when she repeats elements of older stories, she achieves new insights. Certainly her themes are limited to her own life experiences, but unlike many of us she has learned from life and has had the courage to rethink previous lessons. Don't get the idea that she's only for somber and serious readers; style alone is enough to make her an entertainer as well as a wisdom-sharer. 
 This book is great! I am half way through and I have already learned tons of stuff.   What I really like is that it's totally written for the guitar.  Everything is related to the guitar with neck diagrams and tab so it's really easy to understand.  It has total application to the guitar.  It covers all the basics, and goes beyond.  It makes learning music theory fun. 
 I love this book.  Every teacher should have one.  College education teacher aught to use it for their student teachers, too.  The reading is easy and the tips are quick and to the point.  This is a very user friendly book.  Buy it 
 Durable.  Less likely to become dog-eared and ripped through use, unlike many decks I have used. 
 This is a fantastic film that really encompasses some of the less fortunate areas of Naples.  I do not reccomend this film to Non-Italian speakers because the English subtitles don't do it any justice.  For that matter I don't even reccomed it to Non-Neapolitan speakers.(Neapolitan by the way, is the dialect of the city of Naples).  It is very different from Italian, so even to Italian speakers it can be a different language.  I grew up in Naples myself and attended pre-school, elementary-school, middle-school, and part of what we would call high-school there.  Although I was fortunate enough to grow up in a nicer area than the one portrayed in this film and go to nicer schools, it still very much deals with the ongoing problems of southern Italy.  It can seem like a childish film, however it is very complex and has many underlying themes within it.  This film was originally titled "Lo speriamo che me la cavo" hence the last line that Raffaele says in the film, however I think they changed it to "Ciao, Professore" so that Non-Italian speakers could actually pronounce it.  A great film, and another great perfomance by Paolo Villaggio 
 Okay, so I'm not a gazelle.  I'm not graceful and I'm not light on my feet.  We have an eliptical which is probably best suited to my skill level.  It's hard to fall off of one. :-)  But I hate it.  I mean, I devise ways of not looking at the clock and the minutes just drag on and on and on.  So I bought a step and I bought this workout as my introduction to stepping based on the stellar reviews here at Amazon.  I love it!  Stepping is really much less boring than the "eviliptical".  Okay, so I fell down on my #@%#$% the first time I followed this tape.  I would chalk that up to me, not the tape.  As a child my grandmother put me in ballet.  After two lessons the instructor met her at the door and told her I'd be better of in tap. The fact that I only fell once and didn't kill myself is actually a testimonial for Kathy Smith!   I would advise anybody who is new to stepping and coordination-challenged like me to skip doing the arms when first starting.  Just look at the feet and do those.  Add in arms slowly over time.  I still do just feet in some things.  And be careful with the move "over the top" because that's the move that sent my feet "over the top" of my head.  The ab section is short, but a killer.  Don't start on the incline!  Just start flat.    Kathy is fairly easy to follow, the music is cheeful, and the moves are challenging enough to keep you from thinking about how much it sucks to actually do them.  All in all a great workout for me! The only annoying thing is Kathy does let off a high pitched "drill team" squeal once in a while and say things like, "Now that you've got that down let's pick up the pace" (Uh, wait, I don't got that down!)  Thank God for rewind. But all in all she's a lot less "chipper" than some other aerobics tapes, so it's not bad.  And Kathy doesn't have an annoying voice either--a big plus!  She's also older.  I find it easier to take instruction from somebody who isn't carded when the buy booze.     
 This magazine is great.  My daughter and I are doing projects together out of it every issue.  It's great also because it is training us to be creative on our own, and to try new things.  We also do these singing lesson Cds together- "Voice Lessons To Go" by Vaccarino- really fun, and have been doing Berlitz beginning Spanish Cds together.  We love choices beyond sitting and watching TV 
 Harriet Lerner has long been writing books that are both insightful and accessible. In 'The Dance of Deception' she has achieved something miraculous: she has written a book that can help you reconnect with estranged family members and friends, improve your rapport with your children, no matter their age, and, perhaps most importantly, help alleviate the pain that deception has caused you in your own life. I have suffered greatly because of family secrets and have also struggled recently to communicate with my loved ones about painful topics. This book has served as an indispensable guide through these difficult processes and has helped me emerge a stronger, happier person. I am greatly indebted to Harriet Lerner. And I firmly believe the world is a better place for having her in it! 
 I am a serious christian and I LOVE how in alot of his books he says "christ" and "jesus!" ALOT!!!  WAR JESUS!! 
 Few magazines can match the New Yorker's high caliber of journalism, fiction, reviews, and of course, cartoons; all written by some of the best writers in the land.  It makes mainstream magazines like Time and US News look like high school newspapers.  But, one word of caution: if you're the type of person that whines "liberal bias" at anything that you slightly disagree with, then this is not the magazine for you.  
 The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, by Haruki Murakami, is like waking out of a hazy dream.  Your not sure what you are reading, why, or if you are really reading at all.  It is the type of book that defies explanation, or at least simple explanation.  It is in no way a simple book.    I will not bother retelling the entire story, Murakami does it better.  It is a story about change though.  Are we really who we think we are type change.  The book has the ability to make you question yourself by telling the story of Toru, a man that is searching.    The book carries you all the way through to the end in this magnificent half dreaming/half waking state.  Toru emulates this same state at several points in the book.  The reader often will question if what he/she read was real or imaginary.     This is not my favorite Murakami book, which would be Norwegian Wood.  But, the book is very good and stirring.  Murakami has a writing style that doesn't suite all readers and some people detest every word he puts on the page.  I would encourage picking up one of his books and finding out which person you may be.  This book is not recommended for youngsters due to some graphic content. 
 Great book but, wasn't what I anticipated.  None the less, Steven King classic 
 lots of nice plates and informative text. a good book 
 Its blue, its salty, its seaweed-y... What's not to love?  Men in particular will enjoy this soap 
 I'm a newcomer to baroque opera and vivaldi. I now own five of his operas with Griselda being the latest.  I must say I absolutely love this opera.  Lemieux, Cangemi and Jarousky are superb.  The coloratura is to die for and the orchestral playing is first class.  Very exciting.  I'm very passionate about singing, being a tenor myself and mainly singing the Mozart, Puccini, Donezetti, Verdi repertoire which is full of drama, but this is some fierce stuff.  Its so refreshing to hear a tenor in this recording apart from all the "high" voices which could be a little texturally monotinous, and tenor Stephano Ferrari does a wonderful job with this demanding score. The act II trio is sublime and all the arias belonging to Cangemi and Kermes is total "madness" which I love.  I would love it if Naive issue a dvd with their recording giving us a taste of these fine musicians working hard in the studio, at these operas for our enjoyment. [... 
 This book is a must for all libraries!!! Leo Lionni is well known for his orginal art and he does not disappoint in this book. The artwork is so creative and imaginative. The theme of this story is also significant that our differences are what make us unique and we can use those qualities to help others in different ways like Swimmy is able to in this story. You must read this book, if not for the sweet story for the great artwork 
     In The Doll's House, by Rumer Godden, Tottie Plantaganet is a wooden farthing doll inherited by Emily and Charlotte Dane from their great Aunt Laura. After being inherited by the girls, Tottie tells her doll family about the old dollhouse she previously lived in, and all the beauty it possessed. To the family's amazement, Emily and Charlotte become heirs to the dollhouse; however, they also inherit Marchpane, a porcelain and haughty doll. The family must overcome Marchpane's attempts to keep them out of the house, so they can live as they have always dreamed.       The book appeals to young girls, rather than boys, because contains dolls (two of which are male) and dollhouses. I was fond of this book because it brought back memories of my childhood when I played with dolls. This book is an outstanding volume for someone with imagination and wishful thinking.  
 Absolutely Mind-Blowing. The Bush Doctor takes it to another level with "Captured Live." This is, without question, an essential piece of work to any music collection. And if you think you are a reggae fan and you have never heard this, well, you have never even heard reggae before. Buy this disc; it will be the best [money] you ever spend. Goes great with ganja 
 What a great book and wonderful music to add to my Celine Dion collection 
 I am very happy with the Praise Baby Collection Gift Set.  My 10 month old is totally mesmorized with the images and loves moving to the worship music. Although not totally "my" style of worship music, the words are wonderful and the music is pleasant to listen to so I don't get irritated by it.  Cheaper to buy the set than separately. 
 What a great figure! Very detailed and highly posable.  Has a choice of 2 different transforming weapons, too.    
 Before I read this graphic novel, I knew very little about the history of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW or Wobblies). This was a great way to brush up on my history. Almost all of the included art is very informative and interesting. As for the IWW, they were the most successful radical labor movement in the history of the US. You aren't going to learn that in a high school classroom but we can learn a lot from the history of the Wobblies. Socioeconomic developments within our lifetimes could allow a movement such as the one represented by the IWW to grow and flourish. An injury to one is an injury to all 
 exceptional service, shoes arrived right on time 
 Miller approaches this controversial issue reasonably and intelligently.  Much other material I have read on viewed on the issue of evolution and creationism has tended to take an extreme view, with unjustified derogatory comments made about those who take the opposing view.  Miller takes what I see to be a logically consistent view that belief in evolution and belief in God are not mutually exclusive.  The book is well written.  Miller's explanations are informative and easy to read.  While I don't completely agree with some of Miller's opinions on the implications the theory of evolution has on the nature of God, his opinions are reasonable 
 Little Gold Star offers a wonderful blend of story and illustrations from San Souci and Martinez.  Little Gold Star is a Spanish American fairy tale similar to Cinderella.  However, the role of fairy godmother is filled by Blessed Mary, showing the traditional Catholic influence in this culture.  San Souci is always wonderful with words, but Martinez gives the story a serene beauty with his illustrations.  The book has a peaceful feeling with its subdued tones.  The reader knows the story will end happily and enjoys the journey to the end all the same.  I highly recommend this book 
 It's like reading a written out lecture. It's a very easy read and there are very few actual examples of work. It's a topic based `talk' in written form that walks through some of the basic areas where `veil work' is performed. It is a very broad discussion ranging from scientific `proof' of magic through topics like posession.   A great amount of general information and opinion is presented on each subject. To that end, it was very disappointing to see that on some topics, on which volumes could be written, it was summed up with only a few statements or pages. In a book that basic, I was also rather suprised to note that one of the subject in which the most instruction was given was posession.  I have ~12 years of magical experience ranging from tree huggin' Pagan to ceremonial paths. Nothing in this book was anything new to me. That said, it was a refreshing lecture that put several subjects in context with one another and added some tidbits of examples here and there that I had not heard before.  If you are fairly new to witchcraft (about or less than 5 years exp), and have ever wondered exactly WHAT `the veil' is or what some of these more advanced practices are, this is a great book.  it would be an excellent launching pad for further exploration.   If you are an advanced practitioner, you are not likely to get much out of it - except, as I mentioned earlier, a refreshing one sided conversation about topics you are probably already familiar with. 
 NO weak songs on this one.  Loretta says what she means and it comes from deep down with power.  A GREAT / FUN selection of Loretta's songs 
 Reviewed by Cathy Yanda for Reader Views (08/06)  "A Journey Into Being" offers many theories regarding childhood, from the purpose of life to the essence of a child before birth to why a child dies a short time after being born and more. The author Christine Ramos, the mother of three, is a Registered Professional Nurse, Certified Childbirth Educator and Certified Doula, and draws on her experience as a nurse and an intuitive. She takes us on a journey of intuitive conception, motherhood and child rearing through the sharing of stories and a look at research.   In sharing a story of a young woman who had a truly miserable childhood and had grown to become a strong-willed yet caring person, Ms. Ramos illustrates that there can be progression through pain. Spiritual growth is indeed the intended outcome of such circumstances. Ms. Ramos also shares a condensed version of Near Death Experiences where the person not only observes scenes of specific times in their lives when they had to make choices, but also the consequences of their choices on others. She also states that alternatives to those choices may also be shown, as well as the reality reflecting those different choices. Ms. Ramos goes on to discuss what this has to do with a child's journey into being.   Not only does Ms. Ramos draw on her own experience, but has looked at the research thoughts of others such as Dr. William Sears, Dr. Elaine Aron, and Dr. Judith Orloff. She also gives a brief overview on the benefits of aligning your chakras, co-sleeping, discipline, breastfeeding and peaceful parenting. In the chapter, "The Blossoming of a Fulfilled Essence", she looks at children who have been termed as "sensitive", "indigo" and "crystal" children and whether or not they are the essences of spiritual progression. She looks in-depth at those defined by Dr. Elaine Aron as "highly sensitive children". Dr. Aron feels that between 15 and 20 percent of all humanity can be defined as highly sensitive who have a rich inner life and experience spirituality deeply.   "A Journey Into Being" helps to prepare women for the wonder of childbirth, offering valuable insight for mothers before and after birth, and would make a wonderful gift for an expectant or new mom. 
 This movie is hilarious and full of action.Rated PG for some language including brief racial slurs,sexual content,and violence 
 This was the book that first brought Hunter S. Thompson to national attention, and deservedly so. He dissects the cultural phenomenon that was the Hell's Angels in the mid-1960s with great insight and a prose style that reads like a cold beer on a hot day -- impossible to put down.  Thompson stressed two major themes in his assessment on the Angels: (1) They were largely a bunch of "losers," men with very limited opportunities to achieve The American Dream, who banded together to create The American Nightmare of violent anarchy, or at least the image of violent anarchy. In Thompson's portrayal, the Angels seem to revel in their "outsider" status and in their calculated efforts to shake up the "squares." Thompson also indicates that the image of Hell's Angels in the '60s seems to have mattered far more than the relatively isolated incidents of violence and public outrage they perpetrated. (2) That image was swallowed whole by the mainstream media of the mid-'60s (and by law enforcement officials), so that square Americans already reeling from the civil rights movement and black unrest, from the sexual revolution of the '60s, and from the "counterculture" and antiwar movements, were presented with one more reason to believe that the country was going to hell. Thomson sees the hysteria over the Angels in that era as essentially a creation of gullible reporters and paranoid politicians and cops.  This book (which came out in 1966) catches the California-based Angels between 1964 and 1966, as the hysteria was spreading.  Eventually the Angels began to believe the media image too, which led to that fatal night at Altamont Raceway in 1969. Thompson may bear some of that responsibility, too, simply because his book was The Word on the Angels in that time; but his accurate assessment of the Angels was overwhelmed by the popular image that "outlaw bikers," Hollywood, and the media as a whole found profitable to promote.  Some reviewers portray "Hell's Angels" as the story of Thompson's own involvement with the motorcycle group. Certainly, Thompson is a "character" in the book, but he's careful to keep some distance  from the Angels. (In the first-person centerpiece of the book, an Angels "run" to Bass Lake, California in 1965, Thompson traveled by automobile rather than on a "chopper.") Moreover, he never forgets that the story he's trying to tell is of the motorcycle club and their image, not about himself. His detached involvement (involved detachment?) in this book is a model for all insistently subjective journalists. I have read little of Thompson's later work, and I gather that as he became more concerned about hyping his own image, he worked up some calculated outrages of his own; but "Hell's Angels" remains a damned good piece of "new" reporting.  Since the 1960s, Hell's Angels -- portrayed by some romantic pukes in Thompson's time as latter-day cowboys, the last champions of traditional American "freedom" -- has gone corporate, handing out franchises ("charters") around the world and selling logoed merchandise. The most famous of the Angels, Ralph "Sonny" Barger, has parlayed his status as Oakland chapter president into a franchise of his own (complete with website), marketing his own "lean and mean" brand of beer, writing a philosophical self-help book and selling signed copies at motorcycle shows. Certain outlaw motorcyclists still are being blamed (with some justification, apparently) for a variety of crimes in various countries.  Thompson's book has little to do with the commercialized Hell's Angels or felonious "1 percenters" of today.  It's a book very much of its time and place -- but such a well-focused, incisive snapshot it is! 
 This book will give you 40 days of soul searching and working through grief and anger.  A lovely gift for any reader!(... 
 I can understand why this album disappoints some of Kim Richey's fans (this is very different from Kim's earlier albums) but I can also understand why other fans love this album - and I am in the second group. Played as background music, all the songs may well sound similar. This album is definitely unsuitable as background music at least until you have played it enough to be familiar with it.   Produced by Bill Bottrell, who has previously with Sheryl Crow and Shelby Lynne among others, this album definitely needs a few plays to be appreciated although Kim sings as good as ever. I have not followed Kim's career closely but I get the impression that she was at a point in her life where there was a lot of uncertainty. Kim spends a lot of time remembering the past and wondering what the future might hold. Most of the songs are slow, reflective ballads with a bluesy feel to them. Kim even sings a song about good memories (The circus song) reflectively, rather than making it into an upbeat, joyful song.   The tempo picks up a little on No judges, which some people interpret as a gospel song. It could be, but then again it could be a simple love song - or just a song about forgiveness. The tempo picks up a little more on the next track, This love. Again some might interpret this as a gospel song (and it contains references to Jerusalem\) Again, it might be but I interpret it as a love song. It's back to normal for this album with Good day here, in which Kim tries to prevent somebody digging up the past, thus potentially spoiling a good day. After two further mellow tracks, the tempo picks up once more for the final track, Cowards in a brave new world, thus ending the album on a cheerful note.   This is a very mellow, often melancholy, album that may not suit everybody but, after a few spins, I quite enjoy it 
 I LOVE this book.  It is not compiled by subject so I can read right through it and not only hear about subjects beginning with 3 lettters of the alphabet.  The quotes are widely varied and come from fantastic, well known books as well as books I have later been prompted to read.  I can not recommend this book enough.  The quotes are thoughtful and intriguing.  If you enjoy quote books, I can not imagine a better choice 
 I read this book a long time ago for a Persuasion and Rhetoric class and it's still on my shelf today.  If you ever think about going into conflict management, negotiation, or mediation, it's extremely useful to identify different "dirty tricks" that can be used to sabotage sincere efforts toward a common goal.    Ok, so that's for the academics.  What about the common bystander?  This book is imperative to understanding the little tricks of the trade that get you to buy that car, give that donation, or buy those Girl Scout cookies.  It's written in a very easy, engaging way and is great knowledge for a smart shopper.  Once you read the tactics in this book, you start to see them everywhere and look at sales tactics in a whole new light.  Definitely a must-read for the educated consumer 
 i have waited for fourty years to see this movie ,i enjoyed it as a child and now my seven year old daugther can enjoy it with me .this is the best cinderella film of all time none of the other cinderella's can not top this one .four sisters and myself grow up on this cinerella by rodger&hammerstein's and they all say this is the best cinderella.thank you agian amozo 
 This is an excellent book to provide a succinct but powerful basis for supporting Israel as the first Middle East democracy (Hopefully those ranks will grow; Next Stop! Syria!)  Read this and then go to the the New York Times, CNN, BBC, and watch very very carefully to see if they mention the plethora of contextualized information that is found in this book that would completely change your perception of the Arab- Israeli conflict. 
 John Williams is, I think, only human. This great soundtrack gives me cause for doubt 
 KURUPT AGAINST THA GRAIN  Finally KURUPT has dropped this album, after years of delays and drama "AGAINST THA GRAIN" finally hit the streets. I must admit I was surprised it was actually on the shelves even after the date was never pushed back. But I must say the delays were worth the wait, the album is off the hook. Granted some of the songs have been out for awhile threw mixtapes, and the internet. One in particular was all ready released on an official album for the same label. In fact two others can be found on two other official releases. But all that aside this is a very strong album from Young Gotti, and even with the above mentioned it is great to hear a full album from the Kingpin.   1.INTRO  2.SPEAK ON IT-the first song on the album comes out bumpin' hard, courtesy of a bangin beat by MARK SPARKS. What a great way to start an album, plus VAL C on the track, and a guy just telling him to speak on it. And Kurupt definitely does that speaking on different situations in the world like the DPG break up, racism, the east/west war, and certain individuals getting paid off of this type of music. Also this song as got a lot of attention due to the supposed dissing that goes on at the beginning of the song. Other then the 50 CENT part the others could have been mentioned dissing everybody that says that DMX, JA, and NAS are the new Pac's & Biggie's, not necessarily the individuals mentioned. Of course I could be completely wrong, so over all this is a great track, and even though it only has one verse I'll have to give it 4.8/5.  3.ANARCHY '87-Mark Sparks returns to drop another hot beat that switches up on ya during the hook, and the verse. The hook is more up tempo while the verse is more smooth and gliding with its bass and claps. Kurupt rips the track up easily with his lethal flow, and even throws in a little DAZ diss. I also love the fact that he brought back the hook from "BEHIND THE WALLS" for a lil portion of the song. Over all this is an excellent track.4.5/5  4.THROW BACK MUZIC '86-this has to be one of the best tracks to come out THA ROW in awhile, definitely a classic. Non surprisingly Mark Sparks returns to drop this straight west coast track for our listing pleasure. Kurupt giving it up to a time period he came up in, mentions a gang of things some will definitely remember. The guy that reviewed this album at rapreviews.com said this track and the previous track were Kurupt and tha row trying to be a part of a period of time they weren't in. He must not realize that Kurupt is giving it up to that era, that dude is straight hating on this track. This is definitely a must have right here, no wonder it's a single.5/5  5.DEEP DISHES-ah yes a favorite of mine, even though some people don't really like this track. I love the way Kurupt rips this track, the way he flows to it fits the track perfectly. And the beat by RICK RUDE is amazing, very creative on his part, it kind of reminds me of that video Method Man & Red Man did where they were in those chains; I think it was called "THE ROCWILDER" or something. Also homie from rapreviews.com dissed Kurupt saying he rhymed dishes with dishes, and went on to praise KANYE WEST'S albums even though every song he does he rhymes the same words all the time. Any way this is a personal fav of mine, u have yours I'll have mine.5/5  6.STALKIN'-another single from the album, in fact this is the one I hear on the radio all the time. SIR JINX created a very interesting and intriguing beat for this track, and the samples used add to the beat greatly making this psycho girl more believable. Of course u all know Kurupt holds it down on this track, this track happens to be my girls favorite song on the album, should I be worried.3.8/5, her score 5/5  7.CAN U FEEL IT-ok I guess every album has to have that summer time, radio friendly track. DOUG MAYHEM is the producer of choice on this track, and he was very successful in making a bouncy summa tyme track. to be honest I even bump this track from time to time. This is probably the closest thing to mainstream on this album, not that it's bad, in fact it is catchy to a point, and that includes the simple hook from POTION. This is another fav of my girls. This is this album's "IT'S OVER", & "SUNSHINE".3.5/5 her score 5/5  8.SLIDE N SLIDE OUT-the ever reliable BLAQTHOVEN drops this nice beat, and this tack features Y.A. representatives EASTWOOD, BIG TRI, & YOUNG TONE. Surprisingly the star of the album Kurupt only drops a lil something at the end adding up to nothing more then a cameo, not even a verse from Young Gotti. Of course this technique has worked well for albums like "THE CHRONIC", & "DOGGYSTYLE" were there were 1 to a few tracks were the star wasn't on the track, just giving their boys shine. Over all though for the most part this is a nice addition to the album, all though to be honest I really don't listen to this track much, also Daz gets dissed.3.8/5  9.I'M BACK-to be honest this track fits the album nicely, but surprisingly here it is not labeled as a remix. As we all know this track was indeed on the "DYSFUNKTIOANL FAMILY" soundtrack, but there it was labeled a remix. So logically one would assume or at least think that the original version would be on the solo album from the artist. Or the other way around would be more logical since it would have came out years before the remix, but for some reason the remix was released first, and then re-released on this album. Well I have reviewed this track before and like before I do like this track, and the eastern influenced beat by the ROW HITTERS is nice. But I still wish the other version was included on the album.3.5/5  10.JEALOUSY-this is by far an excellent addition to the album, a great choice for a single in my opinion. Mark Sparks returns to continue his winning streak on this album, the instrumental itself is enough to get anyone to bump this joint. Lyrically this is an interesting track, seeing that the ex roc-a-fella signed M.O.P. is in the house making u "Ante Up". Also Kurupt in his verse mentions the hatred towards him for returning to Deathrow, and his so called lose of flow on this track. but to this reviewer it's ROSCOE that steals the show with his fiery verse. This is definitely a great addition to the track.5/5   11.THA PAST-Dough Mayhem returns to drop the definition of what an instrumental should be. I could go on and on about how perfect the beat is for this song, but the lyrics are just as powerful. I love that a track was included that addresses Kurupt's {at the time} former boys in tha Pound. I also appreciate the fact that this isn't really a song hating on the others, plus DAVE HOLISTER is excellent on the hook.5/5  12.MY HOMEBOYS {BACK TO BACK}-finally I got my wish 2PAC on a Kurupt album, man it felt great to see this track on the track listing. And how appropriate that this come after the previous track. also it was great to see that Mark Sparks returns to create this masterpiece of an instrumental, I love the flutes. Kurupt was right it feels good to see a Pac verse on a track with some one he actually got down with. Also Eastwood held it down nicely on this track with a verse and an excellent hook. U know I was going to give this a 4.5 or something for a recycled verse {"ME & MY HOMIES" from NATE DOGG'S album} but since a lot of people are using verses from Pac on their albums {usually the one from "THUG LUV"} I' am going to give this the classic rating it deserves.5/5  13.BULLSH#T & NONSENSE-the second song that is strictly from Kurupt's boys, in fact Kurupt doesn't even get a cameo credit from me, he only says a few words. But the thing about this track is that it is a better track then the last Kurupt less album, the beat from JOSHUA ANDREWS is a really well put together track featuring great pianos. SPIDER {now with g-unit} and Eastwood come real correct with their verses, though I prefer Eastwood's flow better in this one. Over all this is an excellent track.4.5/5  14.CALICO-what more can I say other then this is a highly energetic track, the beat from THE SCREWFACE MUSIC GROUP is highly bouncy and to quote another track with Kurupt "off tha chain" {THE VERY BEST OF DEATHROW, that song also has PETEY PABLO}. Kurupt drops two hot verses; he even adjusts his flow to fit a southern type of flow. There's even a shout out to Snoop and the Doggpound in his verses. Also the DAYTON FAMILY hold it down hard on this track, especially during the hyped up hook, this track also appeared on their album. Over all this is a great song, also the Dayton Fam shout out RAS KASS.4.5/5  15.HUSTLIN'-another song that's been moving around the internet for a while now, actually it's been years. This track was known then as "FAMILY", and the audio wasn't as good. This version seems cleaned up to a greater extent, it has a much more clear sound. This track sees Kurupt rip it up with Big Tri & Young Tone on this smooth Sir Jinx track. Each verse from the artist is off the hook, this happens to be one of my favorite tracks on the album.5/5  16.IT'S A WRAP-mark sparks returns to drop one of his best instrumentals on the album, the way each instrument is put together sounds incredible. Kurupt holds it down nicely on this track easily, the only problem with this song is that it's to short. The song comes in at a short 2:58, becoming the shortest song on the album. I just wish the song would have had one more verse.4.8/5  17.YOU F#CKIN WITH THE BEST-when I first heard this song on the internet I could have sworn that an in house producer for DOMINATION & BANG EM  had producer this track. I had always loved that underground sound this song had, and I always felt it had an east coast feel to it. So to say the least I was surprised to learn that BABY C-STYLE had produced this banger, and to his credit the beat is hard. It has the perfect underground sound to it that fits Kurupt and Domination's styles nicely. And to be honest I love the hook for this track, "I came in this Muthaf#cka with a mask on, so lay ya a## on the floor, or get blast on".4/5  18.OUTRO 
 I accidentally happened across this book, and the title andthesynopsis intrigued me.  It was captivating from the beginning.  Iloved the way the author described things, including the healings.

 John C. Bogle is to the average investor what Carl Sagan was to the lay astrophysicist---an imparter of knowledge blessed with the ability to make the complex and esoteric both comprehensible and intriguing. From his days at Princeton University in the late 1940s and early 1950s Bogle was a man determined to write the proverbial book on mutual funds. In the 1970s, Bogle established the Vanguard family of mutual funds for the common man and woman. Today, Vanguard is second only to Fidelity among mutual funds in assets under management. More importantly, and unlike its elitist rival, Vanguard boasts a family of impressive no-load funds. Chief among them are index funds which mirror the performance of the leading domestic and international stocks and bonds markets. An insightful financial analyst, Bogle long ago realized that despite all the hype and occasional home run on the part of actively-managed mutual funds, over a reasonable time horizon actively-managed mutual funds generally do not out-perform the major financial indices, indeed they comp[are rather unfavorably. Accordingly, and to the dismay of many alleged market gurus, Bogle proceeded to take the mystery (as well as the fees and charges) out of mutual fund investing for those of us who don't own yachts and villas along the Mediterranean. His no-load indexed funds are a prudent approach for the regular guy and gal who hope to retire with financial security and comfort. His story is a worthwhile read as much for its knowledge and wisdom on mutual fund investing as it is for the author's honesty and integrity. "John Bogle on Investing" is particularly welcomed in light of recent criminal charges leveled against many of our largest mutual funds and investment houses. Bogle writes as he speaks, with authority and sincerity. I highly recommend "John Bogle on Investing.&quot 
 After the war of 1812, Captain James Riley was employed as master and supercargo of the brig Commerce from Hartford, Connecticut. He shipped a crew of George Williams, chief mate, Aaron Savage, second mate, William Porter, Archibald Robbins, Thomas Burns and several others. He sailed for New Orleans in May 1815, passed the Bahamas and Florida Keys, (not without incident: the ship ran aground, before Riley freed her) and, in early August, reached Gibraltar. While headed for Cape de Verds, Riley ran the Commerce off course, and was shipwrecked in breakers off the Sahara.   One man was slaughtered on the beach.   Conditions for the rest were pure hell. Captain Riley and those remaining were forced to sell themselves into slavery in order to survive. The party was then divided. Some men  were never seen again, and were presumed to have spent the duration of their days in privation and servitude.  Riley and four others were saved in November 1815; in late September, Riley had convinced an Arab merchant to buy himself and those companions, transport them across the desert to Mogadore, and there to ransom them to the British embassy. He tells in great detail the sufferings the men endured during their slavery and travel through the desert. Nineteen months afterwards, Archibald Robbins was ransomed as well. Subsequently, he wrote at length on his own experiences in slavery. During the 19th century, a volume including both this book and Robbins' tale became a bestseller. Today, a copy of Robbins' account is hard to come by.  The conditions endured by the infidel slaves is almost unbelievable. This book, reprinted dozens of times in its day, sold millions of copies and influenced abolitionists of Riley's time. The book was of the works that the young Abraham Lincoln read by firelight in Illinois, and strongly influenced his thinking about slavery, as did a visit to the slave market in New Orleans.   Mogadore was once a flourishing city, Riley observed, but when he became a freed man there, he observed that "superstition, fanaticism, and tyranny bear sway...[and] have swept away, with their pernicious breath, the whole wealth of its once industrious and highly favored inhabitants;--have driven the foreigner from their shores, and it seems as if the curse of Heaven had fallen on the whole land...."  --Alyssa A. Lappe 
 I recently purchased a new copy of this book. I read it years ago, in 7th grade.  I enjoyed the book the second time and I'm glad I have it for my future children to read someday.  The story is a pretty heartwarming one.  Everyone gets along pretty well and there really isn't too much unhappiness in it.  Everything gets wrapped up pretty neatly without anyone getting hurt.  This is mainly a story about learning to compromise.  I would recommend this book for children (primarily girls, since the main character is a girl) ages 10-13.  Younger children would probably enjoy having it read to them.  It's a nice story for adults too, for the child within.  It's very funny how everyone refers to the lion as a "dog", and the unicorn as just a "little white horse".  I must say that I prefer the picture on the cover of the first book I read.  It was of the girl either standing between a lion and a unicorn or she was riding the lion who was standing next to the unicorn.  I think that one was much prettier than the current cover art.  Also, a suggestion for parents or teachers...when I originally read this book, it was for a school book report.  Part of the assignment was to create a board game that went along with the book.  It was actually kind of fun, though maybe these days 12 an 13 year olds may not enjoy it as much as I did.   
 is about all I can say - this one contains the thoughts of many brilliant and wonderful thinkers 
 Excellent book.  Empowers parents and honors children.  Mr. Sowell's sharing of his own experience and that of others is powerful and useful.  
 I must admit that I am generally not an aficianado of fiction, but a friend recommended that I read Chandler because being originally from Southern California, I could relate to the locales that he describes, and I am a fan of "The Rockford Files" television series whose protagonist and style of writing were strongly influenced by Chandler (although Jim Rockford is different that Philip Marlowe in some ways, not being as tough or as quick to resort to his fists in the event of receiving some insult.). Chandler came from an era in which a man's character was considered important and Marlowe is always looking for character.  Chandler himself saw the horrors of World War I so we must understand this in seeing why Marlowe puts himself out for Terry Lennox (a World War II commando), a man he barely knows, which I frankly think is inexplicable to someone raised in our post-Modern era.  I looked up Chandler in the Encylopedia Britannica and they stated there that opinions are divided on whether this particular novel is one of his best or not, because many critics find that Marlowe's passivity and seeming disinterest in the monetary aspects of his work are not realistic for a private investigator, but as other reviewers have pointed out, that is not the main part of the story.  I would not classify this work as a "page turner" because the plot is not the most engrossing part of the story and is actually somewhat confusing. It is Marlowe's (and Chandler's) observations and descriptions of the "Sun-Baked Sodom" of Southern California (many of whose locales I am familiar with) and its denizens that make the book interesting, in addition to his barbs and humor. A good example is Marlowe replaying a famous chess-match from a book which he describes as "a bloodless battle and the biggest waste of human intelligence since the invention of the advertising agency".  Chandler's jaundiced view of the society around him: television (which by the time the book was written in 1953 had become a major pastime for most people), advertising, novelists, the police, the media, the wealthy, the politicians and other "movers and shakers" still holds more than a half-century later and speak strongly to me (although we can be grateful to the "Warren Court" of the 1960's for curbing a lot of the violence and  abuses of the police) telling me that Chandler is an astute observer of the human condition and the society around him.  But not only this, we see that he is an honest critic of himself, as portrayed in the alcoholic pulp fiction writer Roger Wade character.  This encourages me to read more of his books, which I can't wait to do, even though as I said, I am not a big fan of fiction 
 Pam Johnson, self-taught cat psychologist, relates 13 true cases she has had to deal with oddly behaving cats (or their odd owners).  She writes that it's usual for her to be entering the owner's window now rather than going through the front door.  After you read through the cases, you'll understand why.  A gentle giant cat usually extroverted happy cat suddenly hiding in corners, a cat that shreds printing paper, a cat that runs itself into the wall, the cat who gets violent on Sundays, a cat that overgrooms itself so much that it gets bald, a cat that hates one of its owners when she comes home after work, 3 heartwarming stories involving owners with their cats, etc.  They're so funny, so entertaining, and makes you understand that we as humans are so ignorant as what it's like to be a cat and live in a cat's world.  It would DEFINITELY be great as gifts to other cat loving friends even if you buy them used/out of print.  I'll definitely be keeping it on my bookshelf with my other cat books 
 Overall excellent book. This is a must have book for families.   Strengths:  The author gives a recommended book list.  This is a comprehensive list by age. She also includes  some books from different ethnic backgrounds. She gives sound tips and advice how to impart values to children thru books instead of force feeding them. Great background information about classic books and particular editions and illustrators to buy.   Weakness:  She mentions books on tape, but needs to add a section on good books on tapes.  She could use more books from other cultures on the list.  
 This album came out a year after I'd caught Rich with Sinatra, a period when, above all, the great drummer wasn't afraid to swing!  Beginning in 1968 Rich, like so many other jazz musicians, practically became paranoid of the walking-bass 4/4 swing pattern that had served everyone from Basie to Charlie Parker to Bill Evans so well.  A pulse as fundamental to life as a heart beating  or a lung breathing was no longer sufficiently "emphatic" to be heard, or understood, by the '60s generation.  Rich tried to "connect"  with the Beatles-Stones audience by going to a quasi-rock repertory along with the addition  of electric bass.  Fortunately, this phase lasted for only several years, and by 1974 Rich was once again validating the swing tradition of Basie, Goodman, Dorsey and his own roots.  "Big Swing Face" captures the band at an optimal period, especially for listeners who don't require for every tune the double-eighth-note, on-the-beat, slam-bam feel of much rock-pop music.  And a previous reviewer's point about Rich's later incorporation of electric bass is well taken.  A recently released DVD video of the Rich band from the late '70s features an all-swing program but retains electric bass (even Dizzy Gillespie made exclusive use of the instrument for a while).  The instrument, quite frankly, sounds loud but penetrating and out of balance with the rest of the band.  The band may swing as much, but from a listener's perspective the sound is less buoyant, less integral with the overall sonic textures of the ensemble.  Fortunately, by the end of the '70s, the great bass debate was fait accompli: the acoustic instrument had proven its inherent worth and staying power--at least in the jazz idiom.  It's refreshing, though, to hear a recording made before all the fuss interfered with simply enjoying the music.  "Big Swing Face" is such a recording, boasting, moreover, a total of eighteen tunes (admittedly, a couple of them "period pieces," though Buddy's 12-year-old daughter's singing makes it easy to forgive one such instance), making it a great value and assured winner for any fan of Rich or just plain swinging, great big band jazz.  Finally, for an "on location" recording the audio is first rate--better, in fact, than many studio dates with the bonus of the electricity that only a responsive audience can bring 
 My favorite piece in this book is 'Answers to a Questionnaire'--  vintage Sontag-- thinking, witnessing, and finally enlightening everything she must.  Despite the self-loathing revealed by a number of American reviewers below who show themselves apparently ready to detest integrity itself, the naked truth comes clear and comes clear!  Clear thinking may yet be the last frontier!  A worthy argument for such is surely made in the pages of this book.  It is even for those who are spiteful without cause to discover themselves lurking in the heart of this book, grevious as ignorance is, & wretched as spite becomes in the end.  Listen-- vitriolic political sideswiping is as American as dumplings.  Sontag, characteristically and sympathetically, not only notes its irrevelance, but conjures an antidote called moral patience, so no wonder all the shouts and curses against her!  Making certain their own avenues of self-discovery venture nothing wiser than a hepped up, but sunless, hyper-nationalism wretchedly disguised as patriotism, it's unfortunately not surprising the chorus of disappoval this woman engenders.  Thank goodness Sontag remains preoccupied with her Art!--  a living, teaching, redemptive art burnished, by now, to an holistic glow, as every page of this book bears witness.  What in the world are you talking about??! -- SUSAN SONTAG IS AMERICAN TO THE CORE!  I reckon that aspect of her identity contributes as much as any other of her native gifts to the beauty and usefulness of her art.  Wake up, people 
 At first I was like "um...no," but then I continued watching because I rented the disks from Netflix and then I ended up laughing my ass off. This is a weird comedy show. The timing is really strange, because it is improvised apparently. Now I can't get enough of the show. Larry David is just so...inappropriate sometimes it makes you die laughing. And the cast is just great too. They all play it off like pros. I have ordered the series now and can't wait to watch them all again. One episode was so funny I had to watch it like four times in a row. Maybe that says something strange about my creepy life that I'm watching Larry David so much, but c'est la vie! My advice is to watch the entire first season and see if it doesn't sink into your skin. Larry David's humor is not for everyone, but if you are smart and kind of dorky sometimes with a wicked sense of humor you should like this 
 What I like most about this book is how it feels like a conversation with a credible and practical guide who believes in each of our unique opportunities for personally-fulfilling success. This book gets right to the heart of what's missing for any of us who wants to define success for ourselves - we need a system. The author, Bobbi DePorter, has not only organized this system for us, she has lived it, proven it and taught it to thousands of people for 25 years. This book's message and system is for all ages because it's about a common desire to create the kind of success that radiates in everything we do - relationships, work, and day-to-day activities. 
 I have been reading Greg Iles in reverse lately. His latest, The Turning Angel was recommended by a friend and turned out to be one of the best novels I have read in some time. The Quiet Game is a sort of prequel which I then read and also enjoyed. When I find and author this good, I tend to keep reading earlier novels and having now finished Mortal Fear, I think I will take a break before resuming the Greg Iles reads. This last one wore me out (in a good way).  Harper Cole has an "interesting" life. A very successful commodities trader, married to a beautiful and brilliant doctor who was his high school sweetheart and the father of a little girl everyone thinks is his neice. "Mommy" is his wife's sister a drop dead big city model who has come home to Mississippi and gotten married to settle down. The parentage of the little girl, Holly, has been kept a secret.   Cole has a "hobby." He is a systems operator for an erotic on line service which is quite expensive and sophisticated and caters only to those who can afford it. It offers total anonymity to those who purchase it's services. It is also being used by a brilliant and devious killer who's victims are being stalked for a diabolical pupose.  How these beginning story lines grow and intersect into a very compelling read is what makes this book worth reading. I used to think that I would not want Jeffery Deaver's nightmares after some of the horrific stories he has written. I now add Iles to that list.  I will agree with those that feel the story meanders a bit for maybe half of the book, but the buildup to the conclusion is do- not-put-down-unless-you-have-to eat, sleep or go to bed type writing.  Just listen to Harper Cole. He has quite a story to tell.   
 It's all about Rebecca. She appears constantly in the mind of the main character telling the story, whose name you never learn, further burying her in the presence of Rebecca. The protagonist is a young woman who quite suddenly marries a man older than herself who was married once before. Maxim de Winter's previous wife, the last Mrs. de Winter, was Rebecca.   Our young bride goes with Maxim to his great home, Manderly, which she loves, but it can not hide her from Rebecca's overwhelming presence. To her it seems Maxim is always thinking about Rebecca, whom everyone loved, who died in a boating accident just a year before. She feels herself being constantly compared to Rebecca; this is not what Rebecca would have done, Rebecca must have done it like this, Rebecca was taller, Rebecca was a social butterfly, Rebecca was very beautiful, Rebecca Rebecca Rebecca. She is 'nothing like Rebecca.'  Having not been brought up in this type of life, she must get used to the grandness of Manderly. The servants, like one Mrs. Danvers who absolutely adored Rebecca; the people, who she must contact and talk to and who are constantly pressing her to hold the great dress ball of Manderly that Rebecca used to run; and the ocean, which stands as a constant reminder of Rebecca's tragic death, with its little boat-house that brings painful memories to Maxim.   Although people must compare her to Rebecca, the poor girl makes it worse by exercising her very vivid imagination; putting words where none were said, and constantly imagining things that don't happen. She does not fit into this life, and Maxim isn't making it any easier. You feel very, very sad for her, as it seems it's quite impossible for her to be really happy.  The quiet, depressing wave takes a turn when she makes up her mind to hold the dress ball. A cruel joke is played on her, and it seems she's at a worse position than before, but then something happens in the bay. Something is found, something to do with Rebecca, and you don't know what is going to happen to our little protagonist who may have her first chance at happiness.   A very emotional and intriguing story, it goes rather calmly at first, then gives you a grand twist to end in a flourish. As you learn more and more about Rebecca, you start to wonder; about the presumptions the new bride makes about her, and the real character of Rebecca 
 This boxed set was an excellent purchase. It  is what I expected, as I own the others in this series. If you like true life police dramas, then this set is for yo 
 I had never heard of David Geffen before this book was recommended to me...Now, I say WOW!!! What an OPERATOR he was and is...What a fitting title. I highly recommend this book to all serious business people...Mike Stoke 
 Nancy Kress's "Crucible", the sequel to her novel "Crossfire", is noteworthy mainly since it has more of her excellent world-building featured in her best novels. Alas her characters are not really all that memorable, with the sole exceptions of Alex Cutler and General Julian Martin, but even they are depicted in scenes that seem all too predictable. Here in "Crucible", the human colonists of the planet Greentrees must contend with yet another battle between the alien civilizations of the Vines and Furs, and the unexpected visit of an Earth warship, Crucible, and its charismatic commander, General Julian Martin. Having enjoyed some of Kress's earlier work, I am surprised that her characters and plot aren't nearly as memorable as those from "Beggars in Spain". 
 One of the best USA rock albums ever...no kidding! Rebellion rules here..with the film "West Side Story" as the backdrop, even incorporating the film's score throughout the album..  A piece of cultural history and great songs fusing guitar drenched rock and roll, sophisticated theatrical excitement,elegant sleaze,into a total theme trip that pushed Alice into the stratosphere as both as a star and a clever force that was to be taken seriously. Every note is a treasure and unique. Should get a better remastered 2 CD version with all the trappings, restored artwork and whatever outtakes and live songs that are floating around capturing this highly influential group in the midst of creativity that began with in  earnest with Love It To Death,Killer,School's Out and Billion Dollar Babies..all essential 
 I had always wondered why some enterprising publisher didn't excise the irrelevant material from Volume III of Fortescue's monumental history of the British Army and produce an all American War of Independence volume. I have just ordered the Greenhill edition but have read the original from the multi-volume set. Presumably, John Shy's introduction will provide enough perspective to take the edge off of Fortescue's rankling (to 21st century ears) chest-thumping Victorian imperialist harangue. However, to anyone who winced at the "Patriot's" demonizing of Tarleton (somewhat overdone) and the "Bloodyback" regulars ( a lot overdone), this view from "the other side of the hill" is refreshing. Readers of Higginbottam, John Shy and a hostof other recent sociologically oriented AWI studies may find this as a throwback to the so-called "drum and trumpet" war history, where the strategies and tactics were discussed with little reference to the societies that produced them. Personally, I welcome the return to the nuts and bolts of military operations. Fortescue is no admirer of the American mobocracy, as he makes clear. For example, his description of the viciousness of the ungrateful crowds of colonists as they  hurled insult and injury upon the heads of the poor redcoated troops trying to protect them from themselves will be all too familiar to those who read the late 1960s propaganda pieces supporting the US role in Vietnam. It is fascinating to read  about the various Kent-state type crowd control episodes and the Boston Tea Party, etc. in that light. On the other hand, given Fortescue's prejudices, it makes his reluctant praise of such episodes as Washington at Trenton and the Saratoga and Yorktown campaigns all the more gratifying to the American reader. He does cast much of the blame on the inefficiency and greed of John Bull's erstwhile native allies, the Loyalists.  Likewise the vacillating British foreign policy (that blundering St. Germaine!) is considered to have sold out the valiantly performing British troops. All in all, this is a welcome reprint of Fortescue's take on the American victory of 1781...especially since the full set from which this volume is extracted was only reprinted once, in the 1970s by AMS and the reprint volumes are going almost for as much as the originals from the dawn of the 20th century 
 This writing is so strong, lyrical and commanding, that I am almost able to forget how much I dislike the story. Two boyhood friends fall in love without their parents' knowledge, which leads to a series of events that highlight each characters' insecurity with their life in this world. What exactly is the purpose? Will I ever "know" people and feel at home? Who am I supposed to love?  -- Reviewed by Jonathan Stephen 
 Couldn't believe that this was the same John Lithgow who starred in "Third Rock From the Sun", an hilarious comedy that ran for a few years on NBC.  John plays the ultimate bad guy seeking twisted revenge for being stopped in his tracks by Denzel's character.  Wasn't expecting much, but this movie was surprisingly entertaining.  Yes, it was a little violent, and some parts were a tad unbelievable, but overall, Denzel and John were worthy antagonists.  Boy, Denzel sure was gorgeous!!  Still is.    
 I recently moved to Mexico, and as weight and customs tariffs limited my importation of books, I chose this cookbook to be my overall basic resource. I have been glad ever since that I left my "Joy" behind, along with my "Best of Cooks Illustrated" and the Childs volumes. Unlike B. Marold, I have not been disappointed by any of the recipes I've tried, and I've been delighted to find so many of them to be Latin or Caribbean themed, so that I can use the products most readily available here yet branch out from the usual Mexican fare. To complain that the omelet-making or brioche-making techniques are not what they would be in a teaching volume is to ask more of this compendium than what it is: the best recipes published in Gourmet Magazine, period. I find the sidebars useful and the unfortunate yellow titles a minor irritant. The index is excellent, which is not often the case with cookbooks. Everything for which I've needed a recipe I've found in one way or another through it. Try the Cuban Roast Pork Loin; the Avocado, Orange, and Jicama Salad; the Beets with Lime Butter! My only complaint is that several times I've proceeded with a recipe and added all of an ingredient only to discover that some of that ingredient was to be saved for a later step. I've since learned to read more carefully through a recipe before plunging in.    
 "City of Glass" is Austers first book of his "New York Trilogy". He keeps his themes so it is also about poverty, hunger and chance. "City of Glass" is about the writer Daniel Quinn who pretends to be the detective Paul Auster. Quinn observes a man who locked in his son for years in the dark in order to teach him god's language. Quinns client fears his father who will be set free from jail. Daniel Quinn is like the other protagonists by Paul Auster. At the beginning "City of Glass" is a very trilling novel. If you read something else by Auster before you read this book you may know what will happen. In the end your expectations won't be fullfilled. For me it is too strange because I don't like Austers theories of chance 
 I must admit I bought this book because of the [...] on the cover.  I thought it would be funny to leave it on my coffee table as a joke when friends were visiting.  It was worth buying just for the novelty.  A few weeks ago I was bored and picked up the book to read it.  It wasn't what I expected.  After the first chapter, I kind of got into it.  It's a lot different from other books that I have read.  It's got a weird sense of humor, like Mr. Show.  You can tell the author was pretty young when he wrote it.  Maybe because the characters are druggie rockers.  Aside from the characters, the ideas in the book and the way it was written were very compelling.  I finished the book in just a couple days, which is a record for me.  Then I went out and bought more Carlton Mellick II books.  All of them are great. Usually, I'm not much of a reader.  My life is about movies.  I make movies.  I sell movies.  This is the first author that I have read that is as good as watching movies.  I have recommended Satan Burger to all my friends.  Now I recommend it to you.  Even if you think most books are boring.  This is one book that is far from boring 
 This is one of the books I wished someone would write.  My knowledge of science past and present was wanting and yet there wasn't a single book written for (and by) someone in the same boat.  Bill Bryson has written such a book and brillantly over-achieved in the process.  In the spirit of full disclosure, I like nearly everything Mr. Bryson has written.  He can be pedantic and peevish when describing the less than admirable characters and circumstances he encounters but he's always very funny.  Having said that, this physically ponderous tome made me wonder whether he could sustain his humor while at the same time educating the reader over all those hundreds of pages.  Miraculously, his choice of anecdotes and pacing is spot on.  It is extremely readable and there are wonderful factoids and "ah ha" moments on nearly every page.  Life is short and this book is not but it's absolutely worth the trade-off 
 This book was delivered very promptly.  The pictures are great and the text to the point 
 This wild and wonderful retelling of the classic John Henry folk tale will not disappoint any reader. From the moment John Henry is born and all the animals come to see, excitement and splendor beg the reader on. John Henry is a man of indomitable spirit. He works hard and large at whatever he sets his hand to. We are left with a feeling of 'can do' by the example of this mighty legend.   I loved the illustrations by Pinkney. They come to life on the page and add wonder to the story. I was reminded of Paul Bunyan and his might blue ox Babe as John Henry bore down ever harder on that drill. Not willing to give up or quit. This book won both the Caldecott Honor and The Boston Globe-Horn Book Award.  ......Julius Lester was not an author I was familiar with, but he is one that I will certainly look for now. He has written some 25 books in his career and won many awards for his titles 
 Leave it to Koontz to come up with a way to reenergize the Frankenstein story

 This is a great read for anyone interested in human evolution.  It includes all of the most recent fossil hominid discoveries as well as providing an up-to-date overview and systematic analysis of human evolution over the last 6 million years or so (including molecular - archaeological information).  It provides a convincing argument for the 'Out of Africa' Hypothesis for modern human origins.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in evolution and human and great ape evolution in particular.   
 This & all the books in the Dr.Sears parenting library are wonderful! Very helpful with caring, smart ways to make parenting easier. You can really tell that the authors enjoy thier work & being parents themselves 
 Keith does something different with every album and Spankmaster is no exception. This is possibly his craziest cd, definitely the funniest. I'll even admit that I wasn't too excited after the first listen, but it grows and grows on you. Without the couple lame tracks, this would be a five star rating. If you want his best solo album (all personalities and groups aside) check out Black Elvis/Lost in Space 
 "H.M.S. Surprise" is the most enjoyable of the first three books in Patrick O'Brian's famed Aubrey-Maturin Series.  The characters have been established, and the reader is now familiar with O'Brian's archaic, mannered prose.  So let the dice fly!  This third book covers a lot of turf, and not just in terms of nautical miles.  Captain Jack Aubrey remains in debt, having been cheated out of his prize money by a greedy, unsophisticated bureaucrat.  His debts put his engagement to the gorgeous Sophie Williams in jeopardy, as Ms. Williams is under the guardianship of a money-loving harridan straight out of Jane Austen.  So Jack must once again take to the high seas to (literally) seek his fortune.  Dr. Stephen Maturin also has romantic troubles - he remains smitten with the scandalous, rebellious beauty Diane Villiers (who also caught Jack's eye), but Villiers has taken flight to India with her keeper/lover, the rich trader Canning.  Maturin also suffers unbelievably when a stupid government official blows Maturin's cover as a spy, leading to a dramatic rescue attempt by Aubrey and his crew.  The majority of the novel is given over to the voyage to Cambodia via India, and Cap'n Jack and Dr. Maturin get a dozen chances to battle storms, the French, haughty and insufferable passengers, the horrifying plight of children in India, and in Jack's case, the hard-won affections of a sloth.    By far the most humorous of the first three novels, "H.M.S. Surprise" also has thrills to spare.  O'Brian writes with a unique style that takes some getting used to, but once you are into the rhythms, it becomes quite enjoyable.  And very few authors can write such a harrowing action scene - if you saw the movie "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World," in this book you will see the inspiration for the scene where Dr. Maturin operates on himself to remove a bullet.  I leave it to you to compare whether the movie tops the book.  Do not start the Aubrey-Maturin series with this book, as good as it is.  If you have not started this series, get yourself a copy of "Master and Commander" and get sailing!  
 This is a great movie, will definately keep you laughing at the Diva's in this movie.  So what the movie is not as good and thorough as the book(what movie is?) I mean if you want ever detailed in a book put on screen then we will still be sitting in the movie theatre trying to see the end 
 I just finished reading one of the only novels I had started and not finished. I was supposed to read it for a Philosophy of Literature course I took during my undergraduate studies and during this failed effort I found this to be the most boring book in the world and couldn't get past the first 20 pages (of only 219 pages!) At the time I confessed to this in class and found that I wasn't alone. However, the interesting thing was that it was all the males in the room that found it so boring and all the females who found it so intriguing.  Now, let me immediately say I don't think this has anything to do with the fact that it is titled housekeeping. However, at the time we talked in class a great deal about the difference between a novel with such a feminine perspective and voice and the more numerous novels with a decidedly masculine voice and tone, regardless of the author's gender. I think the most distinctive difference between this novel and most novels I've read is the pace. It is very, very slow and methodical. The cover heralds the praise it received from the New York Times Book Review: "so precise, so distilled, so beautiful that one doesn't want to miss any pleasure that it might yield." I would agree. What I mistook in my first stalled out attempt to read this novel as clunky, boring details were in fact the careful groundwork of great storytelling.  Nearly every dislike I had for this book was disproved during my second read. This book accomplishes an integral task of a successful novel, which is that the form of the storytelling reflects the world of the characters and causes the reader to experience the character's world in the same way. Years ago I criticized the book for doling out details in a stutter-stop fashion, but as I reread it now I realized that this is exactly how the characters matured and learned about these same things. Another gripe I had initially was of the pace, but this I think in reality just drives home how dull and slow the narrator's childhood and path into adulthood was. The act of housekeeping has so many meanings throughout the text that I don't want to spoil any of them, but I found it to be a useful touchstone as I followed the young sisters through adolescence in a small, boring, little town years ago.  Overall, the story is very compelling and chapter after chapter the plight of the women whose lives this novel revolves around delve ever deeper into sadness and loneliness. However, it is in this complete isolation that the protagonist finds some semblance of happiness and peace. I would definitely suggest this book to anyone who has an open mind and enjoys a well-crafted novel 
 We live in a time when the very concept of Capitalism has come under attack from nearly every corner: the religious zeelots who think that only the study of God (THEIR God) should be done, the far left who believe that the Government should do everything, and on and on. Each can present stories of things that Government/Charity/Education or whatever has done better on some task. And they have - developing the Internet, wiping out smallpox - to name just two.   What capitalism brings is innovation into areas where Government would get all kinds of opposition from the various wings. Of one thing you can be sure, the future will not be like the past. We can't say just what problems the future holds, but innovation funded by people who have this idea about how they can get rich will be the answer. Yes, as this author says, it must be sustainable, it must be eco-sensitive.   We are running out of oil, to be sustainable will require a lot of innovation. We must be eco-sensitive, otherwise we all live in a cess pool. No one but capitalism can pull this off 
 "Girl with a Pearl Earring" interested me after seeing the movie of the same name.  Their titles are about the only thing they have in common, but each is good in their own respect.  The book is very interesting in that it uses the first person, and it was refreshing to read that.  The only thing that bothered me was the time span; it confused me, as I didn't really see a change in anyone or the circumstances.  I greatly enjoyed the descriptions and emotions that author Tracy Chevalier conveyed, and it helped me understand the movie better - Griet's motivation was presented to us in this book. A lovely, sensual story. I recommend 
 This is an easy read, his directness and passion has changed my life as I walk my soul path.  He explains how we can tap into this energy to assist others and ourselves in healing mental, spiritual and physical aspects of being human. He also helps  us to understand how ego may hold us back. I was guided to actually attend an oreintation in Washington, DC and met Dr. Pearl. I have taken Reconnective Healing I, II and completed "The Reconnection-Level III" Currently practicing Reconnective Healing. Everyone can do the work.    
 This Book made the  hair on the back of my neck standup ...it is Breathtakingly told superb ...like a LE CARRE  Novel ...this Killer stretched the Israeli's to the Brink ...but they got him in the end ...INSHALLAH...by the way he belonged to HAMAS ,thats the Goverment now in Power in Palestine ....OH really!!!!!!.. 
 PROS: This DVD is appropriate for younger children. It encourages movement and works major muscle groups. The movements are pretty simple, but technique is not the emphasis anyway. The instructor is kid-friendly, not overly made-up or emphasizing body image. Rather, she could be the babysitter or the kindergarten teacher. Emphasis is on health, not appearance, which is great. She teaches the names of some major muscles (biceps, quads, hamstrings, etc.) and talks a little bit about healthy food and energy. (Healthy snacks give you better energy to play!) It is great for my 4 & 6 yr. old girls. They are not frustrated with complex moves or too fast a pace. They are not thinking about how they look or whether they are doing the movements "correctly." It is fun, holds their attention, and keeps them moving. If you are wanting a DVD that promotes health, good snack habits, and exercise without stressing specific exercise techniques or how your body "should" look, this meets that criteria.  CONS: I will say that it could be a little longer. It's less than 30 minutes so I don't know how much of a workout they are getting. Not to be used as a substitute for outdoor activity, but better than none on a rainy day. Some of the activities are not very vigorous, like wiggling fingers. It's definitely not a DVD for older kids. The children in the video are focused on using the right muscles rather than specific technique. I was also a little annoyed at the "snack break" segment. I think it lasts 2 or 3 minutes and just shows healthy food choices, but it interrupts because it comes between the workout and the cool down. And of course, the kids think they need a snack during this few minutes of time, which just doesn't work! I understand wanting to end the DVD with the cool down because it is focused on relaxing, but the snack part just doesn't work well where it is. I suppose you could always have your child begin cool down during this time by doing some simple stretches while watching the fruit go by... :)  Overall, this was a good choice for my kids at their level 
 I have never read Foner's longer treatment of this tragic period in  American history, "Reconstruction, America's Unfinished  Revolution," but this abridgement gives an exellent overview of the  subject. Foner debunks the theory that the "Radical Republicans"  were the bad guys and the Andrew Johnson was a moderate acting in the  spirit of Lincoln. In fact, there was very little progress in restoring  rights to freedmen during the first year or two after the Civil War under  Johnson's "moderate" approach. In fact, Johnson, while a firm  supporter of the Union during the war was, in his views towards blacks, a  racist as demonstrated by statemnets Johnson made and which this book  documents. It was only after the "Radicals" forced federal  intervention that blacks made significant progress. Unfortunately,  Democrats began to make headway in the South, often by the use of  intimidation and violence, and what remained of the Republican party began  to change it's agenda. Certainly, the Republicans in the North became  indifferent, culminating in President Rutherford B. Hayes' abandonment of  Reconstruction after his narrow victory over Samuel Tilden in the 1876  election. This book is illumi\nating and well written. Although an  abridgement, it reads smoothly rather than as a patchwork. I recommend this  book to all who are interested in this underemphasized period of American  histor 
 I have not read any of Hauerwas' works in their entirety. But this is an intriguing set of essays. Stanley Hauerwas approaches many issues from a totally different perspective than the world around him. Unlike many western Christians Hauerwas does not look at social issues in term of rights; for example abortion. Hauerwas does not qualify his remarks on abortion in terms of right to life, right to one's body, etc. instead Hauerwas' view of life is that it is a gift of God that we should not address as a right because rights are ostensibly legal entitlements. This does seem to be a Biblical perspective on the issue, at least it is in my opinion. That not withstanding Hauerwas makes little use of scripture in these essays. Something I find rather disturbing. As a Christian I want to see ethics spelled out in scripture because that's the bread and butter of my faith. This is the only major shortcoming I can readily identify in the way he addresses things. Overall I would recommend this work to any Christian would wishes to reflect on social issues in a way that does not require them to play ball with the world at large. 
 This has great 80s music in it. I saw a commercial for a radio station with a man getting ready for work and shaving and singing "Back in Black." "You Shook Me All Night Long" was played at most dances throughout high school and a few in college. Two friends from college sang that song as well and sounded just like AC/DC. This is a must for rock music fans 
 Jill Davis and Jill Kastner have created a world as warm and cozy as a child's favorite blanket in this delightful picture book. My kids were ready to crawl in and cuddle up! Sweet, funny and earnest, this story captures all the joy and wonder of a pre-schooler's busy day. Davis's charming, lyrical words, and Kastner's lush, ebullient pictures will make you smile. Perfect for bedtime or anytime! 
 I really like this mobile. It keeps my 13 week old infant entertained and she also falls asleep to it from time to time. She gets so mesmorized by it that she will fall asleep. My only problem with it was the first one they sent me did not work but Amazon does such a great job with returning it that all I had to do was email them that it do not work and they sent me one right away to replace it and all I had to do was print the label out and postage and everything was taken care of, just had to drop it off at the post office. I actually got the replacement within 4 days so that is pretty good. They are on top of things.

 Fans of Michael Connelly and his series revolving around Detective Harry Bosch will not be disappointed with his newest novel "Echo Park".   It's mesmerizing from start to finish, and includes all the right elements a murder mystery should have. The main character, Harry Bosch, is engaging as a police detective who is finally on the verge of catching the killer of a woman who's unsolved case has haunted him the last 13 years. Bosch's dedication and determination to find the true murderer, even after the case had long since turned cold, gives your heart a flutter, and it makes me hope that there are many true detectives out there like him.  The novel has an excellent pace, and the reader is not made to wait long for more action, or the next clue that will bring the story a little closer to it's climactic conclusion. Although this novel is the most recent in a series of novels that deal with the same characters, it is also the kind of novel that can be read and enjoyed by someone who is reading this author for the first time. Basically, it doesn't overly confuse you with too many details from previous novels, therefore making it easy to read by anyone.   If you are reading Michael Connelly for the first time, this is a great one to start with. If you like it, and are left wanting more, I recommend going back and picking up the rest of his books that deal with Harry Bosch and his adventures.  All in all, a great read, and a very intriguing look into corruption, betrayal, and the mind and habits of a serial killer 
 That is the only word that can begin to describe Gary Larson and his thought process when putting together these collections.  For the most part this compilation of cartoons is standard Far Side material.  What makes this collection outstanding is the full color cartoons located in the center of the book.  This collection of "art" is all about wiener dogs taking the place of other objects/people in history.  Some of these pictures and commentaries such as "Bottle, Apple, Book, and Bowl of Wiener Dogs" are priceless.  A must have for any Larson fans 
 As has been noted there are a rash of english language books on the Anglo and American participation of the war.  The battle of the Somme and the 1918 offensive are covered in detail in most books on the war.  Anyone with a serious interest knows about the destruction of the British regular army and England's officer class.  We read about the war at sea because of England's involvement.    Few books have concentrated on the French aspect except to mention the Mutiny's, the miracle of 1914 and of course the mention the damage done to the French nation by the death of so many Frenchmen.  THis book is parhaps one of a kind then because it gives the English language reader insight into the French strategy.  Mostly a strategy that hs been mocked or passed over.  Most have viewed the 1917 offensive as one more ill-concevied blood bath leading directly to mutiny.  Many know about Verdun, however the rest of the front, some 70% of it was manned by Frenchmen.  The French army shared the burden of the war on the western front.  Here we are given a fuller picture of the french general staff, of Foch and Petain and of the french strategy in more minute detail.  Keegan and others have done wonderful books on WWI, the more specific study will sppeal to those with a genuine interest in the period.  A worthwhile read.  Seth J. Frantzman    
 When I was growing up in the Sunshine Housing up Big Creek, my Dad was a shift boss at the mine.  From the time I was a little girl I always wanted to go underground to see what it was like, but never got the chance.  Dad retired from the Sunshine (with emphysema from the rock dust) in 1971 and then a few months later my Mom passed away - exactly one month before the fire.  So many of those names in the back of the book are familiar to me.  Dad lost a lot of good friends on May 2 and now I know why his life really ended right then - it just took him 7 years to lay down. I had moved away from the Silver Valley long before the fire so I really appreciate Gregg Olsen for bringing that period of my life back and opening my eyes to exactly what my Dad and his friends faced every day.  I highly recommend this book to anyone (like me) who ever wondered about what it's like underground....   Thanks for taking me there at last Gregg, it was quite a journey 
 The interesting thing about this book is that its plot is resolved by a drawing instead of words.  In fact, towards the end, the book seems to do away with words altogether and shows everything that happens with pictures only.  Hardcore writers may not approve of this method.  A princess appears out of nowhere to give both the dragon and the knight helpful books, and that's how the story ends.  I liked the colored-pencil-esque drawings, especially of the dragon making evil faces in the mirror.  Gave me a laugh or two 
 Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu Volume 2 may very well be the greatest DVD ever created.  It is not however without competition.  Volumes 1, 3 and 4 all give this a run for it's money.  This series finds the perfect balance of humor, romance and action.  That perfect balance being 98% humor, 1.5% romance and .5% action.  I'm not sure if I have ever laughed harder than when military gun nut Sosuke Sagara disguises himself as Bonta-Kun (A big amusement park costume, just do a google image search to see it.) to conceal his identity from Kaname Chidori, the girl he is trying to protect, and then after completely blows his identity by firing a gun at the gangster with a knife at Chidori's throat.  Go and get Full Metal Panic? Funoffu episodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as soon as you possibly can.  If you have a store that has them nearby, then get in your car right now and get them so you won't have to wait for Amazon to deliver.  Unless you don't find a gun nut stealing a Bonta-Kun suit and crotch stomping city gangsters amusing 
 From the director of "Lethal Weapon" and "Superman" and it shows.  Really enjoyed this film.  Spectacular shots of the West - shot in Yosemite.  Mel Gibson is looking old - like early 40s - but his blue eyes and long lashes are still something.  He's too comic here, as he has been of late.  I much preferred him in "Mrs. Soffell" and "Hamlet".  And James Garner was perfect - all cool to Gibson's manic energy.  And tons and tons of cameos, from Danny Glover, to Doug McClure, to Robert Fuller.  But Gibson was not as smooth as Garner in the original "Maverick", nor in fact did he seem to have the same confidence in himself.  The movie was entertaining but gimmicky, from the borrowings from "Lethal Weapon" and "Raiders" to Graham Greene's wisecracking Indian.  It was just a little too precious.  Gibson should go back to serious stuff. (And look what he does now!) I must admit the ending caught me.  I had not a clue.  But as a fun movie, it definitely works.  James Coburn must be mentioned.  He looked great, sounded great, was great.  How old is he anyway?  Mel Gibson should age so well.  And a beautiful old steamboat.  Plot was all about poker and money, what else 
 I own about 10 Pat Metheny albums, and I enjoy all of them alot. That said, this album has always stood out as my personal favorite. It includes some of Methenys best work as a guitarist, and as a composer. I really cannot fathom all the negative reviews this album is getting...   This is a unique Metheny album, unlike most others. It contains rhythms that trace back to Pop and Rock. "To the End of the World" is the real standout track on this album, an epic 12 minute piece with varying themes and rhythms. It stands out among Methenys superior compisitions. "We Live Here" features a tribal element, proving the bands boundaries and limitations are endless and nonexistant.  The band, Lyle Mays - keyboards, Steve Rodby - bass, Paul Wertico - drums, and of course Pat Metheny on guitar, are all on top creative form on this album. Great album to own if you are looking so see what all the hype over Metheny is about, or if you have a hankering for some good Jazz/Fusion 
 This is truely an awesome product, it is so easy to use and holds a ton of data.  
 AFI makes really good music. I wish there wasn't as much screamo but besides that I love them 
 ...David Sedaris was only famous for talking about Christmas. Santaland Diaries, heard on NPR stations across the country, is what gave him his first fame. This collection of stories came after his first book, Barrel Fever, and before the rest. This is back when he was still writing short stories, which he isn't really known for anymore. This book has a couple of short stories and, like the short stories in Barrel Fever, they're not really accessible to a wider audience. They're dark - baby murder dark. Definitely not something everyone can appreciate. But pick it up, maybe you'll like it. If you're the sort of person who finds the idea of a theatre critic reviewing children's holiday pageants bitterly, it's worth a try 
 This book is very inspiring and informative.  It presents information that is extremely relevant to today's workplace.  This book can help companies achieve a high degree of excellence 
 Exactly ten years before the terrorist assaults on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center, Don DeLillo's Mao II (1991) compared the act of writing to the language of terrorism.  Like terrorists, writers once had the power to destabilize perceptions of the world.  They unsettled one's customary responses to things and opened up the possibility of new thoughts and impressions.  By giving things extraordinary names, literary language had the power to radically transform one's relationship to the world.  Today, however, what could be more harmless than a novel?  A novel is insignificant in comparison with the explosive force of terrorist initiatives.  Literature is dead, and the news is the new means of perceptual disorganization.  The only way that literature can be effective in a culture of terror is by absorbing the gestures of terror.  In DeLillo's novel, literature, quite literally, terrorizes.  Legendary novelist Bill Gray is blackmailed by a Maoist Lebanese political organization to act as its spokesperson.  Although literature has lost its power to alter human perception, the image of the author exerts a certain authority.  For this reason, Gray's simulacrum will be used to promote the causes of Lebanese nationalism.  The writer becomes a reporter, a mediator of images that stimulate fear.  As if to acknowledge that literature is absorbed by the culture of the image, Mao II takes the form of a "picture-book."  On the one hand, its various scenes have the "feel" of a documentary and resemble the news in printed form; there is, for example, an extraordinary "documentary"-like moment in which Brita and Karen watch Khomeini's funeral on television and witness endless crowds simulating paroxysms of grief.  On the other hand, each section of the book is segmented by actual photographs: masses of Chinese citizens gathered before Mao Zedong; a preordained marriage ceremony at Yankee stadium; a stampeding crowd crushed against a fence at the Sheffield soccer game; Khomeini's portrait; children in the trenches of war-torn Beirut.  All of this serves to reinforce the book's thesis that the book is dead.  The book has been consumed by an infinite swarm of technically reproducible images.  The author of a novel about terrorism, Martin Amis incorrectly categorized Mao II as a "postmodernist" work.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  If anything, the book traces the limits of postmodernism by standing against the transformation of words into images.  The novel links the tyranny of images with the tyranny of terror-hence the title, which is taken from one of Andy Warhol's mass-reproductions of Mao Zedong's portrait.  By conjoining the order of images with the order of terror, the book condemns both.  Of course, one of the characters, George Haddad, representative of the Lebanese terrorist group and Gray's interlocutor, claims that terrorism has not been incorporated and absorbed by the culture of the image: "Only the terrorist stands outside" [157].  By saying this, Hadded attempts to afford an identification between the writer and the terrorist.  But the exact opposite is the case-just because Haddad makes this claim does not mean that "DeLillo" agrees with him.  Terrorists need technically reproducible images in order to terrorize.  Without television and the massive circulation of sound-bytes and images that it empowers, the efforts of terrorism would be ineffective.  By contrast, literature is, strictly speaking, invisible: it is constituted by hints, clues, gestures, and ambiguities.  In a culture in which terror is spread through images, literature is doomed to failure: "What terrorists gain, novelists lose.  The degree to which they influence mass consciousness is the extent of our decline as shapers of sensibility and thought.  The danger they represent equals our own failure to be dangerous" [157].  American culture is a culture that valorizes the obvious-and for this reason, terrorism, which exploits the obvious, has a firm hold on the American sensibility.  Everything must be visualized, everything must be known, everything must be self-evident, everything must be confessed.  There is no place for literary opacity in a culture that values transparency above all else: "Years ago I used to think it was possible for a novelist to alter the inner life of the culture.  Now bomb-makers and gunmen have taken that territory.  They make raids on human consciousness.  What writers used to do before we were all incorporated" [41].  And yet terrorists are also incorporated.  One must no longer imagine that terrorists are "Others" who infiltrate a domestic territory. Terrorists do not attack "us" by way of an intervention or an incursion from the outside.  Terrorism, according to the logic of Mao II, inhabits the very culture that it pretends to assail.  All writers are terrorists and "half murderers" [158]-and Gray is no exception.  Like the other "dictators" mentioned in the novel-Khomeini, Mao, and Moon-Bill recedes into an exile that would precede his accession to power and intensify his influence.  He disguises his past and changes his name (from "Willard Skansey, Jr.") in order to de-expose himself.  His openness-the media exposure to which he "submits"-is the most devious form of concealment.  How else can an author survive in a culture of terror except by immersing him-/herself in an ever-proliferating sea of images?  Even before his "proselytization," Gray allows himself to be photographed by the enigmatic Brita.  As the subject of a photograph, he yearns to obtain power through inaccessibility: "The deeper I pass into death, the more powerful my picture becomes" [42] By retreating into the illuminated darkness of the image (like Pynchon, like Blanchot, like Salinger), the writer occupies a sacred space once reserved solely for godhood.  Only when the subject is dead can its image have any meaning.  If the subject is still alive, he gives himself the gift of death by permitting himself to be visualized.  The photograph is the death mask of the author.  Joseph Suglia, the author of YEARS OF RAGE, the novel inspired by the Columbine High Massacr

 I like this MP3 as it is easy to load music and play. The quality of sound is also good. However it takes me few days to understand choosing different music folder to play the music. Hence it would be better if manufacturer can provide more details in catalog for the easiness of users 
 Certain events in history change our world forever.  Since 9/11, our reality remains an uneasy one; bringing to the surface a world of terrorism, poverty, police brutality and more, to a once complacent society.  The soundtrack for this disquieted reality? Rob Swift's War Games.  Having left the X-Ecutioners, Rob Swift returns to bring us an inspiring hip hop mélange of thought-provoking and innovative tracks; acting as a catalyst to the part of your brain that has been dormant, quietly awaiting the mental and musical stimulation it requires.  The album features the lyrical craft of The Large Professor, Breez Evahflowin, Akinyele and Prints Haze, serving as the messengers for our new reality.

 This score is one of the most emotional and well composed scores there is. The upbeat track really get you excited, while the softer, quieter track really get you into the emotion of the show. This CD is a great addition to any collection. You will not be sorry for buying this CD 
 It gives you a better appreciation of your tough times and how to accept them and not deny them. I would like to make a note here. I find the comment of "Teri M. Oneal" pretty disturbing when she/he says "It's no wonder his publisher released him as he states in one of his chapters". If the author shares his experiences with us, or anyone for that matter, it is our duty as a mature adult person not to use it against him or her. If one does not appreciate another one's opinion, one can come up with reasoning. Moking or taking advantage of one's trust is the least mature action one can do.      
 This is fast and enjoyable reading, in a credible framework. It is the sort of story that actually happens around us all the time. Michael Crichton immerses us in the technical and legal details of safety issues in aviation, but also packs in some commentary on the contemporary world of outsourcing and international interlocking production, when production and technology is increasingly shifting to China..  The other big topic of this book is the media frenzy that dominates our societies. As one person in the novel says, that "game's got nothing to do with accuracy, or the facts, or reality. It's just a circus." And, that person continues, "sometimes I look around my living room, and the most real thing in the room is the television. It is bright and vivid a mile and the rest of my life looks drab." In other words, there is a giant dislocation that is taking place, away from our own realities to something that's manufactured (the book was written before Internet took over).  Obviously this is not an academic book, it dramatizes this story, adding salacious bits that I would have considered unnecessary, but that probably is needed to make it sell -- almost like an ironic comment upon itself. I personally felt that it was the best book by Michael Crichton I have read so far. No need for future science, a lot of excitement is already happening today, if we look closely and attend to it.  
 This is Sondheim at his best. Beautiful music pared with complex, witty word play:     Now, as the sweet imbecilities     Tumble so lavishly     Onto her lap,     Now, there are two possibilities:     A, I could ravish her,     B, I could nap.  . . .    Perhaps I could read.     In view of her penchant     For something romantic,     De Sade is to trenchant     And Dickens too frantic,     And Stendhal would ruin     The plan of attack,     As there isn't much blue in "The Red and the Black."     De Maupassant's candour     Would cause her dismay,     The Brontes are grander     But not very gay,     Her taste is much blander,     I'm sorry to say,     But is Hans Christian Ander-     Sen ever risque?     Once again Sondheim shows us why, though not as commercially a success as Lloyd Webber, his legacy will endure long after Webber's name is forgotten. To Kay: get beyond the music. You call Sondheim overrated and Webber a musical genius - you're obviously not listening to the whole. Webber's written some pretty music but musical theater is so much more than just pretty music.  Tracks to savor:   Now/Soon/Later You Must Meet My Wife Liasons (Hermoinie Gingold is fabulous!) A Weekend In The Country In Praise of Women  If you love musical theater, this is a must for your collection 
 As a University Extension Division Master Gardener, I frequently staff Q&A booths.  This is the favorite book, hands down, to assist in identifying insects. Between the great insect photos and the illustrations of leaf damage, we can often help the home gardeners positively identify their problem without an actual captured bug to guide us. I have had to guard my copy to keep it from going home with my friends! 
 Throwing out the neg reviews and recommendations The 3-Hour Diet actually works. Most of us know what we should eat, but need some sort of aid to push us in the right direction. This diet is a good way to change your eating habits for life.   The con's are: The actual eating plan could have been published in a 50-page pamphlet. Too much space is spent bashing other diets, and the daily journal of pretty much blank pages takes up a lot of the book, as do testimonials from people who have found success with the plan.   I gave the book four stars because the eating plan does work, and it is sensible, well-balanced eating. Jorge Cruise provides food lists, so you are not dependent on frozen meals or fast foods, although he provides those options as well 
 This is a very good book on SBS2003 for experienced SBSers. The only draw back are the built in advertisements for the author's other books and services. You'll come across plenty of paragraphs containing sentences like ....but that doesn't need to be covered here, it's covered in my other book yada yada yada......  Still this is a very good book and highly recommended 
 THE GOBLINS IN THE CASTLE  By: Bruce Coville                                                                        The book I'm doing this report on is The Goblins in the Castle. It's about a boy named William, a girl named Fuana, and a thing named Igor.  In the book William lived in a castle and finds a hidden passage and meets Igor.  On Halloween he accidentally let the goblins out of the north tower.  Igor said they needed to see Granny Pinch Bottoms.  They go and on the way Igor was stolen by goblins and William falls in a pit and meets Fuana, then goes to Granny Pinch Bottom, she gives him items to save the goblin's land.  He went and did what she told him and saves goblin land.      I think William is the kind of kid that just wants some attention.  He is brave to do what he's told.  He's friendly to his friends.  He's kind of crazy.      The problem was William opened the north tower door and let the goblins out.  Another one is that he doesn't know what to do.  The most important one is trying to find the courage to save the goblins.      The solution was the goblins roamed free because William made them good.  He finds out what to do from Granny Pinch Bottom.  He finds the courage by figuring out what at stake.      I would recommend this book to people that likes a good mystery.  I would rate it at a five star book and because it's cool.   
 Just by purchasing this memory module, I can see a small but significant improvement with almost all memory-intensive programs on my Dell laptop. Even those programs that do not require Windows OS to load a lot of memory, they open faster and perform quicker. Crucial memory is one of the best! You can't go wrong.. 
 As a sixth-grade Social Studies teacher I needed ways to integrate other subject areas into my curriculum. I came across this book while researching for a unit on Ancient Greece.  The book has pictures that are vivid and exciting and follow young Eratosthenes throughout his life until the time in which he "measured the Earth" . My students will find its words complex enough to keep them interested but simplistic enough to follow along. This can be integrated well with math lessons dealing with angles and circumference. I found the book to be extremely enjoyable 
 This is a history of various market declines and panics.  Providing some useful insight, it is well written and deviates from the normal how to buy stocks book.  If you want a good read and like stock market and finance books, you should like this

 Having already read Ted L. Nancy's first volume, I was more than excited to read more outrageous letters.  Similar to the Laszlo Letters (but much better), Ted L. Nancy writes zany letters to all sorts of organizations (companies, governments, the military, hotels and more) to make his hilarious requests.  Though they are, of course, outlandish, but that's the entertainment.  Equally as entertaining are some of the response letters.  Because most aren't totally sure that Ted L. Nancy is fake, they have to diplomatically word their letters -- great stuff.    Jerry Seinfeld has written the forward to both books by Nancy, causing many to speculate that he is the real author.  Check out the wikipedia page on Ted Nancy for more details, but I'm not completely convinced that Seinfeld is the real author.  Nevertheless, More Letters From a Nut continues the great tradition from before, and also makes for great comedy when read aloud.  Enjoy it! 
 Henry Allison has become one of the world's best living Kant Scholars, and KTI is his best work. With Kantian epistemology becoming more and more important, not to mention controversial, many of Kant's critics have got in the habit of smashing down straw-man versions of Kant (often without even realizing it). Here however, Allison weaves together a stunning interpretation and defense of Kant's Transcendental Idealism that leaves little room for those wanting to flail away at poorer constructions. For anyone who loves Kant this is the book for you, and for those who don't this is one of the most important books you'll ever read because it really lets you know what you're up against 
 I love these Examples & Explanations books.  The rules make sense when you can get decent examples, and these books do a good job of that.    If you find your outline frustrating (Like Emmanuels and/or Gilberts - both of which drive me nuts with frustration) try the Finals series books.  I like them much better as outlines than the "official outlines."  
 Great reference for any pharmaceutical drug.  Complete and accurate information that can help in a variety of problems 
 Chinese calligraphy is a mammoth subject with thousands of years of history.  In addition, calligraphy in Chinese culture has achieved a recognition and respect as an art form that has never been matched by its Western counterparts.  Jean Long has written a very readable book that provides an excellent overview to the history of Chinese writing from the tortoise shell oracle bones through bronze inscriptions, pottery vases and, of course, calligraphic scrolls.  Also, the author provides basic instructions for how to hold a brush, grind ink, and write a few characters on your own.  Given the breadth of the material, the author covers it well, but this book, on account of its brevity, serve as an introduction to whet your appetite.  One would then look elsewhere to explore more deeply the various techniques and different calligraphic styles 
 This is a lovely necklace but the pendant part is smaller than it looks in the picture.  Very pretty overall 
 A fascinating window into the lives of Filipina domestic workers in Hong Kong. Details the many facets of exploitation, abuse and discrimination experienced by these maids. A fine balance between portraying maids as victims as well as agents in their own right, adopting a rather Foucauldian theme of discipline or oppression begetting resistance. Constable's work shuns naive generalizations of maids as passive victims (as many other works have), although I felt that domestic workers' acts of resistance and agency could be interrogated in greater scope and detail. Also provides a well-rounded picture by examining the geopolitics that give rise to demand and supply of domestic workers in Asia and Hong Kong in particular. A thorough and well-researched book synthesizing themes of race, class and gender 
 We purchased this item after looking at our options for a wine refrigerator.  This model was the perfect size for our needs.  We entertain friends and family and have a kitchen/dining/family room open concept. Cosmetically, it blends nicely without being overly prominent and is attractive enough that I wouldn't hide it away.  It holds the temperature, well, unlike a prior smaller model.  Removal from the box and some minor "assembly" of the racks and handle took ten minutes before we plugged it in and began noticing the thermostat reflecting a lower temperature.  I'd suggest this as a great gift or addition to the casual kitchen where space may be an issue.  We are very happy with our choice 
 My husband purchased this camera for me for my birthday last year.  His Aunt and Uncle had one and we thought it was simply amazing.  Since our purchase, we've help several of our friends and family members buy the same camera through Amazon. Actually, we've bought 4 other ones besides the one that my husband bought me for my birthday.  I highly recommend this camera to everyone.  It's small, has many neat features, and the quality of the pictures is the best I've ever seen from any digital camera.  Don't just take my word for it, buy one and see for yourself.  It's very affordable.(best feature 
 Just a note: I can't believe no one has yet reviewed her DVD collection of films. I can't believe this artist, once a key figure to any of us who devoted ourselves to the pre-hippie avant-garde of the US, seems to be fading in people's memories. I'll review it once I've seen the DVD and that should be soon.  Another figure from this period is the early electronic and music collage artist Tod Dockstader. His stuff is on CD and I particularly recommend the two discs from the Starkland label. This is not your usual electronica. I also recommend the indy flick "Carnival of Souls" to get a good sense of the American fringe zeitgeist of that time. Some of the classic original Twilight Zones also capture it.  I have to say it's kind of sad, a lot of cool stuff was created in this country during the postwar period up to the mid-sixties. Much of it had little to do with beatniks or hippies but their contributions (which I personally find over-rated but well-marketed) have kind of overshadowed some otherwise fine lost work 
 Marcia Willett is no imitator. Her writing can be compared to Pilcher and Binchy as noted, and what a wonderful compliment...i.e., the descriptive writing and attention to detail so that the characters have the breath of life in them. They wound themselves around the heart of this enchanted reader.  The descriptions of Cornwall were so clear that I was transported. The intertwining of characters, simply living their (not so) ordinary lives, becomes anything but ordinary.  The main character, Maudie Todhunter, is delightful as is her step-granddaughter Posey. Posey's Mother, Selena was impossibly frightful and Ms.Willett weaves a wonderful tale of family strengths, weaknesses, falling in love (with a few mysteries thrown in) through them.  I particularly loved Polonius, the dog. I have her "A Summer In The Country" and eagerly begin another anticipated delight! Thank you Marcia Willett! 
 This book discusses the experiences of managers at different points in their first year as new first-line managers.  I read the book half way through my first year as a manager and wished that I had read it sooner. My  experiences were very similar even though I am in a completely different  field.  This was even more usedul than a three day  new managers' workshop  that I took 
 Tony Robbins has an amazing way of making complex ideas simple. In this 50 minutes long CD, extracted from one of Tony's live event, Tony explains a very summarized form of NLP ideas (same as his well-known book, Unlimited Power) - basically NLP ideas presented in very easy to understand, condensed manner.  However, due to the fact that it's only 50 minutes long, so this CD can serve as only as a good introductory overview. For details, interested readers could first proceed to his books, Unlimited Power and Awaken the Giant Within. And for more who hunger for more NLP details, they could move on to good NLP books written by Joseph O'Connor, the Andreas couples, Dilts, Bandler and Grinder.  I'd rate this CD as a good introductory overview for Anthony Robbins' work and NLP. It will also serve well to those who want to get a feel of Anthony Robbins' charisma live on stage 
 My son loves this book I have bought at least 8 to have on hand for upcoming birthdays'.  He was having prpblems in Pre-K learning how to tie his shoes.  I bougth this book and we read it along with our others at bedtime.  He learned to tie his shoes within a week.  Kids love lift the flaps etc.. books he was ver eager to give it a try.  Now he triple knots his shoe 
    Harvey is a totally spoiled boy. It starts when Harvey is on a ship with his Mother (I forget where they are going) he is washed overboard, and saved by a fisherman `Manuel.' On the fishing boat Harvey makes his first friend, learns to work for his keep and so on. The story worked, it wasn't cheesy, maybe because it was one of the first novels of that type, but the plot of Harvey "growing up" seemed just to be there so you will read the book. The characters were well developed except the cook, you never really figure out where he is coming from. Most of the book was about fishing of The Grand Banks, very interesting is you like fishing and ships, but if you are reading it for the story, there is not that much, the ending was also weak, we are happy the Harvey is reconciled, but I really think that his parents would make a bigger stink. Good historical value, Kipling is a very enjoyable writer, yes I liked it but the plot had some flaws. I do recommend it though. 
 I know that my title may be an exaggeration, but Mickey Spillane's first and last chapters of this book, contain some of the best American prose, word for word, outside of Hemmingway. The narrative picks you up and carries you along in a stream of muscular, swift, clearing written words.  Mike Hammer is having doubts about whether he is a mindless killer who deserves to live or a normal man with a quick temper. By the end of the novel Mike Hammer has the answer.  BTW, the "MVD" that Spillane constantly refers to is the Soviet Secret Police, this organization has been called the "CHECKA", "NKVD", and "SMERSH". Or to put it more international terms, its the USSR equivilent of the GESTAPO. 
 He could have given us more books like Garden. Yes, the topics are a little off-kilter and the language a little rough, but the man could write! In my own opinion, Thompson belongs on the shelf next to Hemingway and Steinbeck as an American treasure 
 A great book giving an insight to synchronization. The first three chapters in Part 1 (understanding sync) is awesome. The chapters lets you look into yourself from a different perspective, a perspective you probably didn't think of.   Throughout the book, the text does not include any mathematical formulae, even in simplest form. Where formulae are needed, the facts are explained by graphics or illustrations. However, to go through the book, a basic knowledge of maths and physics are needed. But no fear, because the author greatly explains everything with metaphors, analogies and examples.   This book is about an "emerging science" as the author puts it. It was my first book about sync, I read it and now I think that it has presented me the fundamentals. If I want to go on further on the subject, then the book presents enough (maybe more than enought) references.  For the ones who like those two branches of science, and interested in the definitions of life in terms of math, then the book is indispensible.  Makes you think, wonder and question...  My review refers to the softcover edition of the book 
 I have always loved Johnny Cash.  I am trying to replace all my music with CD's.  This is awesome 
 My husband is a diabetic and I care for him.  I cook, so it is important to eliminate the sugars and starches that will cause diabetic problems.  The book answered questions I didn't ask his doctor.  It is a very useful important book for a serious illness.  Low sugar causes as many problems as high sugar, read the book to help your loved ones 
 This movie is beautiful and entertaining. I have seen it 8 times and never miss it when it is on TV. Omar is so gorgeous to look at and makes a perfect Nick. Barbra shows off her voice in many dimensions and proves what a great singer she is. Most of us did not grow up with Fanny Brice except on the radio so her life was a mystery. It always seemed funny but there was plenty of heartbreak. I know the producers took many liberties in depicting her life but I think we all get the gist 
 This is a great book to take to the beach. I am a slow reader and it took me no time to read it. I loved it. Cute and funny with a romance involved. I love all Janet Evanovich books this one included. I read these small books in between the Plum series 
 This review is a copy of one I wrote for 'A Rebours' under its alternative title - 'Against Nature'. Perhaps it will be useful to readers of 'Against the Grain' - and act as a vector to the other reviews of this novel under the alternative title.  This is an extraordinarily self-indulgent work, a tirade by the author against all those sensual things that we enrich our lives with - food, wine, literature, religion, music, travel ..... And yet, in the end, the hero of the story, Des Esseintes, fails in his attempt to isolate himself and cocoon himself in all these things he treasures so much - he becomes ill and has to abandon the attempt. So why does this 'novel' work? It is a very strange one, but it is certainly a novel(ty), perhaps even a nova! Is it the fluidity of the writing (and the translation I read by Margaret Mauldon)? Is it the content that connects in so many ways, in so many directions? For me there was a special fascination although the basis for me as I had lived my life was totally different to Des Esseintes. His experience was a withdrawal from the world after extravagant and self-damaging, self-indulgence. For me, I had imagined doing exactly what Des Esseintes did (but my life turned in a different direction), but my basis had been one of rigorous but perhaps equally self-damaging, self-denial. Would the outcome have been different? I can only speculate but I suspect not. I think Huysmans is right on the money! 
 THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BIOGRAPHIES THAT I HAVE EVER READ. THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT I HAVE WITH THIS BOOK IS THAT THE SECOND PART HASNT COME OUT YET. I ONLY WISH THAT THE BOOK WAS A COMPLETE HISTORY OF WELLES. WELL ANYWAY ALL MY BEST TO THE AUTHOR AND I AM AWAITING THE SECOND PART 
 This is a great book for anyone who has time to spare. I could not put it down. I highly recommend it for anyone. (It is thick though so be sure that you have some time set aside. 
 ISBN 034531221x  A very well-written book, and far more readable than the size of it might make you think, I found one problem running throughout the book - the lack of dates.  Although Vidal periodically mentions a specific date, the lack of them makes for a somewhat odd effect: the war, and Lincoln's political career, seem to last a very short time.    That aside, a wonderfully different look at a Presidency that changed the U.S. forever.  Despite the fact that Lincoln never intended to free the slaves, and having done so, didn't want them living in the same country as the white population, his role as hero has always detracted from his human-ness.  This book gives that back to him, and to the reader.  Mary's rather loose grip on sanity is almost played for laughs at times, which is a little sad.  Other than that, it's hard to find one true bad guy in the book - a reflection of real life that was nice to find in a book that, in the end, is a work of fiction.  Unless you're willing to do a great deal of research to verify everything in it, I wouldn't read this as anything OTHER than a historical fiction.  
 I was recently the greatful recipient of the above mentioned book.  This is the 3rd book I have read by author Fran Zimniuch.  His (past) books answer many of the questions you ponder.  Like what ever happened to ????  Fran gives it all to you. This latest book is a wonderful tribute to Richie Ashburn and you can tell that the author truely loves the sport of baseball.  It is more than a story to him.  Way to go Fran and keep them coming......Now what ever happened to Bobby Rydell, Don Cannon and the rest of the oldies...

 Where can the interested reader find so much in one book about the great seventeenth century masters of art such as Caravaggio, The Carracci, Bernini, Rubens, Rembrandt, van Dyck, Velazquez, Hals, Vermeer, Poussin and Claude?  The answer is in the recently published text "Seventeenth Century Art and Architecture" by Professor Ann Sutherland Harris.  In this wonderfully written and very well illustrated book - there are 411 illustrations of which 176 are in excellent color - Professor Harris glides through the seventeenth century with the grace and ease of a ballerina, covering the Baroque period from its inception in Catholic Italy to its final days in the Golden Age of the Dutch Republic.  Major artists and a number of less well know artists are covered succinctly, lucidly, and without pedantry or reference to obscure scholarly works.  The author is so well-versed in the subject matter that she is able to convey it clearly to the general reader with almost every painting described and discussed in detail.  Orginally conceived as a college text, this book is a must read for anyone interested in the art, lives of the artists, politics, and history of the most important century in European art and culture.  Although the title gives equal weight to art and architecture, much more of the art of the period is discussed than architecture, yet the reader is given a full taste of the architecture of the period as well.    This is a book that one will want to read and re-read time and time again.  
 I carry one of these in my pants pocket every day.  It works great for cleaning my glasses. I am buying more of them as gifts for friends who have glasses.  The first one I got, was at a trade show, from the 3M booth.  I liked it so much I went back and asked them if I could take it.  Thankfully they said yes 
 I bought this camera 12/2005 for Christmas on the recommendation of Wolf Camera.  I am not a photographer or techno advanced; just a mom with 4 kids.  I love this camera.  It's great and hasn't failed me yet.  The salesman told me about the oversaturation and I adjusted it.  The battery life is amazing as I am always on the go.  It is so small I just throw it in my purse.  I have not had any problems with the lens sticking or turning on unless I turn it on.  Sounds like some of the other reviewers should go with a digital SLR.  This is an awesome point and shoot camera and I would recommend it to anyone 
 I'll make this short and sweet - this is by far the BEST Bond movie of them all, IMHO.  Excellent work by Connery and the rest of the cast 
 This is a fantastic book for men.  The next step could and should be the Sterling Men's Weekend, for those who want to go even deeper.  But this is a great place to start 
 A helpful way of evaluating how you love and how you can love more effectively. It is worth the read 
 Great book on the fundamental theories of arithmetic and geometry. Covers set theory, arithmetic, axiomatic theories, algebraic bases of geometry, bases of Euclidean geometry, Birkhoff's axiomatic system, geometrical transformations, the Erlangen program, and Bachmann's axiomatic system 
 This is an exceptional beginners book on felting. I have tried several of the projects with sucess. Inspiring projects and great photography make this a must have. The instructions are clear and the yarns are relatively easy to find. On some occasions, I have altered the pattern a bit, without any difficulty.  Felting is by far more art than science. This was my first exposure to felting, which has become a wonderful creative outlet.  
 If you enjoy cozy armchair travel not only in time and space, Maalouf's fascinating tale invites to experience life in late fifteenth-century Europe and Africa as if you were Leo Africanus' sibbling and life-time traveller. From the dusk of Islamic Spain to the height of Christian Rome, the reader follows in the adventurous steps of the tireless traveller, from birthing and circumcision to funeral rites, capturing engrossing scenes of brutal persecution of Moslems in Christian Spain and wondrous appreciation of the Moslem savant in Rome, his marriage to a Jewish-born convert Maddalena, the story moves all readers with time to appreciate an old-fashioned, lingering prose of a quietly erudite writer.   
 I'm going to keep this review very brief.  Usually when a band changes lineup, it can be expected that the band will change, but it may be a very slight change or a very dramatic change.  With the new Troy Bleich on bass, and the new Stu Block on vocals, they have managed to retain the great sound that into eternity has delivered us on their previous 3 albums.  The two masterminds Tim Roth (Vocals+ Lead Gutair) and Jim Austin (Drums) prove again that they seriously OWN, and are very successfull at creating appealing heavy music.  I do say that Jim Austin is one of my favorite drummers out there in the music industry and I play the drums myself, so I look up to him.    The album is very good, and is full energy, pleasing melodies, a very wide array of vocal tonalities, fast and very good drumming, and gutiar work that is out of this world.  Like The previous albums, This bands works consist of a very wide range of sounds both vocally and insrumental.  Stu block has added a few more vocal sounds not seen in the previous albums, but for the most part, he works out very well with the band.    Basically this album is great, while in my opinion not as good as the first 3, but still deserves excellence and 5 stars.  If you want a blend of death metal, melodic progressive metal, and music that shows tonality extremes in both instrumental and vocal forms, go get this album.  Also check out their first 3    1.) The Debut album which most people do not know about.  Theres more singing on this album too which to me is awesome.  I discovered this band years ago, and i was introduced to their first works right when dead or dreaming made its debut.  If you want the debut album go to this website and take a listen of 2 of the songs. http://www.dvsrecords.com/samples.htm       the album is DVS002  This is the website of their first record label, and i think its the only place you can find their debut album, sop check it out.  Tim Roth (Lead Vocals, Guitar) Chris McDougall (Keyboards) Jim Austin Drums, Vocals, Scott Krall (Bass, Vocals) Daniel Nargang ( Guitar)  2.) Dead or dreaming.  Another great Album. Daneil Nargang (Lead/BACking Vocals, Guitar) Jim Austin  (Drums, Death Vocals), TIm Roth ( Lead/BAcking vocals, Guitar) Scott Krall (bass, backing vocals)  3.) another masterpiece, Buried In Oblivion.   Jim Austin (Drums and backing vocals ) Scott Krall (Bass and backing vocals ) Rob Doherty (guitar and death vocals) tim Roth Clean/DEATH VOCALS AND guitar, and Chris Krall(clean and death vocals.)    Get all of these albums now. you only have one life to live, which means only one lifetime to fill your ears with appealing sounds.  =) 
 I work every day acquiring companies and managing the companies we have acquired.  We currently own 7 companies and have acquired approximately 15.  This book in an excellent guide to starting life as an entrepreneurial business owner/acquiror.  I still consult it whenever I'm considering going out on my own.  Aside from reading this book, some other advice to any would be acquirors is to get good legal counsel and a good CPA if you aren't one yourself 
 Perfect fit and soft as can be the more you wash the softer they are 
 I love these oracle cards...I always knew the angels were around...I just found out all you have to do is ask them for help and they will be there in a mila-second.....I cannot reccommend this enough...You will not be sorry you got these...I love angels..and they love us in return.. 
 The plot is already well summarized above. I just wanted to add my two cents worth, and that is that this book is a great read 
 This is a great book and I was able to get even more out it since I am one of Dr. Page's students at East Tennessee State 
 Anybody in the plant diagnostics or pathology field must have this book on their shelf 
 The 2 disk set contains fabulous versions of several of the Dead's standards but for me the medly of China Cat and I Know You Rider is the highlight. A great He's Gone , Tennesee Jed,Mr. Charley , need I say more...This was my favorite live recording when it first came out and has remained one of the Dead cds I listen to on a regular basis. After all these years it still packs a punch.  The Dead were the quintisential live band and this is the way to hear them at their creative peak 
 Doris could have recorded a rousing version of Jingle bells, Rudolph or some of the other up-tempo Christmas classics but avoided all those and opted instead for a collection of romantic Christmas songs, some famous and some not. Even Winter wonderland, a song that can be taken at a gallop, is sung by Doris with restraint and blends in well with the other tracks here.  For me, the highlights are the obscure songs - Snowfall, Toyland, Be a child at Christmas time, Christmas present and Christmas waltz - but Doris sings the classics superbly, as you would expect.  This is not a party album but is ideal for the quieter moments during the festive season 
 my neighbor totoro is another film from the same guy who made howl's moving castle. it has the same kind of story and if you like howï¿½'s moving castle then this is one that you would like to see too 
 i'm taking ASL in school and i was looking on my books shelf and found this book and i decided to re-read it.  its really good.  the only thing that bugs me is that on the cover jessie is using see sign when the book said it was ASL.  it doesn't matter to much though.  it is a really good book and shows how people who may seem diffrent at first glance can have a lot ion common with you.  i hope you enjoy it 
 This book isn't like american psycho, much closer to less than zero.  takes a look at los angeles life, and the overwhelming shallowness of it. The vampires are a bit...um...out of place i think, but still pretty good, and sense i am a fan of Anne Rice too, i felt at home with stories of vampires.  and no, i am not comparing these two writers, you can't 
 I find this film very interesting, though not for the reasons you would expect. It's about two male teenagers living in a working class neighborhood in London, who one day discover they are attracted to each other. One of them is not even aware that he might be gay (Ste, the popular athlete). Put in this way, it may sound like your typical coming of age gay story. But it is much more than that. And what makes this movie really special is the supporting cast. They carry the weight of the story. The character played by Linda Henry (Sandra, Jamie's mother) is truly fascinating, and her performance is astounding. And Leah  deserves a film just for herself. Also the soundtrack by Mama Cas and the Mamas & Papas is a standout. I think that both gay and straight audiences will enjoy this excellent film 
 I kind of like this CD. I don't listen to it as much anymore for some reason, but I think I'm overdue to listen to it again. One of my favorite songs on this album is "respect" which talks about how girls should act around guys and how they should not let boys push them around any time the boy thinks it's convenient for them "no freebies in the limosouine that's not what it's about. let 'em know just what to do give it up he won't call you respect is just a minimum, go on girl and get you some" Another song about not letting men push girls around that I really like is "can't get me down". Which talks about getting ready to face the day and anything that might come one's way. I love encouraging songs like that... they really help you face your problems in life. I don't like to many of the songs on here because of the swearing content but I do listen to "Mizundastood" constantly. She only says one swear word in the song but I don't mind. Otherwise I avoid songs on here that have swearing on them. I like this CD otherwise... but if you're under sixteen, I wouldn't recommend it because of the swearing. I forgot to add that another one of my favorite songs is "Don't Let Me Get Me" 
 Named for the mythical (?) and mystical kingdom in the East, Shambhala Publications is known for bringing some of the greatest and sometimes most obscure philosophical writings of Mankind to the attention of the general public. Heavily (though not exclusively) concerned with Buddhist and Taoist thought, Shambhala Pocket Classics are an attractive set of unabridged minibooks which fit comfortably in a shirt pocket, making them perfect for reading on planes, trains, and automobiles. Titles in the set include THE BOOK OF TEA, THE ART OF PEACE, ZEN FLESH ZEN BONES, THE TIBETAN BOOK OF THE DEAD, POEMS BY EMILY DICKINSON, THE ART OF WAR, THE WAY OF THE JEWISH MYSTICS, and this unequalled classic, TAO TEH CHING (roughly translated as "The Book of The Way").   TAO TEH CHING is ascribed to Lao-Tzu ("The Old Boy"), an approximate contemporary of Confucius, who when asked to summarize his own philosophy, produced this incredible little volume before vanishing into the trackless wastes of central Asia. Long considered by Westerners to be the very essence of Oriental inscrutability, TAO TEH CHING attempts to quantify the immeasurable and speak the ineffable. The Old Boy is far less opaque than he is accused of being; it is simply that human language is too limited to concretize the ideas of TAO TEH CHING. Literally thousands of translations exist, all different. Many people have attempted to describe the Tao (pronounced "Dow" or "Taw" depending on the local dialect). No one has yet succeeded. The mere act of description is a delimitation. Conceptually linked to flowing water or a candle flame, Tao is the natural order of things (but even that fails to suffice). The Tao, like Quantum Physics, must be grasped intuitively. The Book of the Way had a grand effect on Chinese Confucianism, on Japanese Shinto, and on Indian Buddhism as they spread throughout the Far East. Lao-Tzu's spare, clear and indescribable vision ultimately gave rise to Zen, with which it shares the necessity of direct experience. Neither religion nor philosophy, TAO TE CHING is one of the most brilliant and enigmatic writings to come from the mind of man

 A thoroughly enchanting yarn. The story of 2 brothers fixing, then flying a small Piper cub across the US during one of their teenage summers. Told with a zest for adventure, and a great sense of humor.  One of the best parts of the story is Buck's colorful use of language. When talking about how his father had to keep turning a plane back and forth to land in a crosswind, he talks of the plane "jackassing" its way up the strip. Similarly with his tale of "Hank the Stearman man" and the other pilots in East Richmond, Indiana.  The pictures give the book a real scrapbook feel to it, and make things feel more real. (As if Buck's use of language weren't enough!)  The book can tend to get over-scmaltzy at times, but the author can be forgiven that, esp. given his obvious affection for the subject matter.  The ending chapters serve to cement the nostalgic feel of a "bygone" era, which makes one a little sad for its passing. However, this does not diminish the book; rather it made me treasure it all the more 
 None of the other nonsticks can hold a candle to this stuff! I bought this and the 8" fry pan 2 months ago and, except for the bottoms, still looks brand new despite being used nearly every day. I even used a bacon press (cast iron) in it every time I cooked bacon and a couple of times I accidently scraped the inside side of the pan with no marks left. Hubby stacked knives and forks inside, then topped it off with 6 dinner plates. I thought it was done for--scratches and nicks everywhere, but no, not a single mark. My Calphalon Commercial nonstick (which hit the trash already) looked like it had been through a war when my 18 yr. old did that. I must admit, though, that I do not use metal utensils in it, nor do I put in a dishwasher since I won't have one til the kitchen is remodeled. Overall, though, just from what abuse it has gotten, I'm very impressed and will buy more. My advice? Don't mess with the rest--buy the best and this is it. Going to try the wok next. Wish they sold an electric griddle with this stuff in it 
 This is book is an autobiography, behind the scenes look at Eco-Challenge, Survivor, The Apprentice and The Contender as well as motivational book all rolled into one.  To be honest I wasn't interested in Mark Burnett's life story which is what the opening couple of chapters of this book are, and he also tells his life story with no character weaknesses or doing anything wrong unless he made a mistake that he learnt from which becomes a motivational square.  I found the motivational squares to be a bit over the top.  However the behind the scenes and story of each episode of as well as how Survivor was pitched and rejected by the networks was fascinating stuff.  Likewise Eco-Challenge (even though I've never even heard of this show as we don't get American cable in Australia) was fascinating in what went wrong, scouting locations and so forth.  The Apprentice is also examined like Survivor is but in less detail as obviously Survivor is the higher rating more successful show so more pages are dedicated to it.  Anyone who is a fan Survivor will love how each series is examined, the location scouting, how they found some of the characters and Mark's analysis of why some of the characters were a ratings success. Learn about the 4th series Survivor Arabia which was cancelled at the last minute because of September 11.  The description of that Survivor sounded like it would have been the best of the lot, hopefully this will get made one day.     This book is not a how to get on or how to win Survivor or The Apprentice guide.   If you're after that type of book check out The Reality TV Handbook by John Saade and Joe Borgenicht.  Any fan of Burnett's reality TV creations will love this book for the behind the scenes commentary alone.  Every Survivor up to and including the Vanuatu series are in this book, (Palau, Guatemala and any other series after them if you are reading this review in 2006 or after are not covered).  The first three series of The Apprentice and nine Eco Challenges are all in this great book.  Even though I wasn't interested in Burnett's autobiography or the preachy motivational parts of the book I still rate it five stars for the insight into Survivor, The Apprentice and the other shows. Of course this book doesn't give away all the secrets of these shows.  Like magician's tricks the TV shows wouldn't have the same appeal if we knew everything!    
 " The lady killers " is a dark comedy that subtlely satiryzes the provincianism and inmovilism of the inhabitants of a little district of London where seems nothing never happen through the misadventures of a gang of crooks who "disguised" as an amateur string quintet rents a room in a house strategically choosen and property of an innocent and very conservative old woman, basic part of their scheme in a bank robbery. But ironically the candourous old lady will be the reason that they "fall down"   one by one . Black humour, elegant and suggestive direction by Alexander Mackendrick and a little and excellent cast ( Peter Sellers, Alec Guiness, Herbert Lom, Katie Johnson ) in this superb macabre farse. Complete print. 
 Since this is the field that I work in, I usually read as many of these types of books that come out, to see what others are saying and teaching.  I was very pleased with the material that I found in this book, "Ask Your Guides."    You are not alone!  There are Angels and Spirit Guides that are always with you.  And, in this book, Sonia Choquette teaches you how to prepare, meet and communicate with your Angels and Guides.  Each of us has a support team from higher realms.  By following the simple instructions and guidance in Sonia's book, you too, can learn to work with your own "Divine Support System" to enrich your life in many ways.  Sonia writes in a style that is very easy to read.  Her instructions are simple and straightforward, leading one gently into communion with the Angels and Guides that are always by our   sides, waiting to help and guide us through this journey called life.    I especially liked the fact that she points out that contact with our unseen friends can be very subtle.  There are so many ways that our Angels and Guides can communicate with us.  You may not see a flash of light, hear a booming voice or have your Master Guide show up in your living room.  But, if you follow the methods she presents with love and a desire to communicate, you too, can connect.  Rev. Jeff, Professional Clairvoyant www.revjeff.co 
 A very well written and thought provoking look at something a lot of people have probably felt in their gutyet weren't quite sure how to quantify and elucidate 
 I LOVE THIS BOOK!! I heard the author (Jan Zobel) on the radio and liked the way she was explaining tax concepts. She had a sense of humor and it was easy to understand what she was saying. Since I had just started a business, I decided to buy her book. It is so great! It's answered questions I didn't even know I had! I learned about the expenses I can deduct and how to keep receipts. I also learned about making quarterly payments (which was a total mystery to me before I read this book). Jan said on the radio that there's a lot of misinformation around about small business taxes and that one rumur is that you don't have to make quarterly payments the first year you're in business. Sure enough, I had heard that rumor but I learned from Minding Her Own Business that's not true. This book is really easy to read. It's not like those ones that you start to read and your eyes glaze over because it's written in all that legal language. This one is in plain English and it covers stuff you want to know about. For example, I wanted to know if I could deduct the room I work out of at home, my SUV, and my child care expenses. I'm also thinking about hiring my husband to work in my business (when it gets bigger) and all those things are covered in this book. There's also pages of information about books and websites for small business owners and alot of those have more really great information. This book is not just for women (Jan explains in the introduction that she titled it the way she did because a lot of her female tax clients are very confused about money and taxes and she wanted to write something that they would feel comfortable reading.). One of the quotes on the cover says "This book is like having a tax professional by your side at all times". I agree. Plus, everyone I've shown it to has wanted to get a copy (or borrow mine, which I'm not letting go of!) 
 The Darvas trading technique was designed as a simple method for identifying the strength of a trend. Buy signals are created on new bullish strength and managed by a volatility range with a stop loss. This approach is built around long term trend trading and is most suited for trending stocks. All in all, the book is an easy and fun read and highly recommended for beginners and experienced traders alike 
 This is a moving story about the unbelievable pain and prejudice faced by the Japanese in America during WWII. It tells about the life experiences of Hiroko, a Japanese girl, who arrives in America right after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. It tells of her life detained in an internment camp and her life after she is released. It tells of her romance and losses. The story is fictional, but could be real... The historical backdrop is convincing and very realistic. It reveals many of the injustices imposed on the Japanese during this time. A powerful and thought-provoking novel 
 One of the joys of fathering a bunch of boys is taking them fishing. My oldest is only eight, so as of yet we have not had a lot of success actually catching fish! Nontheless, there is a lot of joy in teaching them about bobbers, hooks, bait, casting the line, etc. - there is truly an art and a science to the task.  One of the difficulties that little hands have is pulling all the information together and using it properly.    Just as little children need a good teacher to help them integrate a lot of facts, so do we often find ourselves in the same condition. In writing Modern Art and the Death of a Culture, the late Hans Rookmaaker comes alongside us to explain how a lot of different topics intersect and interact with each other. Art, aesthetics, culture, theology, philosophy world history - these various areas are laid out on the table for discussion, and then integrated together to make a strong point.  Rookmaaker, a lifelong friend of Francis Schaeffer, provides us with a biblical perspective on the modern world, focusing specifically on the philosophical agenda behind modern art. Beginning his overview with the dawn of the Renaissance and Reformation, Rookmaaker quickly covers a lot of historical ground in the journey toward the modern era. In the end, he reveals the roots of modernity's despair. The autonomous reason of mankind put God outside of the box of the world, and as a result began the slow descent into subjective meaninglessness.    Don't let the topic of the book scare you. Even while addressing heavy themes, Rookmaaker writes with great skill and passion. He is not trying to impress you with ivory tower gibberish and a specialized insider's vocabulary.  Although he knows his material exceedingly well, his aim is to edify Christians. He wants to teach you how to pull a lot of cultural data together in order that you understand the times in which you live.  If you have ever been puzzled at the message, or lack thereof, of modern art, Rookmaaker will help you understand and discern what you are seeing. I highly recommend this work, and wish that many more works like this will be written that help Christians to understand the worlds of high culture, popular art, and music.   Note: This 1994 Crossway edition is actually a reprint of this classic work originally written in 1970, about seven years before the author's death.  
 This is Definetly My Favourite Album from Celine Dion, From 2002, and Ultimatly One of my Favourite Albums of All Time... The Album as a Whole is Extremely Solid, with not just Great singles, but Great music throughout the Album.           This Album was obviously very personal to Celine. This was the start of a New Chapter in her life. The Song "A New Day Has Come" is about the birth of her baby son, whilst tracks like "Goodbye" is about the loss of her mother. This is one of the reasons why it is such a Masterpiece, because Celine felt the songs and because the songs were personal they are able to touch the people listening to them, who may be in the same circumstances.          I Am Writing this Review as I listen to the album and here is my rating of my fave tracks - 15 out of the 17 Tracks on the Album.   1."I'm Alive" - This song is just that. It makes you feel Alive. It is Upbeat and Uplifting. It has a Beautiful Melody and Rhythm. The lyrics are also beautiful, and it's no wonder this song became a single, as it is one of the best on the album. It's my 2nd Fave on the Album. It talks about the feeling you get when the one you love is around you and you get an energy of them. The Song captures this Feeling Perfectly. "When You Call On Me. When I Heare You Breathe. I Get Wings To Fly. I Feel That I'm Alive. When You look At Me I Can Touch The Sky. I Know That I'm Alive When You Last A Day. I Just Drift Away. All My Wrorries Die. I'm Glad That I'm Alive" 5/5  2. "Right In Front Of You" - Is Another great song about having faith to find love in your life. It just sounds great and uplifting like the previous track. "Love Can Withstand A Storm. In The Final Hour We'll Find The Joy In Living." It sounds very Canadian. 4/5  3. "Have You Ever Been In Love" - This is a Beautiful Ballad and a single from the Album.It sounds very Jazz type and has A Beautiful Melody. The Lyrics are Even more beautiful  "Have You Ever Been In Love. You Could Touch The Moonlight. When Your Heart is Shooting Stars.  You're Holding Heaven in Your Arms Have You Ever Been So In Love. Have You Ever Walked On Air.  Ever Felt Like You Were Dreamin' When You Never Thought It Could. But It really Feels That Good. Have You Ever Been In Love" 4/5  4. "Rain Tax" is a good Pop Song. The Lyrics aren't great, but it has a good tune. It's Inevitable she would fall in love with the man in the song she is singing about. "When You See What I Want. What I Want Is You" - 4/5  5. "A New Day Has Come" - This is the Radio Version, and is my Favourite version. My Favourite Track On The Album. Its A Pop Ballad, and has A Wonderful message. It talks about the Birth of her New Son. It has the Most Beautiful Lyrics  "Let The Rain Come Down, And Wash Away My Tears. Let It Fill My Soul, And Drown my Fears. Let it Shatter The Walls For A New Sun. A New Day Has Come. Where It Was Dark. Now Theres Light. Where There Was Pain. Now Theres Joy. Where There Was Weakness. I Found My Strength. All In The Eyes Of A Boy" - 5/5  6. "Ten Days" - This is Quite A Good song. It's not the best on the album, but it's good. - 3/5  7. "Goodbye[The Saddest Word]" - This is a song about Celine's mother, who passed away while she was recording this album. The song is Beautiful, but I Can't help but feel sad when I Listen to it.  "Goodbye's The Saddest Word I'll Ever Hear. Goodbye's The Last Time I Will Hold You Near. Someday You'll Say That Word. And I Will Cry. It'll Break my Heart To Hear You Say Goodbye." There is Also a Great Spanish Guitar Instrumantation. This Song Captures the way we All feel about a Lost one at some point in our life. 5/5  8. "Prayer" is a Beautiful song that says how Children are Our Future, and how they should rejoyce and cherish life.

"Super Love" is Quite A Good Song, that Borders on Pop and Dance. It Talks about not settling for less in a relationship. "Some People Never Find Out, How It Feels To Be Feeling No Doubt" It's Not Great, nor Is One Of The Albums High points, but It's not Worth Skipping either. 3/5  11.

Overall This Is A Great Album, and ALL CELINE DION FANS AND MUSIC LOVERS SHOULD OWN IT. The Best time of Day to Listen to this Album is The Early Morning, Just as The Sun Is Rising. A New Day Really Has Come When You're Listing to this Record...And You'll Be Glad To Be Alive!  
 Contrary to what the religious wing of the organics movement might want, this book is a balanced, reasoned approach to organics.  I checked into author Perry's background (what I could find) and there is no connection to the mega food industry.  She's a small farmer with a CSA, organic of course.  The book surveys the broad realm of organic products and offers positive, helpful advice -- what's good to buy, what makes no sense, etc.  And book does a great job of covering the history and philosophy of organic agriculture.  Two thumbs up, or three if you're one of those people mutated by all the pesticides floating around 
 Since the glories of this book have already been trumpeted enough, I'll just suggest some great works that I think merit inclusion when Mr.Steinberg gets around to revising.   As has been pointed out: Copland's Third, Saint-Saens' Third, Franck D minor...  but also Chausson's B minor, and even D'Indy's "French Mountain Air" symphony. Symphonies by Bax, Arnold, Rubbra, Simpson, and Bliss.  Not to mention Liszt's "Faust Symphony"!  And for a good read-about at the very least: Havergal Brian's "Gothic", which is a great work 
 Yes, this CD is a marvelous truly jewel. Buy it. It worth till the last penny 
 Clyde Prestowitz did a commendable effort in summarizing contemporary history over the last 60 years, especially over the last couple decades. It was refreshing to read that someone has dedicated some time to the importance of industrial policy. Many economists and politicians continue to adhere to the fantasy that the invisible hand of the market will address the needs of the consumer and the worker, while other nations actively work to protect their industries, maintain a tax-base, and promote some sort of job-security. They are interested in real jobs that are not only service-sector jobs, but also manufacturing jobs that could have and should have remained in the US. Faith in comparative advantage-based trading is only truly being implemented by the US, while other countries are taking advantage of this stance and gutting its industrial base and service-sector.  An area that Mr. Prestowitz could have devoted more time to is all the incentives that attract foreigners to invest in China. It was important to discuss the tax holidays, free land, and business-friendly regulation to relocate a company's production. However, a crucial point overlooked (or minimized in most major media outlets), in China's attractiveness to foreign investors is the inability of workers to demand higher wages, better working conditions or minimum safety standards because of restrictions and laws in place by the communist dictatorship. These legal restrictions coupled with the financial gifts showered on investors by the communists make China an incredible offer even better than other low wage countries such as India.  As I read Mr. Prestowitz's book it's obvious that he believes that the free market has distinct advantages over any command economy. For the most part, I agree with this belief. However, the reality is that true free-market policies are brutal and have wrecked havoc on the hard-earned economic achievements of the first world middle class. Serious consideration should be given by everyone to the opportunity costs of low prices for consumer goods today, at the risk of working in low-wage service job with no dignity or opportunity for wage-growth. People have to think there is a connection between low prices at Wal-Mart and the disappearance of toolmakers, DVD plants, and hair dryers in the US. It is no surprise that the income disparity in the US has ballooned over the last 20 years, while the manufacturing sector has been shipped abroad with empty promises that the service sector would pick up the slack.  Citizens should wonder why corporate lobbyists are so keen to manipulate US Representatives and Senators and block legislation that may protect US workers and possibly increase the burden on corporations, be it taxes or job-security. The answer is simply to maintain access to the largest and most open market and obtain huge and generous concessions to offshore their plants in a dictatorship that will guarantee rock-bottom overhead costs and large profits to shareholders. I've often wondered why legislators don't swear allegiance to company quarterly reports and their continued growth, rather than to the public that elected them. At least, the charade would not be so distasteful.  Taking these issues into account, it's no wonder that globalization is characterized as a race to the bottom.  Consider these observations as you read, Three Billion New Capitalists and hopefully we will all fully examine the implications of their entrance into the market 
 I love Sabrina Ward Harrison's books already, and this one allows you to interact with her creativity to unlock yours. I get out my markers and pens and go to town journaling in a way that I wouldn't be able to do on my own. I recommend it for self-exploration. It's also a great tool before beginning other creative or artistic endeavors as a warm up 
 I bought this CD when it first came out (was it really almost 15 years ago???), and to this day it is still one of my favorite CDs.  So nice when you're in the mood for something mellow 
 In the CD version of Shopgirl, Steve Martin narrates a book written by Steve Martin (no relation... they are just clones).  The life of an angst-filled young woman (Mirabelle), suffering from clinical depression, intersects with the lives of a lusty older millionaire (Ray Parker), a young man barely able to form a coherent sentence (Jeremy), and a wicked and sexy coworker (Lisa).  Toward the end of the CD book, Mirabelle says to Ray Parker, "It's pain that changes our lives."  This statement summarizes the book.  The imperfect people in this book affect Mirabelle, a "shopgirl" selling elegant women's gloves (about one pair a week) in a Beverly Hills Neiman Marcus, in both profound and hidden ways.  This is a "dark comedy" novella.  It's good. Not great, but good.  I have to admit that now I am intrigued to see the movie by the same name that came out of the the screenplay version.  R-rated for racy language (good to know if you are listening to this CD book in your car and there is company) 
 Zweig has an unbeleivable talent to describe feelings, and he has a unique understanding of the insides of the human nature, especially women's nature. I just regret he didn't create more during his life!    Regarding "Beware of pity", I honestly don't belive it's a great translation for the book's title... I myself read this book in Russian (which is my first language) and fell in love with Zweig after that. I hope the entire English translation is just as great 
 I am extremely pleased with this book and am now the proud owner of both volumes of this book.  It is one of those books that I use all the time, which says a lot.  It helps me personally and is a terrific resource when I teach stress management sessions 
 This story is about three boys who are transported back in time to Blackbeard's days after reading a book.  I would recommend this book to people who like pirates and action.  The battle with the two groups of  pirates was very exciting.  The author also made the character of  Blackbeard extremely funny and interesting.  I never knew if he was happy  or angry!  I wondered until the very end how the boys were going to get  back into their own time 
 What a wonderful multi-purpose book!!!  On the one hand, it is a Christian classic, inspiring and story-telling and teaching at the same time.  On the other hand, it is also just a great read, a real story covering people who will matter to you, over a period of years.  Also, it's a love story, a business story, and a mystery!  It offers everything a contemporary Christian might want in a book for pleasure. I only hope they keep reprinting it, because it was actually written in 1929! Enjoy it!!! 
 I'm serious when I say this book changed my life, not in a major epiphany way, but in a compelling and clear restatement of how I was already feeling.  It helped me make peace and I've finally been able to shrug off the poisonous hierarchy-based value system I'd been told was important.  I'm just in it for me, my family and happiness now 
 I fell in love with this coloring book the first time I saw it.  Every page is nicely & fully detailed.  It's great for kids and also adults 
 As a 3rd Grade School Teacher, I found this book instrumental to my lessons on plant life. Ms. Drizzle and her class answer many of the questions my students come up with before we've read the book so I know that we're reading the right materials for our lessons. Great series for the imagination and for provoking interest in the sciences early in the child's development. 
 Joyce Carole Oates never ceases to amaze me, not only with her story lines, but the depth of the characters in her novels.  In this tribute to her own mother, who is no longer living, Oates has gone one step beyond herself, and given us insight in a magnificently crafted novel.  Having lost my own mother 11/11/2004, this story line captured my attention, and I could not put the book down until I had finished it, reading it straight through, overnight. It was poignant and filled with true-life situations...and one could feel the pain and guilt that emanated between the lines.   I saw the reality of what denial can do to a person, in the character of Nikki.  She had several dimensions, but most of them were superficial, and, in the end, she became the person she feared she would become, she feared that she would become her mother. And, knowing that she had become her, she adjusted to that fact.  Her mother was constantly in her life, although, no longer living.  From her clothes to the house decorations, to the entertaining of friends/family, we see she is her mother's daughter...guilt-ridden, as most daughters are...caring and loving, at the same time. We see her slowly envelope the same habits her mother had...we see her begin to view her mother in a different perspective.  We feel her loss...we feel her denial...we feel her pain...we feel her baby steps in healing...and we also feel..that she will always be missing her mom...as I will always miss mine 
    I loved this book and all of Sylvia's other books. It has  really enlightened my spirtualty. I have always believed in  reincarnation since I was very young. I also have seen a lot  of spirits in my lifetime. It is a blessing 
 This book is amazing, truly one of Dostoyevsky's greatest works. Dostoyevsky has an amazing talent for creating characters. Great authors can be recognized by their ability to create characters that the reader can identify with. However Dostoyevsky is not a great author, great is to meek a word; he creates characters that the reader identifies with so completely that, as a reader you 'Become' his character! This is a must read for any reader! Crime and Punishment follows the endeavers of Raskolnikov as he attempts to transcend humanity. We are taken along a psychological journey of life itself, that begins first and foremost with death 
 I first heard sacred harp singers on the anthology of american folk music (harry smith).  I could not believe my ears when I heard such raw passion and purity pouring from my speakers!  I had to hear more of this strange music, and discovered this collection.  This music could never be passively listened to, and may therefore be unnerving to some.  This is only due to the fact that it is unbelievably moving.  It will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand straight on end.  That everybody's voice is used so raw and naturally only adds to the beauty of each harmony.  Though some of the songs may seem straight-forward at first listen, there is a remarkable depth created when the voices ebb and flow in their cohesion.  Simply sublime 
 If you have a "More" child (more emotional, more energetic, more enthusiastic, more easily angered, etc) you know how tough it can be to deal with it. This book is a pretty good guide to get you started and help you guide the child through those emotional currents. It's not easy to parent a spirited child but neither is it easy to BE a spirited child. Kurcinka's book helps provide a lot of guidance 
 I read this book because Ray's first book, Julie and Romeo, had been so good I decided to follow up on her progress.  She is just as good in Step-Ball-Change.  The story starts off very unassuming with our two main characters having supper when the phone rings.  From there on it is one family catastrophe after another.  The story is funny and the main characters are interesting and true to life.  The secondary characters are also realistic.  Actually, one of the best characters in the book is a white terrier who is nervous and energetic and never bites anyone until...well, you'll see.      Step-Ball-Change is a very funny story of family life.  The story encompasses the lives of both young and old characters and their happiness, trials, and tribulations and how each member of the family relates to one another in the context of those trying times.    Step-Ball-Change is a funny and entertaining story and I recommend it highly.     
 This short story collection from Tobias Wolff is truly just that.  Each story gives you enough of the bare essentials to keep you informed and invested, but they never cross the line into anything remotely superfluous.  Each story feels very much like you've entered right into the middle of things and you are there for the climax, but not necessarily the introduction or the conclusion.  While I found this book to be an effective exercise in the art of the short story, I was even more moved by the flaws each character in every story displayed.  Wolff had grand success in getting down to the heart of who and what people are, and that is, in essence, good people that usually display less than admirable traits.  We all have those idiosyncrasies that make us unique and often troubling to our friends and family, and Wolff captures perfectly normal, though certainly troublesome, eccentricities amongst his characters that give us all we need to know about their particular story.  This is a very fast and interesting read, and if you ever wanted to engage in a deep character study in the genre of the short story, this is the collection for you.   (Visit author S.

 No kidding... by far the best chocolate chip cookie I have ever tasted (sorry grammie!) You will not regret picking up this cookbook with easy to follow instructions and fabulous tasty recipes. My daughter and I have really enjoyed baking in the kitchen together and sharing our treats with friends and family. A MUST for anyone who enjoys baking. 
 This sequel features many members of the brat pack - Emilio Estevez, Keifer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Christian Slater, etc. It's the continuing saga of Billy the Kid and his gang, now on the run to Mexico. Several of the gang members had tried to move on and have normal lives, but unfortunately life and law interfered, drawing them back together again.  Billy is up to his usual self-promoting tricks - acting the crazy one, out for as much attention as he can get, even if it means the death of his friends. It's not that he's cruel, exactly - he's just immature and does things without thinking about them. He lies to them, telling them they're heading for Mexico - but finally he admits that he'd be bored to tears there so instead he's planning on riding around the southeastern US causing trouble and having fun. His antics end up getting pretty much his entire gang killed.  Chasing after the boys are Pat Garrett (William Peterson) with Viggo Mortensen helping out. In contrast with Billy's continual wild antics, these two men are the calm, steady force of the law. They track down the boys, moving slowly but continually to bring peace to the land.  This is never really set out to be a "historic, accurate thought-provoking western". It's meant to be a fun romp with fun actors and fun Bon Jovi rock music. So you have to overlook at lot of the sterotyping. Phillips has to go through a lot of Indian sayings and poses. He's the one who speaks out when they are riding through an Apache burial ground, which is probably the only "Native American" moment in a movie set in Indian Territory. I suppose he does say a Navaho word later on to his horse - but it's only as the setup for a plot joke.  Slater is the sterotypical racist - completely uncaring about killing off Mexicans and Indians as they don't count. Of course there were many racists back in those days (and I suppose there still are) but the character's dialogue and slight growth are very predictable.  I've always been very fond of Keifer's acting and characters, and appreciate very much the "man who longs for peace but who sticks by his friends" - but again it's another stereotype. None of the actors were really allowed to stretch their wings or show depth in their characters.  The landscapes are of course stunning - but locations often seem very Hollywoody. It doesn't seem wild west as much as an idealized version of "how fun things used to be". The story of Billy the Kid is of course a fascinating one, as are the stories of law-vs-freedom and native-americans-deserving-respect. There could have been an amazing amount of meaning in this movie given the actors who populated it. It just never got there.  It's a movie I enjoy greatly as fun - but I think it'd be cool if these same actors came back now to re-do it in a gritty, realistic style. I think we'd be blown away by the difference 
 Jack has written a very simple book to read 
 This collection of essays combines travel with intellectual barbs. The book journeys from the surreal, such as the logistics of manipulating life-sized maps of a territory, to the all-too-real and malodorous such as the title story of the hotel with the broken computer, overly attentive housekeeping, and thus a slowly decaying fish. And the book will please word-fetishists, as the sentences are cleverly assembled 
 A decent compilation. I had to purchase this for my Intro to Music course at Drexel University. It's strong collection, and cuts straight to the highlight points of the songs they want you to know.  If you are thinking about buying this (older) editon of the newer 4-CD set, do it! It's cheaper, and virtually the same collection 
 This is a man that could act his kiester off, Charles Laughton. He, and his wife, Elsa Lanchester, were a much more accessable version of people like Lunt and Fontaine, for Laughton's talents were obvious in every role he ever had. Don't believe me? Rent this and "The Hunchback of Notre Dame", or the lighthearted "Canterville Ghost". He had a "mischievious little boy" way about him when he acted; a way of cocking his head and hedging that made you remember him as a grown-up version of little Johnny asking for more pennies to get candy. In this movie, about the legendary, edge-of-the-Renaissance painter, Rembrandt Van Rijn, his wife, Elsa, also shines as his latter-day love interest: very gentle, optimistic and almost perky. Most players in this film are good, though I feel Gertrude Lawrence overdoes it a bit, and in typical 30s Hollywood style. It's an MGM production, so I suppose overacting had to be in there SOMEWHERE, but her reading gets tiresome after awhile.  The script is full of bon mots, such as Van Rijn's short discourse of "knowing all women when you know just one..." speech, and his dressing down of the Amsterdam hoi-polloi when his masterpiece, "The Night Watch" is vainly slammed and picked apart on its first showing, but it is also good at pathos, as his beloved first wife dies and he also loses his later love, played by Lanchester.   I wish I could laud the condition of the transfer as highly, but alas, this has to be THE worst transfered DVD I have...! The highlights are WAY too bright, there are scratches and hair ghosts all through the thing, and we are cheated out of a first rate, saltine crisp print of one of Hollywood's best classic biographical films, and except for a longish movie-house trailer, there are ZERO extras in this thing. Shameful! Anyway, if you must get a copy of this film, find someone OTHER than MGM, for this transfer, plus the lack of extras, makes it less than an ideal buy! By all means, if you can find a better print transfer....BUY IT! 
 In the time when nationalism and self-interests are becoming the "family values" of this century, Merton offers a sharp criticism of believing that communal responsibility is no longer a value for Christianity (or humanity for that matter).  Insisting that all persons are connected through a spiritual reality (later colored in Christian theology of the Holy Spirit), a concern of the "other" should be a dominant concern for the Christian. Though some are concerned they might not be praying enough, studying Bible, etc, Merton affirms that the second part of this equation is devotion to humanity and its welfare.   Unlike prior Christian theologians that place dominant concerns to man's latent ability to overcome original sin, overt obsessions with sexual sin, and  need for a return to those "horse and buggy" realities, Merton offers a differing view of Christian principles that empower the individual towards co-creating with G-d while affirming humanities potential for good.  
 We've been living in a new city searching for a church where we could invite any of our friends, regardless of their background, life situation, and past church experience (or lack of), without fear of putting them in an uncomfortable situation.  A much larger order to fill than we had expected, because, as it turns out, many people are NOT comfortable in church--period!  This book explains how that has come to be and why churches are struggling, but, most importantly, it demonstrates exactly how churches and ALL Christians can (and should) reach out to and meet the needs of an ultra-diverse population with diverse backgrounds, lifestyles and situations.  This is NOT "watered-down Christianity" or "moral relativism"--contrarily, it is biblical Christianity in its best, purest, most powerful and effective (and user-friendly) form.  For ANYONE interested in effectively reaching the seemingly unreachable.  The author is incredibly engaging and easy to read, but be warned that the substance might just change your perspective on church and religion!           
 I've long suspected there were more writers of color out there besides Octivia Butler and Samuel Delany. Ms. Thomas introduces a rich collection spanning decades. My only question is when will volume 2 be published? If you love SF, add this brilliant work to your collection 
 I love this story.  I suppose I can somewhat relate as I see so much of myself in the young boy featured in this book.  A young, lonely boy, who somehow just does not fit in, decides to invent his own world and simply make it the way he wants to make it.  The story is quirky enough to appeal to most kids as I do feel there is something of that loneliness in all of us.  The illustrations are great.  The story is touching and is good and it is a great illustrations of just where our minds can take us if we let them. It tells us that it is good to be a bit different and not something we should set around and worry about.   Recommend this one highly.  
 These are flawless preformances of great music by some of the most talented artists on the planet.  Slumber My Darling will leave you so relaxed you'll have to remember to breathe.  The reels will bring you to your feet.  This music reaches the soul as well as the ear 
 I've been listening to nickatina since the 7th grade and i got every album.  This one is one of his best, i'm not over rating this album when i say there is only about 2 tracks you may not like. Its a classic.  Equipto and Nickatina flow well together but let me tell you don't buy equipto's solo albums, they arn't worth buying. I don't know why all of the sudden he decides to come clean on this album but cop this album when u get the cash cuz its worth bumpin' 
 I love this game!  We used to play it in college, it is so fun.  I let a friend borrow it years ago and never got it back.  I have been looking forever for it, and the company told me it was discontinued.  Now it looks like it is going to be out soon!  I can't wait!!!!!!  GREAT FUN 
 When Ephron Vestrit, head of the Vestrit trading family of Bingtown becomes the third generation of his family to die onboard his Liveship, Vivacia, the ship "quickens" and becomes alive. Liveships, made of wizardwood, a magical substance so valuable that the four-generation old debt of the Vestrits is still being repaid, are vital to the success of Bingetown, a city-state that has a monopoly on trade with the Rain Wilds. With Ephron dead, the fate of Vivacia and the Vestrits rests on the outcome of a family struggle between his daughter, Althea, an accomplished sailor, and Kyle Haven, her sister Keffria's husband. To Althea's surprise, her father leaves Vivacia to her sister, who promptly hands it over to Kyle. Kyle plans to restore the family's fortunes by entering the slave trade, a trade which sensitive Liveships abhor, and Althea leaves home in disgust and despair to set out on her own in an attempt to prove herself worthy of the ship she has lost.  Vivacia will only sail with a blood member of her family onboard and, without Althea, Kyle must use his son, Wintrow, recently torn from his dream of the priesthood, to console the ship. Wintrow cannot decide between his hatred of the new life thrust upon him and his growing love for the ship.  To the south, in the Pirate Isles, Captain Kennit dreams of uniting the pirate townships under him as self-styled pirate king. He has set about capturing slave-ships and releasing the grateful slaves, which then crew the captured vessels in a growing pirate fleet under Kennit's control. The one thing he is missing is a Liveship.  Under the sea, a group of sea serpents is desperately seeking "She Who Remembers", to lead them somewhere unremembered for some equally important but forgotten purpose.  The Liveship Trader's Trilogy takes place in Jamaillia, Bingtown and the Pirate Isles, on the coast far to the south of the Six Duchies. The war in the north has interrupted the trade that is the lifeblood of Bingtown, and the Liveship Traders have fallen on hard times despite their magic sentient ships. At one time, possession of a Liveship, constructed of magical wizard wood, guaranteed a Trader's family prosperity. Only a Liveship can brave the dangers of the Rain Wild River and trade with the legendary Rain Wild Traders and their mysterious magical goods, plundered from the enigmatic Elderling ruins. Althea Vestrit expects her families to adhere to tradition, and pass the family Liveship on to her when it quickens at the death of her father. Instead, the Vivacia goes to her sister Keffria and her scheming Chalcedean husband Kyle. The proud Liveship becomes a transport vessel for the despised but highly profitable slave trade.   Althea, cast out on her own, resolves to make her own way in the world and somehow regain control of her family's living ship. Her old shipmate Brashen Trell, the enigmatic woodcarver Amber and the Paragon, the notorious mad Liveship are the only allies she can rally to her cause. Pirates, a slave rebellion, migrating sea serpents and a newly hatched dragon are but a few of the obstacles she must face on her way to discovering that Liveships are not, perhaps, what they seem to be, and may have dreams of their own to follow. 
 A trip through stars, a trip through imagination, a trip through the everlasting intricate fields of a child's brain and modes of thought. A wonderful little book that can be enjoyed by readers of all ages. A gateway to a world of fantasy for young readers and the gateway to a world of joy for olde readers. Cute, inspiring, gripping 
    This edition is the same as the previous but with the addition of an incisive introduction by Jonathan Foer who points out that this book is a moral book which drives the reader through the force of the prose to act againt the injustice in society.    Even though The Natural might be better known because it was made into a film.  This book along with with his collected short stories are true classics that will stand the test of time.    This book tackles many large questions. Yakov whose wife left him even before he was arrested has becomes an athiest because he can no longer believe in a god that allows terrible things to happen in the world. As a self educated man he finds solace in the world view of  Spinoza. As a unjustly accused person he refuses to kill himseld despite the horrid condition in prison; not out of religious scruples but in order to clear his name.   But the major aspect he considers --in my opinion better than any other novel or history--is the  development of Otherness and especially anti-semetism.  I do hope that people will continue to read The Fixer until there is aworld without Otherness.    
 More and more it seems so difficult to tell a coming of age story that hasn't been said the same way 1000 times before.  While at moments, the "mysteries"  in the story seem a bit drawn out, there is so much else worthwhile here.  The characters are cookie-cutter types.  The story keeps you guessing and interested.  And the writing is great.  Sure, the central figure seems a tad precocious but it lets him have wonderful lines.  
 This book is a wonderful portrayl of life in old New York Society.  The story of a man (Newland Archer) who is trying to break away from the cycle of New York society and be with a woman he longs to have.  However, he must keep up with what his friends and families have spent their lives to keep...their pride, wealth, and dignity 
 This book was very good.From the first page it grabs you, and never lets go.It was very suspenseful, it got me guessing so many times, but I was always wrong.If you are looking to read a good suspenseful book this is IT 
 I would strongly recommend this book to other aspiring writers. The writing is excellent and although I found myself questioning Regina's troubled past, the story was written well enough for me to keep reading. I read it in a matter of days and wouldn't hesitate to read one of Mrs. Cleage's other novels 
 I found this book to be not only extremely helpful in breaking depressing and negative thoughts, but fascinating as well.  Many of us go through our days not realizing how we sabotage ourselves just by the way we choose to think.  Thinking becomes habit and pretty soon we are caught in a web of our own making.  The book gives five basic techniques: 1.  Listen in  - Listen to your own thoughts. 2.  Underlining.   - finding the depressing, negative words                         in your thoughts. 3.  Stopping.  -stop that thought! 4.  Switching  -change the content of your inner speech 5.  Reorienting - direct your thinking to a different goal.  Of course, all of these techniques are a lot easier said than done and that is where the work comes in.  This is not a book you just read and finish and forget about.  It is something that a person must work on everyday and the authors are quick to point out that it does require lots of work to change bad habits and replace them with good ones.  Though this book was written in 1989, it is timeless in it's message.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is really serious about changing the way in which they think. 
 I'm always glad to see the Heinlein's re-issued, particularly in nice hardcover editions, suitable as permanent additions to your home bookcase.  There's one weakness of this (and other) re-issues: the wonderful Clifford Geary illustrations found in the original Scribner edition have been left out.  For those who remember reading library copies of the Heinlein juveniles, you'll probably miss their absence.  The story itself, while not my top favorite, is still wonderful and a must for anyone who enjoys vintage Heinlein.    
 Kabbalistic healing: A Path To An Awakened Soul by and modern kabbalist Jason Shulman (a recognized teacher in the Buddhist lineage of Shaka Kendo Rich Art, Abbot of the Clear Mountain Center and a faculty member of The New York Open Center, Esalen Institute, and Omega Institute) describes the ultimate healing possible for the human soul through an awakening of one true nature. Shulman covers the process of unification, of joining with reality, and the implications of that process for daily life. Kabbalistic Healing is especially recommended reading for those who are seeking a deeper and integrated understanding of themselves. 
 Have been planing to read his first book for some time and finally accomplished that feat. I found it to be very good more on the line of what is in the mind not what is seen. A fine job of discription of people that we have all known under very trying terms. I have enjoyed most of his books and have completed the circle now with the first. I would recommend reading all his books to get a real feel of a fine author and a combat hero of America 
 This 165 page book, with its short essays and abundant white space, is indeed an easy read.  And, it's filled with inspiration.  Mr. Pressfield, in his easy style, presents dozens of short, narrative bursts of creative ideals and ideas.  He shares his own experiences as author of The Legend of Bagger Vance and other works, what he's discovered about the power of the muse and the need to sit down each day and write.  These ideas are offered up in 50-250 word vignettes and essays, each dedicated to understanding and overcoming the creative blocks that keep us from achieving our daily and lifetime goals and dreams.  What Mr. Pressfield does, is share his artistic philosophy.  The book is divided into three sections:  Resistance (Defining the Enemy), Combating Resistance (Turning Pro), and Beyond Resistance (Higher Realm).  Each section is filled with short descriptions and digestible ideas.  This is one of those books that can be read cover to cover, or randomly opened for a quick moment of inspiration.  If you've read other writer self-help or creative inspiration books, you'll notice glimmers of stuff you've read or stuff you already know.  But, Mr. Pressfield's invocation of the muses and light connections to Roman myth added a nice layer, as do his selection of inspirational quotes from the likes of the Dali Lama, modern film, and the ancients.  There were some concepts that Mr. Pressfield shared that I'll admit I didn't agree with, but I'm not going to share those with you.  After all, we all develop out own life philosophies.  What I found interesting is that, while I didn't agree with him on every point, I also kept reading.  This gut reaction to keep going and trust the words, even through a filter, is a good indication that his philosophical concepts are pretty solid: one of those agree to disagree moments. 
 This text gives pleanty of pictures and the cases studies help reinforce what the reader is learning in lecture and lab. I did not have to use the CD-Rom, but the lab book that goes with this text was a lot of fun. 
 I did embroidery as a young teen, but not since.  I bought this kit as a refresher course for myself and I am thrilled with it.  As with all Klutz Kits, all of the materials are included so you can start right away.  This book has clear color pictures and several pages of patterns.  It clearly instructs you how to do each stitch and shows you where you would most likely use it.  I started by stitching little sailboats around the ankles of a pair of denim overalls for the son of a friend.  I haven't made it to a different project yet...I am working on my seventh pair of overalls...this one with flowers and butterflies around the ankles and over the straps for a little girl to be born later this year.  And all of my information is from this book.  I plan to teach my Girl Scout Troop embroidery, using this book, next fall 
 Who would have thought a book could be like the movies?  This is sooooo cool 
 I was so excited for this!  Finally, a live concert video from X!  I've seen them twice, both times with Tony G. on guitar (he was superb by the way).  But we all know you HAVE to have Billy Zoom in the band. I haven't been able to see them, but this DVD will do the trick.  This DVD is AMAZING!! One listen/viewing makes me instantly forget all the "power pop" "punk" bands that are around now.  Their sound is fantastic, full, fast, heavy, thrilling!  All the members sound excellent, period.  I'm hopeful that there will be a tour, come on X!  Us old fogeys would like to see you old fogeys play your beautiful music for us!!  
 Loved the season! Highly recommend it - one of the best shows out there! 
 After a 18 month break after the release of LIVE: Thirty Days Ago, French indie pop-rockers Phoenix return with their new studio album, It's Never Been Like That. Filled with a somewhat chaotic mix of quirky and progressive pop rock, Phoenix offers an album sure to please existing fans of the band.  The album kicks off with the randomly bizarre but surprisingly growing track, Napoleon Says. Nonsensical lyrics like "Napoleon says to take off your coat, Take off your long johns too" combined with random melodies and a solid guitar lead makes for a song that gets better with repeated listens. Consolation Prizes, Lost and Found, and One Time Too Many are the most commercial sounding tracks on the albums, offering lyrics like "my heart is waiting for a new you..and there is no other option on the schedule" with smooth guitar chords and supportive bass lines complementing the melodies.  Long Distance Call and Rally are the most creatively different tracks, filled with random chord and melody changes and jazzy guitar sounds. North is a nice instrumental that just grooves along, and is my favorite track on the album. Courtesy Laughs is another standard mid-tempo song, with Thomas Mars sounding effortlessly cool, while Sometimes In The Fall has a surprisingly addictive chorus. Closing track Second To None sounds extremely fresh and makes for a great ending track.   Phoenix aren't breaking any musical barriers with this record, nor attempting to reinvent the wheel. They tend to stick with their familiar sounds, only occasionally veering off into new territory, but doing all of it with a simplicity that suits them well. The 10 tracks deliver the type of pop that fans of the band have come to expect. Clocking in at just under 42 minutes, this is a relatively quick album, and one that probably needs more than several listens to really delve into the quirkiness that is the band's hallmark. Ultimately though, this an album equally at home on your stereo or blasting from your car speakers.   A.G. Corwin St. Louis, M 
 The book covers the history of Iraq from prehistoric times up to the era just preceding the Arab conquest. The book is written at the intermediate level as it presupposes some knoweldge of this region. It bridges the gap between those texts written for the beginner and those written for the specialist. This book is a must-have for anyone who wants to obtain a detailed account of Iraq's glorious past 
 This compilation features 25 of the Carter Family's classics taken from original 78's and were recorded in between 1927-1938. This collection actually sounds nice concerning the source material, age of recordings, etc and best of all, they are original recordings. Most of these tracks were originally released by RCA Victor, yet there are some later tracks on it as well and it features mainly their signature songs such as the title track, Keep on The Sunny Side, Worried Man Blues (later covered by the Kingston Trio as "A Worried Man"), Can The Circle Be Unbroken (later to be retitled "Will The Circle Be Unbroken" while Mother Maybelle recorded it on guitar originally, it's also worth checking out the re-recording that Maybelle play autoharp on which can be found on the Dirt Band original "Will The Circle Be Unbroken" album which is still in print and can be found right here or your local CD shop), My Dixie Darling, Wabash Cannonball, plus 2 tracks from the Bristol Sessions: Bury Me Under The Weeping Willow and Little Log Cabin By The Sea and many more. If you cannot afford the Bear Family box or the Rounder series or if you just want a nice sampler of their well known songs to enjoy while traveling, this is the best collection on the Carter Family to get and explains why they were inducted in the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1970 
 I live in the suburbs of a former steel mill town whose mills are now defunct.  At one time we boasted the highest unemployment rate in the state, the highest murder rate per capita and were named number four in George magazine's most corrupt towns list.  But we are creating jobs...Wal Mart, Sam's Club, Taco Bell, one chain store after another.  My town is a prime example of the new economy - service, part-time and temp work with little room for advancement and little hope.    Why?  We do not make anything anymore in the U.S. and it is indicative of much of Europe as many of these jobs, as we all know, are going to other parts of the world where "production zones" are being created, hovels where corporations are free from much of the government restraint that would normally accompany their move to another country.  But these zones are being created for companies to bring their manufacturing needs to and are thus given a high degree of autonomy, almost mini countries in and of themselves.  Workers are underpaid, working conditions seems to be reminiscent of servitude and corporation are reaping huge profits at the expense of jobs.  We know the story.  The reality, however, is that just by buying clothes from someone who does not employ workers at slave wage we are not helping the problem.  The way to solve the problem is to pay these people a living wage, not merely buying some other brand of clothing.  Ms. Klein's breakdown on the issue is nothing short of revelatory.  This book dives deep into this new economy, tracing the origins and development and explosive growth of the ubiquitous "brand" and the corporations behind them.  Perhaps most symbolically it is Phil Knight and Nike who represent the modern day company's realization that it is more profitable not to manufacture anything but to merely market product ultimately made by someone else.  Manufacturing it out; branding is in.       The book was not so much a manifesto nor a one-way attack on this whole process.  It does provide some glimpses from the other side but her positioning of the quotes from the other side merely highlights the absurdity of their statements thus definitely revealing where she stands on the issue.  At times it sounds like a far-left ranting of doom and gloom but she builds the case quite thoroughly.  But as the book develops it provides the realization that it is easy to point the finger and cast blame but the problem lies much deeper than this.  This is a rallying cry, a gathering of facts and of hope of a growing awareness, disillusionment and proactivity in regards to these developments.  It is not too late - yet.  Ms. Klein gives stories and tales of culture jamming, of individuals who have taken on the giants and have had great successes in revealing the trickery, manipulation and profiteering of the companies to which so many bow down in allegiance.        I have known many of these things or have noticed the disturbing trends, not only of these brands but of those who buy them.  We, the consumer, are as much to blame.  If we did not purchase these things, these companies would not continue to market them.  Take action, get information, get knowledge and do something about it.  While not necessarily a how-to book it is one that will inform you, enlighten you, even enrage you and help you to look at branding and the homogeneity ("uniform diversity" in corporate speak) that is much of the modern world.     Most refreshing was her inclusion toward the end of views from those who live in the areas where these factories are located who are seeking to change the people who work in these factories to take up the intiative on their own without the inclusion, or intrusion, of Americans and Europeans who, though they may mean well, may actually hinder the process leading to another form of dependence on those from the West.  Contrary to the belief in the West that we are saviours of the world, those in the world labeled "third" are doing it for themselves.  We just don't hear their voice amidst the self-congratulation of the promotion and celebrity happy Western media.  I recommend this for anyone who cares about where we are headed and who misses the days when we had choices and a world free of commercials inundating us in every nook and cranny of our lives.  I would also recommend Fast Food Nation and the documentary The Corporation (in which Ms. Klein is interviewed) to further add insight and detail to the depths of the issue 
   got it fast and my son was really happy. amazon is very reliable. i'm happy that i got it through them. keep up the good work 
 While I have read a few Durcker articles before, this has been the first Drucker book I read.  I am not going into the TOC in details, in short, the topics have been organized nicely.  It starts with management, flows smoothly into individual, and ends at society.  The attention towards chronology also worked well for me in grasping the evolution of the for-profit organizations over the years.  Each article deserves its individual appreciation, but I must mention a few of those that struck most.  To start with, the responsibility of the professional.  The article brings up examples from the Hyoprcratic Oath for the medical practitioners, not all, but only the "Primum Non Nocere".  Even after hundreds of years passed by, this particular point not only remains valid but spread its relevance over other professions as well.  The Second Half of Life is another one to describe how knowledge workers' career shifts over his/her age.  It also emphasize the preparatory work even before the actual shift, more similar to the way Steven Covey described the quadrant-two activities.  My opinion on this article is a must-read for every knowledge worker.  Towards the end, there is one article focussing on the post-capitalist society.  Mr. Drucker candidly expressed his inability to draw a true picture, but at the sametime quite correctly outlined the big picture.  Whether post-capitalism would mean the end of capitalism could be a big debate, since over the years, the influence imparted by the capital movements around the globe becomes more and more significant.  However, the evolution of capitalism is itself a true phenonomenon.  A good book to start on Drucker's writings. 
 My goodness, what is a non-musical person like Holly Mathews doing in this board?  Do you know what other album she has reviewed?  Hayley Westenra!  And she's not even an opera singer!  She obviously doesn't know her business!  Disgraceful review!  Ignore it!  It obviously was not based on good judgement.  I'm sure she is a pop fan who just likes tender music.  Oh, her insulting language!  What an ignorant Maria basher!   Anyway, this is an excellent compilation of SOME of Maria Callas' greatest arias.  Although I do wish some arias like Pace Pace Mio Dio were included here, I do think it is a very good compilation all in all.  Although she has many detractors, they still have to admit that Callas is the sheer embodiment of singing and drama.  She was an actress...a panther on the stage.  Listen to her La Mamma Morta and her Suicidio...those brought chills to my spine when I listened to them.  Maria is the only singer in the history of opera besides the great Caruso-tenor Franco Corelli who touched me, moved me even.  This is probably the reason why I love Maria Callas' music so much.  If you want to hear Medea's anger and Norma's anguish and Butterfly's hopeful blindness, listen to Maria Callas.  If you just want a golden voice, then go to Renata Tebaldi or Joan Sutherland.  And don't even compare her with Charlotte Church or Hayley Westenra!  The distaste of some people 
 I thought the book was great. It was a good weekend read, and laugh out loud funny at times. I really enjoyed it. I have only seen the newer Stepford Wives movie, and the movie is really nothing like the book (is it ever?). They are both still very good. 
 Wow, people are stupid. Out of boredom I decide to rate the best collection by The Beatles out there, and some stupid reviewers compare them, or rather, attempt to compare them to bands such as Metallica? What is that crap? The Beatles pretty much own all other music from the mid-60's onward, and are in some way responsible for all music that spawned after their breakup due to their incredible influence. They are the most influential group of all time. Now, some teeny bopper has enough nerve to compare them to Metallica? Metallica is a good band, don't get me wrong, but The Beatles own them. Period, no questions asked. John Lennon and Paul McCartney are among the brightest lyricists of all time. Lets see Hetfield top Happiness is a Warm Gun. Bottom line: people like GIRL OF THE WORLD are just stupid. If they are going to go out of their way to insult a band such as The Beatles in favor of a much inferior one such as Metallica, then they don't even deserve to listen to The Beatles. I'm 15 years old. I've got a big poster of John Lennon on my wall, I ask him for advice sometimes, haha. I own every Beatles studio album and there isn't a day that goes by where I don't listen to at least one of them. I'm speaking for my generation, my friends. Every song on Beatles 1 is excellent. There is a reason they topped the charts, so if you're thinking about listening to the negative reviews, don't. Everyone likes The Beatles. Most people just don't know it yet 
 An enjoyable book which offers a good insight into the LBO business and the workings of Wall Street during the 1980s. There are some serious amounts of money involved and some very amusing characters - It almost reads like a comedy when detailing the exploits and excess of the chairman of RJR Nabisco with his fleet of company jets and "superstar" cronies.   Essentially, it reads like a thriller and although a little confusing (and perhaps too detailed on the history / background in parts), it is nevertheless a solid, enjoyable read and a 'keeper'. Recommended  
 This is a great camera for people like me who mainly just want to point and shoot and not deal with too many settings.  I was even able to teach my mother-in-law how to use the one we got them (she's a little technologically challenged).  There are a bunch of different "best shot" settings that are easy to use, but honestly most of my pictures have turned out best using just "snapshot" or auto mode, regardless of the environment/time of day, etc.  It would be nice if you could charge the battery just by plugging in the camera, but I guess you have to pay a little more for that feature.  The photo software that comes with it is not good, but there are plenty of other things you can use out there for free 
 Bill and Joe have done a wonderful job in this book of explaining what a mastermind is and the many types of masterminds that exist or that you can start to help you "Grow Rich".   They cover everything from the history of masterminding, you will be surprised to read how far back it goes and how to start your own mastermind.  Some of the key points I loved about the book were how to deal with the dynamics of the different personalities that may exist in a group and how to satisfy their needs.   I am looking forward to meeting Joe and Bill and their mastermind group in the near future by qualifying for the promotion they had recently. I would recommend you buy several copies to give out to mastermind partners and anyone you know who feels like a solopreneur! 
 This book collects some of Heinlein's earlier efforts in the fantasy vein.  There's virtually no science fiction here, but there are some interesting ideas.  The title piece is almost a short novel, and features a husband and wife detective team who are hired to find out exactly what their client does during the daylight hours.  The answer takes them on a journey through the looking glass to a world of evil secrets that lie just beneath the surface of our comfortable reality.  There are plenty of surprises and a fair amount of suspense, but Heinlein's hazy ending may leave some readers unsatisfied.  The remaining stories in the collection are a pretty mixed bag, highlighted by "All You Zombies", which is not about zombies at all, but still delivers a powerful punch.  Without giving away the plot, the protagonist manages to recount the story of his (generally speaking) totally unique life.  Although by no means prurient, this story has some sexual components that could lead to very embarrassing questions if read by the very young, so be forewarned.  Equally solipsistic is the paranoid fantasy "They", in which a mental patient questions the very nature of reality.  Heinlein seems to enjoy this kind of philosophical rambling, but apart from the sharp ending, this story has little to recommend it.  Similarly, "-And He Built a Crooked House" involves speculation of a more mathematical nature.  An iconoclast architect designs, and then actually builds, a house in four dimensions, with what one assumes to be intended as comic effect, although having a stuffy dowager faint repeatedly seems more like an exercise in misogyny than in humor.  Even sillier is "Our Fair City", in which Heinlein shows how a nosy newsman takes down a corrupt city government with the help of a trained pet whirlwind.  And "The Man Who Traveled in Elephants" is a wholly forgettable story about a man who spends his declining years visiting state fairs.  Heinlein shows considerable inventiveness in finding utterly unique plotlines for these stories, but not all of them actually succeed.  Still, this is a pretty entertaining collection, and should provide a welcome diversion for fantasy fans who are looking for something a little offbeat 
 I am very grateful for this book, thank you Sandy Forster.  I feel a greater connection to the Universe.  Gifts and money find their way to me easily, opportunities pressent themselves to me. If you want to know how this book can help you, you'll just have to read it.  I can only tell you that it has been invaluable to me.  Will this book make you Wildly Wealthy Fast? I think only you can do that, but this is the best book to help you because it shows you how.  I am not a millionaire (YET) but I consider myself now to be wealthy and very fortunate and I truely believe that I AM well on my way to becoming Wildly Wealthy!  This book has helped me to believe in myself and to put my faith in the Universe and life.  I am so grateful! 
 My children and I loved reading about the Pilgrims.  I was not educated about their lives like my children are. Thisbook is very informative and right on their levels.  We read this when they were 5 and 9. 
 This is a love story personified.  And I am sure this goes on in real life every minute of every day.  This is what LOVE really is.  . . . in sickness and in health till death us do part.  And I do not believe it ends there.  So if you want to know what LOVE really is - watch this movie or read the book.  It is fantastic 
 In general, a very good read by a well-informed and articulate writer.  Maybe the best book on the subject since "From Beirut to Jerusalem."  And the author is very good in exploring the inner minds of a lot of his subjects, his review of history is more informative than Friedman's was.  However, I think that in spite of his honest attempts to write a balanced account, the author does not always succeed.  His sympathy for the Palestinian cause, conscious or subconscious, resides in many of his pages.  For example, it is interesting that almost all inconsistencies of Israeli policy over the last several decades are carefully reviewed and enumerated, but no similar critique is leveled at Arafat (with the exception only single reference to him as being unreliable).  In discussing some of the reasons that led to the collapse of the Oslo process, the author omits what could possibly be the biggest one of all.  He described the scene where Arafat rejected Barak's offer because it would have led to his funeral.  What the author fails to mention is that Arafat never made the tough political decision Rabin had made to tell his people that they would have to reach a compromise with Israel.  Instead from 1994 on the told them that one day they will have Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa, and the rest.  He was an irresponsible leader who promised something he could never deliver, who raised expectations of his people to a point where they could never be satisfied with any proposal that an Israeli politician could put forth and win a referendum on.  Arafat's position in front of the Palestinians in 1994-2000 effectively precluded any possibility of a compromise final settlement.  Yet in this entire work the author does not mention this once.  Neither does he mention Arafat's famous doubletalk: one thing in English, another in Arabic.   In describing various Israeli inequities towards the Moslem holy places, the author manages to complete omit the fact that in 1948-1967 no Jew was allowed to approach his holy places at all.   An interesting example is provided by the author's description of the aftermath of the massacre of praying Palestinians by Dr. Goldstein -- a despicable crime and a truly low point for the settler movement.  The author mentions that after Goldstein was overcome by the Palestinians, they began clashing with Israeli soldiers even though Goldstein was a lone shooter. The author appears very upset about the fact that the soldiers "for some reason... made a provocative appearance" at the hospital and then put the town on curfew even though it was the Jew who committed the crime in this case.  But are curfews not usually imposed on a rioting city?  Are soldiers not typically deployed to protect a hospital in a city beset with violence? The curfew had nothing to do with the shooting, but it had everything to do with the Palestinian riots that started immediately afterwards.  The better question to ask is why "for some reason" the Palestinians "made a provocative appearance" on the streets and attacked the Israeli soldiers and settlers, who had nothing to do with the morning shooting.     The author does not miss a chance to call Israeli explanations "excuses;" its leaders are "corpulent" (Sharon) or former "terrorists" (Shamir), yet such labels are attached to Arafat. Reading the author's account of Camp David 2000, one might believe that it was Barak, not Arafat, who was responsible for the fiasco.  Barak was too tough and confrontational, apparently, in spite of putting forth a stunningly generous offer (the best offer Israel could ever give), but Arafat merely was  "suspicious." But I digress...  The book is good, read it, but look for the author's opinions encroaching on history here and there; caution is warranted 
 This book was incredible! A co-worker recommended it to me, and I was not dissapointed at all. It was a great read, and I could not put it down at all. The characters were well developed, and the story was well thought  out!! A real page-turner. Hope to read another Bowman novel in the near  future 
 I haven't really enjoyed this series for the past few installments. However, I did enjoy this one. And that's because the story wasn't overfilled with the annoying sidekicks, Illuminada and Betty.  Both characters have outworn themselves in this series, having turned into a couple of unlikeable, stereotypical caricatures. Illuminada, the impatient Cuban, can't get through a paragraph without throwing out a "chiquita" and looking at her watch. Betty, the controlling African-American, can't get through a paragraph without throwing out a "girlfriend" and barking out orders. These two got old a long time ago, and the series is just so much more enjoyable when Bel is interacting with Sol, Ma, Sofia, Wendy, her kids and her students.   Hopefully the author has realized this and the series will continue in a positive manner, as it did with this installment 
 The book was a little helpful, but the map was great.  My husband and I had a great time and never got lost.  The best part is the Chatechuk Weekend Market map inset.  It was very helpful! 
 These are the early writings of James, including the textbook for his course in psychology. The most well- known piece here is his essay on the 'Will to Believe'. Here James worked to contravene the principal enunciated by the philosopher Clifford that it is wrong to believe anything anywhere for which there is not sufficient evidence. James instead insisted that our passionate life, our life in decision means that we must make choices. And this leads us to believe in certain religious principles we do not have evidence to prove.  James here as elsewhere in his thought rejects a kind of Olympian and abstract stance, and tries to feel into and understand our actual way of being in everyday life.( Also with the mystical researches he would include in the 'Variety of Religious Experiences' in not so 'everyday life')  It is almost as if he is seeking to present a democratic philosophy, one which can defend and be understood by the man in the street.  James is for a philosopher a very clear writer.  I would only add that there is a second Volume of James' writing in the American Library which includes his 'Pragmatism' and 'Varieties of Religious Experience' a volume even deeper and more significant than this very valuable one 
 I still remember the summer when my sister and I read all the Laura books -- it was 1970 and we would sneak a flashlight under our sheets so that we could keep reading after "lights out".  I am now nearly through the collection with my eight year old daughter. She has "Laura mania" and dreams of Almanzo! It has definitely captured her imagination. She especially adores Mary.  I get choked up and bleary eyed when I read about all this wonderful family endured together.  These books will inspire generations to come. Enjoy them 
 I haven't bought the book yet, but I get Perricone's newsletter. I read that a women followed his suggestion and started taking ALA Alpha Lipoic Acid every day and her acne cleared up!     I was skeptical because my 15 year old son has pretty bad acne. I've tried a lot of things, even pro active. He wouldn't take anything orally he only would use topical things. He did try antibiotics. They did nothing.  I said what the heck, and bought some 100 mg ALA caps at GNC.  My son started taking them along with a multi and 500 mg of vitamin C every day. He would take vitamins for me.    Withing one week I noticed his face was clearing up and now about a month later, his face looks about 75%-80% clearer!!! I'm amazed and so is my son! I've decided to buy the Acne Prescription to learn more.  Dr. Perricone is GREAT! Thanks 
 I have used this and the previous edition for many years working in a country club.  I just bought three of these for friends who have enjoyed my findings and got a kick out of my constant referring to my "bible" on food.  If you are really interested in what things are made up of and where they originated, as well as some true tips for ease in food preparation this book is a wonder.  These make 6 books of these purchased and it is one of those treasures that I must pass on to like minded freinds as a gift 
 The appreciation of the book will depend greatly on your level of comfort with the rabbinical view. If you seek a philosophical approach you might be better of with Aristotle and modern science, and if you are interested in rabbinical exegis then go to the source and study the Talmud and other works. Maimonides possesses immense authority and is distanced from us by many centuries. He gives invaluable insight into certain issues but at the same time creates or entrenches other fundamental perplexities open to debate or critique. The introduction will serve the reader well especially on the author's contemporaries. Buy both volumes as the second and the third part of total three parts of the Guide are in the second volume.

 Well maybe not but I can assure you that with an ounce of patience and a cupful of enthusiasm you will be whipping up custom made skirts in no time at all. You'll even be holding your hand out to your friends in a slow down gesture, take a number please... (I wrote a reveiw on Aussie Bid dot com for this book too)  Seriously this book is that good, and I've been sewing for nearly 20 years now! The book is a breath of fresh air. The picures and diagrams are lovely and easy to follow. Remember that this book was written in the USA so be prepared for coversion if you are a metric kind of person (thank goodness Australian tape measures come with metric and imperial on the one tape).   When you order this book go and get yourself some butchers paper, a ruler and some pens/ textas. You need to draft a a very basic flat pattern using your own measurement. This becomes your basis for creating marvellous skirts that will fit you. My first project was the straight skirt, I made this with a black fabric with a self-print. Even with the modifications I did (it has a lovely thigh split,the book guides you through this, with the addition of press stud tape for modesty)skirt- from drafting to wearing, took less then 1 1/2 hours.  The thing that made me fall the most in love with this book is that it has very clear and visual instructions on setting a zipper /fly (or what ever you call those things with teeth that hold your skirt together).   The book I bought from Amazon is hard covered with spiral binding. The spiral binding allows the book to lay flat when you are working from it )(without the pages flipping shut). you're also shown how to make skirts that are:      - Straight with variations including simple pleats, splits, long and short, etc      - a line with layers, wrapped etc      - irregular hem lines (think pixies skirts)- SO EASY!      - ruffled      - etc  Well worth the investment! I am off to order another copy for my Mother (she keeps stealing mine) and for a friends Birthday. I am skirt girl and I adore this book. Now if only they could make a book like this for beautiful, easy, tasteful blouses and tops 
 this shovel works great.I have only had the chance to use it once but it was heavy wet snow and this shovel peformed awsome.It threw snow 20-30 feet off my back porch 
 when one COULD take the law into his own hands... but going overboard of-course COULD get the attention of even the President of The United States...  This movie many argue is not 100% historically correct, but what movie is?  This movie however, does portray real people, and real events that actually took place.  It's great entertainment, even if you don't pay much attention to it.  But if you do pay attention you follow a fantastic story that actually took place, one of the largest man-hunts of the most sought-after gunslingers of all time.  It may cause you to go and research the facts yourself, which you will find are mostly arguable... even the way Billy The Kid died, or IF he even was killed by Pat Garret or not... hence, the second movie Young Guns II 
 This is the first Poldark novel introducing Ross Poldark, Cornwall mining owner/farmer/squire and his extended family.  I especially enjoyed listening to the audiotapes narrated by Tony Britton; his chararcters' accents are humorous and entertaining.  I love the Poldark series and after I read or listen to all the novels I'd like to see the videos.  Wonderful stories and characters, highly enjoyable. Hard to put down 
 aprils teenage years are forcing the patersons to rewrite the rules they have relied on for so long in regards for their parenting. The greated media threat to april's brother and sister was Mtv and keeping them from watching it was probably a simple task compared to what they are faced with April. Outside influences once thought to stop at the front door are easily accesable through the computer and satellite TV and the reality of how unsafe society has become. Face it, we all have a real fear of someone so desperate to kidnap a child they will break in to a locked home. Their fear has forced them to keep April within their sphere of influence evenif it means she has to work at the store along side her mom, something Elly never had to even think about when Micheal and Elizabeth were April's age. This book, even though its humor, is a brilliant editorial on the radical adjustments parents are making in their lives with the onslaught of the radical changes in our society. 
 Simply put, this is the best movie I've seen in a long, long time. It's better than Walk the Line and better than Ray. Every scene serves a purpose and is perfectly executed. I'll admit that my expectations going in weren't that high, but the movie paid off in every way. Don't get me wrong, not everyone is going to like this film. You need to have an IQ over 70 to understand that Hustle and Flow is an extremely accurate reflection of real life for a significant portion of our society. Its purpose is not to make judgments about the morality of people's behavior. You can tune in to Fox News for that drivel. It's about working hard, creating something out of nothing, and doing whatever it takes to accomplish your dreams even though the odds are against you. In my view, a classic tale of the American Dream. 
 Great album, but what is the song at the end credits? I love that song 
 John Westerhoff helps the reader return to the roots of all ministry, not only preaching and teaching.  He boldly challenges the terms and practices of the church and ministry with a renewing spirit.  He helps us explore our relationship with God and how we are actively living out that relationship with God and with each other.  A joy 
 I got this book on a trip to the East Coast when I was ten years old and fell in love.  It was my favorite book during all of my early teen years; and though I haven't read it in years, I think it will always hold the place in my heart as my favorite book 
 A Real Life Great Gatsby   Ponzi is described as charismatic character similar to a real life Great Gatsby who has the mindset of an arbitrageur, the wit and character of a movie star, the style and personality of politician but the morals and values of a crook. It's too bad; it always bothers me when I read books about people with such potential that take a turn to the dark side, but I do love a non fiction that tells such a good story that it could almost be a fiction drama.   The book is very enjoyable. It takes us through a, "magical time, when anything felt possible". Ponzi starts his great scam just at the brink of the roaring 20's when prohibition-which started in Jan 1920 was just setting in and the Boston-Irish politics were played out through sometimes underhanded dealings and new inventions and discoveries had everyone excited about the future. All the while Ponzie is opening offices all over the East Coast collecting as much as several million in a single week. It describes Ponzi's Machiavellian outlook that the ends will justify the means and describes his continuous almost delusional optimism.   You may just find yourself rooting for Charles Ponzie to find a way to go legit, while he struggles to invest the $[...] million or so he collects through the issuance of his "Ponzi notes"    By Kivin Kingston author of, A 20,000% Gain in Real Estate: A True Story About the Ups And Downs from Wall Street to Real Estate Leading Up to Phenomenal Returns   My Blog: [... 
 What a wonderful place this film was shot at. The scenery alone and the beautiful fishing village was amazing. I wonder if you can still find beautiful places like this one where capitalism hasn't killed the wonderful essence and spirit of people, the earth and the community 
 With these words the Nez Perce Indians surrendered to the U.S. Army, having fled from Idaho across country, through Yellowstone and north to Montana, only to be cut off just miles from the Canadian border.  This and other spectacular stories will quicken the pulse of any red-blooded history buff.  We also visit cow ranchers down in Texas and learn the true, unvarnished story of Dodge City and other pestilences.  The real thing 
 If you like DJing, this is your record.  It had to be the strongest showing of musicality on turntables (mixed with dense, vast production values) that came out that year.  A lot of records have tried to be epic,  tried to tell a story, tried to be scary and show you inordinate amounts of  skill on turntables - and many more will try as DJing finds its way back  into the front of the audience mass-mind - but few will be this good.  No  rapping...a pure soundtrack of DJing by one of the best DJs around 
 My favorite DVDs are concerts, festivals, unplugged etc. I was going to buy the CD and Amazon pointed me to their DVD. I prefer DVD surround sound to CD stereo. Plus you get something to look at. I heard the Demon Days songs on the radio, and liked them alot. This is an excellent DVD. You may want to check out Bonnaroo, Cross Roads, String Cheese, even the Doobie Bros. Oh yeah and Eric Burdon and the New Animals 
 Kathy Reichs appearance as a mystery write was dotted with a dozen comparisons to Patricia Cornwell, who had already achieved considerable success with her string of Kate Scarpetta novels.  The irony of this is that Reichs actually is the character she writes about, a forensic archeologist equally at home with analyzing the 100 year old remains of a potential saint or piecing together the shattered remains from a horrific fire.  And while Dr. Temperance Brennan has her own relationship foibles and family issues, the holds not a candle to the goofiness that flows Scarpetta around.  In this, the second novel in the series, Brennan starts out with the remains of Sister Elisabeth Nicolet - dead, buried, and reburied.  She has been nominated for sainthood and the good doctor has agreed to examine and verify the remains.  The corpse, however, conceals a genuine surprise, and the archeologist yields to the temptation to extend the investigation beyond the forensic into the history of old Canada, where plague and prejudice were bedfellows.  The real mystery of the story starts with a group of bodies found in the smoking remains of a torched chalet and with the appearance of Temperance's sister Harry, who has suddenly become interested in a retraining and counseling program that has unexpected effects.  When Temperance leaves Montreal and returns to Chapel Hill to teach for a semester she hardly expects this mystery to follow her.  But that is exactly what it does, in the company of Detective Andrew Ryan who Temperance finds irritatingly attractive.  This story is a tightly woven web with a terrible secret lurking within it.  Everything Dr. Brennan values is at risk as evil and madness threaten to reach out and touch family and friends in a fatal pattern.  By combine past and present in the novel  Reichs manages to present a predictable plot in an unpredictable fashion.  She will continue to build her characterizations in a realistic fashion which I find much more readable than the Scarpetta family of perpetual maladapts. Readers who are attracted to forensic investication while fine Death du Jour a treat 
 I thought this novel was great - I had previously read Stephenson's "Cryptonomicon," which was amazing, so I had high expectations. They were, for the most part, met.  However, I found the "Librarian" to be somewhat of a trope - it seemed as if Stephenson had difficulty linking the diverse strands of his plot (Metaverse, "reality," and Sumerian myth) together and had to employ a long-winded virtual program as somewhat of a stand-in to tie some of the more esoteric Sumerian threads into the entire plot. Forgiveable in a first novel, but set in relation to the whole (and the standard set by his later work) I was a little disappointed.  Regardless, still highly recommended 
 Although being the inspiration of Richard Wagner's opera, this book, itself inspired by Chretien de Troyes's 'Perceval', portraits everything except 'the pure fool' (Der reine Tor): it begins with a rape and a manslaughter.  Its main themes are the search for the Grail and the redemption of Amfortas, but those themes cover only a small part of the whole story. Another important character is the knight Gawan. The epic is written in forceful, violent and colourful sentences, sometimes worth the surrealistic demoniac paintings of Hieronymus Bosch. It paints the not always heroic or galant deads of the chivalry of the Middle Ages with ordinary brawls, tournaments and other (love) contests. The highlight is the masterful and vivid description of the nearly unsurmountable difficulties for the capture of 'Chastel Merveile' (the Marvellous Castle).  This epic is also not what Nietzsche said about Wagner's opera 'Rome without the text', for the author states that 'today very few people want to change earthly wealth for heavenly glory. I do not know one man, or one woman.'  This ambitious and impressive work is by any means one of the highlights of world literature 
 This is a great way to save space and get 3 wonderful books in one. I love that I never have to go hunting to find one paperback I have all 3 together. These are great Nora Roberts stories 
 Hirschman is concerned with three types of argument typically deployed by reactionaries, i.e. conservatives vehemently, vocally and automatically opposed to proposed changes in the political, social or economic order. The arguments are: (1) Perversity: "The change will only exacerbate the problem you are trying to solve."(2) Futility: "The change will achieve nothing, because it fails to acknowledge incontrovertible political, social or economic laws." (3) Jeopardy: "The change will threaten or destroy some cherished previous accomplishment, such as freedom or democracy."  Hirschman's approach is historical. Drawing examples from three key periods of reactionary thought - the aftermath of the French Revolution, the nineteenth-century push for universal suffrage, and the more recent rejection of the Welfare State - he tracks the development, deployment and intertwining of the arguments. His study raises some unstated questions about the psychology of conservatism, the tendency of the populous to be drawn in by such arguments, and the ease with which they can be deployed in short soundbites making them ideal for a modern mass media. Unfortunately, Hirschman doesn't address these issues, so if you're interested in exploring them you will need to look elsewhere. (Eduardo Giannetti's rather advanced psycho-philosophical study, "Lies We Tell Ourselves: The Art of Self-Deception", might be a challenging place to start. Giannetti addresses the issue only tangentially, but he does give a full account of the kind of self-delusion that a lot of conservative thinking requires.) While the three arguments Hirschman describes have been used most often by conservatives, he turns in the final chapters to the occasional tendency of "progressives" to deploy similarly intransigent arguments. Such even-handedness is refreshing. This book will be useful to anyone wanting to promote or defend a progressive agenda as it delineates the likely arcs of resistance you will face, and alerts you to the possibility of woolly thinking infecting your own arguments. It's strongly recommended for conservatives, too. You'll learn that the kind of thinking you find "natural" and "morally right" has a long and hysterical history. This book will have both sides of the table thinking - which is always a good thing 
 Note:  The hardcover edition of The Heart of Listening includes both Volume One and Volume Two, which are available individually only in paperback edition 
 This is an absolutely wonderful first or second book on chess (first in case someone already taught you the basics). Much of the winnings moves I ever make still come from this book. It is well-written; the advice is clear and straightforward. Just go through the first lesson - home away from home - and fall in love with it. It should be reread every now and then, just to be on top of it. I love it 
 Contains a huge amount of information about pediatrics.  Extremely helpful when studying for tests or when making rounds and seeing patients in the clinic.  
 All the information you need and the appropiate readings are here in this  book, which can be very usefull for the study of the economics of a firm  and many other topics in business economics. Worth a look 
 If you like the Native American culture you will appreciate this mystery even more.  The characters have depth and you can't help but get emotionally involved in their plight.  Good from cover to cover 
 I read "Secred Hoops" and was really blown away.  Jackson is a very enlightened writer, and it's fascinating to see how a zen approach to teamwork is really proven by reality and experience.  I'm not much of a basketball fan, but now after reading "More Than a Game"  I know a whole lot more about it's philosophy and strategy.  
 "In Cold Blood" the movie, is a lethally poisonous partner in crime to Truman Capote's non-fiction novel by that same name..What's more arresting, is how that regional story, (the senseless slaughter of a God-fearing, upright Kansas farm family, the Herb Clutter's, by two ex-convict drifters) became a broader national story, a popularized best selling novel, and an Academy Award winning picture!..Truman Capote, the resident "genuis bad boy" of Manhattan gossip mongering cafe-society, was indisputably the nexus and "little engine that could" that drove the enterprise value of this true-crime detective drama  to the attentions of rarified New York literari, and then to mainstream American drive-in movie pictures!..Without Capote, there would have been a skimmed-over, horrific, true-crime whodunit, played out to a small Midwestern audience in the American heartland, without legs, shelf-life, or descriptive names and faces to fit the time and place of that seemingly random incident..Capote was in his Brooklyn apartment reading the morning New York Times when he spotted the backpage story of the murder of the Clutter family of Kansas, and realized instantaneously this pulpish, true-crime narrative, was not only his golden opportunity, his dream come true, but moreso his destiny..He called his editor at New Yorker magazine and said I'm going to Holcomb, Kansas immediately to write a story, I'll explain later..Five years hence, exhausted by endless rewrites, and stays of execution by both state and federal courts, Capote published the book "In Cold Blood", an inventive tour-de-force style of writing, the non-fiction novel..See the movie now!..It has the feel and tempo of a Kerouac beat generation road show, with a Quincy Jones musical arrangement and underscore..And more importantly, "In Cold Blood" the movie, is the granddaddy of all Nuevo American "roadie" film-making, Coppola and Easy Rider notwithstanding 
 This is a very good cookbook which has lots of good recipes some I have tried many more I hope too try.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that it didn't give nutrition information for every recipe which I find unhelpful.  
 Mel Brooks does it again in this great farce. It is mainly a parody of Robin Hood - Prince of Theives, and there was a lot to parody. Cary Ewles is great as the one Robin Hood that can speak with an english accent. While not every joke is a winner (Achoo - Bless you is only funny for so long), most of them are right on target.  The best opening credits of any film ever 
 My daughter was quite a screamer as a newborn, yet somehow staring at this starfish would calm her down within seconds.  (Needless to say, that made this book my favorite very quickly!)  She's moved through lots of different phases in her first 10 months, and nearly every page has been a favorite at some point.  I like the rhymes myself, and I don't mind reading it again and again 
 I've been using Cross pens since I returned to my fountain pen roots several years ago but I decided to try this model because of its gorgeous design.  There are aspects of it that I like better.  The cartridges are longer, unlike the smaller Cross ones that run out much quicker and never seem to drain completely.  It was also ready to go as soon as the cartridge was inserted unlike the Cross which seem to be stubborn to get started.  It has a nice feel to it ergonomically and I nice feel to the nib on the paper.  
 First of all I am biased: I attended 95% of the Baltimore Colts games that JU played in (Section 32 Upper row 27) - I was a teenager and a fanatic Colts fan - Callahan captures just about everything I remember from 45 years ago. This book should be read by everyone under 50 who believe that Elway, Montana, Marino and Manning were the best QBs ever - if they read this book they'll know what we Colts fans (that's Baltimore not Indy) have known since 1958 - that Unitas was the best ever and Unitas We Stand 
 While fleeing the Russian assault on Warsaw, the arrogant Countess Zofia falls off a suburban bridge into the River Vistula only to be rescued by a teenage peasant and his grandfather.  When she recovers, she returns to the capital to stay at the home of her suitor Count Pawel, whose previous offer of marriage she has rejected as Zofia plans to wed Napoleon.  However, she is carrying a child so Zofia must modify her plans for now as the Little Emperor remains her ultimate objective.  At the same time, Zofia's cousin Anna has married her true love Lord Jan Stelnicki, who tries to be a father to her son Jan Michal, an offspring of a rape (see PUSH NOT THE RIVER).  Anna soon gives birth to their son, Tadeusz at time when supoerpowers Austria, Prussia and Russia divide the nation and force the Polish King Stanislaw into exile who seeks help from Napoleon.  As Zofia, who has given birth to a daughter, manipulates her way up the aristocratic elite ladder, Pawel plots to place Tadeusz on the throne, and Jan joins the resistance while his wife worries and rusticates raising their two sons alone even as the years move on  AGAINST A CRIMSON SKY continues the saga of Anna Berezowska and her family as Poland is caught in a deadly vise from its more powerful neighbors.  The story line provides a feel for the history, but is more a historical romance spanning over two decades of two people (Jan and Anna) trying to do what they feel is right for their country yet also keep their loved ones safe. In many devious ways Zofia is the star of the tale as a Lady Macbeth plotting at the cost of others (collateral damage) to achieve her goal.  Fans of Polish historical tales and Regency era romances but in central Europe will enjoy James Conroyd Martin's fine sequel.  
 Mark Twain's time-machine drops the main character in this book in the 6th century of King Arthur's Great-Britain. What he sees is a nation of slaves under the heel of king, Church and noble ('a privileged class is but a band of slaveholders'): 'sweat blood for them, starve that they might be fed, work that they might play, go naked that they might wear silk and jewels, pay taxes that they might be spared from paying them.' But the slaves were so poor-spirited that they took the thanks (cuffs and contempt) and the attention they got as an honor. They were completely under the spell of the Church: 'a united Church means death to human liberty, and paralysis to human thought ... in two or three little centuries it had converted a nation of men to a nation of worms... she invented 'divine right of kings'; she preached (to the commoner) humility, obedience to superiors, the beauty of self-sacrifice, non-resistance under opression and she introduced heritable ranks and aristocracies.' No wonder that the nobility, 'tyrannical, murderous, rapacious and morally rotten as they were, were deeply and enthusiastically religious.'  In order to fight against the forces of darkness and to free mankind Hank Morgan creates teacher factories. But he is confronted with the problem of heridity and social conformism: 'There is no such thing as nature; it is merely heredity and training. All that is original in us can be covered up and hidden by the point of a cambric needle, all the rest inherited from a procession of ancestors that stretches back a billion years.' His teacher schools liberate only a few dozens of pupils. With their help, he has to dynamite the whole British aristocracy in order to install his ideal of universal suffrage ('when every man in a State has a vote, brutal laws are impossible').  This comical science fiction story is ultimately a very actual political diatribe against exploiting privilege, pure indoctrination and class (in)justice.  A must read 
 This is the story of a graphic design class, except it really *is* a graphic design class. Our hero is enrolled in an art class at a state university, and the offerings are, at best, sleepy. Until Winter Sorbeck, graphic design teacher, strides into the narrative and wakes everyone up. The characterization of this charismatic, brutal teacher is no less than masterful, and also an interesting study in power and the dark sway of advertising ("you infect them with your obsessions").  Chip Kidd has a sharp, sure way with language and tells the story of beleaguered art majors like no one has before. The only drawback is an inconclusive ending, a fizzled wreck that detracts from the rest of the story. Up until then, though, it's 5 stars 
 Great resource for the whole 9/11 situation.  Good history, good resourcing, great for your library to see other connnections to the 'new pearl harbor' 
 A misbegotten woolen stocking becomes a "hat" when it gets stuck on the prickly head of a hedgehog. Hedgehog feels silly, is full of excuses with regard to what he is wearing, but just cannot free himself from this "hat". The ending is a surprise 
 "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn," is named as one of the Century's Best Books by the New York Public Library for a reason. Originally published some 60 years ago, even to jaded readers of modern contemporary fiction, it remains highly readable. Every word.   This was my mother's favorite book. I remember watching the movie with her when I was a child and for these two reasons, reading was slow. I couldn't help but reflect on the story as if they were MY memories rather than the main character's, a young girl named "Francie," growing up in poverty in the early twentieth century. It reads like a series of both heartbreaking and entertaining anecdotes about life among first and second-generation immigrants in Brooklyn, New York. And while you can sense the starvation and the continual worry over making ends meet, through the eyes of the children, Francie and her brother, Neely, and also through their Aunt "Sissy," who absolutely takes a bite out of life, it's difficult to feel sorry for them. They are prideful and make the most of all that they have. There's a scene where the children manage to stay standing as the tree vendor chucks a giant Christmas tree at them on Christmas Eve, which I will never forget. What will also stay with me are the feelings Francie discovers while growing up, about the different kinds of love she had for her family.  I savored each page and didn't want it to end. For all the days I read, it was like spending time with my mom.  From the author of "I'm Living Your Dream Life," and "The Things I Wish I'd Said," McKenna Publishing Group 
 My wife and I, huge fans of `America's Next Top Model' and `Project Runway', were very excited about seeing this film.  Why it took us this long still baffles me, but as of Friday night we had the pleasure of seeing `The Devil Wears Prada' and let me just say that it was quite the pleasure.  Now, most if not all the praise has been heaped on the shoulders of Meryl Streep, and while she was outstanding, this film is more than just a Meryl painted canvas.  There are four brilliant performances in this film and they all are deserving of praise.  First is Anne Hathaway who plays Andrea Sachs, a young aspiring journalist who takes a job working as Miranda Priestly assistant at `Runway Magazine'.  Anne Hathaway proves with her performance that she's all grown up.  No, that's not to take away from her more adult roles in more adult films like `Havoc' and the masterpiece `Brokeback Mountain', but here Anne proves that she can do adult comedy, not falling back into her teen goofiness that made her famous in `The Princess Diaries' but keeping everything smart and mature.  She has enough poise and grace to match wits with Miranda, and she does so elegantly.  Next up is Emily Blunt who plays Emily, Miranda's first assistant (there are two, Andrea being the second).  Emily has worked her butt off to get to where she is, slaving for the unruly Priestly and it's all about to pay off with a trip alongside Miranda to Paris.  The only thing standing in her way is Andrea, for if Andrea fails miserably then it reflects poorly on Emily.  Emily Blunt turns out I think the best performance of the bunch for she has enough sass, enough attitude and enough wit to make her pop out from the screen and stand out no matter who is sharing the screen with her.  Stanley Tucci also does wonderfully here as Nigel, Miranda's second in command.  He is there to make sure everything is perfect, and also help Andrea adjust.  Stanley always has done great backup work, playing second hand man to just about everyone, but here he really makes his performance his own and owns it.  He delivers some of the funniest lines in the film but he never feels like the `token gay guy'...he's needed in this film, not filler, and he commands his scenes and really stands out amidst the crowd.  And then, of course, we have Meryl Streep who plays the ruthless tyrant known as Miranda Priestly.  What I was most impressed about was the way Meryl underplays every word, every emotion, every scene, which is not what I expected.  I really expected her to go all Glen Close and reincarnate Cruella but she didn't (thankfully) and instead turned out one of the most inspired performances of the year.  She must have had fun playing the snooty self absorbed and above all selfish editor-in-chief of `Runway'.  She lets us see inside her character briefly (when crying over another failed marriage) but her character is more about shutting off feeling in order to succeed and so we don't get to see the real Miranda because we're not supposed to.  Carried by these four brilliant performances `The Devil Wears Prada' is a fabulous film that will make you laugh and make you smile and will impress almost anyone.  The script is brilliantly adapted from Lauren Weisberger's novel, and while it's not an exact replica (are any adaptations these days?) it carries the same wit but smoothes things out to make it more approachable and, in my eyes, more enjoyable.  Bravo 
 There are some writers whose talent is so special that you want to save their books and make the reading of them an occasion. Walter Mosley is one of those writers. He invests his characters with such depth, such full histories that you cannot help but care about them. RL's Dream is populated by a cast of such characters; even the most minor ones (including a baby) are fully fleshed and very real. Soupspoon and Kiki are two almost-lost souls who bring each other back to life in unexpected ways. It is a credit to Mosley's rare and splendid talent that the book itself resonates with music; its cadence is almost audible in the spare prose, the all-too-human behavior of people who, often, do things without even really knowing why. To comprehend the blues, to put words, literally, to a musical theme and to do so in a kind-hearted and deeply understanding fashion is to deliver magic in the form of a book. This is a "must read" novel 
 I enjoyed reading this book tremendously. It not only gives a well organized introduction to the Islamic faith, but Dr. Sarker's first person account of his miraculous journey from devout Muslim to committed Christian adds a personal dimension not typically found in books of this nature. This book is an excellent resource for anyone wanting to know more about the Islamic faith... set on a backdrop of an inspiring testimony of God's grace.  The book is organized into three parts: Part 1 is Dr. Sarker's personal story, Part 2 is a presentation of the fundamental beliefs of Islam and its practices, and finally, Part 3 is advice on how Christians should share their faith with Muslims.  He answers many of the common questions that we Westerners have about Islam: What do Muslims believe about God, Jesus, the Bible, and about prophets? But more importantly, he gives advice from the perspective of a former Muslim on how to effectively build relationships and minister to Islamic people.  If God is calling you to work with Muslims or has placed Muslim people in your life, then you need this book 
 Never heard of Jim Gaffigan but ordered this CD based on the reviews and I'm very glad I did. Just finished listening to the CD for the second time and liked it even more. Looking forward to viewing the DVD but the CD alone was worth the price. 
 This is a hilarious second take on the action in Shakespeare's Hamlet, from the point of view of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, the two unsavory nobles who think they are escorting Hamlet to his death via a distant king.  In this play, the two titular characters are fleshed out to be absurdly, and comically, inept in some ways, and very human and sympathetic in others. They play at deep thought, and this play is meant to lead the audience into musings that aren't necessarily articulated on the stage.   The humor is very off the wall, reminiscent of both Waiting for Godot, to which its often compared, and certain parts of Douglas Adams' "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" trilogy.   The showdown between logic and the absurd is always, thankfully, entertaining, and this is as much fun to read as it is to see on stage. In fact, it might be a better read than it is a play, as the slow, thoughtful pace may give some audiences too much time for checking their watches.  
  A genuine great book,long awaited, about that  somehow underated     cool gentleman of the sixties and seventies...but I long for more !   somehing perhaps like  "Bernie Wrightson, a look back", or ... "The Gene Colan Collector" ??? And of course good editions of his masterworks. Aniway, I'm happy for the moment  
 Thankfully this author's books are coming back into print and I have yet to be disappointed with any of them. Without sounding condescending, (or elitist), McCarry's books are "intellectual" thrillers in the best sense - i.e. much like Littell, Furst or early LeCarre - in that they make the reader think and the books are also almost impossible to put down. McCarry's books track Paul Christopher, covert agent in the "The Outfit", who is a multi-lingual, globe-trotting ladies' man, rarely carrys a gun, doesn't drive fast expensive cars and doesn't blow stuff up. On the other hand he knows a lot of people who do all the above (and more), and be them friend or foe, Paul is usually very busy staying at least one step ahead of them. In this volume we find our hero searching for the truth behind the tragic events, both in Vietnam and the U.S., of November 1963, bouncing from continent to continent. (As an aside the view into Vietnamese culture in this book is fascinating). The answer(s) he finds are troubling, creative and seemingly involve everyone but the journey in ascertaining them is what makes this book a great read. Highly recommended. 
 The movie does have a plot and is well acted but the real reason to see it is the fabulous Eric Balfour.  He gives a good performance and is naked in several scenes.  A must if you are a fan 
  After reading piles of books about politics, the Bush Administrations, the collapse of the US dollar, the collapse of the US.... I needed to regain my sanity. These books are not allowed in my bedroom. Instead I have Mark Twain's "Roughing It" beside my bed and am starting to recover 
 My recipe for Iced Green Tea Latte.  1 teaspoon (approx 4 gms) green tea powder, A pinch (1gm) of soy protein powder, 1 tablespoon sugar - mix with 1 tablespoon hot water and let seep for 2 mins.  Add milk (8-10 oz) and ice 
 In this graphic-novel style book, several women gather over after-dinner tea to "ventilate the heart," that is talk about the trials and tribulations of courtship and marriage in a culture where the sexes are far from equal, as well as to dish the dirt on some friends and acquaintances who are not present. Each woman has a story to tell that illuminates the sexual politics of a certain class of modern-day Iranians by revealing the secrets hidden by their socially respectable behavior. Marjane, the young, unmarried narrator of the book, lets them have their say, and what we get is a kind of memory play, sometimes poignant, often hilarious, with an all-female cast.  The title is a euphemism for a surgical procedure, which figures in a story or two in which a lost maidenhood is restored. In another story, a razor blade is put to use to similar effect but with unexpected results for the groom. There is discussion of nose jobs and the relocation of fat cells from a lower part of the body to a higher one. Young wives married to emigrants already living abroad find their hopeful expectations dashed in various and sundry ways. A marriage prevented by a prospective husband's tyrannical mother leads to a visit to a psychic, who prescribes a potion that backfires. And so on. The lesson of this enjoyable book is that for a clever and resourceful woman, there's often a way to get what she wants, even when the cards are stacked against her 
 I love Paula Deen and these recipes are wonderful if you love southern cooking. I highly recommend this book as a wedding gift or for anyone who loves to cook southern style 
   This is an awesome book if you're into Gibson or classic cyberpunk science fiction. The author likes to jump around a lot, so it may be confusing at the start but thats half the experience. This book is great if your a fan or The Matrix, Jonny Mnemonic, Shadowrun or other cyberpunk fiction. You should really read Neuromancer first, because this book is like a sequel to that. This is a classic book and a really good read. Well worth it 
 For those who know John Mayer only from the radio, this is a good introduction to a live atmosphere.  He's an excellent musician foremost, who also knows how to perform 
 EMI did a nice job of remastering these tracks, so that they are cleaner and more dynamic than ever before. This is significant since there is so much Piaf product out there from second-generation tapes/old records/etc. Including the most well-known of Piaf's songs this, then, has become the definitive single CD of her work. Highly recommended 
 I read this book many, many years ago on a very long flight.  I couldn't put it down.  The philosophy is simple; live frugally, save/invest money every month, and you too can be a millionaire.  It's great advice, especially in this day and age when the younger generation wants the big house, expensive car, and everything else right NOW, with no regard to the future.  Although some of the info is dated (Enron being named as a great company to invest), and some other advice (putting new soles on old shoes) is a bit much, the general message makes plenty of sense. 
 As an editor and 3D artist, I found this book to be an invaluable resource. The tutorials are straightforward enough for a novice to understand, yet useful enough even for an experienced Photoshop user. No matter how you make use of it, you _will_ use it 
 Cancer is a serious subject, yet Fran managed to write about it in a way that makes you laugh as well as cry. Sharing her experiences will help many women.    Buy this book. The information it contains is priceless. You will not be sorry.   Diane Gasparri Offut 
 Although, in all fairness, he is not writing this (or any other book) focusing on the cakes.  However, most of us who are practicing cake decorators rather than competing sugar flower artists eventually want to end up using these creations on or around a cake, and that's where this book, or any book by Alan Dunn, is unable to inspire.  He's clearly a botanist at heart who's simply chosen a rather unusual medium in which to pursue his calling.  His floral sprays are amazingly life-like and I can't imagine anyone criticising his talent in that regard.  However, his work, and Lesley Herbert's work, need to be tempered somewhat by someone wild and loose like Anna Von Marburg.  Rolling all of their talents into one decorator would result in cake decorating as close to perfection as one might want -- cakes which are not only a thrill to look at but also appetite whetting as well (a much-overlooked facet of professional cake decorating).  Alone, however, Dunn and Herbert produce technically stunning but somewhat sterile work.  Still, I own many of their books and wouldn't be without them!  Many American designers must simply be puzzled by their work -- the fondant purity with the stiff floral spray is so unlike what's coming out of the States.  I suggest cake decorators get ahold of books from all parts of the world to really get inspired and certainly as far as English design goes, no collection would be complete without Dunn's work.  By the way, all of his books are handsome, carefully-produced, well-edited, high-quality, and full of generous, honest tips.  He should be applauded for this indeed 
 This is Joe at his finest and the James Gang is his best rhythm section. He knows it too, thats why he reformed the group in 2006 and is touring with the JG again! Go Joe. The 2 organ tracks Take a Look Around and Tend My Garden and done very well live and Joe rips on the Hammond organ as well as the guitar. Stop! and Walk Away blow away the studio versions also. Get this record if you are a Joe Walsh fan. 
 Robin Miller has such great ideas for new recipes...not the same ol', same ol'.  They are delicious, easy, and practical.  I can't wait to try more of the recipes in this book 
 If the first track off of Betty3, It Girl, doesn't sell you on this incredibly talented group, I don't know what will. The whole CD combines the best of all worlds, thought provoking lyrics enveloped in catchy  pop-rock riffs. There is not a song on this CD that I don't like but the  real stand outs are It Girl, Hercules, You Don't Know and Perfect Day 
 I'm not sure where the 7/4/01 reviewer was coming from and I'm sorry this CD didn't hook them, but please read the 'Jazzfanmn' review. For the money, you're getting early Lee Morgan and Wayne Shorter, with Bobby Timmons and Jymie Merritt, and Art Blakey in the driver's seat.  On paper, it's impossible these people could have put out anything worth rating two stars. They didn't. This CD is beautiful. I bought it on a gamble having not read any reviews, and it paid off. This is right up there with Jackie McLean's, 'Swing, Swang, Swingin' or any of a multitude of fine hard bop albums of the period 
 I was always in a certain kind of doubt when it was asked of me to recommend one or the other of numerous histories of philosophy. They are not your ordinary texts, which you can browse about in your leasure time. They often require some thinking to really grasp what author had in mind and where does he stand at all. After all history of philosophy is elusive subject even to profficient ones. Looking back, in something less than seven thousand years of culture as we know it (it began with emergence of Summerian epos - Gilgamesh), one finds himself before wast ammount of data, to put it that way. When faced with them, one feels compelled to escape in any direction avaliable to him.  But neverthelles, something drives you to continue your studies, to learn and feed upon knowledge of others, to live in times long forgotten and to think an re-think thought again and again. But without that initial spark which puts great flames in motion all would be in vain. MacIntyre book is one that feeds that flame, helping it to grow.   If one really wants to understand key questions of ethics and how, at the first place they came to be, one should start with MacIntyre. You won't find your asnwers listed here, rather contrary, MacIntyre, in his almost positivistic scepticism, states many pro et contra arguments for theories presented in his book, that reader finds himself confused on many occasions. But precisely that kind of expose is what drives one to continue searching and to complete questions posed by MAcIntyre. A task that takes whole lifetime and more.   In the end I have to mention that ethics described here concernes itself mostly with western ethics and ethical thought. East is left out. For which purpose, I'll let you find for yourself.    
 While the Brooklyn Bridge is the oldest of the bridges crossing the East River, it's one of the strongest, sturdiest and will most likely outlast the Manhattan and Williamsburg bridges. John Roebling and his son, Washington, did not know how the forces of nature and bridge loads would affect their bridge. Given this gap in their knowledge they overcompensated by building a bridge capable of withstanding forces many times greater than would ever be applied to their structure.   But the Roeblings' gaps in knowledge also worked against them. One of the most interesting portions of the book is where McCullough discusses the pressurized caissons beneath the East River where Washington Roebling and many his workers spent their time. Few doctors or engineers at the time knew how high pressure environments would affect the human body. The quick changes in pressure killed workers and left many, including Washington, with a condition known as the bends. Washington's wife, Emily, was forced to transform herself into chief engineer while Washington struggled with the bends.  There are lots of fascinating facts and tidbits throughout this book on the bridge and the people involved with its construction.   McCullough's book is much more about the politics and people behind Brooklyn Bridge rather than the engineering. I would have preferred to read more about the engineering techniques, but I  still found this book reasonably engaging. 
 Known mostly for his bestselling masterpiece, "A People's History of the United States," which recently sold its millionth copy, Howard Zinn is both historian and activist.  This dvd captures the legend at his best, connecting with his audience.  Having seen him speak live on three occasions, I feared that the film wouldn't capture his charisma, his passion.  To the great fortune of all his fans, this dvd delivers! If you felt empowered when reading Zinn, get the dvd.  If you felt alive when you first saw him speak, get two; one for you and one for a lucky friend 
 Bill McKibbon's The End of Nature was first published in 1989. Had I read the book then, my reaction would have been diluted. Instead, after finishing the book in July of 2000, I am stunned by the accuracy of his  analysis -- especially regarding the inescapable ramifications of  human-induced environmental changes and the path being followed by  designers and marketers of genetic engineering. Books that complement  Bill's well-expressed thesis include Mander & Goldsmith's "The  Case Against the Global Economy" and Winona Laduke's "All Our  Relations: Native Struggles for Land and Life" and Jeremy Rifkin's  "Entropy" 
 I cried more when I lost my beloved Melissa and Anabelle compared to Jeff, Erik, and Geoff.... and it's true sadly that friendships are not forever sometimes. This is a good book to read and realize it is not you alone in this experience. That said, the gift in losing a dear friend is to examine what one has done (if applicable)on your end to cause the break up. Sometimes its nothing and sometimes it is a build up of something. And with girlfriends (they are soo much better to have than a boyfriend)... losing one is like a miscarriage that takes a while to heal from 
 Castleden has done a very good job synthesizing the archeological evidence and presenting a look at Mycenean society, the people and their interactions with their neighbors while comparing it with the traditional legends that had come from that time.  The book is well written with easy to follow text and discourse, and is filled with illustrations and annotations of artifacts, maps, floorplans of extant buildings, and pen & ink representations of wall paintings and artifacts.  Since Castleden is well versed in Minoan studies he is quick to point up just how much the Myceneans had appropriated from this island culture: Their art, their dress, and eventually their trade routes and craftsmen.  However, he also points up the Mycenean accomplishments as well, expanding out of the Polyponese where most other books focus, and into the northern territories dominated by Orchomenos and Thebes.  He looks at their engineering feats and discusses how they might've been influenced by Hittite and Egyptian cultures as well.  These people were bureaucratic, they were not afraid to attempt to change the landscape to suit their needs, diverting rivers, and draining shallow lakes, and they were militaristic.  The author addresses the various other interpretations put forth and comes forward with his own take on the material.  By and large, presenting a well-reasoned and supporting argument for his interpretations.  He discusses the daily life of the common people, and puts forth a hypothetical reconstruction of the trade routes of the various Mycenean cities with their overseas trading partners, and presents the various hypotheses of what happened to bring this age crashing down.  The biggest issue brought forth by him is the reinterpretation of the citidels which were argued to be the Palaces of the Kings to actually be the temple centers of the kingdom, akin to the acropolis in classical athens, but temples that took a more active role in administering to the material being of the kingdoms.  All in all, I found this volume very enjoyable and informative 
  I'll admit to you that I love to watch Adult Swim, and I'll also admit that I like certain types of anime. No, I'm not one of those nerdy card-trading Poke'mon lovers, I'm a young adult who likes to use my imagination in my down time. I like anime that's made for adults like: Big O!, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Outlaw Star, Tenchi and Ghost in the shell.   I was watching either watching Family Guy or Aqua Teen Hunger Force when I saw previews for this show start to air on Adult Swim, I thought thought it looked cool, it featured what looked to me like a cool futuristic take on robots and the humans that are seamlessly integrated with cybornetics to make them almost immortal, But I didn't know the half of it.   What I got was a cyber-punk version of the old black-and-white film noir mysteries. The series receives its subtitle from a theoretical mental complex attributed to the adaptation of cybernetics into the mass public. In the story, 'stand alone complex' is said to describe copies with no original and is portrayed by copycat crimes with no original criminal, or in other words, an imaginary criminal. It also refers to the structure of each episode: Each episode can be viewed independently of each other, and there is little catch-up (if at all) given in each episode to keep the viewer up to date.   Taking place in a fictional city of Japan called "Niihama-shi" (New Port City) in the year 2030, Stand Alone Complex tells the story of a special operations task-force called Public Security Section 9, or simply "Section 9". The series follows the exploits of Section 9's agents who range from ex-military to ex-police as they address each case and how it affects them on a personal level, eventually leading to the mysterious figure dubbed by the media as "The Laughing Man".   Public Security Section 9 is an elite domestic anti-crime unit tasked with the charge of preemptive prevention of technology-related acts of terrorism and crime. Their duties include response to serious cyber crimes (i.e. Cyberbrain hacking, cyber-terrorism), investigation of unlawful acts of those in public office and of high profile murder cases. From time-to-time they also serve as protection to foreign VIPs.   If you have seen the movie then you know that the TV series differs from the cinema adaptation in its focus upon issues created by the advance of technology. Instead of the intensely focused and personal examination of technology, presented is a look at society and technology as a larger whole. The series of 26 half-hour TV episodes has a larger budget of time to explore the concepts and ideas found in the original manga. In comparison to the film version, the series is considered by many to be easier to understand. Also, in comparison, the series can be found to be closer to the manga; due to the presence of some humor, the usage of the Tachikomas (Fuchikomas in the manga, and referred to simply as "tanks" in the one scene a derivant version makes an appearance in), the design of the characters, and also, the usage of the characters Paz, Bouma and Saito. Stand Alone Complex exhibits the accumulated experience and expertise of Production I.G. in their application of computer generated imagery. This is evident in their digital color grading, environmental effects, and cell-shaded computer models. Their work has been highly praised for its subtle contribution to a scene, which adds greatly to the atmosphere.   I think a lot of people will try to compare this to Cowboy Bebop as with so many other anime and mangas, but that's foolish. Stand Alone Complex is no better or worse than Cowboy Bebop, it's just a different story, different style, different sets of charactors and there places.   if you like anime or manga you'll definitely like this show. It's complex, has views on modern terrorism and how to deal with it, and not to mention the technology! Even if you don't watch anime just give a chance and take it for what it is. 
 Wilson observes the history of biology.  First there was the systemmatic categorization of life forms under Linneus.  Then there was the notion of fitness and evolution by Darwin.  That this could happen was supported by work on heredity done by Mendeleev.  Finally, Watson and Crick developed the structure of DNA.  This made it possible to anchor all of biology's observations in the realm of physical sciences.  The structures and metabolic processes of cells could be derived from this work. And the functions of organs. And the organization of complex individuals.  This alignment, this vision of coherence from the lowest level fundamental laws up through higher and higher levels of complexity, this view that all the highest level processes can ultimately be explained by low level processes is what we understand Wilson to mean by CONSILIENCE.  Wilson's has seen how profoundly consilience has altered biological science in his lifetime. And he argues in this book that a lot of other fields of endeavor might be improved by an analogous transformation: psychology, economics, sociology, and the arts.    He makes a number of very intersting points.  The biggest conceptual problem I have with the book is that Wilson skates around the problems of knowability.  He views the world as being ultimately knowable.  But those who have a bit of knowledge about quantum physics, turbulent fluid flow, Goedel's incompleteness theorem, or chaos theory understand that many systems that can be described with great accuracy cannot be predicted very well.  There's a lot that we cannot know.  It's not very clear how consilience's bound's are affected by this limit, for Wilson does not go there.  But this is not a problem that should ever keep someone from reading the book.  Wilson's knowledge is deep and wide.  His reasoning is lucid, his prose articulate.  It might be a slight exaggeration to say the book is a steady stream of quotable passages on biology, science, art, knowledge, ethics, religion, and culture; but only a slight one.  Almost  eighty post-it notes mark the passages in my own copy that I find worthy of quotation. And I'm a very tough critic.  This is a monumental book that is mandatory reading for any person who cares about how science might inform any of a host of other human endeavors.  There are few areas of human study left untouched by WIlson's analysis.  Most of it is hopeful and optimistic; but Wilson airs a number of concerns in the last chapter.  Here he talks about the biological future of man and how it is limited by resources.  He recounts peaks we have already passed, such as the peak in food production in 1987.  He shows how burgeoning populations in the face of limited resources either collapse entirely (the model described by Diamond ) or go through the throes of  murderous wars ( the Rwanda model described here) .  The final chapter seems to say "Consilience is important.  It is crucially important to every field of endeavor. And if we trace population dynamics back to the fundamental laws using ideas from consilience, we will soon discover that this  field of study more than any other desparately needs the illuminating effects offered by this approach.  Like a pack of hyenas eying a single child on the savannah at dusk, the problems are staring at us. They are undeniable. They will not go away. The longer we turn our back on them, the more desperately we risk losing everything to them."  
 pretty standard mouse I think. Reciever on the floor and mouse on the desk and it has been working fine, no faults as of yet 
 I had to read a science book for English class, and I wasn't the most thrilled. Reading the first parts of A Sand County Almanac, I wasn't sure if I was going to finish reading it, because I found his intense love for nature a bit extreme; however, as I continued reading, I found it very thought-provoking -- comparable to Thoreau -- and made me appreciate nature and its wonder. 
 Here's how it goes..... One day The Ohio Players were in the studio laying down Love Rollercoaster.  In the other room, a photo shoot was taking place and the model was oozing honey all over herself.  One shot required her to lay on a fiberglass surface and drip the substance over herself.  As she did this, she realized she was stuck to the floor.  The folks in the area had to tear her off of the surface, which resulted in the tearing of the skin off of her back and her legs and arms.  She became so angry that she barged into the studio where The Ohio Players were laying down Love Rollercoaster and screamed her head off at the manager and threatened to sue the record company for everything they were worth.  As the band was recording, the manager pulled out a knife on the model and basically stabbed her to death.  The screaming was unknowingly recorded into the song, and was not discovered for a long time.  That's what makes this album great for me, the mystery and secrets behind it.  See if you can find it, it'll scare you silly 
 I bought this pen recently and I really like the attractiveness of the pen.  I believe this goes well for either a man or a woman.  The pen writes very smoothly and offers you a quality pen at a reasonable price 
 For the great majority of car buyers, this is probably THE BEST resource. Unless you're into super-performance or the finer points of car technology, it's probably the only resource you need.  For any car that you want to check, Consumer Reports tells you clearly what type of car it is and who it's for, how reliable it has been, how satisfied its customers have been, and how much it holds its value. There's also info on performance and various routine "specs," definitely enough for 95% of us. If you're an EXTREME car enthusiast, you may be disappointed; this book isn't like the "harder-core" car publications. But Consumer Reports does an excellent job of including what most of us would want to see -- and can UNDERSTAND! After all, much of the material in the "harder-core" publications is Greek to us, right? And actually some of the technical material in this source is also a little tough-going, but not so much that it's intimidating. I think it's just enough to help us stretch our technical knowledge, without turning our brains to mush.   Consumer Reports is renowned for its "reliability" ratings, and indeed this information is probably the most valuable and most distinctive part of what CR does on cars. And in fact, this aspect should be of interest even to the "enthusiasts," because the harder-core car publications don't have anything like it. The reliability ratings are presented in a form that's easy to learn and easy to grasp at a glance. While a good reliability rating doesn't guarantee that a car will be good, it definitely stacks the deck in your favor.   An aspect of the "reliability" system that Consumer Reports doesn't get enough credit for is how excellent are its criteria for defining and determining reliability. Some other organizations (including very well known ones) use criteria that have little to do with what most of us mean by "reliability" -- their surveys focus mainly on "number of complaints," regardless of how significant the complaints are. For example, complaints about rattles, or radio reception, or about wishing the car had more power, get counted as problems and count against the car. (Often those organizations don't use the word reliability but some other term like "quality," but the media and the public usually don't get the distinction.) Consumer Reports focuses on problems more related to the basic functioning of the car, which is what most of us are more concerned about.   Consumer Reports is also renowned for being perhaps the most objective and neutral evaluator of products, free from influence of manufacturers and other interested parties. From what I've ever been able to tell, the reputation is well deserved.   The one quibble that I have with their car ratings is that they seem perhaps to lean a little too much toward practicality and don't show enough appreciation for certain kinds of upgrades. For example, they tend toward the idea that paying extra for a Mercury Mountaineer over a Ford Explorer is a waste, likewise an Acura over a Honda or a Lexus over a Toyota. But once you realize that apparent bias, you can just take it into account in making your own decisions. And besides, there's a lot to be said for practicality 
 The Landscape Lighting book, by Janet Moyer, provides both an academic and practical level of landscaping lighting knowledge. Another good book, if you can find it, is the Ortho's book of How to Design and Install Outdoor Lighting.  In comparison, the Ortho book has more colorful pictures and offers a very colorful education - I'd say, more or less at a good high school level.  If you want more of college level introduction to landscape lighting - perhaps, to start a business or to broaden your knowledge, The Landscape Lighting book is the book for you 
 To my mind there are a lot of alienated, thinking Protestants (not that they would use the "P" word)-- far outside of or on the fringes of the institutional church (whatever that is) who nevertheless have active minds, open hearts and hungry souls. Once there was a retreat area in the Swiss alps called L'Abri or "The Shelter" run by Francis and Edith Schaeffer that these seekers would be drawn to. Outside of that hands-on culture Schaeffer's books seem somewhat out of context. InterVarsity Press, which published most of them, once displayed them in its own rotating in-store rack, but now they are lost on the shelves (if they're in stores at all) amid much more viscerally-aimed, issues-oriented books about the crisis of the week or the conspiracy of the month. Not much for the thoughtful reader.  (Re)enter Francis Schaeffer, probably the author that seeking readers would like to seek out. Should they do so, however, one immediately finds two dozen or so books, with no idea where to start or how they're supposed to go together. Reading the many negative reviews, it seems that this book is especially misunderstood. But to my mind it remains one of his best.  This is the third book of a trilogy which begins in a non-obvious way with a tiny but densely written book called Escape From Reason. That book briefly traces the history of the split between nature and grace, lamenting it and, as many have pointed out, wrongly attributing it to St. Thomas Aquinas, who also lamented it. The second volume is a larger book called The God Who is There, which can be read on its own and which many readers have found quite engrossing.   This third book, which also stands on its own, is a very brief examination of epistemology (how we know and how we know we know). I took a philosophy class once which studied the exact same questions and I used to bring up Schaeffer's points in class. The instructor thought those were valid and interesting arguments, and I would suggest that the reviewers who don't like this book either have no taste for philosophy or don't like Schaeffer's style, or both.   Either impersonal forces created us as personal beings, or a personal creator did so. The other choice, that we are somehow impersonal beings resulting from one of the above options makes no sense but has nevertheless been argued by behaviorist B.F. Skinner in Beyond Freedom and Dignity and elsewhere. Schaeffer helps us see that there are really very few answers to this dilemma, and like Pascal, we must wager on one or the other. This book could be titled "Think Along with Schaeffer". For those who'd rather read the results of his thinking, they are laid out more simply in one of his best books, True Sprituality.  
 Light and Dark clash yet again Up in the hills of Wales They really are alive this time There's music in these tales  Deep in a hill there lies a harp The wondrous Harp of Gold One of the Old Ones' Things of Power It's High Magic controlled  It's Will again who has the task To end the Sleepers rest Welsh folklore joins with King Arthur And Will's put to the test  His new friend Bran's a mystery He's much more than he seems His mother left him as a babe And dashed a good man's dreams  The Brenin Llwyd, or The Grey King Observes their every error His breath it forms the clammy fog His Milgwn provide terror  Caradog Prichard is obsessed Something's killing his sheep He blames the dogs who aren't at fault His anger rages deep  Will they stand against the Dark, Will they fulfill their quest?

 All my life I was taught to revere Shakespeare as poet and genius and to treat his work with reverence and pious respect.  Then, I read Stoppard's work and I have never looked back!  RGAD broke down so many bariers that had been fortified for ages in my mind.  Stoppard was able to show me like no one else that Shakespeare was an entertainer. He was one of the greatest of his age, but he was just a man like any other.  He would have sacraficed iambic pentameter for a laugh or a piognant pregnant pause if it meant his work had more impact in a moment. 
 Many books on the topic of time, calendars, and, in an unsuprisingly related way, papal history have so much to tell given the vast scope of years involved that their authors either just scratch the surface, leaving the reader wanting more, or tell lengthy, complicated anecdotes about select occurences, leaving the reader scratching his head and wondering how the events are related. Duncan does an admirable job of telling the history like, of all things, a STORY. The myriad names and places somehow settle into a pattern that makes the disparate chapters makes sense together.   Certain editorial license is take by Duncan, as well, which adds to the reader's enthusiasm in speeding through the chapters. It's a quick read and a great re-read 
 I found the relationship between Jacob and Rabbi Simeon very, very touching 
 It's about time this show made it to DVD! I forgot how good the early years of Sabrina were. So many great lines. This is a truly funny show that is a lot of fun to watch. Great writing! I plan on buying every season except the college years. those were just too wierd to watch. My one complaint: not enough extras! I want commentary by Melissa 
 I spent some time looking for a simple bedside aggregation of the various topics associated with the psychology of decision making and the various perceptual biases, without finding much. Most of the books are excellent; but, aside from this one (and Jon Baron's) they are usually compilation of original research. I like to have a readable consolidation of the material not far from my figertips. I was lucky to have found this book, which provides a wonderful and comprehensive coverage of the topics. It is limpid, precise, illustrative, showing a wonderful clarity of mind.  Now the bad news. The author passed away recently at the age of 48.  
 Great service, the book came way before the delivery date, and I was able to give it to my friend as a present before he left for home 
 This is one of the most beautifully illustrated books that I have ever seen!  Every page is filled with bright colors and cheerful prose and images.  It is a perfect book for the age group intended, but it is also a  wonderful treat for an adult.  The images are so delightful that I can look  at them over and over again.  I especially like the colorful borders found  on many of the pages.  This is the kind of book that you will want to keep  forever - even when the children "outgrow" it.  I highly  recommend this book 
 When I first heard Lucinda Williams I thought it was going to be too twangy to get into.  Wrong.  By the third time I played it I loved it.  Her singing is stays with you.  I end up playing the songs over in my mind day and night, and not in a bad way.  I have become a huge fan, and this is probably the best of her albums that I have heard 
 It's pretty clear that all too often the current education system is a way to park kids in a centralized location until they are ready to graduate from child consumers to adult  consumers. Zoe Weil reimagines education from the beginning up and encourages parents, teachers, and every responsible individual to give children an opportunity to grow into passionate, critically astute, and engaged citizens. What more could you want for a country, and what more could you want from a book? 
 Of all the great novelists and writers of English, Joseph Conrad was one of the most pessimistic. His view of human nature was not encouraging or, to use modern jargon, "life affirming." Like Shakespeare, he always sought to look under the mask, to remove the polite smile of civilization and expose the red, toothy maw beneath. He often sent his characters into the "interior;" a jungle always described as a black-green hell, hot and dripping, where man was free to release the bloody and awful God within.   "Lord Jim" follows this pattern to an extent, although in this novel, the character struggles to be honorable and kind. In a nutshell, an English officer - young, handsome and noble - is terribly disgraced and struggles to restore his honor. The storyteller in the novel, Marlowe, is the same character Conrad used to tell "Heart of Darkness." It is the relationship between Marlowe and Jim, the young officer, which provides the most fascinating element in the work.  Marlowe meets Jim during the latter's military hearing, where Jim is desperate to tell someone the story of his disgrace. Marlowe, a merchant captain coincidentally in port, reluctantly hears him out. This event establishes a deep, psychological bond between the two men that courses through the book. It is through this relationship that Conrad explores some of the fundamental assumptions of human nature: Is man, basically, good and honorable? Is there even such a thing as honor or "good," or is every belief we cherish about ourselves a thin chimera, shredded easily by the base nature within?   Certainly there are few "honorable" characters in "Lord Jim." One of the great treats of the book is the flotsam of humanity that Conrad skillfully parades before the reader. Take, as an example, the merchant Chester, one of many who offer Jim extremely dubious work once he is in disgrace (in this case overseer of an island that produces tons of bat guano, which has great commercial value) or Chester's right hand man, Captain "Holly Terror" Robinson, described thusly:   "The Notorious Robinson. The man who smuggled more opium and bagged more seals in his time than any loose Johnny now alive. They say he used to board the sealing -schooners up Alaska way then the fog was so thick that the Lord God, He alone, could tell one man from another. Holy-Terror Robinson. That's the man. He is with me on this guano thing." He put his lips to my ear. "Cannibal? -Well, they used to give him the name years and years ago."  Yet, there remains something that makes Marlowe care about Jim, something he is at pains to understand himself. The fascinating thing is that most of the time Marlowe is nearly repulsed or irritated by Jim, made squeamish about shaking his hand, or will cross a street to avoid him. There is a quality in Jim's disgrace that dims Marlowe's own cherished memories of youth and high adventure. Yet, as Marlowe says repeatedly, Jim "was one of us." This phrase changes, bit by bit, in the course of the novel. At first it means, primarily, white, English, and of a certain class. As the novel progresses, the phrase begins to take on a much broader meaning, touching something fundamental in all living men.   As Marlowe puts it in describing Jim: "Woe to the stragglers! We exist only in so far as we hang together. He had straggled in a way; he had not hung on; but he was aware of it with an intensity that made him touching, just as a man's more intense life makes his death more touching than the death of a tree. I happened to be handy, and I happened to be touched. That's all there is to it."  Again, like Shakespeare, nothing is obvious and much is open to interpretation. Does Jim succeed in regaining his honor, there in a remote jungle? Did he fail? Or, perhaps, was he aiming his shot at a romantic tendril of air, never really there at all. If you read this great work, you will have the pleasure of deciding for yourself.   ---- Mykal Banta   
 Three-and-a-half-stars. "Flags in the Dust" is the first of Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha novels; it is a must-read for all potential Faulkner fans. It's not his best, by any means--the storyline is at times skittish (perhaps owing to the fact that "Flags" is the uncut, unedited version of what was originally published under the title "Sartoris"), and the characterizations are neither as deep nor as unique as those found in his later works. But "Flags" has charm and importance nonetheless. First, it is a crash course in the Sartoris family, whose many "John"s and "Bayard"s (not to menion the indomitable Granny Millard and Aunt Jenny) comprise a hefty chunk of Faulkner's later novels and short stories. Second, it is absolutely *amazing* (and I can't underscore that enough) to see Faulkner's great novels just beginning to poke through the surface of Jefferson, MS soil: the Snopes family, V.K. Ratliff (here named V.K. Suratt), the McCaslins, the Compsons (I think reference is made even to Thomas Sutpen) all make appearances in the novel. Therefore, I recommend reading "Flags" *after* you've read most of the other Yoknapatawpha novels--the breadth and depth of Faulkner's vision (anticipating or laying the foundation for novels he would write 20 or 30 years later) is truly remarkable, and is half the joy of reading it.  (But whenever you read "Flags," at least make sure you've read "The Unvanquished" first--the characters will make far more sense if you do.)  As for the story itself: it's convoluted and not always engrossing--though the angst of young Bayard (silently mourning the wartime death of his brother John) is portrayed achingly well, and Aunt Jenny remains one of Faulkner's most powerful leading ladies 
 As much as I hate Puff and not much of a Bad Boy fan, this album despite the LOX's bashing of it themselves, is a good one, and I may like it more then their "street" album "We Are The Streets" (it's very close).  The beats aren't as hard as new LOX material but they are good and there is no doubt that the 3 man Yonkers group have great lyrical ability.  Production is good on most of the album and is handled by Puff, Dame Grease, Swizz Beatz, 6 July & Nysheim Myrick and P Killer Trackz (half of the producers are Ruff Ryders producers anyway).  Guests aren't too plentiful and each member has a solo song on here as well.  It has 4 classics, 2 songs I skip, 1 or 2 average ones and the other 8 or 9 are good or great songs.  A must have album even though I hate supporting Bad Boy.  #2 - 9.5 (good beat) #3 - 9 (upbeat song) #5 - 10 (Classic -- f/ lil kim and DMX -- I still love this song even after it got overplayed) #6 - 6 #7 - 10 (Classic relaxing song -- f/ Carl Thomas -- kind of a deep song) #9 - 9.5 (great beat -- f/ kelly price -- another kind of deep song) #10 - 6 (sheek solo) #11 - 10 (Classic song about a bank heist -- Styles & Jadakiss) #12 - 7 (f/ styles) #14 - 8 (about some grimey b!+che$) #15 - 8 (upbeat song f/ Puff Daddy) #16 - 10 (CLASSIC -- one of my all time favorite songs w/ relaxing beat -- Jadakiss solo) #17 - 9.5 (upbeat song f/ kelly price) #19 - 8.5 (about gov't rats) #21 - 8 (deep song dedicated to Biggie {R.I.P.}  JADAKISS -- Jason Phillips -- b.

 I have Plain Dirt Fashion and Partners, Brothers And Friends on LP.  Now that these two classic Nitty Gritty Dirt Band records are available on one CD, I bought the CD version.  This music is as great as it was in the mid-'80s, when NGDB originally recorded it.  "Long Hard Road", written by Rodney Crowell(the writer of NGDB's 1980 hit "An American Dream"), was the Dirt Band's first #1 country song, and it has always been one of my favorites.  I especially like this line:  "When the world was on our radio, hard work was on our minds/We lived our day to day in Plain Dirt Fashion."  "Long Hard Road" by itself shows the Dirt Band's ability to pick a well-crafted song.  The record's most fun moments, however, are provided by NGDB's Jimmy Ibbotson.  Ibbotson's "High Horse", a driving, bouncy song, was a huge hit, as was his wisecracking celebration of the band's first 20 years, "Partners, Brothers And Friends".  These two songs are also among my favorite NGDB songs.  Still another excellent Ibbotson song is "Telluride", about life in the Colorado gold-mining town("Take the gold into Telluride").  Why "Telluride" didn't get radio airplay I'll never figure out.  It's a great song--I think it's certainly up there with Ibbotson's "Ripplin' Waters"(from NGDB's album Dream) and NGDB's '70s classic hit "Mr. Bojangles".  NGDB's rocking version of "Cadillac Ranch" is well done and in my opinion surpasses Bruce Springsteen's original.  The reflective songs "Home Again In My Heart" and "Old Upright Piano", the romantic ballad "I Love Only You", the rodeo song "The Other Side Of The Hill", and Steve Goodman's humorous song "Video Tape"("If your life was on video tape/Wouldn't everything be alright") are also highlights.  In my opinion Plain Dirt Fashion and Partners, Brothers And Friends, when they came out, represented a welcome return by the Dirt Band to a more countrified sound.  Ibbotson's return to the Dirt Band in '83, after a seven-year absence, helped the band bounce back from an ill-advised switch to a pop direction and reclaim their country roots.  Not only is Ibbotson a great songwriter, but he's an excellent musician as well--note his mandolin picking on "Telluride", for example.  To go on, Jeff Hanna's guitar playing is exceptional in a lot of places(for instance, on "Partners, Brothers And Friends" and "Cadillac Ranch").  There's also some solid piano work by Bob Carpenter(as usual), Jimmie Fadden does excellent harmonica playing, and John McEuen plays some unbelievable banjo and fiddle parts on several of the songs.  If you don't already have Plain Dirt Fashion and Partners, Brothers And Friends on LP, they're now both available on one CD.  By all means, get the CD version and listen to it.  There is a lot of great music here.        
 I applaud Ms Levy for this book but don't quite share her views completely.  I am appalled by the environment we of Western Society offer to our young and our women and especially our young women.  The aberrations, so often a product of far too much male leadership, flow down to every part of our society.  We have wars and terrorisms rife, the victims usually the innocent with the root cause being poverty  created by the inequities of the predominantly `male' values represented by Heads of State almost everywhere.  At a `grass roots' level it manifests in the `sell-out' to those dangerous values becoming a substitute for women embracing their own values, and they become the victims again.  As the Womens' Movement evolves there is a place for a voice such as Ms Levy's.  We don't need more bras burnt, we need Women able to have a balance of the controls as Women, not de-facto Men.  I am a Man, a Lover, a Father to a daughter and someone who would be happier living in a world which had evolved in the influence of manuscripts such as this book.  However, I feel as if it was a little too politically correct (which I am not).    I know Strippers for whom Stripping is a celebrated part of their life, where they feel able to live out their fantasy world, to be in control, owning their sexuality and living much more in line with writers such as Nancy Friday than Ariel Levy.  Many go back to being much more conservative and `proper' than many of their peers in day-to-day life, able to be red hot raunch when living out their fantasies but being more elegant and conservative in their day to day lives than many of their day-to-day peers.  Some of the same young women who will bare all, living out their fantasies in a hot wet slippery performance would be the first to challenge you in day-to-day life if you were trying to perve down their top or up their skirts.  I accept that most of the Stripping industry is exploitive and am not condoning or supporting it but I do feel as if Ms Levy neglected to touch on the part of many Womens' psyche (and blokes as well) that wants to `play games' be viewed as a sex object now and then just for fun and stimulation, to be able to say to a trusted partner `just do me like a 50 cent hooker!'.  If this text is the current state of feminism, maybe the one-to-one Caring, Loving, partner centred relationship where anything goes in a complete history of trust will be the next wave and both genders will be closer to liberated by that.  This gets into a grey area because it requires such trust and vulnerability and it will be argued is only the product of all the flawed history but surely if we can build self esteem to the point where we don't need to take things `ever so seriously' we are really headed down the right track.  Apart from that I recommend this book highly.    Anything that tells Women `it's YOUR body, YOUR sexuality, YOUR birthright, own it, have it, treasure it, enjoy it-will get my approval.  As a bloke, feminism may not be in my interests, as a Father, Lover and Human, it has my complete support.  I hope many people read this book and see some of what Ms Levy identifies, the new attack on the feminist movement from within, Women thinking they are expressing their liberation by being exploited, coz no matter anything else-That SUX!!   Cheers, Lloyd 
 If you like books on non-fiction crime or just crime in general, you should get this book.  I think it got a lot of press when it came out, as it should have.  I read this book a couple of years ago after hearing the author on the radio.  I flew through it.  Earley doesn't miss a beat on what it's really like to be in a serious prison like Leavenworth.  From the guards to the prisoners, to the administrators and Federal Bureau of Prisons, you get it all.  I mean it's probably 1 of 4 books I really enjoyed the last 5 or 6 years of reading.  You just learn a lot in this about this parallel universe of criminals and the men and women who have to warehouse these guys.  I haven't read anything else from the author but I should because I enjoyed this book so much.  So you love true crime?  Then you should find out what happens to those guys after their convictions, it's just a real solid cool book.  Get it 
 I'm an avid DVD concert collector. From certain forms of Jazz (Norah Jones to Harry Connick Jr) to Pop (you name it!) to Rap (Linkin' Park). I like music and enjoy watching and listening in general. But I have not experienced anything like this DVD. Take it for what it's worth... because tastes are very personal. Here goes...  I wasn't really a John Mayer fan. I've heard a few of his songs which piqued my interest. At the first viewing, I was half turned off and half amused by his unusual gyrations and facial expressions (like the others who have commented on the same thing). Just looking at his face, it seemed initially that he might have some sort of mental retardation. But since the music was great, I ended up listening to the DVD again... and again... and again! With each re-listening, I always noticed something new. And it is only with re-listening to the DVD that one will get the true essence of John Mayer. After a while, you see past those facial expressions and gyrations. To me now, its just like a pianist swaying back and forth with a slow tune or bobbing his/her head up and down with a fast one. You will notice those expressions/gyrations only occur when he is plucking or strumming out melodies and chords. His voice has great depth. I didn't and couldn't for the life of me make out the lyrics initially. But again they eventually ALL come out! And the lyrics themselves convey many things. So... from getting to know the singer through his monologues, voice and songs, to the wonderful and oftentimes soulful guitar playing (mostly very clean plucking and excellent strumming), to the wonderful overall performance and sound quality, I can't give this DVD anything but 5 stars 
 "Neoconservatives were the boat people of the McGovern revolution that was itself the political vehicle of the moral, social, and cultural revolutions of the 1960s."  A key to understanding neoconservatism is that it is not a sibling or an "update" of traditional conservatism. To see it that way will only mislead you. Neoconservatism's roots have sprouted from the left more than the right. The current GOP "may be Reaganite in its tax policy, but it is Wilsonian in its foreign policy, FDR in its trade policy, and LBJ all the way in its spending policies. Pragmatism is the order of the day. The Republican philosophy might be summarized thus: "To hell with principle; what matters is power, and that we have it, and that they do not."  But when one becomes one's enemy, who won?  Conservatives are nationalists. Neoconservatives are internationalists. Conservatives are protectionists. Neoconservatives are free traders. Conservatives see the culture war as essential. Neoconservatives see it as a distraction. Conservatives believe in defending the land militarily and project our ideals by example. Neoconservatives believe in defending it offensively and projecting our ideals by force.  The neoconservatives and presidential candidate George W. Bush were a match on domestic policy in 2000 (Bush didn't propose a single spending cut in his campaign), but it appears that they hijacked his foreign policy, whatever it used to be. (Given the events of his presidency, it's a startling reminder that this same president couldn't name four world leaders when he was quizzed during the 2000 campaign.) That foreign policy was the defense and advancement of world democracy, something that has never been America's aim. The only proactive foreign policy we've ever had was the Truman Doctrine, a stance we took when the Soviet menace showed itself to be aggressive and a real threat to the United States, our allies, and our real interests. The Clinton interventions, misguided as they were, were at least brief and limited, nothing that risked expansion into a long-term, regional conflict. The same cannot be said of Iraq.  Mr. Buchanan gives a chapter-length history of Islam and Europe, setting the scene for 9/11. The following war in Afghanistan was just and necessary, and quite a diplomatic masterpiece, one that could have been the foundations for better relations with the Middle East, which had shown considerable support for our efforts against al Qaeda. Iran, an al Qaeda enemy, voluntarily offered help in Afghanistan, but Bush soon after named it among the "axis of evil". The neocons had attached their agenda to the unclear war on terror to advance a war on Iraq, a war that the neocons had pursued for years, and to be followed with a frightening series of wars throughout the region. The war on terror evolved into a quest for worldwide democracy, buffered with a moral imperative that our diseased culture violates in almost every way, and with the unrealistic belief that the Middle East wants democracy, even though they've never chosen it themselves. Mr. Buchanan also offers a study of terrorism, and what a touchy thing it is: the weapon of the weak, the reaction to empire, the stuff of martyrdom.  With new bases in central Asia, the invasion of Iraq, and talk of much more war, the neocons were starting to frighten the world. China, now surrounded by U.S. bases, began building and tailoring its military for our encirclement, and leading the all-offense neocons to believe that war with them could be expected, even though their going to war with us would have been suicide. China wasn't just preparing for us: it was reacting to us. The neocons were reacting to a world of their own making: filled with nations that wouldn't war with us if they were democratic. This is utterly divorced from conservatism, historic American foreign policy, and moral, Constitutional, and realistic restraint. Perhaps it's for the best in the long term that Iraq didn't turn out; that madness seems to be coming to an end. Even the neocons seem to believe that failure is now an option.  Mr. Buchanan then turns to the domestic issues: the disaster of free trade, the continuance of big government, and the imperial judiciary. However, about all you'll find is that neoconservatives are a problem in the sense that they're not the solution. Cultural issues have given them plenty of chances to fight and solidify their base, but they've been silent, and often quick to fund whatever nonsense demanded funding to keep the issue from open debate and away from the hands of the Democrats. Neoconservatives seem to have concluded that big government gets votes, and that social issues are a distraction. But the culture war truly began with the horrid Warren court, while Congress didn't use its Constitutional power to hold it back. The neoconservative GOP seems too focused on bad foreign and economic policy to be concerned with the judicial usurpation of power it wasn't meant to have. Neoconservatism hasn't corrected wrongs; it has created more of them.  I was hoping for some answers to an overall question I've had about neoconservatism: where is all of this going? How do massive debts get paid when spending is out of control and manufacturing is sent overseas? Where does peace begin after perpetual war? Mr. Buchanan doesn't offer anything here but the question. Perhaps that's for the neocons themselves. Perhaps even they don't know.  "Where the Right Went Wrong" could be the prequel to "State of Emergency" in that this book is a good summary of Bush's first term, whereas the latter defines the pressing issue of the second. However, this book includes an afterward, written in early 2005, summarizing the voters' response to the electric 2004 election, and defining the battle lines within the GOP between traditional conservatives and neoconservatives, the fighting between which began almost as soon as the 2004 returns were in 
 As a "suicide survivor" after the death of my younger brother, I found this book very enlightening.  The suicide of a loved one leaves many unanswered questions for the survivors.  Reading this book acknowledges many of the same feelings I had, and continue to have,after my brothers death.  I hope with all my heart that my brothers spirit is watching over our family, as I miss him dearly every day.  This book has brought me hope for my journey into the next life 
 I haven't got the chance to see Alabama live, but "Mountain Music" is one of my all-time favorite country albums.  I bought this one from a mail-order record club.  Not a clunker on it.  Highly recommended 
 I got this massager couple of days ago & I have simply fallen in love with it!Just 3 minutes of massage can be so relaxing & all the muscular tension & fatigue is gone. Dfferent programes & various speed modes will make U feel U got a wonderful product that's worth your money & you are not wasting it on any trash! 
 I bought this CD to practice for my school play and was really helpful. It also has good songs to listen to 
 They are books like those written by Stephen Ambrose which keep the flame of my interest in reading of times and events of long ago burning. Some have accused Ambrose of taking too many liberties with the facts. To those I would say, Bah Humbug! This book is well written and worthy of the readers time, unless, of course, you are a "fact-checker", in which case the original sources, to the extent they even exist, might be more to your liking.  For Orginary Joe's, like me, Mr. Ambrose has provided a good deal of reading entertainment and information. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be transported in time and place to the high plains during the Indian Wars 
 This book is indeed very good, as it presents deeper analysis of many fluids phenomena, departing from basic ideas and fundamental concepts. But in my opinion you must already have a good understanding of fluid mechanics to really enjoy it. I guess it would not be easy for a begginer in the matter, and guess that's why some may call it confusing. In fact, you won't find that current structured treatment of the matter that other books (mainly the textbooks) presents, or the contents of regular under-graduate or graduate courses in engineering, with common engineering applications, and so on. Nevertheless, as a teacher and researcher in the field of fluid mechanics, I really enjoyed reading it, and it really improved my understanding on many topics 
 The poetry in this diverse volume lives up to the lofty title on the book cover.  Indeed, the poetry therein is luminous.  From Haiku and dead moths to drangonfly wings and Jeffers' hurt hawks, this anthology is great for any ocassion.  I discovered it while traveling, and it proved a lovely travel companion.  It made the trip especially memorable and much more endurable, in that the poetry unceasingly provided me opportunity to reflect on the human condition and elemental themes.  The more interesting aspect of this anthology happens to accord with the editor's own writing philosophy--which focuses on celebrating the ordinary--to demonstrate that the world is imbued with poetic spirit in  simple facts--simple happenings that may easily be overlooked by the distracted passerby.  I recommend this volume to anyone, esp. the contributions of Herbert, Hass, Milosz, Jeffers, and Szymborska 
 I have read every book in the Tempe Brennan series; this is another excellent novel. This is one of my favorite suspense series...I eagerly await each new installment.  If you like this book, check out a new author I've recently discovered. I highly recommend Thirst by Dania Deschamps. 
 For 25 years I have struggled with alcohol while living a life of a supposed happy, successful executive. I had never, until reading his book, been able to admit I was in the same boat as every other alcoholic no matter what social/economic walk of life we come from. I feel grateful to have been humbled through his open account of his journey to sobriety. I thought I was a "big shot" and that was my downfall until reading his story and the other stories of "successful" people included. The Thinking Person's Guide to Sobriety caused my first real awaking to the truth because he relates to those from corporate society. Pluymens book is  honest sharing from a white collar executive who lived in the fast lane and for years denied needing any outside help to conquer this insidious addiction just like myself. He shares his personal journals that discribe his long denial, his many solo attempts to quit and ultimately how he got real with himself. It is full of educational information along the way that helps the thinking person "get it". My wife has also read it and claims to have a better understanding of me and what I need to do to stay clean and sober. I am grateful to have come across this fanastic book and my new found determination to rise above my addiction is paying off. I am finding peace I never thought I'd experience 
 The first time we listened to this alblum we were a bit dissapointed.  I guess we are Smokey fans.  We love his voice. The earlier songs on the alblum came from his days with the Miracles.  It was good for us , but not great.  The second half of the alblum highlighted Smokey and we really enjoyed it.  Hey 25 songs for this price.  Who can complain. 
 I am a coach and i train people into coaching, and I use this book and referr to Flaherty as one good manual to get a frame on how to work with people and which way to build with them the coaching interaction, objectives and achievements. It is also very clear, has a lot of visual maps, and it's quite accurate too when it comes to issues definitions and their origins. It' not the complete guidebokk of coaching but very helpful indeed.I do suggest any coach to have it among the basic important manuals 
 Such great poems from a great person. One of my favorites 
 Tom Broadbent is out enjoying the desert when he hears gunshots.  He finds a dying prospector who gives him a notebook with instruction to give it to no one but his daughter.  Tom, am man of his word, keeps knowledge of the notebook form the police and sets out to figure out who the prospector was so that he can locate his daughter.  The book is full of numbers like a code so Tom enlists the help of a code breaker now studying to be a monk.  But the numbers aren't a code but readings from a ground radar machine.  Compiled, the numbers show a picture of a almost mummified dinosaur fossil.  The find is incalculable but there is no information about where it is.  Meanwhile the forces behind the prospector's death have recovered a sample of the fossil but need the notebook to locate the main find.  One of these forces is ruthless and willing to kill.  He suspects Tom has the information and sets out to get it.  This are complicated even more as the fossil is somehow related to a shadowy organization connected with the final Apollo mission and something discovered on the moon.  All of these forces begin to come together as Tom tries to carry out the promise he made to a dying man.  It will not be easy for Tom or his wife to survive this but they keep trying.  It all comes together in the end in a satisfying way.  There are elements of this book that seem influenced by Preston's work with Lincoln Child.  It is easy to see elements of THUNDERHEAD, THE ICE LIMIT and any books dealing with natural history museums.  This book, like his collaborative efforts, is well paced, imaginative and entertaining.  Watching all of the plot threads come together at the end is almost a pleasure to watch.  Almost because the reader will want to pay attention to the story's revelations and not the author's mastery of the writing craft.  If you have enjoyed any of Preston's other books you are sure to enjoy this one.  Check it out 
 This movie is the bomb! I had such a great time with this movie! Jurassic Park has always been great! The videogames where great! And I loved the soundtrack! If you have seeen my other reviews you will know I love a movie with a great soundtrack. And this one got it! Hey who dosent like Dino action? Over to your left there are man eating dinos they are gonna shread you! So much action! This movie couldent get any better! Well if they somehow got lost in the city it would be the bomb! But hey this movie is great! I had a great time and you will too 
 I find many of the reviews "right on".  However, many comments are off-base, and as His Cousin, I find inappropriate.  Ask, and you may find Truth!  "No disrespect..." ..."but"... there is that word again... don't listen to what I just said, just what I am about to say...  Amazing how the critics, nearly a Century later, have criticisms that sting, but couldn't find the gumption to face Him... or me!  Let's get it on 
 My kids love Dr. Suess's books. This is one of their favorites, and mine. It's silly but what fun! Recommended for parents who like to read to their young children 
 This is one of the few standard books on the subject of the Andamanese  Negrito - and the earliest written by a professional anthropologist.  No  serious student of the subject can afford to be without it.  Based on field  work done by the young Radcliffe-Brown 1906-08, he  only published it in  1922, the book  undergoing several subsequent reprints and revisions. At  the time of his field work,  aboriginal society had been under great strain  for half a century and was well on the way to extinction. Brown's results  therefore have to be taken with some degree of caution, at least far as  traditional Andamanese society is concerned. This being the very first work  of the inexperienced young scientist, unsurprisingly, there are a number of  shortcomings: the book is virtually our only major source on the north  Great Andamanese tribes (earlier authors had concentrated on the southern  tribes) yet Brown often fails to distinguish between the various northern  tribes. This lamentable fact reduces the value of his observations,  especially in linguistics. He also did not seem so much interested in  collecting new information  than in "explaining" and theorizing  on the cultural features he found. With hindsight, it would have been very  much better if he had gone easy on the theory and collected more new  information more carefully. His field work was the last chance to gather  anything of value on the traditional Great Andamanese societies shortly  before they dissolved altogether.  The book can be fairly heavy going in  some places but is well written and organized for all that. It even has  (unusual for an early book on the Andamanese) a useful index 
 Nova are a research facility that have just constructed five robots designed for war. After a lightning storm, their Number 5 leaves the group and heads into town, realizing he's alive. Is he alive? That's up to Stephanie Smith (Ally Sheedy) and Number 5's creator (Steve Gutenberg) to find out.  I found it a bit hard to sit through when I was a kid, but "Short Circuit" isn't too bad. The robot is cute and the plot is fairly engaging. Worth a look for fans of robots 
 I've been wearing Saucony running shoes for about four years now. This is my first pair of Grid Omni 5 and I'm generally pleased. There is a squeak in the heel of the right shoe, so I contacted the seller and they're going to exchange them for me. First time I've had a squeaking problem with a Saucony shoe. Great stability for a moderate overpronator, very comfortable. 
 Barthes tells us about Japan but I would recommend his exploration into another culture as a pattern to follow in your next travelling. Signs and meanings behind the surface. 
 The Sineater is a stunning debut from an incredibly articulate, well-rounded writer.  This is, without question, one of the best debut horror novels I've ever read.  This original tale grips you and never lets go, having one of my favorite all-time endings.  The world Elizabeth Massie creates is frighteningly real, populated with characters so believable that it sometimes feels like nonfiction.  I can't wait to dig into more of her books.  Do yourself a favor and read The Sineater.  You won't be disappointed 
 Maizon Singh is a black girl who lives with her grandmother. She is happy where she lives and the school she goes to (P.S. 102). Her friend Margaret also lives on the same street as Maizon does. They are very close friends and spend much of their time together. Maizon's Grandmother is always there for here when she needs her and Margaret's mother gives Maizon good advice. This family is happy together on Madison Street until the day Maizon parted. Maizon is accepted by Blue Hill, a school far from home. Maizon's Grandmother urges her to go, while Maizon secretly does not want to go and does not want to disappoint her. At school, she realizes how beautiful it is there. Not only is the place beautiful, but the teachers are nice, there are wonderful classes, and Maizon has a nice roommate. There are only 5 black students at Blue Hill and feels lonely. A part of her is missing from Blue Hill, she longs to go home. She is homesick and feels different from the others. In the end, Maizon has to make the tough choice of staying and pursuing the scholarship she wants or will she go home and find the piece of her that is missing, most likely, her family 
 The fragrances are marvelous, yet after the shower they do not interfere with your scent of choice. I find the shower gel is very creamy and not drying at all. I do use it as well as a shampoo, but have found in the dry harsh winter I still need a conditioner. I highly recommend this product 
 I'm a nonbeliever, but I became aware of Augustine and Aquinas when taking Philosophy 100C and Philosophy of Religion at UCLA for my BA in Philosophy.  What I enjoy most about Augustine in this work is that he often sounds very rational and open-minded, indeed, almost modern in his frank discussions of human behaviors.  For example, he says things about sexuality that you might not expect a Doctor of the Church to say, like sex, being created by God, is not evil but it is lust which is sinful.  This work also contains his famous quote about time "If no one asks me what time is, I know.  If someone asks me, I do not."  I suppose that is the mark of a great author, in that they transcend the times they live in and have something to say to all generations.  At over 1000 pages, this book definitely requires a time committment on your part, but is certainly worth the investment 
 I am currently using this textbook in my AP English Literature class and this is one of the best English text books that I have used so far. It really provides numerous poetry (famous and not-famous) with in-depth questions that I find very helpful for me to study 
 Although my husband and I knew each other well before we got engaged and married, this book was a great help for us.  Recommended by our pastor, the book (and accompanying workbooks) are great for opening discussions on topics you probably wouldn't even think of!    Preconceptions about who should do the dishes, who did the laundry aren't really things you would think to discuss when you are starting out as a married couple -- but misconceptions based on how you were brought up could create some serious resentment within your relationship!    Thanks to this book we were able to realize our different preconceptions and work on finding a new balance for ourselves.  Actually doing the exercises in the workbooks was the most helpful because my husband and I were able to see the discrepancies in our ideas based on our upbringing.  It brought us closer together while giving us insight into each others' family structure.  This book will give you a strong foundation for maintaining a close relationship throughout your marriage -- the key is communication and understanding the differences in your spouse/fiance 's background and upbringing.   
 I have been an amateur photographer for 20+ years. In that time I have been a semi-loyal Olympus fan. (I admit I cheated with Canon on a couple of point & shoots).  This is a great DSLR for someone looking to carry their photography hobby to the digital world or someone looking to start a new hobby.   It is not the easiest camera to use. Meaning you need to read the manual to learn the icons.  The picture quality is amazing. The ability to manipulate the picture without entering a full manual mode is also very impressive. The size is perfect. The Cannon DSLR is a little to compact for my hand to provide a stable platform when shooting. The Olympus fits just right. (my hands are not huge.)  DOWNSIDE: The accessories are very expensive and limited. The kit included is excellent and will satiate the appetite of most amateur photogs, especially when purchased with the optional starter kit for the camera (extra battery, bag, remote, etc.) But, before you buy this camera, imagine yourself wanting a wide angle lens, or a more powerful telephoto. Now take a look online... not too impressive?  This is the area that the Cannon DSLR excels 
 I happened upon this book in a library sale, and so glad I picked it up! The prose in this book is astoundingly gorgeous....poetry.  The details of everyday life in the period are vast, it's all intertwined in a bitter marriage and life of John Milton...told through his wife who was forced into marriage with him at 16...2 temperments so unsuited to one another. She loved another.  You'll love this gem of a book. I am surprised it is not more well known 
 I enjoyed this movie when it first came out, and I am very happy to be able to get it on DVD.  Sally Field And James Garner star in this 1980's May-December romance.  Sally's character is a 33 year old single mother of a 12 year old boy who moves from California to a small town in Arizona.  James Garner is her love interest. Both Sally and James are great actors, which is one reason why I loved this movie.  I also enjoy the setting - a dusty small town where she tries to make a go of a horse boarding/training business on her rented property.  I grew up in a small town and also with horses.  The ex-husband of Sally's character is the movie's antagonist. His immaturity, lack of ambition, and other undesirable traits make Murphy (James Garner) that much more appealing. I was about 13 when I first saw this movie, and now I am 32 and love it even more. There's a lot of truth in this movie.  In my life, older men have been much like Murphy - wiser, more grounded, all in all a much better catch than a young, flighty man - like the ex-husband. All in all, a great film. Wish they still made them like this - simple, with a great story, and good humor.  When you have a good story, you don't need all of the "extras" like special effects, lots of explicit sex, etc.  A good movie for the whole family.  
 Of all the New Order albums that I own, I would have to say that Republic has been my favorite throughout the years. I enjoy listening to this album the whole way through, and with the order that they used to lay out the songs, you can have it on repeat and want to listen to it again and again.   So you can understand my interpretation of the feel of the album and why I like it, I will tell you that I enjoy this album because of the musical style it has, which in my opinion, has a timeless and smooth quality to it. Each song starts out brilliantly, and although it would go well on a pop radio station, it seems a little more mature and unique than your typical pop tune, using a fine combination of guitars, keyboards, and at times, a choir and a symphony. To describe the feel of each song, as each song progresses, you become more settled as the rythm and the background (almost a classical style-like music) resonates and blends with the guitars and keyboards even more as the song reaches it's climax. Bernard Sumner's vocals seemed to be most at home with this style. With Coldplay, Dido, Sarah McLachlan, Delerium, Balligomingo, and many others in my most frequently listened to category, this one definitely goes well in the mix... the mix for chillin. : 
 Author Henry Miller lists Mencken's Prejudices series (which was published in six volumes) as one of the "hundred books which influenced me most" in his famous list subjoined to "The Books In My Life." Having just completed reading a tattered copy of volume one, I can say in all sincerity that I have rarely enjoyed a book more. Prejudices is a compilation of Mencken's literary and theatrical critiques, and on display are his unparalleled lexicon, his sardonic wit, his exasperation with human incompetance and pomposity, and his appreciation for the rare instances of human greatness. If you have a good sense of humor and despise political correctness, settle down on the sofa and relish one of his 10 to 20 page vignettes. This is as close to nirvana as you can come with a book, but be forewarned! Keep your dictionary very handy until you have mastered Mencken's hilarious vernacular 
 The Maya did not divide their everyday lives and religion.  In fact, they didn't have a religion in our sense at all.  Their everyday lives were bound up in visions, stories of the heavens, earth, past, and future that were not separate from the reality of their everyday experience.  This book, the "Popol Vuh" means Council Book.  That is, it is a book for the Lords to consult.  One of its other titles is "The Light That Came From Beside the Sea".  It is a document of the Quiche Maya who lived (and still live) in a portion of what is present day Guatemala.  The "Popol Vuh" tells the essential myth of the ball game and the hero twins.  Its story is far too involved and strange to try and explain it in this review.  The story explains things about the Sun, Moon, and Venus in their play across the heavens.  It prepares the living for what awaits them in Xibalba (the awful place below the earth).  And there is constant gratitude for the knowledge of the creation of men from maize and the light of understanding this book brings them.  The various sacred places of mountains, caves, and of ritual sacrifice are all here and powerfully expressed.  Dennis Tedlock translated the text into clear and very readable English.  However, that is not sufficient for the uninitiated to understand.  So, Tedlock provides us with an introductory essay to help us understand the context of these stories.  At the back he also provides notes on the text arranged by page number, a glossary of terms (which we desperately need to read the book), a wonderful bibliography for further reading, and an index.    Now, a couple of things to keep in mind when you read this book (and you should).  This text has one written source, and it is written in the Mayan language with a Western alphabet.  Also, this copy is post Conquest so there is no real way to know how the story was changed or influenced by the Christian stories that were also (forcibly) taught to the Maya, if at all.  If you end up believing that this story is an intact retelling of the true Myth without Christian influences, there are some pretty strange and wonderful parallels.  If you are uncomfortable with some of the parallels, then you will want to explain them away by claiming corruption by the Christian conquerors.  Take your pick.  No one really knows.  Terrific edition of an important text that you can really enjoy reading and adding to your understanding of the world and the total range of the human experience 
 FRONTIERS is another great Journey CD. The band was experiencing interpersonal problems within itself during the sessions for the album, resulting in a work frought with tension, especially on the album's hardest-edged songs "Chain Reaction" and "Edge Of The Blade." The latter accurately describes the friction between myself and members of my old bowling league, which led to my passing on the opportunity to rejoin in 2002 when it was presented as a way to help me look good for my favorite actresses. The ballad "Faithfully", although great, is a little bit overplayed. The fact that past and present Journey members currently advocate sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist, as well as increased funding for law enforcement, makes FRONTIERS an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience 
 I have celiac disease, which is essentially an allergy to wheat protein, and I've been GF for 5 years now. (Why does that sound like I'm at an AA meeting?) Bette Hagman's books are the first couple of books that I got, and they're pretty good. *GFG-Fast & Healthy* is one of my favorites because it has some great recipes in it. However, I have no idea why she called it what she did. Maybe she lightened up some of the recipes compared to her 1950's style of cooking in the original GFG book, but after doing Ornish (*Eat More, Weigh Less*, Dean Ornish) for a couple years before I was diagnosed (familial high cholesterol), I can't imagine how anyone thinks that using this much butter, cheese, margarine, or butter-flavored Crisco (!!!) could be in any way labeled "healthy." Including recipes for salmon, curried shrimp, or mulligatawny soup was just silly. You can get those recipes in GF form anywhere. Maybe the title was wishful thinking.   However, some of my favorite recipes are in this book:   Pizza crust - p242 - 5 ingredients. Only 5! Tastes great, too. Husband prefers it to regular.   Spicy corn muffins - p103 - fantastic!   Banana bread - p98 - My first successful GF baked product.   Veggie muffins - p101 - tasty and good.   Salem crumpets as pizza crust - p95 - tasty for a change, but I like p242 better.   TK Kenyo 
 Cormac McCarthy is undoubtedly one of the best American writers alive today. This is precisely why I purchased one of his works for my first venture into the "books on tape" world. I feared that hearing his works read to me my a Hollywood actor would diminish its impact, but I am happy to report that Brad Pitt does a good job of keeping the spirit and humor of his writing up to par. There are, however, times when he seems bored with the task as his voice takes on a particularly lullaby-like quality, so be sure to keep a cup of coffee handy if listening while driving!  I have read all of these novels before so I was familiar with the stories. The abridgement did cut out some of my favorite passages (especially in the Crossing) where McCarthy embarks on a style parade worthy of Fitzgerald's or Faulkner's attention.  My wife and I listened to the stories while traveling through the Southwest, and it was a delight to experience the landscape through the eyes of the stories. If you are planning a cross country drive or a long drive through the New Mexico-Arizona-West Texas area, I cannot recommend enough these books on tape as travel companions 
 There were some songs I could do without, but for the most part a great CD 
 This enchanting story about preparing to do something new offers an opportunity for parents and children to discuss the pictures, how a child might get ready for a new experience, and how to interpret the feelings expressed by a variety of faces.  After a few sessions through the book, the child can manage to tell the story without being able to read any of the occasional words.  For those who like to see that girls can be involved in challenges, too, the maiden from the castle who seems to be merely observing the action, has a hand in the very happy ending.  
 This is the description given by Time magazine to Feynman's investigation on the cause of the Challenger disaster.  And like other books by/about him, this one reinforces the statement. Recommended for physics and  computer engineering graduates who want an overview of computer science  using the tools of physics.  Don't miss out on this smorgasbord of ideas  and good stories 
 This book is great!  Lupica tells the story of an old Mets pitcher trying to make a comeback.  His use of real players and baseball history makes this story seem like a non-fictional biography.  For anyone that was a ball player and loves this great game will relate to everything the main charactor (Charlie Stoddard) goes through.  From the pains of throwing a baseball your entire life to the night life of a pro ball player; his interaction with other teammates, the great pitcher/catcher relationship and the infamous Red Sox Vs Yankess rilvary.  This book is a page turner and is extremely difficult to put down once you've started.  Any true baseball fan will love this book 
 "Went home lonely and despondent because nobody loves me and it's Easter, and I cried." [4-17-81] When I reached that line in the diaries, I think I truly fell in love with Andy.  He was a total observer of life and pierced a depth of feeling in his aloneness.  He seemed to be a walking nerve and picked up every nuance of life and all the personalities surrounding him.    His observations about people were uncanny - and he was like a prophet in many ways, even at one point predicting his own death!  He knew things about people that they probably didn't know about themselves.  For instance his glib comment after the death of Elvis Presley in 1977, "They're saying that the article Caroline Kennedy did on the Elvis funeral for Rolling Stone made fun of the local people, but I can understand that--Caroline's really intelligent and the people down there really were dumb.  Elvis never knew there were more interesting people" [8-30-77] - honing in on exactly what killed Elvis!  Or when he mentioned Michael Jackson's penchant for young boys - and that was 1984!    His diaries are so revealing and so easy to read and he really makes us understand all the modes of the counterculture that revolved around his life - the music, the artists, the movie stars... and how self-absorbed they all were.  And how caught up in drugs and drink some of them became.  Although Andy was obviously anorexic and somewhat alcoholic (he hated to drink yet it seemed he drank almost every day) he was constantly trying to improve himself and he wrestled with his physical self and all his insecurities every day of his life.  Yet he was of strong mind and his beliefs were never swayed.  And he wasn't afraid to make his feelings and opinions known.  Yet his life was always overshadowed by his fear of death and disease.  And he was insecure about his looks, yet managed to start a modeling career in his early '50s!  He was such a 'cat'!  "There was a party at the Statue of Liberty, but I'd already read publicity of me going to it so I felt it was done already." [7-5-83] He invented his own language and way of communicating, which was very colourful and made every moment interesting.  His diaries are a sensual feast; he lived life to its fullest and was able to describe all the flavors of the food and drink, the odors and scents of people and places, in such a way that the reader feels as though he/she is reliving it all.  What impressed me most about Andy was his great discipline and ability to admit to his own shortcomings.  He got up every day and went to work like it was a nine-to-five job, went to church every Sunday, and stayed in tune with all that was going on in the world around him.  If Andy were alive today, he'd love the Internet, e-mail and cell phones.  For he was a man about the world, truly in love with life and all that it has to offer.  I just wished the diaries included an index. 
 White Noise by Don Delillo was a book that should be read by all ages. It's basic concepts that were brought out were the acts of consumerism and death. There was also some sex involved in there too. As you can see, a perfect book for the growing college student. I also liked how Delillo brought in some humorous moments when they were during his grocery shopping and watching television. This novel basically describes the typical American family and shows how this family is just as normal as the rest of us, but shows the side we never really see. I particularly like how Delillo displays Jack as this bizarre man who really focuses on death. He can't help but think about it. I really liked him in this novel because he reminds me of myself as I walk around and think "outside the box" if you know what I mean.  This book constantly made me laugh, especially when the father fights with his son. That whole argument is hysterical! The book throws some good twists to American society that most of us never see. My basic thoughts on this novel are that you should read this because it will really make you laugh, and make you think about your typical day of work and life 
 The Mental Keys to Hitting is the Greatest most user friendly baseball coach's book ever. I thought the mental aspects of Seeing the ball were extremely effective. Most readers reading this review might think that every player is seeing the ball properly. Players do not see the ball as well as they should because they have never been taught the proper mind set of seeing the ball.Coaching hitters to see the ball is one of the most important things a coach can teach his players.This is absolutely not coached at any level of youth baseball. Mr. Dorfman does an excellent job of explaning this simple but often overlooked method of batting. I have bought The Mental Game of Baseball, The Mental Game of Pitching, and The Mental Keys to hitting. These three books are the TOP Three baseball coaching books ever written. I highly recommend this book and the other two books by Mr. Dorfman. This book will teach you the coach how to apply these mental princples to help you to effectively coach your youth league baseball team 
 You need not like or understand basketball, nor do you need to be from the east coast (or Jersey City, heaven forbid!) to enjoy and appreciate this book. The message here is simple; in an age of inflated egos, lack of humility, and sports figures revered as gods, there are still people in the world that care about their fellow human beings. Bob Hurley has dedicated his life to helping inner-city kids achieve something through basketball, but more importantly, to respect themselves. What can you say about a man who dedicated his life to St. Anthony's and the kids who attended school there? An inspiring story.   Basketball was a vehicle for kids from Jersey City, under the guidance of Coach Hurley, to realize that there was more to life and to the world than being a hotshot basketball player at St. Anthony's in Jersey City. Yes, Coach Hurley has achieved seemingly the impossible at a beleaguered inner-city school, but he has saved lives in the process.  I was born and raised in Jersey City and I attended a Catholic high school that was a competitor of St. Anthony's (Marist H.S. in Bayonne)because my parents had the same philosophy as Coach Hurley. You need to rise above your environment, especially when that environment is Jersey City.  Anyone who deals with children for a living, coaches, or needs some insight in dealing with children will benefit from the message in this book. 
 About the Book: For those of you planning to buy something for a comic book fan, the "Marvel Essentials" series are black & white trade paper back (tpb) reprints of what are considered popular and/or important Marvel Comics.   They are printed on lightweight paper, and are designed to bring comics that may be hard to find back to new and old comic book fans.  This particular tpb reprints a series of 15 comics that were originally released in 1982, 21-years after the first Marvel comic (Fantastic Four #1).  Another (more detailed) version, called the "Deluxe Handbook" was released in the mid 1980s, and will be reprinted in a series of 3 tpbs this year.  The series covers the major people, places, and things that make up the first 20-years of the "shared" Marvel Universe where Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, the Hulk, etc. live.  The black & white reprint is designed to keep size and costs down.  Good Features: - Easy to store (book format) - Easy to read the text (the lettering is crisp and clear) - Easy to find information and flip around because entries are alphabetically arranged - Entire 15 comic run in one book - Detailed reference information w/ first appearance of people / places / things - Good artwork (even in black & white)  Common Complaints - Original comics can still be found for cheap - Color is important, and not present in this book - Information is dated - The more complete "Deluxe Handbook" tpb 3-book series will be released in 2006  General Thoughts: I actually own about 11 of the original 15 comics from this series.  It has taken me over 6-years to find them in cheap quarter bins at comic shows, but I know the color originals from this series are easy to find.  I plan on getting rid of my originals, because I never really found myself reading the originals.  I filed them away with the rest of my regular comic collection, which isn't really the point with this particular series.  However, since tpbs, like the Essentials series, easily can be carried on a bus or plane, I tend to really enjoy reading them while commuting and traveling.  And since this book is the ideal size for sitting on a proper bookshelf, I've found that unlike the originals, I'll pull it off the shelf when I'm curious about a comic person, place, or thing.    Do keep in might that the larger and more complete Deluxe Handbook will be released in 3 black & white volumes later in 2006.  I plan on purchasing that series as well, but some people might want to wait to only keep and read that series. 
 Quite frankly an all-time horror classic, that I remember from youth oh so well There seemed to be a trend developing dealing with apartment buildings and its weird tenants, The Sentinel certainly has it share of that. Some of it may not make alot of sense, but that's the great thing... a surreal creepiness that you recognize instantly with things not being right. We would go on to see familiar themes being presented in movies such as "Rosemary's Baby", "The Tenant", and a more recent "The 4th floor". With some similarities as well to "Burnt Offerings". All in all its a classic 70's horror presentation that leans more on the nightmarish than ghosts, satanism or slasher films. I can still jar me the same as my younger years...... and I love it!

 I'll be perfectly honest, I had no idea who Modigliani was before this DVD came in to my hands. I've always been a fan of art history, although I've never taken any classes on it, I've always just pickde up things here and there and appreciated art. I was captivated by Modigliani from the very beginning. I found everything about the plot interesting and fast moving.   The depiction of the religious problems that kept Modigliani and his lover apart was heartbreaking. And their struggle to keep their family together against all odds was amazing. I also love seeing the relationship between Modigliani and Picasso, which was definitely a rivalry if I ever saw one. I had never beena aware that Modigliani and Picasso were completing against each other for almost everything, and it was interesting for me to see how they played that out in the film, whether or not that's actually how it went down in real life.   I thought this movie was brilliantly acted and touching. I'm really glad I sat down and watched it and I definitely recommend it 
 This is an album that features Keith on vocals more so than in the past, which is awesome because he is a great vocalist in addition to being on bass.  Just because Les C. is the most different bassist ever doesn't mean Keith can't Rockit on the bass Cheesy style (hint hint....new cover song to play).   The Cheese does the Chameleon and they gotta do the Rockit!!!.  Of course we all know Mike, Travis, Kyle, and Bill are great vocalists / players as always.  I'm still listening to the Hann because I am a piano player and mostly focus in on Kyle's notes.  I'm sure if him and Travis did some Hart & Kreutzmann style drum duos, that would also certainly Rockit!  The Cheese has certainly progressed/evolved throughout the ages and this album is something I could definitely see the Cheese rounding the wheel to.  It's very chill and I simply like it.  Cheese!    
 Never listen to this CD while driving after ending a relationship.  Trust me on this one from someone who knows.  I love this CD.  Songs that really touch you and everyone can relate to these songs.  
 This book is life-changing. I have given countless copies away to the people I love. We all have patterns that have been passed down our family line...some of them that you know you don't want, nor do you want your children to inherit. God has blessings awaiting you to replace these generational curses. If you are tired of struggling with the same old thing, get this book to get set free for good. 
 As with all the Robert Munsch books we own, my son frequently picks this one for reading. It is silly and always makes him laugh 
 I read about this book in Sunset magazine. I love Lanais. I want one at my house! It has so many photos of traditional Hawaiian decor and great info about the lifestyle. It's a great coffee table book because of its size and photo content 
 The book offers the reader a glimps into the true essence of leadership.  The author helps us to realize that it is not the leadership styles of the leader or behaviors of the followers that count the most.  Rather, it is the spiritual essence of our being as individuals that influences how we effectively move organizations and motive people.  It teachers us that leadership is about self and how we view and manifest our spiritual and personal principles as leaders.  It is a must read book for those interested in improving their leadership skills 
 An airliner unexpectedly crashes on the Greenland Icecap near a scientific station.  The scientists scramble to save the surviving passengers from the desperate cold of the Arctic night.  They soon discover that the passengers are not whom they seem, and people keep dying...  "Night Without End" is one of Alistair Maclean's earliest novels.  If his story-telling technique had not quite matured at this early date, he could still tell a gripping story, a closed house murder mystery set out-of-doors.  Stolen military secrets are at the heart of the plot-line, but they frequently take a second seat to the simple task of surviving the dangerous cold weather and the uncertain terrain.  The hero, a scientist named Mason, must ferry the passengers to safety on the coast while figuring out the identity of the killer and while being distracted by his sudden affections for a stewardess.  Maclean builds the story to a thrilling finale on a glacier.  This book is highly recommended to fans of Alistair Maclean, and to other looking for an exciting story.    
 It's interesting another should mention his/her disappointment over the music included for the DVD release of Trouble Man (1972), composed by the legendary Marvin Gaye.  The way I understand it Gaye wasn't pleased with how the music came out for the movie when originally released back in the day, and went back and re-recorded it for the soundtrack album (I got this information from another website)...I'm unsure if this is true or not, but it might explain why the music for the film is different than the actual music on the soundtrack album.  Written by John D.F. Black, who worked on a slew of television series ("The Fugitive", "Hawaii Five-O", "Mary Tyler Moore"), along with a film or two, most notably Shaft (1971), and directed by Ivan Dixon, who also worked on a great many television series like The Rockford Files" (1974), "Starsky and Hutch" (1975), and "Wonder Woman" (1976), to name a few, Trouble Man stars Robert Hooks (Airport '77, Fast-Walking).  Also appearing is silky voiced actor Paul Winfield (Damnation Alley, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan, The Terminator), William Smithers (Deathsport), Paula Kelly (Soylent Green, Uptown Saturday Night), blaxploitation veteran and one time Bond villain Julius Harris (Superfly, Black Caesar, Live and Let Die), Bill Henderson (Cornbread, Earl and Me), and Ralph Waite, whom many 1970s television viewers may recognize as patriarch John Walton Sr., from the series "The Waltons".  Hooks plays T (Mr. T if you're nasty), a licensed private investigator (which means he can carry a gun), among other things, who dresses sharply, maintains an office in a pool hall, drives a big, fancy car, and whom people turn to when they have no other recourse and need fast action.  An example of this is seen early on when someone comes to T relating how a baby got hurt because of a negligent building owner, and T pays a visit to landlord, played by Gordon Jump (the hapless station manager from the TV show "WKRP in Cincinnati"), and lays it on the line.  After their little talk, the hospital bills are taken care of, an apology is made, along with a promise to fix the problems with the building...street law in action...anyway, T is approached by two mid-level hustlers, Chalky Price (Winfield) and Pete Cockrell (Waite), who run various illegal gambling operations, with a problem.  Seems some masked men are hitting their games, and they want T to find out whom.  T's price is steep (he seems to have little love for the men, but is willing to take a whole lot of their money), but the men agree, as they know he'll get the job done.  Turns out the hustlers have set up a somewhat elaborate scam, one where they're going to try and pull a fast hustle on their main rival Big (Harris), setting up T as the fall guy which turns out to be one of those things that sounded good at the time, but now seems like a really bad idea as T is out to settle the score, his way (his way involves some serious beat downs and a whole lot of shooting).  A strong, proud, African American lead character, who is a private investigator type people turn to when they got nowhere else to go, plays both sides of the law, feared and respected by the criminal element, loved by the ladies, consistently hassled by The Man, dresses sharp, plays it cool, and sees things to the end...if this sounds familiar it is because we saw the same thing a year earlier in the film Shaft (1971) which writer John D.F. Black co-wrote with Ernest Tidyman, the latter being the actual author of the novel.  In essence, Trouble Man is Shaft in California, substituting Robert Hooks for Richard Roundtree...not that that's bad, but just not entirely original.  While Trouble Man does exhibit many of the qualities of movies within the blaxploitation genre at the time, funky music, dated fashions, sleazy characters, a whole lot of violence, etc., it is missing one, common element in that of female nekidness, but that didn't bother me as it made up for it in action, copious usage of profanity, and a whole lot of attitude.  Actually, while watching the movie, I got the impression the absence of nudity may have been deliberate, a conscious, respectful choice by the filmmakers not to mire themselves in the sleazier aspects of the genre, but rather focus on the strengths, those being strong characters, a solid story, and a good deal of action.  Hooks, not really a regular for these types of films, does very well, providing a tough, smart, infinitely cool no nonsense lead, one who uses his head, but isn't afraid to mix it up when he has to...I thought one scene particularly interesting when T set up a meeting between Big, Chalky, and Pete in the pool hall (neutral ground), and Big's men show up first to check things out.  Big's main thug, a large man named Preston, seemed fairly antagonistic on arrival, itching for a fight, but T manages to diffuse the situation, allowing for both men to save face, displaying a calm, cool, intelligent demeanor as T shows the other the lack of value in their getting into a brawl, which helped elevate Hooks' character beyond that of what one would normally expect from a movie like this...I'd credit this to solid writing, but probably more so to Hooks himself, who seemed like a exceptionally good actor, and one with a strong screen presence.  All in all I've seen better, more memorable blaxploitation films, but not a lot, as this is definitely above the average, and worthy of owning, especially if you're a fan of the genre.  The film, presented in both fullscreen (1.33:1) and widescreen anamorphic (1.85:1), looks beautiful, blowing away whatever bootleg or copied from TV version you may own (I'm unsure the film has ever seen an official home video release up until now).  The audio, presented in Dolby Digital stereo, comes through strong and clear.  There aren't really any extras except for an original theatrical trailer, and a few previews for other films including Man on Fire (2004), The French Connection (1971), and Sugar Hill (1994).

 I had no idea of the content of this book when I picked it up at a Used Book Store. In fact, I looked at it several times before starting to read and then had great difficulty putting it down. My own Mother died in an instant from a heart attack. I always felt cheated that I didn't get to say "Good-bye" but after reading this book, I know how fortunate we were not to go thru the heartbreak of an illness like this........so much pain and suffering, both physical and mental for the patient as well as the family.   I will now look for all of Quindlen's books hoping they are as interesting and completely "full of life" as this one 
 Nothing like this in the usual grocery stores. Splenda-sweetened to help keep the calories down. Great texture and just plain good!  I want to try the other flavors soon 
 I found this book to be a great resource. As a beginning runner, it had a lot of information on the science and practice of running, both how it relates to the body and mentally. I thought the sections on nutrition and for special populations (children, the elderly, those with disabilities) were interesting and have a wide range of appeal. If you want to buy one book on running, this is it 
 This is one of my favorite games, and though The bulk of the guide is unchanged, Prima did a great job with The Expanded Content. I would recommend this guide to both new and veteran players alike. 
 On the surface, this film blantantly demonstrates raw sexuality, but there is something much more to this story. The levels of intamcy between the characters is quite outstanding. The two main male characters start off as the closest of friends. I found it amazing that two young males could masturbate together, talking about women, turning each other on, so distant, yet so close. The main female character acts as a mentor two our young men. By the end of the film, you get the impression that the two main male characters could easily expand their relationship from friends to lovers. Each genuinely cares for the other. Also, you get a glimpse of life in another country, Mexico. This story is about growing up and in the process learning that something must be lost in order for growth to occur. Is it a loss of innocence? From my perspective, I use the following metaphor. It's as if these three characters are living in a darknened room and someone turns on a light. There is something sad in that experience. Knowing you are now more aware, but the truth is that you are free. This freedom only occurs once fear is shed, then anything is possible among the endless possiblities of existence. 
 Without question one of the greatest movies made by ' The Clan'. The story is very good covering the prohibition in America and the clash between two gangs. One headed by Robbo (Frank Sinatra), and the other by Guy (Peter Falk)- The difference between these two leaders is that one can sing and the other can't (have you heard Peter Falk sing ??? )The DVD covers additional material which is very interesting , The service from AMAZON . COM was as great as the movie. Defineatly for fans of Davis, Crosby, Martin and Ol' Blue Eyes... 
 How did he have the time to write such a picture, to co-direct it, to act in it and after everything else to write its score?  Noel Coward's energies, always remarkable, were redoubled during the second World War, and it must have seemed like another excuse to show off his patriotism, which he wore like a second skin despite his slummy upbringing.  IN WHICH WE SERVE is still worth watching, but it's nowhere as appealing as either CAVALCADE or THIS HAPPY BREED, and its focus on the "life and death of a ship" (the HMS Torrin) is strangely monomaniacal, almost constructivist.  Over and over you see unattributed bare arms hammmering away, symbols of brute strength like something from a Soviet film.  The ship goes up.  The ship goes down.  A new ship rises out of the water.  And in between Coward tries his hardest to keep you interested in the lives of the men clinging to the lifeboat, till our interest settles on three--Bernard Miles as Hardy, with his striking, long, hatchet face and the deep voice that goes with it--he should have played Ichabod Crane--John Mills as Blake, a tiny little pipsqueak who's feisty in the standard Mickey Rooney-Jimmy Cagney manner, and Noel Coward himself as Captain Kinross, tranquil with class privilege and, in the background, his glamorous marriage to the ineffable Celia Johnson (so beautiful till she opens her mouth and those bits of teeth wobble around on her gums).  Hitchcok's LIFEBOAT had the same concentration on a handful of downed and wet actors playing nautical, but without Coward's complicated flashback structure.  Coward stalwarts Joyce Carey and Kay Walsh show up as the love interests for Miles and Mills respectively--Carey, in this movie and in BRIEF ENCOUNTER as well, treated very unusually for the 1940s as a woman not in her first youth, nor good-looking in any way, who's given nevertheless a fullblooded and physical romantic interest.  She must have kissed the ground every time Noel Coward walked on it.  Who else would have written such roles for her?  The movie is trying indeed when it goes "serious," and yet that's half the fun of it, seeing how often Coward plays the "race" card--"we are an island race" indeed.  I teared up, of course I did, during the Blitz as the V-1 rockets drop bomb after bomb on London households, leading to the death of several favorite characters, and again when Coward leads his naval boys into Dunkirk and out of it again with a panoply of half-nude British soldiers sipping tea or what looks like an enormous vat of Kool-Aid.  Outside of these scenes, however, the movie is marred by its agitprop and by David Lean's tiresomeness, in showing everything at such a glacial pace.    PS, the film was shot by Ronald Neame who later became a director himself and whose "masterpiece," THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, sometimes seems like a shot by shot remake of the disaster sequences of IN WHICH WE SERVE 
 bird.  Because I am a bird person and don't want to miss anything, I subscribe to several periodicals about the subject of wild birds.  BIRDER'S WORLD strikes me, a mere layperson, as a somewhat more scientifically-based journal (though not off-putting) concerned with conservation.  For example, in the June 2005 issue includes articles discussing migration paths throughout North America as well as articles about observation in different ecological preserves are topics, as well as a lengthy article about "Big Day" activities when birders all over North America count birds in an annual inventory.  In the current issue, California species such as the Magpie and Scrub-Jay are the covered in an article about bird-watching locales on the West coast, as well as where to go in Texas to see the Golden-cheeked Warbler and the Black-capped Vireo. Next month, the focus may be bird sites in the East or Midwest.  Regular features include columns by Pete Dunne who is an officer in his local chapter of the Audubon Society as well as director of the Cape May Bird Observatory; Jill Graves, who is supervisor of avian research at Michigan's Rouge River Bird Observatory; and Eldon Greiji, emeritus professor of biology at Hope College in Holland Michigan. I especially enjoyed an article this issue on how to ID orioles, a famous bird in these parts by photographer Brian Small who apparently hails from the West Coast, but managed to find a number of our local visitors with his camera.   
 I am an avid reader of poetry: classical and modern, in English, in translation, in other languages, in collections and magazines, in any form I can find it. Without a doubt, this is one of the finest books of poetry I've ever read, maybe the finest. Each poem is lyrical and elegant - complete in its own right - but the collection also works as a whole. The poems are spare, and for the most part, sad, speaking to love and loss, life, letting go, and holding on. They are classical subjects of poetry, and they manage here, to be both intimate - a seemingly autobiographical look into the author's emotional life - and universal. And somehow, too, they manage to be timeless and vast in their appeal: accessible, I think, to a casual reader of poetry, and yet equally rich for a student of the traditional forms. I devoured this book, reading it in a single sitting lasting late into the night. And then the next day, when I awoke, I read it again. That was a month ago, but the images linger: life altering and life affirming, the essence of great poetry 
 I've been listening to Stephen Covey for years, and I think he's one of the wisest observers of the human spirit around.  While all of his programs are inspiring, Living the 7 Habits is probably the most moving - because it brings the 7 Habits to life, by showing how people have used them to change their lives for the better.  I was so moved hearing some of these stories, and even more moved when I realized that, thanks to Dr. Covey's wonderful guidance, I can bring the same wisdom and insight into my own life.   It's pretty clear that I was already familiar with the 7 Habits when I heard this, but you don't have to be - I recommend this as an excellent starting point for anybody who is encountering this way of living for the very first time, as well as for people like me who have heard and read a lot about it but can still use some help putting it to work on a day to day basis.  And what a generous program it is - nine compact discs long, but it doesn't even cost $30 ... even less with discounts 
 It doesn't get much better than this, great animation, all the elements needed to draw in a wide variety of people.  My absolute favorite anime. Just don't come looking for a plot 
 Very helpful read for anyone that has lost a child 
 The most comprehensive statement of what holistic medicine is about. This book is inspiring and daunting and intelligent. It gives us a way to see not only our healing process, and the role of healers, but of ourselves in society and time and space. I think it should be required reading for doctors, nurses, patients, alternative healers, psychiatric doctors and social workers. 
 This is a true picture book-as the pictures tell the story beyond the words.  The illustrations go the distance for story time reading, as well as working for up close inspection (be sure to look for that unconcerned  snail on every page!).  I just never tire of this book and its  illustrations, and I have been a fan of it for six years.  The illustration  of carp, tiger, and jungle folliage provide visual saturation satisfaction.  The simple repetitious rhymes are fun to say, they roll off the lips in a  way not always found in rhyming text, with wonderful repeating sounds. The  story message is sweet, loud and clear, yet subtle at the same time.  Thank  you for this gem, Mr. Baker 
 Blue Break Beats was compiled by Blue Note Records, giving any hip-hopper or R&B fan a crash course in songs where their favorite artist "got that beat from" (for example, many folks will recognize "It's Your Thing" as the "Punks Jump Up to Get Beat Down" groove by Brand Nubian). This volume has its standouts like "Dominoes" by Donald Byrd, "You've Made Me So Very Happy" by Lou Rawls, and a great rendition of "Light My Fire" by Shirley Bassey. But that song called, "Don't Call Me Nigger, Whitey", throws the album off course a little bit. Still get the album for the other songs, though, and once you listen to this volume, you're gonna want to get the other volumes, too 
 I purchased this movie for my 6 year old grandson.  This is a perfect age for this movie.  He has watched it over and over again.  It is not so simplistic that he gets bored and is very entertaining and funny. Parents can at least watch it once without getting bored.  I highly recommend it 
 As a quick response to offset all the bad reviews, I'd just like to say that I enjoyed it very much.  I didn't think the actors were bad at all.  Maybe it wasn't as good as the original, but what movie is?  If it's lacking in some things, it's not enough to ruin the entire film as many people seem to think.  Personally, I thought it was a cute and highly entertaining movie, and I'll stick with that opinion.  
 Not much can be added to what's already been said... fine action, engaging characters & storyline, intricate technical detail, not to mention witty and entertaining. Some of the passages on Hiro's academic research can become tedious, but that's really the only fault I could find with this novel, and it's a minor one. Read and enjoy 
 This book was assigned reading for an introductory hermeneutics class.  I found that the authors were able to strike a solid balance between readability and intellectual depth.  While I felt sufficiently challenged to think as I read the book, I never felt like they were talking above my ability to understand.  To their credit, Hays and Duvall selected their particular analogy to describe the process of interpreting the Bible, and they constantly referred back to that approach throughout the text.  Though somewhat repetitive, this writing style allowed their technique to really resonate with the reader.  By the end of the text, I certainly wasn't struggling to remember their approach to hermeneutics, as it had become clear to me.  Hays and Duvall write from an unashamedly evangelical perspective, and they are willing to suggest that the biblical texts do not and cannot mean whatever the reader wants them to mean.  Though more liberal interpretative approaches would be alarmed by the certainty of their proposition, I found it to be refreshing.  Without ever reaching a point of arrogance (a problem of which some evangelicals are rightfully accused), Duvall and Hays suggest that the human authors had a particular meaning intended when they wrote the Bible, and God has given us the necessary tools to get at that meaning.    The reason I'm only giving this book four stars is because many of my seminary classmates were less enthusiastic about it.  I have never read a hermeneutics book before, so I had no point of comparison.  However, many of my better informed classmates referred to other hermeneutics texts that they liked much better.  In any case, I found this book to be challenging and accessible.  I would recommend it for anyone interested in a thoughtful analysis of the process of interpreting the Bible. 
 The book allows creative influence to be shown without as many boundaries as in the usual coloring book. The images give an immediate interest to anyone who likes to color, and who wants to be able to show themselves creatively. Its great from front to back 
 I read his book cos I had to go to the conferences, it was a good preparation. Probably I will get something more out of it now as I have been to his conferences and got used to his language. I didn't read the second book Avalanche until after  his conference, I was very amazed much later there were a few events that were very similar in his book that I experienced myself.  The book doesn't tell you about him now, at the end, it was written very long ago. If anyone who has met Brugh, you will know he is a great master and it is his job to teach.  Brugh's conferences have great impacts on me and everyday, I thank god that I had the chance of meeting him. He has a lots of students that learn from him for 20 odd years, and believe me, they are great teachers themselves.   When you meet him, you will know what he really wrote and why. Don't judge a book by its cover and don't judge a person by his book. His book might not be the best, but he is definitely one of the great teachers. Probably he see himself as a media and guide than a guru. He opens the door for others' spiritual path and this book is a good start 
 This mouse is ergonomic, fast, and worth every penny! Not to mention it's color matches that of my laptop. GREAT BUY 
 This book was excellent and easy reading.  My 12 year old granddaughter, her mothe , my father and I read all of Dave Pelzer's series of 3 books.  We also read his brother's story 
 I first read this book about 40 years ago as a teenager and have never  forgotten it, indeed it lived up to my memories the second time around.  Beautifully written, a wonderful story and, who knows, perhaps it may even  be just a little bit true!! 
 I have to say, this is a great book. It really portrays Dalamar's story and struggle well. The only reason why this is not 5 stars, is because it takes a long time to really get into the story. The first half of the book is mostly pointless. If  you are a Dragonlance fan, get this book, if you havent read any or many Dragonlance books, don't get it 
 I found this book to be fantastic. Whether you are an experienced investigator of computer network security incidents (as I am for government/military/commercial organizations) or a neophyte just getting into the field of computer forensics, this book takes you through everything you need to know. The chapter on how the author handles an investigation in detail from start to finish is great. I'm applying what I learned there already. The coverage of forensic tools such as EnCase and tools from NTI is great. He gives me step by step information on how to use these tools, which I really need because you can't remember everything to do with all the tools I am involved with. The various reference sections on web sites, tool sites, attack signatures, etc. has been extremly useful for me and various organizations I work with. It's great to have the DOJ Search & Seizure Guidelines in the book. Sure, I can go out to the DOJ website and after some searching find them, but it is difficult to work through all the various links, I can't take notes there, make underlines, etc. It's really nice to have these and other guidelines in a handy written reference. This is one book that goes with me and my team members whenever we leave for a client site. It has just about everything we need for reference purposes. The author calls it a field guide and that is just what it is. I highly recommend this book. Very practical. I just hope the author is going to write another book...no doubt we will pick it up 
 This is a good read written by and about the life of one of  the truly great movie directors.  Along with Emeric Pressberger, Michael Powell created The Archers, whose movie productions were and are breathtaking in their daring cinematography and scoring. If you're not familiar with Powell's movies, you're in for a treat. I urge you to design your own Michael Powell film festival:  Be sure to include The Thief of Baghdad, Stairway to Heaven (A Matter of Life and Death in Britain), The Red Shoes, Black Narcissus, The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp and my personal favorite, I Know Where I'm Going. These are stunning works of art.  Consider that they were filmed in cash-strapped postwar England, and you come away all the more amazed.  Powell lost his career when he filmed Peeping Tom, a Hitchcockian thriller that upset critics with its psychosexual theme; his reputation was only rehabilitated by the intercession of such luminaries as Michael Scorcese during the 1980s. Powell lived a brash, full and vigorous life spiced with affairs with the likes of Deborah Kerr and the fascinating Pamela Brown.  He dared the new, often endured hardship and even danger to catch what he wanted on film. He envisioned original and groundbreaking ideas, and then assembled teams that made them happen:  A Himalayan garden in Kent for Black Narcissus, awesome outer space animation and the world's largest staircase for Stairway to Heaven, shooting I Know Where I'm Going without the leading man ever being on location.      This book has been out of print for some time in hardcover.  I've seen copies selling for hundreds of dollars.  There is a  reason!  Now is your chance to enjoy the best words there are about Michael Powell--his own 
 Paymar's book is pretty much the definitive handbook for video poker play today.  He discusses every factor involved in beating theoretically beatable games, and at least stretching your dollars and getting the most out of your play in the rest.    Dan disects each of the most popular games in detail, as well as multiple variations of each, and some of the older machines you might still run across.  Each is subjected to computer payback and play analysis, and this runs to quite some length (and strictly speaking is not necessary reading).  He streamlines all of this information into shorter hand flowcharts on how to play each hand to maximum potential, something which comes as quite a relief after going through his exhaustive and detailed optimum play discussion.  Further, he delves into just what the stats mean.  If a game is technically beatable over the long run, what does that tell the player?  Well, it means frankly a full-time career of playing video poker, all day every day for months, at almost unbelieveable speed and rapidity and of course with perfect unerring accuracy.  It is not easy or simple, and I can't even imagine that it would be fun.  Moreover, one's potential edge in even the very best game, with the best payback, is so microscopic, that the fluctuations in the player's bankroll, even with only slight statistical blips, are huge.  Don't even think of playing full time at a quarter machine with less than $50,000 to start.  His advice in this area is depressing but honest and frankly about the most important stuff in the book.  If the only thing this book does is to show the reader how to shop for a 'good' game and refuse to play short-pay ripoff games, it will be well worth the money.  If your play improves as well, that's a bonus.  Regular video poker players will benefit by reading this book 
 This is a singular masterpiece in film making but totally unlike anything, even for it's day.  By today's attention deficit disorder standards, this film is really really odd.  But no doubt it is a masterpiece if the viewer is willing to put the effort in to catch all the nuances because this is a film of nothing but nuances.  Tati himself is just one of many participants.    There is a plot of sorts dealing with a group of female American tourists and the one women who is the odd duck among them.  She meets Tati and they spend the night together dancing at a night club and see in the dawn at a coffee shop.  Various bits of business are constantly swirling around them and you could view this picture 10 times before seeing everything.  There are many jokes but they are gentle visual puns.  Don't expect belly laughs, just a wry but amazing view on modern life.  As is standard practice for Criterian these days the extras on disc two are spectacular.  The documentaries on Tati's life and this film are brilliant and helped me understand his art and this film much better.  A gentle film with brilliant use of wide screen (this film would make no sense pan and scan) you need to fall into the picture to enjoy it.  But there is an endless wealth of material to enjoy 
 After four years of recording for RCA, Esquivel's popularity was still high, and yet, his contract was not renewed. So, he signed on to the Sinatra owned label, Reprise. This album has many cuts that have been used on commercials, news specials and television shows. His arrangement of "I Get A Kick Out Of You" is so original, that you'll be playing it over and over again and attempt to analyze his method of orchestration. The only other piano version that can top Esquivel in this song is Nat King Cole. Cole's version is available on the album "The Piano Style of Nat King Cole." Another great album, worthy of owning. Although the playing time on this album is short, every tune is a model of unique arranging and stunning orchestral arranging. If you are new to Esquivel, this is a great album in which to get started This one is intended as a sequel to his RCA release, Other Worlds, Other Sounds, but the fact that is not as eccentric as some of his other releases, make this an easy album to new comers to the great Esquivel. A great album 
 This book is great for anyone who loves to take their dog with them.  It gives you insight into what your dog is thinking while you're packing for vacation, lounging on the beach, etc.  Once again, beautiful illustrations 
 Wizard and Glass has to be the most memorable books in the series which introduces you to Roland's youth and what launches him on his quest for the Dark tower and the man in black. King will introduce you to a few new words and way of speaking. I caught myself using his high speak a couple times during this read, as I'm sure you will as well.  King's Story of a world that has "Moved On" is extremely entertaining. A Post apocalyptic lovers Dream Book! Set in the far off future ware were not shooting at each other with Laser beams but Hard Caliber 6 shooters. Roland is a Gun Slinger, a Law Giver on a quest to find the Dark Tower, a nexus point that holds millions of time lines and worlds in check. Roland's quest will sling shot him back and forth between the present, future, and Past. All of Kings Books tie into this Dark Tower in some way or another. When you finish the Story, your going to want to re-read the Dark Tower series Again, & Again to catch the subtle nuances that tie everything together 
 When I began reading this book, I simply could not put it down, and I ended up staying awake all night reading. Quite simply, it is riveting. A seriously ill woman with no interest whatsoever in occult or religious matters is put under hypnosis by a neighbor, in an effort to relieve some of her pain. Surprisingly, while she is under, her "guide" reveals himself, and begins a highly philosophical dialogue. It seems the woman, unbeknownst to her or anyone else, is an excellent channel of those from the other side. An informal group gathers around her, and in time they each meet their guides through her, who all seem to know extraordinarily personal information about those gathered. A rapport quickly develops between the guides and the members of the group, and the guides regale the members with accounts of former lives spent together, the nature of earthly existence, the karmic ties being played out among the members, etc. Sometimes the guides give information on the guides' own most recent past lives. The information is highly detailed, including place-names, names of people, specific landmarks in obscure places and times, etc.   Joe Fisher, one of the group members and the author of this book, wants desperately to have some sort of tangible and objective proof that the information coming from the guides is verifiable and factual. His quest takes him around the world, and into the realm of a kind of ghostly smoke and mirrors, where, in every case, the evidence is highly compelling and accurate...and yet genuine confirmation is *just* beyond Fisher's grasp. His journey also takes him into the realm of other channels, and their specific entities, some quite well-known. What he finds is mind-boggling and, quite frankly, some of the most fascinating information I've ever read.  The implications of the author's discoveries are far-reaching, regarding the reality of earthbound souls, the true nature of ALL channeled entities (despite the entities' own self-proclaimed origins--e.g. "I come to you from the causal plane of existence,"...etc.), the smokescreens that channeled entities use and the reasons behind it. If you are at all interested in "A Course in Miracles," the Abraham books, the Seth books, the Michael books, Ramtha, etc., I strongly advise you to read Joe Fisher's "The Siren Call of Hungry Ghosts" first. As other reviewers have noted (accurately, in my opinion), this book truly is one of the most important books on the subject of New Age phenomena; it is a pivotal and important work and I can't recommend it highly enough 
 This book is incredible.  I've read it twice and ready to read it again 
 There are many practical ideas in this book that I am still using five years later.  I find many of these ideas to be curiously lacking elsewhere in western society.  A few of the key concepts seemed obvious to me once I had pondered them, and I have given it some thought over these last many years.  This book may not be for everyone, but if you are looking for some ideas on how to make positive life changes, then this book may have some ideas that will help or even inspire you.  It was quite easy to read.  Don't expect recipes for great sex, although it does include some.  This book is more about developing a healthy, nurturing relationship.  You will need to do some work to incorporate the ideas from the book with your daily life, but if you are willing to put in a little effort and have a little patience, you can get good results.  This book only teaches a small portion of what Tantra is, and the Muir's explain that in the book.  If you are looking for more purist information on Tantra you can google for references.  You can also google for the Muir's web site 
 I always look for new presentations of Christmas songs.  Rene Flemming did an excellent job in this recording. She has a super voice but sometimes the words of the song get lost in her singing styl 
 Fantastic. He is a big reason King's X is such a great band. This album rocks form start to finish 
      Following up on 'Jesus Freak', the colossal album that changed DC Talk from just a rap group into one of the most important artists in Christian Music, could not be an easy task.  But listening to 'Supernatural' makes it sound like it was the easiest thing in the world to put out another great CD. This release is ALMOST as good as 'Freak' (and in some ways it even surpasses it).  Almost every song on this CD is top-notch - from rockers like 'Since I met You', 'Dive' and the title track to lovely ballads like 'Red Letters' (perhaps their finest song to date).  The band morphs from one style to another througout the set, bouncing between fun and purpose freely, sometimes within the same song.  'My Friend' is a good example of that, with fun creative wordplay that betrays the dramatic story beneath it.    The major shortcoming that I hear is that this ablum doesn't sound as fresh as 'Freak' did.  One case in point is 'Godsend', a fairly mellow piece that is not without merit, but somehow it comes off as a second-rate clone of 'Just Between You and Me'.  And "It's Killing Me" could have been more powerful, but it sounds like they are trying too hard to restrain themselves (at least until the endo of the song).    But those are small potatoes.  Overall, this is a fine CD that can brighten any collection.  It is a pity that their solo careers have put the group on the back burner.  In my book, DC Talk is greater than the sum of its' parts.                   
 This was the finale to the Graves area and overall is a fitting goodbye. "Dead Kings Rise" is one of their best songs ever and why it wasn't issued on an album is a completely beyond me,it grabs you with it's skeletal hands around your neck and refuses to let go for  the duration of the song. The "Mars Attacks" demo is a bit more punkier than the"American Psycho" version and you can easily imagine the Ramones in the studio background drinking a few beers whilst"I wanna be a NY Ranger" was being recorded,it has a stamp of New York punk rock authenticity all over it. "Monster Mash" was destined to be recorded by the Misfits and illustrates how the band had a great sense of humour about things as opposed to a lot of Black/Death metal types who take themselves very,very seriously indeed. "One Million Years B.C." baffles me because like "Dead Kings Rise" it's another awesomely powerful piece of music that really packed a punch and showed The Misfits were very much back from the dead. Why neither of these tracks went straight onto the "Famous Monsters" album will confuse me untill my dying day or at least untill I meet either Jerry or Doyle or Graves. When we come to "No More Moments" this is the reason why I gave it four stars and not five also intially I wasn't that bothered about "Devil Doll" ," Fiend without a Face" and "Bruiser" but I have to admit that over time(and with a significant lack of any new Misfits material emerging from Misfits records) these songs have grown on me. We read in the CD booklet how Graves had been listening to a lot of Jim Morrison at the time of recording"No More Moments" and it shows thankfully there were no more moments like that!!. Was that the direction Graves was going to take the Misfits in for a third studio album? we'll never know although in a final irony the last track is Black Flag's "Rise Above" an absouletly awesome punk anthem that any old punkers like myself will feel a rush of adrenaline when you hear the opening chords. Whilst "No More Moments" was the funeral march of the Graves era of the band with Dez and Robo in the band and rumours of a new studio album (unfortunatly Jerry is notorious for mentioning ideas that never seem to happen or take a considerable amount of time before they do) full time now "Rise Above" may very well be a glimpse of the future Let's keep our fingers crossed 
 In this book, Roddy Doyle creates a character who is just like anyone you'd meet on the street.  Through her eyes, we the readers see hope, heartache, pain, and lost dreams as well as a look at greater social ills.  This is an excellent book for bibliotherapy or anyone who enjoys a good story from a master storyteller 
 I read this before Mr. Greene became 'big.'  The man offers some great insights into the way peope think and can be manipulated.  I'm hoping only merciful people will purchase this because this book could definitely be used against humanity by the forces of darkness 
   I highly recommend reading to your child from one of his books. All books of his I have found very inspirational and my daughter loves reading and listening to his stories. Some bring tears to your eyes and joy to your heart. Very positive reactions in my home to this book. Enjoy his stories along with your child. 
 At first, I found this book to be difficult to digest because it appeared to be heading in a direction that was in sacrilegious conflict with my beliefs as a Christian and a catechist in the Catholic Church. Yet a part of me was also highly fascinated and captivated by the story, especially since I work as a mental health professional. As I keep reading, I discovered that it wasn't sacrilegious at all but rather a story of general faith and hope, of the extent a mother would go through to protect her child, and of the intrusive nature of the media. I particularly liked the strength Mariah showed during this conflict, despite her past history of nervous breakdown. And I like the way the character of Ian evolved from a sleazy teleaetheist to a caring and more moral man. The secondary characters were all wonderful, in particular Mariah's mother and the lawyers on both side. I thought the trial was once of the most interesting parts of the story.   As with all Picoult books, this was a deep and heavy novel which wasn't easily breezed through, but it was definitely a compelling and awesome book to read!  
 This is the first entry in the Joe Leaphorn Novels by Tony Hillerman.  I prefer to start series at the beginning, however, I started this series with the Sinister Pig.  That book was very enjoyable, so I started at the beginning with this novel, The Blessing Way.    First things first.  This novel is not great based on the mystery plot at its center.  What gives this novel its "great" status is the way in which it introduces the uninitiated to the Navajo Way.  This book made for a very enjoyable read.  Although it certainly lacked the complexity of a John Dunning novel, or the eloquence of an Elizabeth George novel, it did stand out on its very own merits.  Hillerman does an excellent job of describing the dry and arid landscape.  He paints an excellent picture.  I was also impressed with the tension in one of the chapters in which the suspense was riveted up a couple of notches.  This book was a great first in this series.  I look forward to the rest.  
 I was at first apprehensive about buying this book.  After all, what would the Gallup Poll know about teaching?  Well, it turns out that they know a lot.  Being a "highly qualified teacher", i.e. having a license to teach a subject is not enough these days.  Good teachers must also be able to "connect" to students.  The authors are realistic and their findings are extremely helpful.  For example, working on ones weaknesses won't work.  If you are an introvert, taking classes in public speaking won't help that much; it certainly won't make you an extrovert.  This book is an excellent read for anyone who works with or is interested in working with students 
 This is a book everyone interested in the stock market needs to read in order to understand and utilize a top down approach to market analysis.  Excellent charts and superb explanations 
 I now realise that I had never really understood the Five Books of Moses before I read this superb translation. It is written in easy to understand, modern English but unlike say the "Good News" version it brings out the full meaning without oversimplification. Many Christians devalue the Old Testament and imagine that only the New Testament is worth studying.  However, to those who think that the Laws of Moses are archaic and outmoded, or who imagine that "Love your neighbour as yourself" is solely a New Testament idea, I say read this and be amazed. The Old Testament God is as close to us and full of love for us as Jesus 
 Alice Laxton's life starts to unravel in her senior year of college, and she soon begins a descent into the black hole of mental illness --- a world in which she hears voices and imagines bizarre incidents. Convinced by her legalistic church that her daughter is demon-possessed, Alice's mother relies on their pastor to heal Alice. When that fails, Alice ends up in an institution, escapes, and takes to the streets.  Through a couple of homeless gay guys, Tweedle Dweeb and Tweedle Dumb, Alice meets a semi-eccentric woman named Faye, a "cat lady" who has agreed to help nurse her newfound pet, Cheshire, back to health. But she proves to be much more than a healer of felines --- she becomes the means by which Alice has the greatest hope of finding her own healing.  Yes, the Alice in Wonderland references are intentional, and Melody Carlson handles them skillfully. Even more impressive is her deft handling of Alice's mental state ---her vacillation between lucidity and paranoia, her resistance to medication and other forms of treatment, her brilliant insights and delusional "knowledge." Everything rings true here; Carlson's peek into the mind of a schizophrenic is eminently believable. Christians who have suffered from mental illness, or whose loved ones have, will find much here that resonates with their own experiences.  With this book, Carlson has established herself as an author with genuine crossover potential. Her characters come across as living, breathing people --- quite an achievement in any genre. Alice is an intelligent but otherwise fairly ordinary person, so unlike the typical female protagonists (you know the kind --- beautiful, headstrong young women with emerald-green eyes) who populate many CBA novels. As the most fully developed example of authentic Christlikeness in the book, Faye is wonderfully different from the cardboard Christian role models you see in both fiction and nonfiction. Simon, Faye's nephew, is neither ruggedly handsome nor strong and silent --- he's just a guy, a caring and giving guy, but a guy nonetheless. And that makes him all the more appealing. Like Anne Tyler, Carlson knows that ordinary people become extraordinary when you take the time to examine their lives.  FINDING ALICE is a truly remarkable book for a CBA publisher. WaterBrook deserves a great deal of credit for publishing it. Carlson, with 90 books and numerous awards to her credit, could easily have bailed on the CBA had she not found a willing Christian publisher.  I could quibble about a few details, and in fact will. Quibble number one: When Alice gets high for the first time and is found out by her mother and some finger-pointing church ladies, she suddenly finds the inner resolve to stand up to them. Now, I'm not saying where I got this insight from, but as I understand it, grass doesn't exactly make a person assertive --- goofily defiant maybe, but not imbued with steely determination like Alice is. Number two: The key to understanding the "golden key" that Alice believes God has set before her becomes obvious too soon, in a scene in which she has been invited to help decorate for a Christmas party. Number three: Toward the end, starting with a chapter titled "Waking," there's a subtle shift in the way Carlson tells the story that causes it to lose some of its immediacy.  Number four is a bit more than a quibble for me, but I suspect it won't be a problem for many, if not most, readers. It's the way one storyline ends. The problem --- and I can't be more specific here --- arises in the last three pages, in which something predictable happens despite all indications to the contrary and Carlson's efforts to make the reader think it can't happen. But I could feel it coming and I was hoping it wouldn't. It tied up one sub-story a bit too neatly, which was disappointing, though I do think many readers will love it. And to Carlson's credit, she did leave a few ends dangling, most notably Alice's complicated relationship with her mother.  The bottom line is that FINDING ALICE is one of those rare finds in the Christian market, a novel that is satisfying on so many levels. To name a few, there's authenticity, plotline, characterization and --- the trickiest element of all, it seems, for most CBA authors --- dialogue. Highly recommended 
 Check out some other persons review on here-it doesn't make any scense!!! HIS Barbies!!! OHHHHHHHHHHHH....K??????????????? THEN?????????????? 
 The roots of game theory in biology go back several decades.  Roger Fisher's studies in the 1930s are generally credited with initiating the concept.  Later, Robert Axelrod and others expanded the idea with structured game applications.  The most famous of these is the Prisoner's Dilemma, where two charged thieves are offered "deals" by authorities.  Prisoner's Dilemma is easily played by any two people with a moderator.  The point of the game is to reconcile the issues of "defection" and "cooperation" with various "payoffs".  As Barash shows, the game is played often, usually unconsciously, by many people under varying conditions.  It is an underlying theme in many international situations.  Barash here introduces us to the basics of game theory, with many illustrative examples in human and other animal behaviour.  From simple game propositions, Barash goes on to explain the many variations and how to assess them.  Instead of mathematical equations, which he eschews in the opening chapter, Barash provides matrix box sets with players, options and outcome results for each game set.  He then explains the logic of strategy variations for a single game encounter.  He points out that single encounters may neither validate the game nor the strategy applied.  The most famous variation of Prisoner's Dilemma is called Tit-for-Tat.  This game's bizarre history is recounted well - it was twice chosen the best option in a contest for "best strategy".  In this game, a form of Prisoner's Dilemma is played repeatedly - with the caveat that whatever your opponent does, you must respond in kind.  The game's simple rule shattered many myths about the foundations of human behaviour.  Genes may be selfish, but humans are not.  Cooperation has its own payoffs.  Once applied only to humanity, game theory has found many examples throughout Nature, and not just animals.  Since part of game theory deals with resource use, even forest trees can be shown to apply it to growth patterns.  Jungle frogs, in their competitive mating strategies make decisions explainable by Barash's matrix diagrams.  How far, then, can its usefulness extend.  As game theory has been demonstrated to have nearly universal meaning, critics have raised objections.  Americans, as Barash carefully notes, find it objectionable on the grounds it shatters their myth of "rugged individualism" - the notion that success comes to whoever goes out and grabs it by the scruff of the neck, ignoring objections of others.  Others have decried attempts to apply it to every human circumstance.  Barash dismisses this critique as overstated.  Game theory isn't a universal "theory of everything" - a quest physicists have vainly sought for years.  On the other hand, America, as with every society, must play the Social Dilemma Game - Personal Gain versus the Public Good.  Barash's examples are mixed biology, diplomacy, domestic politics and personal encounters.  Although he regrets the little attention paid to game theory by the general public, he ably demonstrates why this book should redress that situation.  Game theory is not a game - it's real life.  This author's perceptive observations and excellent presentation make this work a compelling read.  It's a fine item to have at hand when watching debates, hearing of a new cockpit of potential international conflict or even negotiations between businesses or employment contracts.  A valuable resource.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada 
 This is a must-have DVD, not only for wrasslin' fans, but for all of mankind. You will learn the ways of the WARRIOR and hopefully learn something about yourself as well. 
 This book is jam packed with advice on every page.  The inspirational stories give insight on "how it is done" as well as showcase highly successful women entrepreneurs; the tool kit provides a useful blueprint to follow right down to sample legal forms; and the down to earth style makes it easy for women just starting a business to easily follow along.  That is not to say seasoned women business owners will not benefit from reading the book to take their business to the next level with the "how to's" spelled out for you 
 I remember this movie from my childhood.  I remember seeing in theaters when it was first released back in 1977 and I remember it being a huge hit.  Now I'd like to purchase it on DVD but I kind of hesitate to, because I haven't heard many good things about the quality of this DVD issue, not the film, the DVD.  After seeing some screenshots online I am shocked to find the film deteriorating far beyond it's original brilliance, I remember it being sharp, bright and colorful.  After having seen Robin Hood four years before, the animation used in The Rescuers looked so refreshing and lively and above all, well-done.  However, it seems that lines have thickened, colors have faded and the entire print has become subject of artifacts and scratches.  Shameful.  It seems so unfair that up to this day, films that are even less than [...]are getting massive restoration undergoings while other, older movies are left to rot to this kind of state. Disney, is it so much to ask that you should treat all your timeless classics equaly?  They all deserve it.  Yes, all, even The Black Cauldron, Oliver & Company or One Hundred and One Dalmatians.  Well, that's all I'd like to say for this film.  I will not have to think twice about purchasing it as soon as the DVD release is what it trully should be 
  Jean Campbell, who I know as a pioneer of dreamwork and peace, surprising us once more with her endless gifts. You will see this book is not only a research or history of group dreaming but she wrote it as a novel, in literary style. Not only teaching but also exciting, enthusiastic and tastefull. I think, the most important thing she shows us in the last part of this book is; opening a new horizon on how group dreaming can be used for serving humanity, children, world peace and harmony. How we can dream for peace together, become groups of peace dreamers and make our dreams come true in waking reality. How we can go to dream, we can interpeate in connection, we can build projects on our dream wisdoms and than we can touch the souls and wounds of others so far from us. And thanks to her, we are reading all these as living a fairy tale which brings magic on earth 
 this shaver performs extremely well. shaves as close as a razor, and a full charge lasts an entire month, longer if you dont shave every day. the instructions are absolutely correct, it takes a few weeks to get used to it, so dont be too put off if your first couple shaves are uncomfortable. if you have more sensitive skin, i would stongly recommend using minimal pressure at first, even if that means not getting the closest shave. once your skin adjusts, you can still get shaver burn if you press too hard, especially on the neck, so resist any urge to grind the shaver into your beard.  despite providing an incredibly close shave, it sometimes fails to grab every hair on the first couple passes and its a little tricky maneuvering around a strong adams apple. after taking those shortcomings into account, its still superior in every way to the other shavers ive used: a top model braun foil shaver, and a couple cheaper norelco models. while that doesnt qualify me as an authority on shavers, i can appreciate when a product basically lives up to expectations. even though the 9160 isnt quite perfect, it comes through with a reasonably fast, close and comfortable shave. here are a few tips that should help, especially when starting out:  1) shave BEFORE you shower. the shaver works better with a stiffer beard and your face will be less sensitive. 2) shave every day if you can.  the longer your beard, the more hair gets missed. 3) if any hairs do get missed after a couple passes, leave them. its not worth getting every hair in exchange for shaver burn. as you get more experienced with the shaver, youll get better at using it. touch up rogue whiskers with the sideburn trimmer. 4) this shaver has trouble with longer hairs that lie flat.  if you spot any after your first pass, use the sideburn trimmer to shorten them before touching up with the rotary blades. if youve already made a couple passes before you notice them, refer back to tip #3. 5) keep the tension setting on normal.  if you set it to sensitive, you just have to press harder and make more passes to get a good shave. 6) if you still have trouble with shaver burn, use a little apple cider vinegar as an aftershave. yes, it will feel like your face is being ripped off for a couple seconds. if youre not a fan of that sensation, you may dilute it. let it dry completely, then rinse it off. its the best solution ive tried for minimizing razor bumps, and ive tried them all 
 I just got this anime at a store today. Its a really hard to story to follow. It strongley suggests 17+ due to some weird scenes. It has 3episodes on DVD 
 Young children are fascinated by this product. An enormously great improvement over the similar product I used as a child 60 years ago. This item has stencils, a small car to make tracks, and is easily erased 
 There's so much to preview in this show, that to share it all would take a couple of pages.  However, the highlights are the music, the singers, and "The Dance."    Flatley is INCREDIBLE, and the show flows like a river (pardon the pun).  It is superbly choreographed and executed, and it goes from the serene to the sensational in a split second.  The orchestrations are touching and the Irish/Celtic music is haunting, as are the costumes.  This is theatre at its very best, and it is highly recommended.  I'd give it 20 stars if I could!! 
 An exploration of the seething and confused messianic expectations of the first century - and why John found these so significant and so important for any understanding of human life in the world. Dr. John Painter studies the character and history of Johannine Christianity, the process fo the composition of the Gospel and its relation to 1 John, the purpose of the Gospel, and all its major themes and issues. The study explores the genre of quest stories and draws attention to the concentration of such stores and the theme of quest in John's writings. There is also discussion of the relations of quest stories to rejection stories, and development of Johannine christology. John Painter brings to light the evangelist's identification of the Quest for the Messiah with the guest for life - how John universalizes the quest and gives it positive value, and how he brings it into relationship with his christological views. 
 Since the Phileas came out a number of years ago, I've had 4 of them (3 fountain and 1 roller ball). These fountain pens have never let me down and have always been sound in quality. The first was the original red and blue series, the others were later blue and green marble models. They look nice and write very well. Many fountain pen users regard the Phileas series as the best place to start with fountain pens, and I agree with that. They're easy to clean, easy to use, and mine have always been ready to write for me. I whole heartedly suggest this pen as a fine addition to any pen collection, as well as for a nice fountain pen to use on a daily basis 
 John Beckett has the feel of an average guy that stepped in to help with the family business and has walked out with so much more.  Loving Monday reflects his humility and dependence on his faith as the ante was upped.  The small family business grew into a Fortune 500 company, yet Mr. Beckett's faith allows him to turn his company into a blessing to its workers and community.  Loving Monday is the account of this success peppered with wisdom from and for the journey.  John Beckett addresses some of the hindrances of western culture in seeing business as a calling.  He uses these insights to apply them to the 'called' businessperson, thus empowering them to press forward with  full confidence in the One who called them.  Loving Monday sets itself apart from others in John Beckett's real life proof that standing firm and resisting pressure to succumb to the status quo of the business world pays with rewarding dividends:  he and his employees are "loving Monday!"  
 Okay, maybe the last one isn't really European, but you get the point.  I watched this over the weekend, on a rental from everyone's favorite Blockbuster Video!  I loved this movie!  It took us where Roadtrip wishes it could have taken us!  I really liked the "scenery" along the way.  I didn't rent this movie for the longest time, as the cover showed some goofball white dude pointing his fingers in a funny way with this goofy smile (he almost looked mentally handicapped) and it just looked so "dumb." Honestly.  But the cover of the unrated version, shows the young female actress removing her bikini top, and it looks damn hot!  Also, the unrated version has a ton more sexy scenes, including lots of nudity.  I also believe this is the first DVD I've rented that gave an index of the nude scenes, as well as an index for the additional "unrated" scenes.  Now that''s hot!    The movie was very funny, and put together well.  I felt like they were actually in Europe, and when you watch some of the special features, you learn that they actually were.  I felt like hit every country they said they were in, but something tells me it was only 1 or 2, and they used stage sets.  But, the scenes were all realistic looking.  I especially noticed this at the Vatican.  That was damn funny!   Some other reviewers are comparing this to other American clowning movies, but I didn't see it that way.  I saw it as us making fun of their stereotypes.  I mean how could you have a sex comedy in Europe, and not have a Berlin or Netherlands comedy scene.  And that scene where the Italian businessman keeps molesting the tourists?  I have a roommate that said an Italian man kept chasing her and molesting her on a city bus, so yes, stereotypes are based on some aspects of reality.  Get over your PC correctness?  Okay?  It's funny, because its partially true!  I stop short of giving this five stars, but I will give it this rating:  DVD movie alone: 4 stars DVD Movie and special features: 5 stars  MC White said: CHECK IT OUT!! 
  James Baldwin's stories are more like poetry, describing painful circumstances as dreamy metaphors. I felt myself pulled away from the story a few times to ponder what Baldwin is expressing through this story, for example he writes something about not choosing your friends or who you love, just as you don't get to choose your parents. He forces you to stand in the shoes of each character, feeling as though you were naked, because the message, for me at least, is clear. If people would allow themselves to feel total honesty with themselves, then perhaps the way they are choosing to live their lives would be completely, way over on the opposite end of the spectrum then what is actually real. No sexual orrient, race, religion. Just looking inside yourself and saying "yes". And if you think I'm just getting to romantic over a story, still read this book. James Baldwin is a master at story telling. Even if you don't feel as I do about this book, I'm sure you'll feel something. It is, for me, one of those stories you thin kabout long after you've read it. 
 I am a Johnny Cash fan from the very first time I heard RING OF FIRE played on a juke box.  I have looked over and listened to the samples on this recording and all I have to say is WOW!!!! GREAT, GRAND, GLORIOUS.  I've Gotta Have THIS CD also.  I also have his other CDs.  Love them all 
 This movie was perfect in every way,and the trees and the berries,and the candy were great looking.  Hansel and Gretel are amazing actors!  I own this on DVD,I am going to order it on video too!  But I wonder why there is no cover for the video?  But anyway,this is a great movie 
 I use the Delorme Gazetteers, including this one, for planning my fishing trips every year.  They include comprehensive coverage of the state in question with sufficient detail to identify all the major topological features one will find, including streams and lakes.  Also, they show all the roads.  One criticism is that they don't contain road mileages between locations, unlike a highway atlas.  But, a highway atlas will not show topographic coutour lines, or indicate locations where one may launch kayaks or rafts, or show locations reputed to have good fishing.  I keep a Delorme Gazetteer for each state in which I expect to travel on any extended drive.  They enable me to find campgrounds (in the indexes and shown on the maps), roads, topography, and all the essentials to plan a trip 
  Charles Francis Adams is best remembered as the ambassador to England during the Civil War who helped keep England (and France) from recognizing the Confederacy. His father was John Quincy Adams. He was a Boston Whig very much opposed to slavery, though like Lincoln, he was willing to concede smaller issues to protect the larger ones (mainly the spread of slavery to incoming states). Adams was an austere man; it was said that when he entered a stuffy room, the temperature dropped 10 degrees. The most interesting events dealt with in this biography, written by his son, include:       the 1848 Presidential election, where Adams had presided over the Buffalo Convention which formed the Free Soil Party and saw the nomination of Martin Van Buren as President and himself as Vice-President;       the war with Mexico, a war Adams thought unjust and only an excuse for slave states to gain new territory;       the Trent Affair in 1861, when two Confederate commissioners were arrested aboard the "Trent" on their way to England, which almost caused war with that country; and      the launching of the "Alabama" in Liverpool, a British privateer that Adams tried but failed to prevent from sailing, and then held the British government responsible for for the destruction of American property caused by the ship.  Adams, Jr., tells his father's story in a robust, very readable style. It's informative and authoritative, and even after 100 years has the feel of definitiveness about it. Highly recommended.  
 As an avid reader of the series I have been waiting impatiently for this book for a long time...I am glad to say that it did not disappoint in any way. It is highly recommended...just make sure that you have a good two weeks to devote to it 
 Let me state up front, that I have yet to see the movie.  I bought the soundtrack based upon the soundclips.  I have really enjoyed this one.  There was one song that could have been inserted onto the Chronicles of Narnia cd and no one would have thought it out of place.    Another song, Wall Breached, that could have been expounded on, but feels short.  I am sure that this is because of the action of the movie, but I still wish that it would have been developed into something bigger.  Overall though, I am very pleased with the cd 
 the misfits is well written, witty, and guarenteed to induce thought even if your brain is fried. four unpopular kids-a tall skinny girl who doesn't know when to shut up, a fat kid living in a trailer, a gay guy with little faces painted on his fingernails, and a greaser who looks like something out of the outsiders or west side story-create their own party in the class election. Their point in the end is to stop the name calling, which does happen. some innaccuracies: 1) kids in middle school aren't that mean. 2) its unrealistic to think that four geeky seventh graders are going to get boyfriends or girlfriends, especially with popular people. 3) the ending-something out of a teen movie. still, read it. 
 I gave my daughter this 2 disc edition for Christmas and now have gotten to see the extras that are included on the second disc. The movie itself looks great with what I think are improvements to the stage production (switching Cool and Gee Officer Krupke; Swapping America & Tonight; Adding the boys to America) but I wish they had not omitted the ballet sequence.  Get the cast recording with Carol Lawrence and Larry Kert to hear how great the ballet sequence sounds.    This is a musical that deserves to be seen on a big screen (or at least a big screen tv with a killer sound system) to be appreciated for the wonderful score.  Everything that could be said about the songs Bernstein and Sondheim wrote has been said so I can't add anything there.  Forget the idea of Natalie Wood playing a Puerto Rican and enjoy a great movie.  And see the stage production if it ever comes to your town 
 I just love beautiful love stories. A lot of the reviews say that this is "unsentimental," and I think what they mean is that it isn't maudlin. It's a book full of sentiment and emotion. It's also a nice read, and I enjoy books that have a great love story in them.   My book club enjoyed this one but, while we found some things to talk about, we all just kind of agreed on it and nodded a lot. Certainly nothing controversial that will keep your book club up at night. 
 It's a page turner -- a fun vacation read!  The scenes are vivid and the characters memorable -- our hero Michael Seeley gets thrown into a web of Hollywood secrets that keep us guessing.  I'm looking forward to Seeley's next case! 
 after the plea for peae/take action cd before this one did so well they decided they could make a 2-disc for the next one..and they did. however, the content is not as great as the first one. no more alkaline trio, hot water music, thrice, AFI, thursday, at the drive-in, boy sets fire, good riddance, strike anywhere, or international noise conspiracy. however, the double disc still is packed with anti-flag, common rider, lawrence arms, finch(i really don't like them),  poison the well, taking back sunday, movielife, digger, and piebald. but compare the two lists. so if you like this CD definately get the other one too 
 If you're looking for a lot of fluff, this book is not for you.  But if you're genuinely wanting to become a disciplined person, physically and spiritually, you will find the tools for becoming so in PrayerWalk.  The author doesn't promise you it will be easy-nothing worth having ever is.  However, whether or not you intend to become a walker, you can benefit greatly from this book.  The prayer helps and ideas offered are invaluable.  Janet McHenry shows you how to pray specific prayers, and get specific answers.  You'll learn how to pray for your children, for your community, for your friends and for yourself.  Knowing that, why wouldn't you want this book 
 "Indy-rock," "low-fi," "neo-psychedelia" ... Green Imagination deserves better than the usual labels employed by music reviewers too lazy to do ought but compare and categorize, Bill Doss & cohorts deserve better--for all their association with The Elephant Six Collective (not to mention the inept comparisons to Sixties psychedelic pop the band continually suffers at the hands of apparently hearing-impaired or musically-uneducated critics/hacks [works like Magical Mystery Tour are often referenced by such clueless scribes who clearly ape one another`s ignorance]), Sunshine Fix consistently expresses an unique musical vision, one that defies the stamp and file of trend or genre.  As with their previous release (the excellent Age of The Sun), the Fix have concocted a heady brew of pop tunes both lyrically and melodically intriguing, and once again the production  is as delightful and idiosyncratic as the songs themselves (in these dark days when so many recording artists have abandoned Songcraft in favor of mere Sound, the evocative compositions of Bill Doss are salient points of very-much-needed light). Whether all-out rocking, like the opening "Statues and Glue,"  or emphemeral dreamy-most, like the lysergically-blissful ballad "Innerstates," or pataphysically poignant, like "Enjoy The Teeth," with its heartbreaking piano and strings intro, each track is a polished gem, Doss & company pulling more aural tricks per song from up their musical sleeves than most bands do over an entire album. It is not only that mellotron, clavinet, gospel organ, dulcimer, flutes, strings, horns, mouth harp, childrens' choir & more are employed to embellish their tunes, The Sunshine Fix have an amazing knack of utilizing such instrumentation in just the right places and in just the right measure. The musical landscape of Green Imagination is always full, yet never cluttered, a magickal place where something new always waits 'round the next corner, and repeated listenings reward with previously unnoticed subtleties and textures (the listener's third ear growing ever more acute, unplugged by the magick contained within this music).  Perhaps many of these songs reflect a bit too much harmony and light to suit the artificial taste of nihilist-poseurs, but that also is one of the qualities that make The Sunshine Fix a very special musical entity indeed 
 This CD helped me to sleep during my entire pregnancy...I would rarely be awake by the end.  Very soothing, with just the right touch of very simple background music.  Nothing was abrupt or startling, everything flowed  perfectly 
 This book, published by the American Society for Training & Development, is a compilation of all evaluation articles published from 1987 to 1998 in Training & Development.  Dr. Donald Kirkpatrick deems  these fifty articles "best practices." If you don't know who Kirkpatrick is  or aren't familiar with his four-level model of evaluation, you need to  read "Evaluating Training Programs: The Four Levels." Kirkpatrick's  four-level model is considered standard in the HRD and training industries.   The articles are categorized into each of his four-levels (i.e., measuring  reaction, measuring learning, measuring behavior, and measuring results)  and contain evaluations conducted by organizations such as Motorola, Arthur  Andersen, and AT&T. Even though Kirkpatrick's model does not include  return on investment (ROI), he did include an ROI section.  He recognizes  that ROI may be a natural extension to his model and is of utmost concern  for many organizations, but ROI is not an evaluation panacea. You need to  take a measurement at all of Kirkpatrick's four levels for the best return  on your training investment.  The articles in this compilation cover a  myriad of rationales, perspectives, approaches, instruments, and results.  Kirkpatrick urges the reader to "look for the way the program is evaluated  and not the results of the evaluation." Overall, this book is very well  organized and contains many great resources from well-respected training  programs and departments 
 The best as a televison show and a movie 
 I live in South Africa and have just picked up "The Diet Alternative" at a local bookshop.  After reading the first 20-odd pages, I feel so inspired and filled with faith that my eating and weight problems can be overcome through Jesus Christ 
 I thought this book was way better than most of the reviews portrayed it.  I really enjoyed the concept of this book.  It was definitely new and exciting.  I'm not going to write a plot summary.  Amazon and some of the reviewers do a way better job than I could.  I didn't think it started out boring at all.  It did get a little bogged down in the middle.  I think it may have been from where this book was translated.  I found it easy to get involved with the characters.  I would really recommend this to young adults and adults who love fantasy 
 I love Jayne Castle/Ann Krentz's futuristic world and this was no exception.  Very fun and the play between characters is something I really enjoy.  I do wish she would do more of her flower series (i.e. Amaryllis, Zinnia, Orchid 
 Think! could have been better written.  In places, LeGault's writing and thinking seem little more polished than the "blogs" and "posts" you can find on almost any topic all over the Internet.  LeGault's thoughts are roughly strung together.  His writing is often persuasive, but also too often uncomfortably close to a rant.    Normally that would have been enough for me to put down this book and move on to another.  We are blessed these days to have many powerfully written and thoughtful books available, many more than a person can read in a lifetime.  But despite the flaws, LeGault quickly captured my attention.  Although I did not always agree with what he had to say, his thinking always seemed sharp, incisive, and clever.  Just as he encourages us to be.    Rarely do I find that in a book like this.  And although I enjoyed reading Malcolm Gladwell's Blink, and his Tipping Point, I was not impressed by what Gladwell had to say.  Sparkly and entertaining, Gladwell's books look better than they are.    LeGault's book is the opposite.  LeGault's presentation could be improved.  His arguments could be refined.  The whole thing would be worth a lot more if polished.  But still, it is a diamond, albeit in the rough.  At heart, the book is better than it looks.    As LeGault says, "More and more, large numbers of people substitute [politically correct] views, hard-line political ideology, or cultish balderdash for hard-won knowledge and flexible, powerful reasoning and problem-solving skills."  Most books show mostly the former.  Think! shows mostly the latter.    You can agree or disagree with LeGault's conclusions on some of the topics he discusses in this book.  Like most of the other reviewers, I did not agree with some of what LeGault says -- on climate change, for example.  But even though I liked reading Gladwell's books and have no qualms about his success, I have to say that LeGault is in a different class.    Gladwell blinks.  LeGault thinks.    
 This book really is a little jewel -beautifully researched and written and incredibly moving. Keats is vividly portrayed, and , as the previous reviewer noted, Joseph Severn is given his due as the best person Keats could have had with him in his dying days. Severn was a devout Christian, according to Walsh, and his life after Keats' death exemplified the Christian belief that if you give selflessly, you will receive... Just have a box of tissues handy while reading this book.. 
 This book was recommended to me by one of my mentors, and echoes the best advice I've ever been given over the years.  The information is powerful and precise, and applicable to any professional in the "people business."  I found the suggestions on writing Thank You notes very helpful.  It has definitely made a difference in how my contacts respond to me, resulting in several new clients.  Of course, the book offers much more--from booking appointments by phone and positioning yourself as an expert to beginning your own networking group.  Bob Burg dissects the sales process and offers very practical solutions at each and every step, from pre-qualification to closing.  This book is a truly valuable resource that you will go back to again and again 
 A wonderful book, both the pictures and words, and it really informs you  about lots of birds.  A sense of adventure that's mixed with suspense, the  joy and the fun of the book is intense.  The story is brilliant, the  drawings sublime, and they manage to carry it off all in rhyme.  So buy it,  enjoy it, it's full of surprise, and not to forget, it's got googly eyes.   Now the author's my brother, I have to confess, but that won't mean that  you'll like the book any less 
 If you do have the finances necessary for personal pro instructors, this is the next best thing to improve your game, being a "seasoned citizen" I especially took note and used his suggestions for senior golfers-this book is still a classic 
 In the 1998 Hal Hartley movie Henry Fool a perverted garbageman writes a poem that becomes the "best selling poem of all time," eventually earning him the Nobel Prize. Ben Lerner is not a garbageman, but he holds a degree in Political Theory from Brown University, which is close enough to the script that he ought to be in line for recognition by the Swedish Academy. Lichtenberg is a sonnet sequence chloroformed by the lies and swindles of the English language circa 2004. I adore this book. I adorate it.  Check out some of its lines:  What am I the antecedent of? When I shave I feel like a Russian. When I drink I'm the last Jew in Kansas. I sit in my hammock and whittle my rebus. I feel disease spread through me like a theaory. I take a sip from Death's black daiquiri.  ...  O slender spadix projecting from a narrow spathe,  you are thinner than spaghetti but not as thin as vermicelli. You are the first and last indigenous Nintendo.  
 If you love Lalah Hathaway's unique and rich voice, and you loved Joe Sample circa Spellbound, this is a perfect album. Lalah Hathaway's first album was soul with some acknowledgement of jazz and a few concessions to the R&B sounds of the time, but on this one, she's more of a straight-up jazzy vocalist.  Together, she and Sample take on a few originals, one of her late, great father's songs, and even rework some of the old roads Sample has traveled.    Hathaway's voice to me shines the most on a couple of tracks in particular.  On "Come Along With Me", a rework of Sample's "All God's Children" with lyrics, the combination of her warm tone and pleasant lyrics make for a great listening experience.  "Love's no sure shot, but I would take one with you."  Indeed.  "One Day I'll Fly Away" is as sad as "Come Along With Me" is hopeful, a perfect song with which to sit by the window on a rainy day and sip something.  Their low-key take on The Crusaders' "Street Life" will never match Randy Crawford's original, but is still pleasant listening and in line with the vibe of the album.  On the other hand, their faithful rendition of Donny Hathaway's "For All We Know" shows how much the daughter has inherited from the father, with everything down to her timbre eerily matching the original.  Sample has a couple of instrumental-only tracks as well, including the title cut, which is probably the best of them.    If you are a fan of contemporary jazz with a little intensity but still a great deal of accessibility, this is a solid album.  I just bought my third copy of it (one for myself, one for my father, and a third as a recent gift) 
 While listening to this disc, it amazes me how many hits this wonderful artist has.  I mean, hit after hit and her voice just floats on the music.  I really wish she hadn't dropped off when she did.  Anyways, beautiful disc from a beautiful lady and a must have.  Absolute must have 
 This paperback book is everything it's cracked up to be:  umpteen tips on tying smarter and faster. The photographs are superb.  A. K. still doesn't think much of many modern synthetics, exhibiting a strong preference for natural materials.  Although not a professional, I just tie for my own use, this book will save me the purchase price in materials alone, with the time savings a bonus.  This is not a recipe book - this is a how to tie in (fill in the blank) material better, more consistently, and quicker 
 Everyone knows that Paul Simon has not been particularly prolific as a composer. His catalog of songs is small and those that are worthy could fill four albums - over a course of forty years - that works out to one song a year. One of the secrets of his career has been the fact that the basis for his first three albums with Garfunkel was the batch of songs he wrote and recorded while in England by himself. Some of these were released as the Paul Simon Songbook. The Sounds of Silence was tweaked in the US to become a folk-rock number, hit number one, and Simon rushed back to the states with his songbook to go electric in the studios. The rest is history.  Here are early versions of many songs that would become classics in later years. Some, like "Kathy's Song," are essentially unchanged. "Sounds of Silence" has a different, plodding tempo that weakens the impact of the song. "I am a Rock" and "Flowers never bend with the rainfall" are strong here but are definitely made more powerful in the later versions.  Simon appears to have been ambivalent about this release once his more electric versions were produced. He didn't exactly withdraw it from the public but he rarely mentioned it either. I suppose its release on cd means he was looking for some quick pocket money. Overall, if this was all we ever heard from Simon, he would have been remembered as a folkie on the "B" list - known only to collectors of early sixties folk music. Interesting for a listen if you are a S & G fan 
 Fanatastic album, a must have for all Coco Montoya Fans.  This is how I remeber him live. Great energy in this album.  The last review is off on only one point.  Coco you need to put out a Live DVD! !  
 Indeed it's even better in some ways than their last album and I gave that five stars too. After Tears of a Mandrake I was almost nervous waiting for this disc to hit my stereo as how could they surpass the last one. Well they managed. There is more humour and more uncouth kicking butt here than many paint by numbers power metal tossers manage in an entire career.  Just throw it on and listen as the first track roars out of the blocks. Track two had me worred - it's a damn long creation, but once you get over that your back into the swing.  Tobias is in fine voice and the band seem so tightly meshed into some driving force. I actually caught them on this tour and the show just blended into one long celebration of metal. I couldn't of picked a highlight if I tried.  And it doesn't slacken off toward the end, more cool tracks with a sense of fun - like the single Lavatory Love Machine. This is a band that doesn't mind making fun of itself though some might find the infamous German sense of humour a hurdle.   Overall a wonderful album from a band that is thankfully somewhat removed from some of their power metal peers 
 This is an excellent book. Rankin's use of language is superb, enhancing his story which moves meaningfully without predictability. He is a wonderfully talented master of his art 
 There is no doubt that Larry Gross is a top scholar in the field of Gay Media Studies.  Having just completed my own thesis and graduate work in the area, I found this work by Gross priceless because he makes the material readable, enjoyable and understandable for anyone.  Looking at Gay representation in Mass Media from a variety of different perspectives, Television, Print Media, Film and briefly touching on gay visibility on the Internet. It is amazing that although I have been studying this material for 6+ years, Gross brought new insightful information to me on the material that I haven't heard or read before.  This is must read and worthy personal library addition to anyone interested in Gay Studies.  When we realize how far we have come, Gross is quick to remind us how far we have to go 
 I am a student from San Francisco State University and this is one of the books that I have to read for my Ethnic Studies Class. I really think this is a book made for student of Ethnic Studies and I strongly recommend this  book to anyone who is interested in learning more about history of Asian  American 
 Handsome, strong, intelligent and able to get the job done. Shaft was the man and he was black. What a good combination and one that was long overdue.   It was so refreshing to see him take control and handle any situation that came his way. On top of it all he did not discriminate as far as being a lady's man was concerned. Black or white he still was the lover, which at that time was not seen on the big screen even though it was happening alot in real life.   Do you know how many men bought turtle neck shirts and leather trench coats after watching that movie? Quite a few where I lived and probably many other places to. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes action, drama and a man who's presence alone was magnetic!! 
 This story teaches us about friendship, sharing, caring, and giving. Any child will greatly benefit from reading this book. It's very heartfelt and leaves you feeling happy and relieved in the end. It provides hope that  nobody is alone and that somebody does care 
 I got a Pogo Roo for Christmas around 1991.  My parents were not sure whether I would like it or not.  I played with that pogo stick more than anything I else for the next few years.  I spent most of Christmas day trying to see how many jumps in a row I could get.  I used this same pogo stick for years, bouncing down the street to my friends' houses.  I started doing tricks like no hands and 360's by about 4th grade. The spring broke sometime around 1998 but it still worked pretty good.  I finally threw it away when I was in 17 in 2001 after 10 years and millions of bounces 
 I bought this TV earlier this afternoon for a couple of reasons: brand reliability, widescreen format, HD compatible, and the very wrong description that it has more than one HDMI input.  It's a nice TV, reasonable price, but it does only have one HDMI input.  I get the feeling it would be well served by a proper tuning by a pro with reference materials for color, contrast, brightness, etc.  That's the case for most TV's though.  Money well spent 
 Much of the material in this book is covered in Hollywood Babylon but there is enough new material to make it worth your time.James Robert Parish loves his subject and it comes through in the text.A good read 
 Business writer John Kador describes the evolution of Charles Schwab & Company, a former discount brokerage blessed with the ability to transform itself through four different incarnations. Kador emphasizes Schwab's commitment to integrity and customer service, a code that enabled it to prevail despite upheavals and threats. While the book focuses on the company, the running portrait of Chuck Schwab gives it a personal core. Kador highlights Schwab's concern with exercising his values and leading a highly principled business amid an often shady industry he saw as corrupted by greed. Kador's engaging narrative style is designed to inform and entertain general investors, executives and managers. At times, the discussion of Chuck Schwab and his company sounds almost too laudatory, as if the book is an in-house publicity piece. We from getAbstract recommend that readers should take all that sugar with a grain of salt, given this otherwise compelling dish 
 A terrific listen, awash in wonderful guitar work.  Definitely one of the best shoegazer releases and for that matter pop records of the 90s.  A 13 year old CD that sounds endlessly better than so much of the talentless nonsense that pervades the airwaves today.  Chock full of great singles like "Black Metallic", "She's My Friend", "Balloon", "Shallow" and the wonderful "I Want to Touch You".    Great production by Tim Friese-Greene who worked with Talk Talk.  A CD that stays in my regular rotation 
 Though perhaps not completely correct in teaching your child about chameleons, this book is adorable.  My three-year-old son and I read it at the library, and he kept asking about it, so I ordered it for him.  He really enjoys reading it again and again 
 I don't collect Tyler Wentworth dolls but still loved the book. Lots of good pictures 
 You have to admire Charlotte Chandler just for the way she prints a photo of herself with Bette Davis on the back cover, and in the photo she, Chandler, is wearing either the goofiest hat ever designed for a woman, or perhaps the worst haircut an author ever received.  It is the kind of upswept hairdo we associate with Lillian Russell and the Gibson Girls, but different somehow, with the texture of a minor, pale fur like rabbit or nutria.  In contrast Bette Davis, stroke and all, looks like she's got it all together.  What a delightful book, compiled from houts and hours of taped conversations in which Davis details all of the movies she made (87 feature films, thirteen TV movies, one miniseries) as well as the men she made along the way.  Yes, some of the material is familiar, such as Davis' worship of her mentor George Arliss, and her devotion to William Wyler who, for all I know, may indeed be America's greatest director but I doubt it.  However, many of the comments Davis makes here are completely new to me.  And in addition, Chandler interviews many of those who worked with Davis and solicited their opinions about "This N That."  I enjoyed reading George Cukor's comments on Davis' appeal.  Though he never directed her in a film, he was the man who picked her out to join his stock company while still working in the stage repertory system.  "Even in Rochester, young as she was, Bette has styar quality,.  'Do you know what the secret of star quality is?' he asked me.  'It's being irritating.  The great women stars have an irritating quality, each in her own way, individually irritating.  It's a part of what makes them distinctive.  Katharine Hepburn, Garbo, Olivia de Havilland, with all that sweetness of Melanie, each had that oh-so-irritating quality.'"  I don't know whether this says more about Cukor or the women he finds irritating, but it's something to think about, and rarely so well expressed.  Another intriguing story is the one of the "film that got away," Irving Rapper's proposed biopic (from the 1947-8 period) of Mary Todd Lincoln, in which Davis might have played the conspiracy-ridden first lady, committed to a mental hospital after her husband was assassinated and her son died.  Todd Lincoln had an unusual friendship with a black milliner which would have been part of the script too, at least as Rapper describes it, alas a great part for someone like Ethel Waters or Marietta Canty lost to us forever due to lackluster studio response.  Instead, Davis and Robert Montgomery made JUNE BRIDE, a horse of a different color indeed.  Did you know Greer Garson was asked to play the part of THE NANNY?  I didn't, and there's an amusing story that goes along with that (pp. 245-6).  You have to give Chandler props as well for the bizarre collection of blurbs that decorates this volume!  How on earth did she land Pavarotti, Liv Ullmann, and Michelangelo Antonioni to say things like "Formidable!" on the book jacket?  Most of the stars and studio personnel interviewed by Chandler give Bette Davis nothing but good marks; on the other hand, there's always Celeste Holm, who's been practicing a dill pickle sourness for years now when it comes to the topic of ALL ABOUT EVE.  She'll outlive us all, preserved in acid like a car battery 
 This is a wonderful book! It is very inspiring, and the ideas are easy to follow, understand, and adapt to your own space and needs. I loved the descriptions of their garden/sanctuary at their home, and am inspired to  try to create some sacred space in my own life. Thank you for a truly  fantastic book 
 All right, students, now pay attention! Put down that racing form and pay attention right now! This here Chess Blues box set contains exactly 101 tracks. How appropriate! That makes this collection a sort of unofficial college course entitled Blues 101, and Professors Wolf, Waters, James, and Jacobs (Little Walter), etc., etc., will be your blues instructors. You will learn the Fundamentals of Blues Harp, with Little Walter ("Juke") and Sonny Boy Williamson II ("Don't Start Me to Talkin'") as your master teachers. Over here, we have a course entitled Mellow Blues, with Willie Dixon ("Walkin' the Blues") and Jimmy Witherspoon ("Ain't Nobody's Business") showing you how it's done. Then, we have instruction in Blues and the Female Voice, with Koko Taylor ("What Kind of Man Is That," "Wang Dang Doodle") and Etta James ("Somethings Got A Hold Of Me," "I'd Rather Go Blind") as your teachers. Finally, what great university would be complete without Master Classes and the best professors in the business Muddy Waters ("Got My Mojo Workin'," "I Can't Be Satisfied," "My Eyes (Keep Me in Trouble"), Howlin Wolf ("Killin' Floor," "Evil," "Going Down Slow"), and John Lee Hooker ("Walkin' the Boogie," "One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer") holding court for your edification. No, there is no blues university, but if there was one, the above masters would surely be the instructors and Chess Blues would certainly be the required text. As I said, it's packed with an amazing 101 songs, many of the best blues tracks ever recorded. There are a few clunkers, but very few. You will spend many enjoyable hours listening to this collection. (Trust me, it takes a few hours to listen to 101 songs once!) Get it today, and enroll in the best blues education money can buy 
 This is a well-written, beautiful little book written in peaceful yet eloquent language.  Having had little success with meditation, I have been very excited about the consciousness states I have been able to achieve using the experiental CD included with the book.  I also find that in addition to being relaxing and instructive (and incredibly entertaining), the shamanic state is indeed a real point of power.  I have had almost instant "life feedback" or "results" - to use an informercial term - after visiting and learning in my own garden space.  Read this book, and use the CD.  It may prove to be invaluable for you as it has for me 
 This was given as a Christmas gift.  According to my daughter and husband who have four cats, this baby really takes care of the cat hair on their furniture.  Not sure how many they tried before but they are very happy with the Dirt Devil 0100 
 Great book! I'm a Reading Room teacher and am always looking for new books for our read aloud program. This story grabs you and is hard to put down. If you like fiction/witchcraft/ghosts etc. this is the story for you 
 Before this book the word lady symbolized a New England society debutant in a courtsy at her debut. It seemed restrictive but this book offers a more expanded and actually quite inspiring interpretation... being a lady does include stating your mind, having a leadership role, enjoying adventure, and so forth. It's like an etiquette coach once said - class does not equal cash. Ladies can be strong, wise, outspoken, but at its core ... it is about having self-respect and learning from our mistakes with grace 
 Despite the unfavorable comments in "A VERY POOR EFFORT," I decided to buy this book and try it for myself. I'm so glad I did. This reviewer seems to be confused about this book. Of all the books on the subject, this is the only one that's written by a Pulitzer-nominated architectural historian, comprised of all-color photos, inclusive of the late-20th and 21st cent styles, designed like an art book, and packaged in a compact/portable format for taking it on the road. These 5 features are completely NEW to this genre! The unhappy reviewer's other point of criticism (that there are too many trees on the property of some of the photographed houses) is simply absurd. How can a photographer remove trees and foliage from a house's property before photographing the house? These houses are important examples, not slouches. The book states clearly that each picture was taken from public property. Should the photographer have given each house a fresh coat of paint, too, before he photographed it? Such a criticism is illogical. For my dollar, this is the best book in the genre and thus should be given a fair evaluation. I'm glad I bought it. As a realtor, I need this kind of book, and this one's the easiest to use of all of them. 
 I have had over three copies of this book and read and re-read the stories contained within.  It isn't a book that you have to read from front to back, just pick a subject or topic and have at it!  Whether its  Sea-monsters, Ship wrecks, or Sea life; Ghost stories or True stories, this  wonderful book is a wealth of information & lore.  A must have for Navy  men (and women), sailors or any lover of the sea and the stories and  mysteries she holds 
 This book puts the "so what" back into research texts!  It is a wonderful, thoughtful, realistic and provocative description of how research is not only a technique but an approach to life.  I used many of  the excellent suggestions to explore my own thoughts and to develop new  insights into research methodologies and philosophies.  I can't remember  the last scholarly book I sat down and read for an entire weekend cover to  cover 
 A very good book for someone who knows linear algebra. In fact, it is probably a good introduction to advanced statistics for someone with a numerical background.  The reason I did not give if 5 is that it has started to show its age and insists that data is best arranged in rows. Those with a numerical background invariably use columns (unless they are doing funky stuff).  The description of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is based on eigendecompositions rather than a singular value decomposition. Apart from being a numerical no-no, it is also a nice description of the data.  Every 10-20 years a statistician reinvents a minor variant of PCA (often without obvious knowledge of the previous ones). It would be nice if this was made more explicit. The connection with factor analysis is mentioned (and it has a good chapter of its own), but it would be nice to mention at least the Harkunen-Loeve and Hotelling-transform 
 This is a very informative book that can tell you pretty much everything you need to know when it comes to electric vehicles.  If you want a good fiction read about electric vehicles, try 'The Wilson Concern', by Will Alan.  I found it very entertaining and informative 
 This biography reads like a light-hearted enjoyable chick lit novel; about being single, in your 30s, and living in NYC.  Bridget Harrison took a great leap of faith by moving to New York for four months on an exchange work program.  She landed her dream job and decided to make the move from England permanently.  Working as a reporter for the New York Post, she also has a once a week column on dating for the single person. She intersperses her life as a reporter in her narrative with her dating woes as she tries to find Mr. Right, a.k.a. "Clark Kent" in the city.  She writes so well you easily get caught up in her potential romances and dating disasters.  Any single woman over 30 could relate to what Bridget says, does, and does not do.  
 For those of you that are familiar with Markus' previous releases, you know how beautiful and uplifting his musical style is.  This release is no exception.  Staying along the same route he did with his Coldharbour 2004 and Miami '05 releases, this release compiles some of the most beautiful and uplifting trance and progressive house tunes ever heard. I have already found myself scouring the internet for some of these cuts on vinyl so I can have them in umnixed form. This is the type of music that moves you spritually as much as physically. Everytime I play a Markus Schulz cd or record, my body automatically becomes relaxed and the clutter that is running through my mind at the time ceases to exist (although temporarily) and I just focus on the music, it just takes me away. In my mind, listening to Markus Schulz, I've been mentally transported everywhere from big cities, in the middle of the "trance-floor" surrounded by beautiful people, to cruising in a convertible on a balmy summer night in a sexy metropolitan environment. This music is just utterly gorgeous.  When most people refer to "trance," they are usually speaking about songs like the ones by Ian Van Dahl, Lasgo, etc.. no, no.. that is commercial dance pop with bits of trance elements. Don't get me wrong, I love those groups and their music.. it's fun and great to dance to, but this on the other hand, is music to clear your mind with.  It's progressive, sexy and stylish but it's ethreal as well. Everytime I have people over and I have his work playing in the background, someone ALWAYS asks me who it is that I'm playing.  This cd will definately be one that will be blaring this summer as my buddy as I are cruising downtown Dallas this summer in his Mustang convertible. This music is perfect to chill to, dance to, cruise to, play at work... it definately lifts my spirits and mood.     Notable Tracks:  "The Fusion" - Joonas Hahmo "Shelter" - Progresia "Technology & Computer - 4mal, Corey Andrew, Matthew Adams "First Time" (Funabashi Remix) - Markus Schulz feat. Anita Kelsey ("First TIme" is lifted from Markus's first full-length album "Without You Near" - the version included on Ibiza '06 is similar and recognizeable, but it is void of all vocals and in my opinion, it flows alot better without them.)   NOTE : On the same day I listened to this this, a buddy I work with brought over Tiesto's "In Search of Sunrise 5" cd that he had just purchased.  I listed to the whole thing, both cd's.. Tiesto has NOTHING on Schulz.. I like some of Tiesto's earlier stuff ("Traffic" etc...)but Tiesto's new cd was more low-key dance radio pop to me..  if you want beauty and textures as well as danceability or chill factor captured in your music.. this is one you should definately look into!  
 I love this program!! It is so easy and fun to use that I will be purchasing this program in other languages 
 Ipods are power-hungry electronic devices and sometimes it's just unconvenient to charge your Ipod through your PC when you aren't even going to use your computer while it is charging. Thankfully, Griffin made this USB power adaptor for your Ipod that you can just take with you anywhere there isn't a computer to be found. Just plug it into any wall outlet and you're set.  At about $30, it is a bit expensive once you realize that it's such a simple device, but that will pay off once you see how convenient it is. It is also small enough to fit in your pocket and the plug folds for easy storage.  To charge my Ipod through my computer it took nearly 4 hours, and for me thats a bit too long especially when I'm not even going to use my computer. With this it only took about 2 and a half hours and it seems the Ipod battery lasts alot longer when it is charged using this rather than the USB port on my computer. I don't know much about electricity and battery power but I believe it charges faster probably because it is directly in an outlet rather than the electricity having to travel all the way to the USB port of your computer and then to your Ipod.  The Griffin Power Block also comes with a USB cable. This is such a nice bonus considering the Apple USB power adaptor doesn't include one and their's costs about $10 more. I believe the Apple power adaptor is also larger.  If you want the best USB power adaptor for your Ipod 4th and 5th gen., Nano, or Shuffle then this is the one to go to 
 Of all the Bonnie Tyler collections there are (and there ARE plenty!), this one is my favorite! It has everything but her top 50 hit Take Me Back(the follow up to Total Eclipse...)Don't Turn Around was originally a reggae song by Aswald and latter made famous by Ace Of Base. It covers all grounds from her first Country hit It's A Heartache to her rock classic Total Eclipse Of The Heart. Her covers of Cher's Save Up All Your Tears and Tina Turner's The Best. She also did the original version of Bette Midler's top 40 pop/top 20 dance hit Married Men, which is included as well! Enjoy the diversity and memories 
 Aria's family is still dealing with the after effects of a fatal car crash that took both her father and her baby sister, some 15 years ago. Aria, in particular, hasn't gotten over the guilt of being unable to offer comfort to her dying father.   Eloise, Aria's mother, is perhaps the most vividly painted character in the book. She too has been unable to come to terms with her own perceptions of the fatal accident that took her husband and her favorite child.   Hermione, the elder sister, left home at the earliest possible moment. Her escape came by marrying her deceased father's best friend, an act that still hasn't been completely forgiven by the family.   While the differences and distance between these family members sometimes seems insurmountable, the book is about how this group continues to relate as a family, in spite of all odds. When Aria needs to come to terms with untelling a lie she's been harboring, rather than meassuring how much she loses, the beauty of this story comes in seeing how much she's gained along the way. 
 I've always enjoyed Lucinda's music, you can always find a few classics on every collection, especially this one. It took some time but I really enjoy the musicanship and her vocals are such a treat, she says what she feels(not everything makes sense but hell, who really cares) she is stretching some on many of these songs and getting away from her base at times but she is a gifted alt-country rock talent that deserves to be heard in these times when music created for the masses is really letting us down. Sure she's something else when she rocks out like on Car wheels on a gravel road, she's dealing with the death of her mom and under the LA influence  but each album gives us new insights, and no one sings like this 
 I LOVE this movie!  I first saw it on HBO in a hotel room in Florida during a high school trip, and at that time I only saw part of it.  Still, I was laughing so much!  We had about 10 people in the hotel room watching it and we had a great time!  I've seen this movie so many times since then, but it never gets old.  It is so much fun.  Who wouldn't, if given the chance, chill in Europe with your friends, having the time of your life?  Sure, they all have their problems, but in the end, they're better people.  I never thought I would enjoy an obscene comedy so much...but Eurotrip completely exceeded all of my expectations.  I don't even care that the ending was completely unbelieveable, out-there, ridiculous.  It doesn't matter.  It just made the movie more hilarious!  And except for the title of my review, I haven't even MENTIONED the catchy, awesome song associated with the movie - "Scotty Doesn't Know!"  Definitely check out the soundtrack, because after watching this movie, you will feel the need to rock out to this song...it is great 
 In _Michelangelo_, Hibbard presents a unbiased account of Michelangelo's life in an enjoyable mix of historical narravitve and critical and contextual analysis.  The writing is approachable with a minimum of high-brow art jargon.  Hibbard also refrains from diving too deep into  speculation about fine points such as sexuality and politics.  This book is  suited for those desiring an end-to-end introduction to the man and his  art, or for those who have forgotten 90% of art survey 101, like me 
 Some readers, I know, dislike Simon Winchester's conversational, discursive, sometimes off-on-a-tangent narrative style, but I for one find it richly rewarding. I first discovered it in "Krakatoa," his book about that Indonesian volcano where it's even more in evidence than it is in this title. But even here, reading Winchester is like settling into a chair, or around a fire, to listen to a talented storyteller weave an entrancing tale. If your taste in history runs to deliberate, just-the-facts reportage, then Simon Winchester probably isn't for you. But if you're willing to trust the author and follow where he's leading you, I predict you'll find reading "The Professor and the Madman" a most satisfying experience.  Winchester had to put some effort into unraveling different, sometimes contradictory, versions of the story of Doctors Minor and Murray and their unusual partnership in the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary. The care he took in tracking down records from St. Elizabeth's hospital in Washington, DC, as told in the Acknowledgements, is itself solid evidence of his determination to get the story right. He also maintains an excellent balance between the personalities involved, the overall story of the OED, and the tragic crime that underlies it all. It's to the author's true credit that in the end, he returns to George Merrett and his untimely death, closing his story with that image before our eyes.  "Popular history" too often is code for history-writing that dodges deep questions or merely reaffirms popular prejudices. But "The Professor and the Madman" is excellently-done narrative history that deserves the popularity it evidently enjoys 
 People complain about how commercial the songs on Vegas are.  There is a reason for that: the songs are good.  Call me shallow but the only reason why I listen to techno is to give my speakers a run for the money.  This is hands down one of the best dance/techno albums of all time.  It has very catchy grooves, has withstood the test of time (a real challenge in the electronic music genre) and stays upbeat for the most part thought out the entire album.    I am not saying this is a bad thing but when an electronica group tires to put more depth and creativity into their music, it just isn't very fun to dance too.  I enjoy music that wants to make you move and keep the blood flowing.  Crystal Method is special because they really hit the nail on the head here.  They know how to make big beat music.    I listened to others that make pure dance music like TCM but is cheesy because of senseless lyrics and cheap synths groove loops (2 Unlimited).  If you were to own one techno album, this should be one. 
 Very descriptive, held my attention from first page to the end.  I was able to see through Jane Eyre's eyes, her world of living as an orphan in England in the 1800s, the cruel and heartless people in her life, her selfish aunt who didn't keep her promise to her dying brother to rear her as her own.  Throughout the novel, Jane was resourceful, nurturous and intelligent.  She became a governess for a rich employer who had his insane wife imprisoned.  Jane fell in love with him, suffered tragedies of a broken heart, trials of running from her past, a new identity.  She discovered loving friends and family, became rich, and marries her former employer.  Every time she had a taste of happiness it was taken from her.  I cried and got angry 
 There's seems to be a lot of fuss about a typo on the cover of Behind the Wheel Chinese. One reviewer says that he's upset because he bought a car Chinese course with the intention of doing some reading while he drives and learns Chinese. HELLO? I can't speak for others, not in English or any other language, but I can say that anyone who wishes to learn a foreign language in their car should not do so while reading. If they do, they should have their head examined. What they should do is buy a course that offers them the best in recorded car instruction In this case, Chinese. It can even be 'counter productive' to learn a language like Mandarin Chinese while trying to read the language, whether you're in the car or not. According to the very best methods, you must first  learn to 'speak' the language. When you were small and learning English, I'm sure your mother didn't ask you to read a book first.  Did she? And she certainly wouldn't have wanted you to read a book and drive while learning to speak your very first language which is English.  Correct? O.K. Now that we have established that,  allow me to say few more words about the exceptional method that I have found in this course. In a word, IT"S EASY AND IT WORKS. That's it.  I recommend you try it too 
 Aztecs Under Spanish Rule is an in-depth study of the evolution of the historical relationship between the Native Mexicans and the Spaniards in Colonial Latin America.  The story begins with the cultural differences between the two groups after the Spaniard's conquering effort over the Aztecs, 1519-1521. The social-cultural alterations and reorganizations that took place during the process of their co-existence within the Mexican mesa central from that point until Mexico's bid for independence, in 1821, are the general themes within the topics of each chapter.  	Gibson begins with a brief historical sketch of the landscape and human occupation of the Valley of Mexico, and each following chapter covering such historical topics as settlement patterns, land use, politics, religion and social structures literally has the potential of being its own disquisition.  The author unleashes a flood of data, references and Indian names that cascade over the pages; unless the reader is in firm command of the Mexican Indian terminology, the glossary will become a welcomed reference bookmark. The overall effect of subjugation by the Imperial Spanish over the once Imperial Aztecs is visible in nearly all facets of life.  This transformed society becomes the foundation for modern-day Mexico City and the greater Mexican society. 	The typical form of the chapters is a chronologically based essay. Beginning at or close to the point conquest, and traversing through the next three centuries, stopping at important junctions, at which point Gibson provides connecting vignettes that illuminate this region and inhabitant's path of history.  Thus the scholarly Aztecs Under Spanish Rule is not overwhelming and is a quite digestible text that lay persons with interest in Mexican or Latin American history will find most agreeable.   	Even though the structuring of the chapters and their content is consistent and readable, Gibson's work is essentially a historical text that suffers from a lack of narration.  The people and their situations do not come alive; they are presented in a flat, matter of fact manner, negating Aztecs Under Spanish Rule's potential as a page-turner.  The most commendable list of primary sources permits the author to introduce an enviable texture, however, the fine combing does not occur, which would have produced a more human connected story.  It is hard to imagine that the plethora of letters in the bibliography did not allow for the inclusion of longer, more personable and illuminating quotes.    The very strength of each chapter as its own tractate, in this reviewer's opinion, becomes the book's undoing.  At the conclusion of each topical chapter, we are back in the starting gate once again. That is not to say that Gibson's work is anything less than exemplary, rather simply that its topical structure somewhat takes away from author's ability to maintain the reader's imagination and focus as the story begins, unfolds, begins then unfolds, and begins and unfolds yet again and again. Once transported back in time, a connection is made, and an anticipation of the unfolding of the story builds.  Severing this association repeatedly disconnects the reader from the flow of history. This could however be a matter of personal taste. Gibson states in his preface that he spent nearly twelve and one-half years researching and assembling this extraordinary piece of historical scholarship.  His extensive appendixes, notes and bibliography speak well of his not brief dedication in compiling this work.  For those aroused by the subject and feel the need to go deeper, this is a great starting point.  The selection of maps and plates further illuminate this recommended history of Mexico.  Try to remember that this work was groundbreaking in its time 
 This book is a good eye opener for anyone who has even a little opinion on moral issues such as abortion, the death penalty, the right to pornography, and euthanasia.  The cool part of this book is that it presents a pro-side and a con-side to seventeen different issues.   The way in which the arguments are presented are logical and follow a well thought out pattern of thought.  In my reading of this book, I was amazed at some of the thoughts that were presented many of which I had never thought of or considered before.  This book could serve as a textbook, or just a good resource book for debates.  If you have even a slight opinion on a touchy issue, I would suggest reading this book for two reasons; first, it will give you more understanding and fire for your position, and second, you be able to understand where someone else is coming from 
 Robert Anton Wilson's final part of his Cosmic Trigger Series proves that from the beginning its all a conspiracy. Even his own death was just a hoax. Can you prove normalcy beyond a shadow of a doubt? Although I found  this part one of the best, I would still say to read part 1, then part 2,  in that order. Wilson argues Evolution and Creationism, political  correctness, Carl Sagan and of course, conspiracies. Well thought out with  the reading that doubles upon itself, you will find how information adds up  into another line of thinking. Certainly a classic RAW book! Highly  reccomended

 This card is capable of holding over 1000 pictures in most cameras.  Going from around 17 pictures in a standard 16 mb card to 1046 is pretty satisfying 
 This was one of my favorite all-time books. I purchased one as a gift for my sister also. I love to read about other cultures, and this was an enjoyable read 
 Fox News promotes itself as fair and balanced, when what it is biased and unbalanced.  This DVD provides mountains of evidence in the form of video segments that contradict official statements that the network is unbiased and even handed.     Particularly galling is the Jeremy Glick segment, presented in its entirety here. O'Reilly puts words in Glick's mouth, and later segments is seen claiming that his own lies about Glick are Glick's actual sentiments. This is reprehensible.       It's an unflinching depiction of the Republican Party's mouthpiece.  
 The _Short Oxford History of Europe_, under the general editorship of T.C.W. Blanning, is an especially well-edited series of 11 brief but meaty topical surveys covering the region's entire recorded history, from Ancient Greece to the latter part of the 20th century. The reader is assumed already to know the broad outlines of European history and to want look below the surface of events to the underlying forces and trends. While each volume is composed of a series of articles by experts who bring unique understanding and insights the result is much more integrated and consistent than that of the usual collective work. The transitions between volumes are well managed so that the series can be read as a seamless history from start to finish if desired, but the reader who is looking only for insight into a particular period can read just one or two volumes without feeling that he is missing the secret key.  The overall impression, in fact, is a good deal like a far shorter (and much more affordable) version of the _Cambridge History_  series.   The chief lack is of good references to sources. At the end of each volume is a "further reading" section which is generally pretty thorough and helpful, but there is no way to tell where a particular fact or insight comes from except in those cases where the chapter author has mentioned the origin in his or her text.  It should be understood that these are not narrative histories of the events of their periods. A timeline of major events is provided at the back, but the chapters cover topics rather than sub-periods, and generally are not themselves organized chronologically.   The period of this volume, the Early Middle Ages, was proverbially the "Dark Ages." It's a term historians dislike, but it is appropriate to the extent that the documentary evidence from this period is quite slim. People had other things to do, such as struggling to survive. The volume covers six centuries at one gulp not because little happened but because our knowledge of what did happen is so sketchy. In general the authors do a good job of teasing out from this dearth of material the story of how Europe began to become European rather than Roman and Barbarian 
 Bill Amend does it again.  This is another great collection of Foxtrot comics. It features another of Roger's attempt to create a perfect barbecue that turns into a Fourth of July fireworks and Peter and Jason wondering whether Bruce Springsteen gets his inspiration from watching Roger's attempt at barbecuing.  This is another great addition to your collection 
 The Talisman chronicles the adventure of a twelve year old boy named Jack Sawyer. The young hero sets out from the East Coast of the USA in a bid to save his mother, who is dying from cancer. Jack needs to find the mystical artifact known only as the 'The Talisman'. Werewolves, both good and bad, inhabit the far western parts of a world parallel to America known as The Territories - which incidentally are part of the Dark Tower World.  A sixteen-year-old Wolf, simply named Wolf, is accidentally drawn pulled into America by Jack Sawyer, and the two form a strong friendship as they seek ways to travel between their worlds and find the talisman.  The book is split between The Territories and our world's America. King and Straub are able to constantly throw Jack from the frying pan to the fire, as he escapes from one life-threatening situation to another. Jack must retrieve the Talisman before it falls into enemy hands and will be lost to him forever.  A different type of book for King, as it involves the creation of worlds other than our own...A concept he uses almost exclusively in his Dark Tower stories and the Eyes of the Dragon.  However, this is a successful stand alone novel, in its own right and I would suggest picking up a copy of this for a rainy day so you too can visit another world...   Relic113 
 This book is every bit as good as the other reviewers suggest.  Although, I have not read other books in this field, I recognize excellent writing when I see it.  I am compelled to state that a reader looking to learn about this complex field need look no further than this book in order to get a comprehensive, authoritative and highly interesting account - one that is not afraid to confront some of the major and controversial views.  A few additional comments:  a. While written very well, the material is such that I found this book to be one that is best enjoyed in many smaller helpings  b. It is one of the rare books that gets progressively more interesting, the further one gets into the book (somehow the topics are arranged that way) - patience and faith are strongly recommended.  As a last resort, try one of the later chapters - they can be read independently of each other for the most part.  c. The arrangement may seem somewhat unstructured - have faith - there are so many aspects to this "field" - let the authority guide you.  d. While some readers may question the authors opinions, I found them extremely well reasoned and articulated - even if they feel a bit uncomfortable to start with.  I saw no agenda other than the pursuit of science to benefit mankind.  Overall, hats off - I am very thankful that there are people out there that do write about such topics that may not have mass market appeal 
 This is truly a wonderful film that really gets to the heart of family and parenting.  It also has a lot of comedy added in the mix of it, so it makes the film that much more enjoyable.  I have loved this movie since I was a kid, and I still love it today!  The only reasons I rated the 'product' 4 stars is because it has not been released in a WIDESCREEN version!  I am not a fan of full screen!  I actually like to watch the whole movie, so if this one is ever released as a wide screen, I will be buying it again!  I always have family member I can give the other version to 
 Child of Darkness had me glued to my seat from start to finish.  I could not put this book down.  If you are a fan of this writer then you are in for a rare treat with this book.  I promise, you'll be glued to your seat until you finish the story 
 Just by the name alone -- "Darkman" -- you know you can expect something spectacularly refreshing in the superhero genre. Indeed this is. With Sam Raimi taking on the directing, Liam Neeson playing the lead role, and Danny Elfman scoring the music, how could anything go wrong? Well, although it's not a timeless masterpiece that is enjoyable for eveyone, it is one of those films well worth the cult status it has recieved.  In Darkman, we are given a story of love, madness, and revenge. Scientist Peyton Westlake is devolping a breakthrough product: synthetic skin. Unfortunately, his lawyer girlfriend -- Julie -- has exposed some of the city's organized crime, and the criminals decide to bust up Westlake for some payback. Although not quite as brutal as Murphy's near-death scene in Robocop, this one is vicious nonetheless. To finish the job off, they set explosives in Westlake's laboratory where he lies helpless on the blood-spattered floor. The bomb destroys the lab alright, but it is so powerful that Westlake's body is flung from the building and into the nearby harbor. He's alive, but in horrible condition. At a nearby hospital where his identity is unknown, he is subjected to strange tests. Before long, he awakes in his bandages. He now has terrible flashbacks and is tortured by his hightened emotions, yet barely feels any physical pain. He finds that while his body and mind are a complete mess, he is quite strong. He escapes the hospital and sets up a murky new lab in an abandoned building. Now the story truly begins. Using his synthetic skin technology, he is able to disguise himself as virtually anyone (after all, his severely disfigured facial features might raise a few questions from folks crossing the street). But all great things come with a cost. The skin terminates after a set amount of time, so he can only stay in public for so long. He uses different disguises to get to his enemies -- as well as his girlfriend who believes the man she loves to be dead. With the mental torment of Julie slipping away from him, and the animalistic anger he must unleash on those who've harmed him, he becomes more driven than ever. He tracks down the bad guys, giving them a dose of their own medicine with a side of sweet vengeance. Westlake is seemingly dead, and a new breed of justice has been born. Before long, this anti-hero realizes his calling, becoming the only thing he is now destined to be: Darkman.  The visual style is certainly one of the more interesting aspects of Darkman. The character of Peyton -- when not in disguise -- wears torn bandages over his face, shadowed by a grim hat. His trench coat is as mysterious and haunting as Batman's cape as it flaps in the breeze. Not surprisingly, he also takes on some nice one-liners and witty tricks. Is it just me, or does this sound like a great candidate for the representative of dark superheros? Accompanied by a finely woven storyline, intense characters, stylish to-the-bone action, and a sense that a new form of heroism has risen in which we all can relate, this just seems too good to pass up!  In conclusion, Darkman is a must-rent if not a must-own. There seems to be a lack of truely stylish and original concepts in modern cinema. But this succeeds in giving us something out of the ordinary, and well worth a second look. So see what all the whispering is about and witness the new face of crime-fighting in all of it's terror and fun with Darkman on DVD! Because somewhere lost in the crowd, lurks the legend... 
 I'm a little late in reading this book.  I am trying to pace myself between the movies and the books so that I can enjoy a little Harry Potter at least every year.     I think Goblet of Fire is the best in the series, so naturally it would be pretty difficult for Phoenix to live up to that standard.  In Goblet, it feels like Rowling had a fantastic ending in mind, and that drove the writing of the story.  In Phoenix, it seems like the story is key and the ending was simply tacked on to round it out and provide some concluding information.  The major theme seemed to be the Ministry's takeover of Hogwarts.  I found that entire thread to be thoroughly engrossing.  Harry's dreams, however, took on sub-plot status, and then rose to the top for the final conflict.     I didn't mind the length of the book, but it did seem to drag in a couple of places.  The gang spent too much time at Grimmauld Place.  I could have also done without Hagrid's giant story.     My biggest problem with the book was Dumbledore's secrecy.  Good stories have real roadblocks to keep the hero from achieving his/her goal.  In Phoenix, the cause for most of the confusion was that Dumbledore was reluctant to share certain information with Harry.  He explains his behavior in a most unconvincing way in the final pages.  The secrecy was necessary for the story to take the course that it did, but it lacked good motivation and left me feeling let down.  It reminded me of the natural disaster movie template where the world could be easily saved if not for an arrogant bureaucrat who refuses to listen to the young upstart with all the answers.  It is contrived conflict that is hardly believable.   Don't get me wrong.  I love the Harry Potter series.  And, perhaps my expectations have risen too high.  I am eagerly awaiting the movie and then I know I will devour book 6 (when I allow myself to read it).  I lose interest in most book series after the first couple of installments.  Harry Potter always leaves me wanting more 
 Nonfiction    Attention Nancy Drew fans! The history of Nancy Drew is now available and very well worth the reading. It is a book that will appeal to anyone who is interested in the history of the creative process in any form.   Nancy Drew was born in the mind of the very imaginative Edward Stratemeyer, as were the Rover Boys and the Bobbsey Twins and many other series for the young readers market in the early years of the 20th century. Stratemeyer built a syndicate and had a system of hiring writers to flesh out the outlines of plots he created for these characters that is thoroughly described herein.   In recreating the background of Harriet Stratemeyer and Mildred Wirt, both of whom were involved in the writing of Nancy Drew tales, talented Melanie Rehak gives us a look back in time to an era when drastic changes in society were occurring. One change was recognizing the need for girl-oriented stories to fill a once-snubbed market. Nancy Drew became a leading lady almost at once.   An in-depth look at the creative process and marketing of books from conception to publishing, Girl Sleuth will keep you reading, offering up a study of living characters as well. This is a chance to catch up with one of your favorite characters and visit with the people who delivered her to the page.   Thoughtful, well researched, this is an informative history written in such a way as to keep you reading. Enjoy. Highly recommended for any reader. 
 Anne Lamott is amazing!  Her metaphor for writing and for life may be a  little irreverent at times, but she tells it like it is.  The unexpected moments of humor delight us while opening us to her keen insights on life.  A manual on writing, a daily meditation, and a joyful read, Bird by Bird reaches us on many levels 
 The follow up to the Peter Pan prequel "Peter and the Starcatchers" is a hefty book that may scare some of the more timid readers among us.  556 pages seems like a lot, but there's a lot of action that keeps the pages turning, and I finished it a lot faster than I thought I would.  If you're scared of the dark and tend to jump at shadows this may not be the ideal book for you, because even though it's not scary, it has a lot of dark content.  Peter Pan sets off on a rescue mission to London to warn Molly about a sinister plan to seize the trunk of starstuff in her father's care, and takes some big hits to his ego when Tinkerbell has to bail him out of trouble over and over again.    While he's off saving the world, Captain Hook has plans for the Lost Boys on Neverland, and even Fighting Prawn can't help them when the trap is sprung. Oliver Twist meets Stonehenge, and mind control meshes with inter-terrestrial beams of light in this action/fantasy story that builds to a climax, and then ends with a wonderfully mighty splat.

 Director James Whale did not break stride after his brilliant 1931 classic "Frankenstein" with an almost as brilliant "The Old Dark House".  Two groups of travelers traversing the Welsh countryside in a torrential downpour seek refuge in an eerie, desolate and threatening mansion.  Raymond Massey and a stunning Gloria Stuart, who made her movie comeback as the aged Rose in "Titanic", playing husband and wife The Wavertons are joined by Melvyn Douglas as the first group of wayfarers.  Their relentless knocking at the front door is met by Boris Karloff playing the scarred, mute and mad butler Morgan.  The hosts of the mansion the peculiar brother and sister team the Horace and Rebecca Femm greet the wet and weary travelers.  The neurotic Horace played by Ernest Thesiger and the deaf Rebeccca played by Eva Moore commence revealing some chilling oddities surrounding their family. They are soon joined by a thickly accented Charles Laughton and his girlfriend Gladys played by Lilian Bond.  The group is subjected to a scary overnight stay as they wait out the passing of the storm.  Exploration of the upper floors of the mansion reveals the presence of the bed ridden 102 year old father of the Femms played by white whiskered actress(!)Elspeth Dudgeon.  She reveals that the mad oldest son Saul, a pyromaniac is locked in his room.  She fears that the drunken Karloff will release him to wreak havoc on the house and its visitors.  Whale using his horror flick regulars Karloff and Thesiger successfully creates a romantic yet anxiety laced flick using an effectively constructed setting to evoke feelings of dread.  The fine cast expertly captures the spirit with which Whale desired the film to be portrayed 
 Deceptive Bends was the beginning of the end for 10cc.  The band had split into two bands: 10cc and Godley & Creme.  "How Dare You" was the magnum opus, and in my view the best album that 10cc came out with, not to mention one of the best albums of a decade that was full of amazing albums.  But now the year was 1977 and Graham Gouldman and Eric Stewart regrouped and came back with a beautiful pop album that showed a subtle change in the 10cc sound.  The interesting thing is that for all the wonderfully quirky pop art that filled the first four albums that included Godley & Creme, the music was still alive with fresh ideas and inventive productions, just a bit less cerebral.  Sure, this was no "Consequences", Godley & Creme's first album that was full of high art but lacking in accessibility; but Deceptive Bends has so many infectious melodies and grooves that it intensified what made this band so attractive in the first place... The pleasure of invention.   Every song on this album has become (more or less) a highlight for me, including the bonus tracks.  But the first side of the album is definitely the stronger half.  It is rare to have a perfect album- in my mind there are very few of those.  But I've got to give Deceptive Bends five stars nonetheless, because take away few missteps and you have a pop masterpiece.   Bloody Tourists continued the success of inventive pop music that Deceptive Bends had brought- it was the weaker of the two but still was mostly great.    I think the music declined somewhat after that for 10cc.  That's not to say Look Hear, Ten Out Of 10, or Windows In The Jungle aren't strong albums- they just don't have the allure that the albums up to Bloody Tourist have; Ten Out Of 10 probably being the strongest of the three.   One note: I though it was interesting how close the guitar solo on "The Things We Do For Love" sounds like the guitar solo from "Killer Queen" by Queen. 
 Very entertaining!  Jessica & Nick are so cute!  It's cool to watch how celebrities live day-by-day and have the same fights and do simple things as watching TV and laundry just like the rest of us!  It's fun to watch the young couple and how much they love each other.  Unfortunately, their sad divorce keeps it real now, and shows that NOTHING is ever perfect : 
 We do training for companies in a service industry and use this book as part of our program.  It has revolutionized the way we look at customer loyalty. The concepts in this book will help you identify and keep the right kind of customer 
 I have really enjoyed Ms. Slaughter's Tolliver series, and I thought this one would be perhaps not as good (I tend to like it when I've "met" the characters before), but I was wrong.  First of all, the excellent balancing of character viewpoints makes this book a wonderful read. I particularly enjoyed getting different perspectives on the same action. That's always fascinated me, and Ms. Slaughter does it with a good sense of balance and suspense. Just when I think I've got "the" story on how something  happened, I find out there are different viewpoints, and my own understanding shifts and strengthens.  The second reason I enjoyed this book so much is the characters themselves. I am fond of characters whose personalities have been shaped by the circumstances of their difficult pasts, and these characters are definitely that. But they don't fit stereotypes, and they constantly surprise the reader. At least, they surprised me fairly regularly. I also enjoyed knowing more than they did at times. Normally that irritates me, makes me want to throttle the character that just isn't seeing things I'm seeing, but I understood why I sometimes knew more than they did in this book.  Overall, I liked this book and didn't think it was less excellent than the Tolliver mysteries. In fact, it's a good stand-alone that deserves recognition in its own right 
 What an engaging book of essays! I bought this on a hunch and am finding it simply absorbing. The stories are gently told and the insights hilarious, biting, kind, piercing. They are about people, towns, food, war, beauty, ugliness. I am even starting to understand the cultish following in the food community for MFK although her writings are as much about food as anything else. Her memories make me want to ask my mother and grandmother if it was like that for them, too. She speaks freely as if one is in the room with her thoughts, honored by the invitation 
 My now 20 month old little boy lives for Agner's bath books.  It's amazing how much his vocabulary has improved using these books during bath time.  He loves to have them read to him, to point to objects when asked to located them, to look at the pictures as if he was reading the books himself, or to just play with them as a toy.  These books are only as good as your creativity on how to share them with your child.  Have fun and watch your child learn ... while bathing!  I highly recommend all four of the Baby Einstein bath books 
 Easy to understand, practical advice for owners or prospective owners of puppies.  Ranks right up there with the books written by the Monks of New Skete 
 This book, and the others in the Air Disaster series (4 volumes as of Oct 2006), are compelling and interesting reads.  Highly Recommende 
 We loved the movie and discovered the sound track. As a New Orleans regular this CD just adds to the mood when we are back home. I predict you'all will jus' love it 
 Fred Ordway has to be the world's leading space historian. If he isn't recognised as such he darned well should be! True to form Fred delivers an outstanding book filled with beautiful reproductions of some of the greatest space art ever painted. In the past fifty years Fred Ordway's contributions to the documentation of man's preoccupation with the heavens has to be unsurpassed. This book is a brilliant and perfect addition to any space enthusiasts collection. Trust me...buy this book 
 I thought this book was great.  I just sat there after I finished it and did a lot of thinking.  He has a lot to say about his family and I felt like taking a particular chapter about his father and mailing it to several members of my own family 
 The devotions in this little book are such a lovely way to begin and end the day. It helps me to center myself in the morning, which can be such a hectic time if you let it.  It reminds me to keep the Big Picture in mind and spirit as I begin my day. It is non-denominational and very inclusive so anyone could use it. In the evening, it is a great way to wind down and pull all the scattered pieces of oneself back together.  I particularly love the Celtic artwork and archetypal symbols included on each page. 
 I am a believer now.    I bought this because I saw a demonstration on QVC.  I really needed a great scrub since I use a spray tan and a great exfloliator helps.    I'm not sure what amazing grace really smells like, but I liked this smell.  Its not over-powering and not over-perfumed.  Its got a nice clean smell.  I have a bottle of the expensive Peter Thomas Roth scrub but find that the philosophy brand actually holds together and you can feel the scrub.  There is no dripping.  This is truly a great rough exfoliator.  As for the warming sensation, I didnt feel it.    Buy it at sephora where you can return it if you're not satisfied.  
 She's a fabulous writer and this series is a great example of her ability to capture and hold a readers attention. I couldn't wait for the other 2 books of this series to come out! Now that I've read them all I would definitely recommend them to anyone who likes a little romance, mystery, humor and a little ghost talk thrown in for good measure! 
 Bobbie Ann Mason is one of the modern masters of the short story, and to see why all you have to do is pick up this collection. The stories all have a melancholy feel and are simple stories of rural Kentucky. They do at times tend to be very similar, so it is best to break this collection up with something else. But reading this shows you the skill Mason has with the short story, and why so many students love her work. I especially loved the touching story "Drawing Names.&quot 
 Of all the books on the market today about simplicity this one speaks directly to the Christian. It explains why many of us may feel drawn to the simple life. What would Jesus do? This is more than a book about how to save money, buy at thrift stores, and save the earth. It speaks to the soul 
 what can i write about this book that hasn't already been said before? its great, and obviously a great deal of care was taken when this book was put together. recommended for cutters, ex-cutters, goths, punks, and any other "outsiders" in general 
 I grew up in the midst of 80's hair metal and was never a big fan of the blues.   That is until I heard Crossfire on the radio and my hair stood on end.  I was never the same since.  I think everyone remembers the first time they were slapped in the face by Stevie's playing.  It was an epiphany..I now understood what the blues, and on a deeper level, music,  was all about.  My voyage into a whole new realm of musical enjoyment had begun, and to this day I could never thank Stevie enough.   And even after having said all this, this DVD was just as life changing as when I heard Stevie for the first time.  And I guarantee, one listen to his playing "Texas Flood" here will convince you that this man had a direct, wide open, and unfiltered connection right to the heart of the blues. It is absolutely amazing.  I don't care what style of music you have been enjoying till now, watching this performance will affect you, change you, and floor you 
 David Kersh was another artist going through the mill with his first album, the way most artists have to these days; the creation of "art" is generally watered down so the idiots who program radio  stations can understand it.  A tragedy, to be sure.  But the beauty of the  thing is this; if the powers that be get lucky and a hit song finds its way  to the surface, the artist often gets a little more control over how the  second album gets done.  If this is the case, the result is always  perceived as "growth," but the truth is, everybody else left the  guy alone on the decision-making process just a little.  Well, David had  this chance on his second effort, and it's all the better for it.  The guy  knows what he likes, and he sounds like he's having pure fun on this  release.  "Anything With Wheels" is an example of where country  music should've been headed a long time ago.  Sure, the songs are  definitely "radio-ready," but the quality of David as a vocalist  shines through strong and clear.  The songs translate well to his live  performances, which border on frenzied, with a super-tight band and great  production.  On top of that, the guy's beautiful to look at.  David Kersh  is the real deal, and this listener can't wait for his next outing 
 As Pink said nothing can top her 2nd album. Which is true, but try this is not bad at all. I just found a way to download all her tracks. When I first heard the samples to this disc I hated it all. I thought Pink lost her carisma that she had on her other 2 cds. Lately, I've been trying to find a way to enjoy the samples because Pink always turns out good. I realize when you listen to each song as a whole the cd is good. Like I do enjoy it, but I can't give it 5 stars. I love you Pink. Her latest cd out I'm not dead is the best. One thing about Pink she can't top her other albums because they are each worthy. That's good enough. She fell short a little on this cd because of the views, but the cd is not bad at all. Now she's back in the spotlight and look how many albums she sold. Pink is amazing. I love how she have fun through cursing, everything about her.  P!n 
 Auster's The New York Trilogy is compelling, haunting and a beautiful work of genius. All 3 stories are unique and engaging. Auster is the best modern writer in America. --From the Author of the Cyclops Hammer. 
 Although I imagined that this film would be shown as authentically as was possible, I was terribly disappointed that I had no option to view it with the original, German, intertitles. There were, of course, English ones, that were quite well created using the German ones as a guide, typestyle and all, which I thought was a great touch, but I did expect that I would at least have the option of seeing it in its original form, and then also have the option for English subtitles, or maybe even better, intertitles. As a student of German, and that being one of the reasons I ordered this DVD, I was very disapppointed in its lack of "original film as created" option. Otherwise, a great mountain film, with specatacular natural vistas captured and a feeling of the time and the place which lingers on in a modern person's mind and imagination! Quite a great experience, but just a little disappointing for the German student 
 I am not super talented in the kitchen , just a mom trying to feed two little food sensitive children and not let them be deprived of desserts, who got tired of Pamela's brownie mix and was ready for a new challenge. This is a very well researched and written cookbook and the only gluten free, dairy free and soy book that I have heard of. I have tried some of the prepackaged flour mixes to make things like pancakes and muffins and not had great results. Recipes that I found online were not that great either.  This book includes a good variety of recipes that have, so far, yielded some very tasty results. There were some ingredients that I had difficulty finding or could not find at all. For instance, vanilla pods were expensive and not easy to come by. I am still unable to locate coconut butter which would be great since soy free margarines are impossible to find. Some of the suggested ingredients are available through online sources that are listed in the books resources.  I found the introduction and definitions of ingredients to be very helpful and the pictures are an inspiration. I leave this book on my cookbook stand because it is so gorgeous and whenever I get a minute or two we get right to making flan and cookies. These are good looking cookies that I am proud to share with everyone.  People are very ready to reject them as sub-standard when they hear that they have no wheat or dairy and they can't because they're too good.  I look forward to the challenge of the more difficult recipes and to mixing her flour mixture to try in other recipes.  Worth every penny for the smiles they put on the kids faces 
 Despite the nearly unanimous reviews of excellence for this book from both professional and Amazon reviewers, I must slightly dissent.    The author gives an excellent portrayal of the environment surrounding the peace conference of 1919 to finalize the end of the Great War.  She provides the reader with the moods of each allied leader and does not hesitate to offer unflattering portraits of how each leader related with on another and impacted on the final treaty.  On these matters, the author was at her strongest.  For example, I did not know about the hostile atmosphere surrounding the German delegates by the hotel staff and that one German was so injured (by a thrown rock) that the French government paid for her head injury.    Another of the book's strengths, though, is also a weakness.  The author was so desirous of inserting salacious details in every available spot, that the historical story was sometimes lost amid the gossipy tone.  Another difficulty was the author gave so many intricate details about matters of far less significance to the total story, and then she seemed to rush the ending, which contained the more essential concern of the treaty, i.e., the German surrender.    The latter was very bothersome to me, but more so were the author's conclusions that the treaty was less to blame for the resulting troubles in Europe than what historians have traditionally assumed.  Her point is not without validity, but instead of developing this thesis with strong supporting analysis, she tosses out a few facts and wraps up the book as if no more need be said.  In so doing, she gives grave injustice to other facts that lead to opposite conclusions and she stalwartly utilizes a Eurocentric attitude that sounds more like rationalization than explanation.    Perhaps if the author were more judicious in editing the side bars throughout her book, she would have had more space for a deeper discussion of what is certainly the main thrust of her book, which is the Paris treaty is due more respect than that of being the fuel waiting for Hitler's match.    
 And definitely not my last.  If you are looking for a suspense thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat through the entire book...till you finish it at 3:00am with a loud WHOA!, then this is your book.  He gives you a twist at the end and when you are content and think it's over, he throws one more twist at you that catches you off guard and leaves you wondering how someone like Harlan Coben can be such a genius and write so well.  I love this book!  Also, try his other books, "Tell No One", "The Innocent", and "No Second Chance".  Those are my other favorites 
 This may even be better than Feint of Art, the first in this series. The lead character, Annie Kincaid, is smart, funny, irreverent, balanced, and believable. These authors do a great job creating three dimensional characters and then putting them in implausible situations, justified by Annie's past (and her grandfather's present) in the underworld of masterpiece-level art. It's a blast to read, with just enough real art knowledge so that you're learning between the laughs, which are plentiful 
 Reading this book was a very validating experience for me.  Growing up in Christian dominated America, I often found myself bewildered by many of the commonly accepted Christian stances: its okay to kill people on death row, but not an unborn fetus; euthanasia is okay for a sick dog, but not a sick person; its okay to kill animals for sport and war is okay too, but 'thou shalt not kill'; stopping premarital sex and gay marriage is more important than saving the 24,000 people who die of hunger each day.    Singer presents a clear cut ethical stance and follows it through to all of the tough issues facing man today.  He offers no apologies and he doesn't back down from his stance when he reaches controversial conclusions.  He also explains where others have gone wrong in trying to address these very tough ethical questions.  Additionally, I really enjoyed Singers writing style.  Ethics can definitely be a dry subject but Singer brings it to life with telling examples and narratives.  The book is divided into easily digestible sections, and Singer builds a foundation in early chapters which he uses to develop more complex stances about abortion, infanticide, euthanasia, animal rights, the environment, the obligation to assist, etc.  Many of the conclusions in this book are hard to grasp against the current moral backdrop of the Western world, but Singer lays them out in a logical sequence that makes them hard to refute.  I am not a Christian, but this book helped to show me just how influenced even I have been by Christian morality.  We all need to take a look at our ideas about ethics and realize where they come from.  This book may be a difficult read for some, but I think that is all the more reason that this book is a MUST read.  
 This record beams with creative confidence. The exciting part is that it's the product of a band who's just beginning to develop their sound and artistic vision but have already taken their work to a level of maturity and complexity that rivels many of their contemporaries. Easily one of the best albums of 2006. Beautiful, lush instrumentation while maintaining a creeping, living feeling through the album. The production is phenomenal and allows each banjo note and flute embilishment to both comfort and inspire. I haven't heard an album in a long time that creates such a rich listening experience as this one. It really stands out amongst the other praised indie-rock records of this year (and the recent past, for that matter) as it inspires imagery and landscapes that most popular music has seemingly lost.   Also, the album artwork looks a lot better than Amazon's image gives it credit for...   : 
 This DVD is very good sound quality and the the footage is spectacular. But it lists the songs on the back and they are not in order some are in special features 
  Do you like jokes? Well I've got just what you're looking for. READ Runny Babbit. It is the funniest book ever. Instead of saying all the right things he says all the wrong things like "here is my bat" insead of "where is my hat". It is so funny. Read to find out why the book is funny. You will love this book. So READ IT! Recommended for kids who love jokes. 
 This book exposes the essential Quantum Mechanical topics in a non-traditional order, and explores more advaced subjects as well, without losing clarity. The notation is easier to follow than most graduate level text books. Particularly good chapters are those concerning to Quantization of Radiation and Second Quantization 
 A good read.  Hurston does an excellent job of depicting the parallel experiences of the captivity of the Israelites and the American Slave.  In fact, one could argue that the experience of the Israelites is the American  Slave experience. This is a great book for high school reading, it provides  a variety of cause and effect themes that all young adults need to know;  among them, if you oppress a people or person you breed fear, insecurity,  and eventual self hatred in that human. I highly recommend Their Eyes Were  Watching God another of Hurston's literary jewels. jewels 
 For the last 30 years, when I've read Bible storybooks to my own children or others, and now my grandchildren, I've winced, usually at the moralistic finger-wagging tone.  I kept thinking I'd write one someday, but now I don't have to!  This is it - a captivating story that truly does point to Jesus on every page.  My six-year-old grandson loves this Bible.  I'm spreading the news to anyone I know who has, or who works with, young children.  And I'll especially promote it with women who are just coming to faith themselves, because as they read this to their children, it will whet their appetites to open the Scriptures for themselves. 
 Srini's holistic approach in addressing the supply chain made this an easy read even for someone without major lean manufacturing experience. So many times, business books only address one segment of an audience. His emphasis on synergistic application of lean principles brings home the importance of applying the lean philosophy to all layers of the organization. Too many times professionals outside the manufacturing arena feel that they have no influence on lean applications. He highlights that marketing and sales have an important role play when implementing and managing an efficient lean system. This book offers many examples and principles that can help many organizations develop a strategy for the highly competitive business world 
 The Seven Last Words from the Cross come from the various pieces in the gospel stories of the crucifixion.  They are, according to the King James Version, as follows:    'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.' (Luke 23:34)  'Verily I say unto thee, today thou shalt be with me in Paradise.' (Luke 23: 43)  'Woman, behold thy son! ... Behold thy mother!' (John 19:27)  'My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?' (found in Mark 15: 34 and Matthew 27:46, also in Psalm 22:1)  'I thirst.' (John 19:28)  'It is finished.' (John 19:30)  'Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.' (Luke 23:46, also Psalm 31)  Fleming Rutledge, a priest in the Episcopal church, has developed this small book based on meditations on these seven words from Jesus.  These are statements that have been used as inspiration for meditation and works of art in the many centuries since the time of the crucifixion, and remain inspiring texts to this day.  Rutledge developed these as meditations for the Three Hours of Good Friday, and delivered them in churches in Columbus, Georgia in 2002 and Boston, Massachusetts in 2003.  Such services on Good Friday usually involve hymns; Rutledge has incorporated stanzas from various hymns to give the reader a fuller sense of the services.  However, these reflections stand alone very well.    Rutledge is skillful at incorporating the modern with the ancient, the timely with the timeless.  Through it all, she relates the crucifixion with honesty and detail to the our lives.  Her method is fairly inductive; however, it tends to start and end with the words of Jesus.  Rutledge makes the claim that we are in the grip of something we cannot fully comprehend, but that the prayers of Jesus, even as he was undergoing humiliation and degradation on the cross, reach something deep inside of us even to this day, and pierce through the darkness in ways that no other event could do.  Rutledge relates the aspects of the individual gospels as well as the collective memories - for example, all four gospellers recall that Jesus was crucified among thieves, common criminals; on the other hand, not all gospellers record the same words, so the fullness of the seven words comes from taking all the stories together, even in the paradox of our sometimes difficult task in reconciling the events as recorded.  Perhaps the most beautiful aspects of Rutledge's work are when she gives her personal memories, or personal stories shared by others.  She recalls in the text that she had a particular theology professor who tragically lost his only son, his only child, at a relatively young age; the professor put to words his grief and task in life in terms of these statements of Jesus - we live our lives, he said, between 'My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me,' and 'Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.'  On this Good Friday, may your spirit be blessed.  Rutledge's book is a blessing during the passion, during Eastertide, and at any point in the year.   
    I have 1 boy and 2 girls, I grew up with strawberry shortcake! I love her! My 3 yr old likes her. I bought this movie for my 3 and 1 yr old daughters and they really enjoyed this movie. My 3 yr old didn't like the purple pie man she said he was a little scary. But he isn't scary just bad!  It doesn't compare to the old strawberry shortcake but it's the new strawberry shortcake for this generation! 
 This is another collection of Barry's columns and a surefire hit for any fan.  As usual, his columns pack a punch and end with a zinger or inside joke.  Mr. Language Person makes an appearance or two in this collection, and Barry also takes on TV commericials, his relationship with his wife, and (always a winner) the life of his teenaged son.  Recommended 
 I was disappointed in the third book in the series and almost didn't get the next one. I'm very glad I did! Lion in the Valley is the best Amelia Peabody so far. Finally, the "mystery" gets going and the supporting characters get interesting. The Master Criminal is hilarious. I really began to like Amelia a lot more in this book. I thoroughly enjoyed this one 
 Covers all the bases.  Explains benifits, pitfalls and patience required to network effectively 
 Happiness - A Guide to Developing Life's Most Important Skill covers so much territory.  This is my first introduction to Matthieu Ricard but woven in the book is the story of his life.  Ricard traces his early adult life in France and a promising career in cellular genetics.  A career he gave up to study Buddihism.  He is now a Buddhist Monk and writes from that perspective. There is no question that Buddhism has some valuable insights into what life is all about and how best to live a fulfilled life.  One of the most contrasting differences between Buddhism and Western society is the way we view death.  For the most part, Western society deals with death in a very unsatisfactory manner.  Buddhism on the other hand understand and accepts death as a normal and natural end to life.  I think our society would be better off if we could handle death better.  There is another sharp difference in how Western society carries so much mental baggage throughout life, while the Buddhist work to clear their mind of guilt, resentment, hatred and other negative emotions.  "What a relief it is for the burdened man who has long walked through the world of suffereing to lay down his heavy and useless load."  Although the book deals with some very deep and complex subject matter, it is well written and easy to understand.  There is extensive citing of the source material in the appendix.  While the answer to so many of life's puzzles seem so clear, it is also clear that very few in Western society will ever dig deeply into these concepts.  Unfortunately we are always looking for the quick fix.  We seem to want to take a magic pill and make things right.  Ricard shows us a way to achieve what ever human strives for.  But it is very doubtful that many will be willing to make the changes necessary to achieve true happiness 
 Finally, an easy to read, practical guide written by a woman who has  survived the tramatic experiences of separation and divorce.  It's a great  book for woman faced with the many challenges of living alone and raising  children.  The author writes from the heart, first-hand, what is important  at this time, what steps should be taken, what others can do, what legal  actions are necessary, and much more, to survive this painful journey.   This book provides a pathway for women to take charge of their situation  and to grow from their experiences 
 I listen to books on tape constantly and when you get a reader and a story that can take you away, it is a find!  Nothing annoys me more than a poor or monotoned reader or one who places inflections in inappropriate places, like news readers.  I loved the sound effects coupled with an excellent reader and the two added to the experience of listening to this book.  I also liked that the story was partly done in first person.  The main character initially doesn't seem to have much to offer the world.....  Anyway, there are others who have diagramed the story, I just wanted to say, I enjoyed it and the way it was presented in audio version. 
 This is a tale of a few good mens struggle to - against all odds and against the most powerfull man in the world - find the truth and see that justice is served. A must read to all reporters and ï¿½ll democratic minded people 
 Take this book with you when you visit Jamestown this year.  2007 is the 400th anniversary of its founding. This is an excellent account of the (still active) archaeological dig at Jamestown. The author is the primary investigator at the Jamestown site. Mr. Kelso and his team have done a wonderful job uncovering and reconstructing life in the first successful English colony in America. Not only will you learn about life in 17th century Jamestown, but you'll learn about the art and science of archaeology as well 
 Like many Americans in the 70's, I somehow never got a good listen to this one (fifth album, recorded at Abby Road studios) back then, but I had seen it before in others record collections (especially when I was in Europe).  On the inner cover the inscription reads: "The only Rolling Stone Album of the Year never to sell a million - typical!".  How the #$^* did that happen?  It is easy to just figure that if it wasn't more popular, there must be a reason ... DON'T MAKE THAT MISTAKE!  This is a lost classic!! The lack of sales was a case of badly handled promotion (Motown Rare Earth) and publicity ... at least in America, to our detriment!  I'm listening to it AGAIN now (it has been like afternoon tea these days), I just don't get sick of it at all and regularly jam to it on guitar, bass & drums.  Yes, I'm a sucker for these old-school acid-rock albums ... they really inspire me for some reason.  The artwork and additions are great as well!  For starters, the package on this limited addition import remaster is top  shelf - they really pulled out the stops to give this band and album the  classy presentation they deserve.  The original lyrics are included with  many cool pictures (promotional and album art) and a long essay with band  history, thoughts and remembrances.  A track by track explanation is added as well, although formal notes would have been helpful for the complete picture.    There is something represented about what I love from the era in just about all of the songs, although it is hard to describe - Kind of an emotional, not intellectual basis in most cases.  The songs go all over the place and play on many an emotion, which makes sense considering the disconnected 1970's were just beginning and the intense, idealistic psychedelic 60's were fading fast.  That is part of the key - Buffalo Springfield, The Dead, J.Airplane, Moody Blues, Beatles & The Byrds (and many others) seem to have been an influence from the 60's, but there is a walloping dose of a Deep Purplish, Zeppelin, Doors, Floyd, early Chicago & Cream (even Hendrix) feel often too (among others) bringing an underlying heavyish feel.  Yes, Parachute is kind of the best of both worlds in a way ... one of those rare albums!  Picture it (cover): Love, Peace and mellow thoughts cruising in the '69 Z-28 down the highway with your girlfriend snuggling up close after 2001 Space Odyssey, but anxious to get back to the Marshall amp, Strat & Crybaby (and the latest colorful import - Yes this IS stoner music).   Musicianship shines all over Parachute too!  Skip Alan's muscular drum  intro (took over from prior drummer Twink) kicks everything off nicely, you get a sense that you just might be in for a treat.  New 18 year old  guitarist Peter Tolson just joined the band and provides the bad-ass,  explosive guitar riffs and chunky chords throughout (often through a  Leslie).  This formation of the band has great chemistry and form a  short-lived but excellent combo (with Wally, Phil and Jon).  The vocal  harmonies are usually very good and the older members provide a Pretty  Things core formation on the melodic/harmonic side (great bass on here  too).  A few eclectic instruments are heard here and there with no notes as to who performed on them.    I hesitate getting into which song I like for whichever reason - There are 13 songs on the original album, most outstanding examples of trippy rock (Mr.Square/She Was Tall, In The Square, Rain, Midnight Circus, Grass, She's a Lover and the Parachute fade are favorites so far).  Six GREAT extras are included: Blue Serge Blues is a first rate song making fun of the British police's hippie busting (sounds a bit like the Airplane), if these are throwaways ...?  October 26 about the presumably about the Russian revolution but winking at the 60's revolutionaries in general - There are some nice biting and sharp guitar wah leads flowing through the languid atmosphere of the song.  Cold Stone is a head slammer 70's anthem style: "This world is just cold stoned" ... presaging many a 70's blues rock band (think Humble Pie).  Stonehearted Momma "really make it hard on me" is the classic rock 'n' roll male lament with some totally  pulsating heavy guitar power chords and doubled guitar talkbox/echo eads - OH YES, no holds are barred with this band!  Summer Time is a Youngbloods/Allman's sounding happy-go-lucky rollicking jam that is charming as that tulip on the cover (close your eyes and your there, sun on your face).  Circus Mind is a nice closer for this extended version - a parable for the whole scene, I can relate ... go ahead and take his hand (cover).  A little over 63 minutes of head-swimming fun, TURN IT UP AND ENJOY OFTEN! 
 After catching Lean on Me on cable recently I decided to purchase my own DVD copy of this 1989 movie. It's a movie devoted to those who love kids and educate them day in and day out. I am so happy there is a movie that teaches through tough love you can succeed in everyday living. This is what Crazy Joe (Morgan Freeman) inspired in this film. The supporting cast is first rate. Despite some of the language in this I liked everything about it. If you want to see something so powerful, go out and watch Lean on Me! You won't regret it! 
 The law is a deep subject , this book is geared for the average American.  Some anecdotes are provide of Justice O'connor's career path, an explanation of the lifestyle of a Supreme Sourt justice, a little history  of the law and the United States.  The latter part of the book  explains the Amendments,  The author comes into her own on womens rights.   I generally would not read a law book, but the style of explaining the constitution and law did not put me off.  Giving a little historical background for each amendment, appealed to me.  I found the book very rewarding for the information it contained,  rewarding as a quick summary of an area I would not otherwise have read about.   
 This book is not a memoir in the traditional sense, or even directly about Brinkley.  Instead, Brinkley has composed a collection of essays recounting, as mentioned in the subtitle, the people, places and events that have captured his interest during his career as a television journalist.  These compositions provide glimpses into the past sixty years, and are both observant and humorous.  Brinkley helps shed some light on the second half of the twentieth century, and in doing so, also provides us a glimpse into his own personality.  Through his insights and reactions, we can just begin to get a glimmer of the man behind the familiar face 
   This book is truly entertaining--the characters come alive with the narrator's keen wit and wisdom.  Small town fun using educated prose 
 Actually I saw the movie many years back and, remembering that and recently reading another Doctorow book, I decided to pick this one up when I noticed it in a store. The tale of a ramshackle little western town on the edge of nowhere in the Dakota territory, deriving its lifeblood from a nearby mine, WELCOME TO HARD TIMES grabs us from the beginning with its brutal portrayal of the town's destruction at the hands of a monster of a man who is to remain nameless for much of the tale, a natural force more than a fellow human being. The Bad Man from Bodie savagely rapes and callously kills those in his path including the town whores, the barkeep, the carpenter, the undertaker, the hangers-on, leaving only a few scattered survivors in his wake, after burning the town around them to the ground. In the shadow of his departure, with little hope and much desperation, the handful of survivors rebuild, mainly for want of anything else to do. And the town, after a rigorous winter, prospers. But the mood throughout is ominous and the memory of the Man fron Bodie never far below the surface of the broken people he leaves behind. Doctorow writes with subtlety and irony and his telling is as tight as it gets. Yet I found the ending, deliberately muddled, I suppose, to mimic the sense of collapse, rather a letdown after the crisp narrative that comes before. All breaks down, in the end, in a sudden revelation about the sustaining source of the town's hopes and the Bad Man from Bodie returns without notice, just abruptly appearing in the maelstrom of collapse. This time is a little different from the first in the town's response to the Bad Man, or at least in how the self-proclaimed town mayor and narrator responds. But the results are no less redolent of life's despair and futility. Although the characters are more than the Western stereotypes they at first appear to be, they do not rise above their situations but are sucked sadly back into the storm that blows down upon them from the larger world outside. They are a sad lot and so, we sense, are we all, doomed to live out our lives in hope and desperate striving but never able to gain a foothold in the rock to take us above the level of the town of Hard Times and the life it offers us. This is a fable, writ on Western rock, of living and dying. More subtle and many-layered than the movie it inspired, in the end it is a book of hopelesness and of the raggedness of life itself. -- SW 
 I read a few not so favorable reviews, mostly stemming from problematic attachment of the stand (which mine does not suffer), but I decided to order it anyway, figuring the potential upside eclipses any issues with the stand (you can also wall mount it).  Well it has paid off, as the magnets work as promised, the tines stay sealed tight, and the tops rotate to open two different sized outlets for the spices.  I pitched the included spices and filled it with my own.  As for labels, there are many clear preprinted labels available for purchase here or elsewhere to accommodate your own spices.  I honestly have never seen a better designed spice rack, and it has worked beautifully 
 I've used this book in my fifth grade classroom for many years--and for quilt ideas at home.  I'm purchasing another copy for a friend who is just starting her career as an art teacher--and she is also an avid quilter!  Projects are great and can be adapted for every age level--highly recommended 
 It is so wonderful to hear this album together with my child.  I am looking forward to sharing this album with my new baby as well.  My family is from Cuba and although my Abuela (grandmother) and Papi (father) are no longer with us, this album captures the songs they would share with my children.  It is hard though, to listen to songs like Drueme Negrita, a favorite that my Dad would sing to me when I was young without shedding a tear.  Hearing these special songs reminds me that my family and heritage are always with me.  For anyone else it is enrichment for the child to hear songs in other languages with a different tempo and style.  I highly recommend this for adults and kids alike 
 This was a great read.  Very well-written.  It covered more than any other film book.  I especially liked the exploitation stuff and how it mixed with art films: the yin and yang of indie cinema 
        Buchanan(B)has done his homework.He goes back to the founding of the American Republic in 1787 and shows that every single war with a foreign power(War of 1812,Mexican American War of 1846-48,Spanish American war of 1898) and/or military action(1802-1803 battles with Tripoli pirates) engaged in up until the aftermath of the Spanish American War(McKinley's claim that God had told him to  sieze  the Philippines combined with  the subsequent defeat of Filipino patriots in the war of 1902-03) involved clearcut,direct threats to American borders/interests. It is the period from 1899 ,starting with the completely unjustified war against Filipino patriots,through the eight years of the Woodrow Wilson administration,1912-1920,that American military force is used in situations where no direct/indirect threat to American interests/borders starts to be undertaken .The best book to read concerning these unjustified military operations is still Marine General Smedley Butler's account.The main conclusion that can be derived from B's careful analysis of the historical record is that the term "isolationist"is a gravely inaccurate description of those Americans who opposed American entry into World Wars I and II,the Vietnam war and/or the second Iraq war of 2003-2006(?).One can,of course, disagree with the arguments put forth by those who opposed entry into these wars(i.e.,direct American interests were at stake).However,to label them as "isolationists", in an attempt to avoid having to meet  their arguments head on,is simply nonsensical 
 i like this book because it tells you to never give up and have fun even if you are losing 
 I didnt want to give this album a chance because the first single dem boyz is kind of weak. But I gave it a shot and was a little bit surprised. Standout tracks: Felonies, No talkin, Dont put your hands on me, gangstas etc. Filler: Still slizzard, b----es and bizness, if you a thug and happy jamz. Happy jamz might have been okay if it wasnt for the dull beat and sloppy singing by jazze pha. The group's fatal flaw is the dead weight Jody Breeze. Felonies could've easily been a classic if it wasnt for Jody Breeze's non-rhyming verse. If that werent eneough he ruined P---y MFs with a verse that had nothing to do with the title. Example: I got a dame from France so freaky that she sleeps in a three point stance. Now tell me what does that have to do with p---y mfs? Nothing. Even Trick Daddy's verse was better than that. The only members that hold up this album is Big Gee, Big Duke and Young Jeezy (surprisingly!). Jody Breeze brought this album down bad! All in all this album is good but they can never touch NWA especially when one of their members (guess who? LOL) needs to step his rap game up immediately 
 The music takes a little bit to grow on you, but boy, does it!  It's wonderful, charming, romantic, funny--just like the play itself.  I loved almost every song and I was really impressed with "Long As I'm Here With You"-- I thought it was an old song written back in the twenties, because it so sounded like one. The cast is absolutely energetic and endearing, and Sutton Foster just *rocks*.  Definitely worth the money. 
 I found this book to be most informative and interesting. Horn paints a picture of a dysfunctional settlement that barely endured long enough to become a colony. The conventional wisdom is that the Jamestown settlers were adventurers and younger sons of nobility who sought easy riches and refused to do the work necessary to sustain a settlement such as building and planting. In contrast, the Puritans in New England were hard working, pious, and a much better model for American colonization. I don't know whether the Puritan myth is true, but Horn seems to agree that Jamestown's myth is fairly accurate.   He seems to be ambivalent about John Smith: while he doesn't seem to like Smith much, he describes him as one of the few seeking to get the settlement self-sustaining rather than putting up with idleness and depending on the Indians for food. In this portrayal Smith is very arrogant and makes some serious mistakes, but no more than others, and he does try to establish productive relations with the Indians, which subsequent leaders failed to do.   I particularly liked the author's liberal use of quotations from source material. They made the narrative more lively and more personal. I hope Dr. Horn keeps writing.  
 I like this toy.I played with it for 3 hours."KIm Palmer" your daughter is a crybaby.Why did she even cried just because she couldn't scan with the scanner.I thought you said your daughter was smart 
 A 400 year saga of the chesapeake, Michener at his best. Great history, believable and engaging characters. A recommended read.  
 Here is another book I would take along with me if I were banished to a tiny island to live in seclusion. "Night Shift" is a compilation filled with so much quivering madness from King's imagination, it's a wonder the book doesn't slither in the hand. In the stories presented here, King proves that he can write as powerfully in short form as he does with his epic length novels. Here are a nearly two dozen stories that are as fascinating, frightening, disturbing or humorous the third or fourth or fifth time you read them. As he does so well, King creates vivid characters, demands that you love or hate them, and then thrusts you all into an absurd situation. Among my favorites:  "I am the Doorway," an astronaut comes back from a mission to Venus with, let's say, handy new abilities.  "Quitters Incorporated:" Quit smoking or we will rape your wife, beat your kid or subject them to the electric shock room. This is a story ever smoker should read.  "The Mangler," ever wonder if a big, snarling laundry machine got pissed of and ran amok? Of course you have.  "Gray Matter," a lazy beer swiller gets ahold of some bad brew and turns into mold. Hey, laugh all you want. It's scarier than you think.  "Trucks," later made into a movie. But only in written form can King really bring home the idea of the world's cars and trucks taking over the planet with a collective conscience.  "Sometimes They Come Back," the original idea that mutated into "Pet Semetery."  "The Ledge," a wealthy madman bets another man his life if he can walk around a top floor of a high rise building on a very narrow ledge. A story that inspires acrophobia. "I Know What You Need," man, if I could know exactly what a young woman likes and then provide it for her, well... I'll just stop right there.  "Children of the Corn," an extremely creepy story about Nebraska cornfields and the young people who live among the rows. "Night Shift" is full of gems. A must have for any King fan and a great introduction for those random weirdos who are not yet familiar with his work 
 Bones is one of my favorite TV series. This one episode I missed so I had to get it to keep on track. Great show even if you have never seen it from the begining 
 the book is informative and very well written with explicit "how to" instructions.  Written especially for people with more than 20 pounds to lose who want to win the weight battle once and for all. 
  Although I never owned Enron stock, I have heard a lot about Enron on the local TV news because I live in Houston, where Enron was headquartered. So I was very interested in reading "The Smartest Guys In The Room." From Enron's beginnings, where Ken Lay's Houston Natural Gas was acquired by InterNorth, yet became the dominant partner in the merger, to it's end with the filing of the largest bankruptcy case in U.S. history, McLean and Elkind tell the whole sad story of Enron, with the blame for Enron's and Arthur Anderson's (the accounting firm destroyed by the scandal) mainly lying with Lay, the CEO more obsessed with the trappings of the CEO position rather than the responsiblities, Jeff Skilling, who installed the corrosive culture that turned many Enron employees into SOBs who thought they were better than everyone else and prevented Enron from being saved by Dynegy, installed the mark-to-market accounting system that ultimately showed Enron's profits were actually losses and was obsessed with the big ideas, or enchiladas that wasted so much money even as Skilling said those big ideas were profitable right now and Andy Fastow, the ex-CFO whose Global Finance team created all the accounting games that made Enron appear profitable even as he secretly enriched himself behind Lay's and Skilling's backs. Neither are other executives like Rebecca Mark, Lou Pai, Ken Rice, Cliff Baxter, Tim Belding and Greg Whalley spared by the authors, who expose their arrogance in black and white as well. In retrospect, it's just as well that one Enron trader's dream about ExxonMobil buying Enron and Skilling becoming CEO of ExxonMobil never came true because the Enron disaster would have hit a lot more people, myself included. I will be content with imagining Skilling and Fastow in jail, two of the smartest guys in the room stripped of all their power and prestige and having to live with that fact if they ever face reality and admit what they did was not only wrong, but also ruined so many lives 
 The music at the start of the CD is scarey and I don't know why he used it. After you get by that its ok. He is very good at explaining the steps and if you watch it a few times you'll get the hang of it. 
 I am currently going through one of the blackest and darkest times of my life. I have wanted to read this book for a long time and have had it in my hand several times, but never did buy it. My financial situation will not allow me to buy any new books, so I thought that I would check to see if the local library had a copy. It had an older edition of this book,which I immediately snapped out. Phillip Yancey has a way of tackling hard questions that most other Christian writers wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole. This book is no exception. I think every Christian (whether they admit or not) has wondered at one time or another "Is God Hidden, Is God silent, and  Is God unfair?" Those are three questions that have been plaging me recently and I am so tired of simplistic answers to questions like these. You can tell that Yancey has wrestled with these same questions. He doesn't offer any quick fixes or easy answers. But he does raise some thought-provoking issues. He causes you to look at your relationship with God  (and His relationship to us)in a new and fresh way. I can definitely understand why Richard felt God was no longer trustworthy. But unlike Richard, I can't just walk away from my faith. This book by Phillip Yancey has reinforced my belief that God is trustworth and that He does care. It has reinforced my belief that God is exactly what and who the Bible portrays Him to be. A quote that I heard a long time ago kept running through my head as I read this book. The quote is by Elizabeth Elliot. "If God were so small, that I, with my limited mind could understand Him, then He would not be big enough for me to worship." I hope I never get to the point where I am arrogant enough to think that I know everything there is to know about God.   I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is going through a dark time and wondering where God is in the midst of intense grief or emotinal pain. 
 Movies don't stick in your memory for forty years for no good reason. This one just would not go away. Low expectations are wonderfully rewarded. The pre-feminist theme of men as mezmerized breeding slaves in a phony underground lunar playground works to perfection. Matriarchal society never looked so good as with this cast of beauty pageant winners. You too will say, "Yes, my Lido!" 
 So Mitchum, Movie Star was human. So. I guess the argument that some on the site regard this as a filmography holds true. Still there is certainly a biographical element laced throughout. But the hearty middle is about the films, and there were many of them, with a rundown of who was involved, where, the story/character, and then the goings on during the filming. Lots of drinking. Lots of humping mostly unknown females, lots of brawls and messin'. There are plenty of first hand accounts of Mitchum's kindness and generosity and many also of his nastiness and callousness. So he was moody? So. I will say an element is missing though. His family must not have supported this because there is relatively little from them, so Lee Server fills in the rest. I do wonder at his wife's putting up with what must have amounted to hundreds of affairs/liasons, and a seeming lack of argument. But there it goes...Who knows what makes a marriage, and after all I've just read an account of a busy and active and influential and rich life, but I'll never know the marrow, and apparently Mitchum's friends didn't even know such depths. I now appreciate him, will look out for his films more then ever, and marvel at some peoples appetite for drinks, brawls, affairs and cigarettes. To conclude, Mitchum is portayed here as a guy who I'd look forward to chatting with.. 
 I love this game! I love the training exercises, being able to compare them with other who creat files on my game, and I especially love the Sudokus!!! I feel smarter already ;- 
 My best friend and I have been searching for this cd for years. It's worth it!!!!!!! 
 I am a big fan of Ra from the moment i heard Do you call my name off the from one record. i didnt even know they had another cd coming out. i saw it in the store and had to have it one of the best cds i own prolly it has great songs on it and i can sit and listen to the whole thing but to me the stand up song would have to be swimming upstream that song is so amazing i have not had one person i've showed it to not like it my girlfriend even likes it and she loves rap that is far from a rap song but if u dont own this album i would prolly have to go out and get it one hell of a c 
 I purchased this book because I had done only enough candymaking to know I wanted to do more.  There were other books with recipes that made me say "gross", but I found myself tagging every page in this book because everything looked so good.  So let me start by saying I do reccommend this book to anyone interested in learning to make treats.   I have since made many recipes from it, and would have probably given it 3 1/2 stars but you can't do half stars on Amazon, so here are my four star reasons:  I have tried about five of the fudge recipes, and if these ladies wrote a fudge book I would be the first to buy it.  Simple and delicious, every fudge is a winner.  I have also made some of the easier fruit and jam/jelly candies, which came out great but are not quite as impressive.  The marshmellow recipes and truffle recipes are also fairly straightfoward and come out wonderfully, I suggest trying these after you have a few of the simpler ones under your belt.  And if you want to make fondant, this is the book for you as nearly one third of the book is devoted to delicious, fairly simple fondants.  Now for the problems.  I have given up on caramels in this book, as I have tried three different recipes a total of seven times and ended up with seven "caramel tiles".  The problem here is that I am following the recipe and have NO IDEA what I am doing wrong.  There are tips on how to recook but that is not my problem, I need a little troubleshooting section.  Also, while the section on tempering chocolate is alright, you will probably need to consult another source because I don't think it is thorough enough for someone who has never tempered chocolate.  So in a nutshell, if you want to go pro, obviously this is not the book for you (maybe you'd be better off in culinary school), but for the average stay-at-home mom (or average anyone, for that matter!) go for it 
 I'm over 50,this book made me fell like life was just begining. Fun reading 
 Arrived quickly and in great shape.  What more can one ask?? 
 What an astonishing and entertaining box set!  This three-disk set with the unwieldy name and robust price tag is one of the best collections I've watched in a long time.  These `films' - some are only thirty seconds long - range in date from 1894 to 1931.  Almost all are silent, save for a couple of experimental sound films.  A comprehensive review is out of the question, so I'll limit myself to short observations on some of my favorites from each disk.   Disk One - Things are kicked off with `Dickson Experimental Sound Film' (ca. 1894), a 15-second film that features two-men dancing and a man playing a violin in front of a huge metal cone, the microphone for the wax cylinder the sound was recorded on.  This set is dotted with experimental movies like this one.  Out of context they're a little mystifying, but this one comes with a short commentary track.  The commentary track lasts a few minutes, and the movie is looped behind it.  All films come with program notes which are found both on-screen (handy) and in a two-hundred page book.  I think a lot of people will get a kick out of the 13-minute `The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' (1910).  It's certainly inventive enough, but the Scarecrow, Tin Man & Lion look different, the Wizard looks creepy, and I was never that much of an Oz fan to begin with.  My favorites from the first disk are the two feature films, at least feature length for their time: `The Invaders' (1912- 41 mins) and `Gretchen the Greenhorn' (1916- 58 mins.)  `The Invaders' is an early western that features real Lakota Sioux playing the indians.  It's a smart film that feels authentic.  `Gretchen the Greenhorn' is a charming story starring the 18-year-old Dorothy Gish (Lillian's little sister) as a young Dutch girl joining her father in America.  There's an innocence and a sincerity to it that I found completely winning.  Disk Two - This is the second set I've acquired recently that contains `Gus Visser and His Singing Duck' (ca. 1925 - 90 sec.)  It's another synchronized sound experiment, and remains a hoot.  Also of interest was the 12-minute `Early Color Films,' a trio of films from 1916, 1929 and 1926 that used different experimental color processes.  This one really benefits from the commentary track.  The 1926 entry is `The Flute of Krishna,' choreographed by Martha Graham.  My favorite film on this disk has to be `Clash of the Wolves' (1925 - 74 mins), a Rin Tin Tin silent.  Rin Tin Tin plays Lobo, a wild dog who gets a thorn in his paw and is rescued by a borax miner. There's a pretty girl, a staid father, an unscrupulous claim-jumper, and stunts galore.  Also included on this disk is a Charley Bowers two-reeler (19 mins) from 1928, a silent, titled `There It Is.' Bowers is the great unknown silent movie comedian, a stop-action animation innovator and one of the more surreal moviemakers to come out of Hollywood's early years.  Disk Three - Kicks off with `Rip Van Winkle' (1896- 4 mins.)  Rip is a series of very short scenes from the enormously popular stage play starring Joseph Jefferson, who was an established stage actor before the Civil War.  The film was produced and shown on mutoscope machines, a flip-card, peep viewer affair that lost out to projector presentation of films.  Like many of the films on this set, this isn't inherently interesting, but if you're interested in film history it's fascinating.  The big one on this disk in Ernst Lubitsch's `Lady Windermere's Fan,' (1925 - 89 mins) starring Ronald Colman, a witty and sophisticated movie from Oscar Wilde.  Perversely, perhaps, I like the rougher, less polished films in this set.  `Life of an American Fireman' (1903- 6 mins) and `Falling Leaves' (1912 - 12 mins) are two earlier films that may not be in the same league as Lubitsch's film, but they have an appealing simplicity.  What I liked best about `Life of an American Fireman' was its demonstration that movies had to find a narrative strategy.  Here's what I mean - there's a scene (hope I'm not blowing the plot), set inside a tenement room, smoke billows and mother and child are trapped in a burning building.  Mother opens window and shouts for help.  Fireman enters, ladder appears outside window, fireman hauls mother and child out of burning building.  This is all done in one continuous shot.  Next we're outside the building with the fireman.  We see a woman open a window, shout for help.  Fireman appears in the window, ladder is emplaced, mother and child are rescued.  This just isn't the way scenes are cut.  When the film takes us outside, it also goes back in time to the woman in the window calling for help.  It seems an intuitive thing - we don't go back in time when we change point of view, but `Life of an American Fireman' proves that, along with close ups and such, continuity had to be figured out as well.     This is a great set, especially for those interested in film history.  Heck, it's a lot cheaper than a college course.  A couple other highlights - Martin Marks provides the music for all the silent films, and he provides notes for every movie he scores.  I think his contribution can't be overstated.  Great musical accompaniment.  Also on each disk is a silent Fleischer brother animation.   
 Yes, I was once like you.  Enraptured by XTC's more lush productions like Skylarking.  But maturity encouraged me to pay closer attention to GO 2 and it has proven to be their finest hour.  Pure, raw, creative energy captured on tape.  This is what Andy and Colin are capable of when not distracted by their more Beatlesque leanings.  There are lots of good tunes on the later albums, of course.  Drums and Wires and English Settlement are personal favorites.  But XTC never exploded with this level of combustion again 
 I value this almost as much as I do Dirr's Hardy Trees and Shrubs: An Illustrated Encyclopedia.  What I like best about this book are (a) the wide variety of trees that it features and (b) the excellent illustrations, which provide far more detail on tree profiles, leaves, cones and other seedpods than other comparable books.  So far, I have found illustrations for every tree that I have considered planting, including many uncommon ones. This book can really help you visualize what a particular tree will look like when you are designing your landscape 
  This is a beautiful and very clever book.  Pages are cocooned within larger pages, with individual illustrations blending seamlessly into the background illustrations.  Like the natural world itself, this book rewards the patient observer, with rich details on the surface and others folded in more subtly.  Your kids will be focused in on a little book within the big book, as the caterpillar goes on its journey.  It makes the launch to the story within the bigger background pages all the more dynamic, striking as the shift from Kansas to Oz.  It starts with the eggs "hidden from view,/ clinging to leaves with butterfly glue."  As we turn the pages of a little book enshrouded in the bigger book, we see the caterpillars hatch, "each one knows what it must do," and we follow the path to metamorphosis.  Ultimately, the reader will be rewarded with multiple beautiful butterflies launching up towards the sky, a nice Lepidopterian metaphor for the developmental adventures in store for our little ones.  It's a good job of story-telling when we know exactly where the story is going but still find ourselves awestruck.    Finally, as if Ms. Ehlert hadn't done enough, we get several pages at the end on butterfly identification, with information on colors, wingspans shown in actual size, the corresponding caterpillars that precede the butterflies, and the like.  We get flower information, and then tips on growing your own butterfly garden.  Nice stuff.  Get this book, drill it for a few night-night times, and then take your toddlers to a butterfly pavilion to see the real deal.  Good times. 
 If you are reading this review you must know who Bob Clouser is and why he is so deservedly famous among fly fishermen. This book gives you detailed and clearly illustrated instructions for tying his extremely effective fly patterns. He also discusses the best materials, colors and tying techniques to use with each fly. I thought I was pretty good at tying all types of Clouser flys but this book offers tips and tricks that immediately improved my tying. It also illustrates several patterns that I've never seen before even though I try and visit his shop in Middletown at least once a year. Perhaps the most important information you will learn from this book is how to present and fish these flys more effectively. Bob discusses and gives tips on the best presentation/fishing techniques for each fly. In short, here between two covers is everything you could need or want to know about Clouser flys. If it sounds like I'm extremely enthusiastic about Clouser flys I think I have a reason to be. The biggest fly rod fish I've ever caught in the salt the Delaware river and the Schuylkill rever were all caught on Clouser flys. I think every fly fisher should add this book to his or her library. 
 Choking On The Silver Spoon: Keeping Your Kids Healthy, Wealthy And Wise In A Land Of Plenty by Gary Buffone (a practicing licensed psychologist and Director, The Family Business Century, Byron Harless Consulting, Jacksonville, Florida) is a very practical and accessibly written parenting guide meant for parents everywhere, whether raising toddlers, dealing with difficult teenagers, or keeping in touch with their adult children. Choking On The Silver Spoon deals with the very serious problem of handling children and money matters in a fair and balanced manner that will not "spoil" children, but rather teach them the true value of hard-earned wages, give them initiative to achieve, and help them better succeed financially when on their own. Of special note are the "five laws": The Law Of Necessity; The Law Of Loving Limits; The Law Of Reciprocity; The Law Of Fiscal Responsibility; and The Law of Example. This is superbly presented and highly recommended primer for passing down financial survival skills and endearing a healthy respect for work and the fruits of honest labor 
 This book discusses about special situation investment.  The author presents the subjects with a very accessible (humorous) writing style that I like it.  Usefully, the author explains different topics with case studies.  I learned from those examples.  Even though, I don't think I would be able to utilize ideas in this book in near future.  And, the special situation investment is not suitable for everyone.  Just like there is no one life style is suitable for everyone.  However, just by understanding this investment approach can broaden my view on investment.  Conclusion: my time and money are well spend on this book. 
 This DVD is as important as a historical document as it is a concert DVD.  It does a great job of capturing the repressive past of the Soviet Union, the loyalty of the Beatles fans throughout this cold era, and the sheer joy the music brought the Russian people.  And here he is, Paul McCartney, in Red Square,  near Lenin's Tomb, rocking the same Russians, now older and grayer but now free.  High energy throughout.  You can tell McCartney knows how important this is to the Russian people.  'Back in the USSR' never sounded better.  Great footage, great historical background, and solid set list played by McCartney and his very capable band make this a good addition to your Macca library. 
 So barks iron-jawed Robert Stack at the end of this draining flight. This movie is almost more than a body can handle. Flight 502 leaves New York for London on a routine flight, routine that is until a letter shows up in the first class lounge. There will be murders on this flight.  But who is the killer? Who will be the victims? And why? Could it be the priest who wears fingernail polish? The Davy Partridge look-alike kid who likes to play with smoke bombs? The has been rock star? The bank robber? The mystery novelist? The doctor? Or could it be the lovely stewardess played by Farrah Fawcett-Majors?  I cannot give the ending away because it will blow your mind. Even Agatha Christie could not com eup with a plot with so many twists and turns. But I'll give you a hint. When the second stewardess spills her suitcase, look at the contents VERY carefully 
 This continuation of the Grifin and Sabine trilogy is fantastic. I read all three books in one sitting 
 Well written, engaging novel about a young woman's coming of age during the 50s, with original insights into the female experience during the Beat movement in the Village, etc.  The perspectives are at times iconoclastic; overall, this is a provocative, even enlightening work 
 I've not completely read this book, but what I read so fra is amazing because it's my story.  I was led to this book in an old used book store and was not told to read it until recently.  To my amazement the same Man  that talked to Marc was the one that I believe has been talking to me.  I  let a friend read the book first  and she did not tell me the content, but  I kept telling her about the Man that's been talking to me in meditation  and dreams then she told me that this was my story.  I have not been led to  read more, but when the time comes I know it will only be a reminder 
 A comment from another reader describes this book as "inane" and unoriginal, but I have to disagree.  This book is wonderful!  Studies show that repeating patterns of words and rhythms, with just a word or two changing between verses, actually helps strengthen beginning readers' vocabularies, word recognition, and understanding of sequence and structure, all important parts of literacy.  The colors in this book are beautiful.  There are many interesting details in the illustrations, and I noticed there are little ways that the human characters match up with the animal ones.  The CD is great, too - there is a full vocal version as well as an instrumental version, and the tune is really bouncy and catchy. As the editorial review mentions, it is one of the few books I've found that actually includes a child with a disability, which I think is important for young readers to be able to see.  I have a six-year-old and twin two-year-olds, and we enjoy this book very much 
 Bob Marley was a true musical genius in every sense of the term. He completely defined the reggae genre and influenced a great deal of artists, and his legacy still lives on today.   "Gold", a 2 cd compilation of all Bob's most familliar tunes as well as many lesser acknowledged recordings, is the ideal collection for the beginning Marley fan. At 34 tracks, including timeless classics such as "Stir It Up", "I Shot The Sheriff", "No Woman, No Cry", "Jamming", "One Love / People Get Ready", "Waiting In Vain", "Is This Love", "Could You Be Loved", "Redemption Song" and "Buffalo Soldier", your money is definitely being well spent. And then there's the sound quality, which is just about perfect ("Buffalo Soldier" seems a bit flat, but it doesn't do anything to bring down the quality at all). The liner notes by Scott Schinder is well worth the read, and the packaging is overall very well done.  I'm going to make this simple. No cd collection is complete without at least one Bob Marley cd. If you only feel the need to own only one Bob Marley cd, then "Gold" is the way to go 
     It's definitely the 70's, the 80's, the 90's and the 2000's with Tom.  Well, One From the Heart soundtrack was 1981 but musically belongs with his 70's work.  This album is the start of his distincly new 80's sound which did not correspond to radio 80's music.  Tom began to use an organ and have a more jangly sound with more exotic noises.  It was like he left the seedy downtown district and took a musical journey to New Orleans.  For me, the 90's period is way too dark and stark, Black Rider, Alice and even Mule Variations.    I gotta admit, it took me a coupla years to fully appreciate his shift.  At first I missed that smokey lounge sound.  But some of these songs, and many from his other 80's work: Rain Dogs, Franks Wild Years and Big Time were more quality numbers from a skilled, word wise, emotional artist.       Here's songs that really stand out for me on this album: Shore Leave really tells a tale.  You go with him on shore leave and feel his separation and one of his most memorable lines, "Look up and see that same moon that shines on you in Illinois".   16 Shells From A Thirty-Ought Six is pretty catchy, sort of the equivilent of a beat song that finds its groove and takes you along whether you signed up or not.   In The Neighborhood is a real hit that likely has virtually never been played on the radio.  It's a natural take on the neighborhood, the highs and the lows.  Delightful song.  Very catchy, sweet.  Down, Down, Down is another song that just finds its groove and goes. Soldier's Things is one of his most moving songs.  A veteran selling his medals, "for a dollar in this box".  Few songs can take you to this emotional place.   The rest of the songs are all respectable.  I don't fast forward through any of them.  Those 'hits' really stand out for me.  Interestingly, for me at least, as the decades have passed having been into him since 1974, I now prefer the 80's material only because the textures are more complex than his 70's work.  As the years pass I tend to continue to enjoy music that isn't predictable.  I know where every 70's song is going.  But his 80's work twists and turns and makes noises where I don't expect it to and that, sometimes, I don't even know what it is.  Nice.  chrisbct@hotmail.com 
 This book has some weaknesses, but it still deserves five stars for the introduction of the concept of "the third dimension of power" in which the powerless are deterred from struggling for the power they don't have.  The significant aspect of this concept is that this deterrence occurs in a way that is "underground", so to speak, so that the powerless don't even realize that they are being restrained by social forces. This is really a book for sociologists and social theorists.  Read on that level, it offers a fascinating new understanding of the nature of power relations 
 I found this book very easy to read and interesting - and helpful when traveling, with a few caveats.  The walking tours look great, although we didn't do any.  The book is well organized and with an index you can't go wrong.  I found it the most useful when wanting to know how to do something... for example: what RER stations you can buy tickets to Versailles at, what are they called so you can ask for the right thing, and what kind of tickets to buy to save time and money.  He also gives great recommendations on what to see when so you can avoid crowds or closings, etc.  What I found most disappointing was the restaurant recommendation section.  We brought the book out with us one day, and without looking ahead of time, we thought we would be able to select a restaurant in the area we were in from the book.  The area we were in that particular evening had only 3 recommendations: one very upscale and pricey, one sandwich shop and one cafe.  We just wanted a nice, quaint restaurant to have dinner.  No luck... we did however find the most perfect place on our own... sorry I don't remember the name!  So I would recommend this book for ease of getting around, insider tips on where to go when and walking tours.  Just get another book on where to go to eat 
 I loved it as a kid and I still love it as and adult.  The special by effects by Ray Harryhausen are still excellent after all these years!  This movie is what got me to read Greek mythology as a kid 
 I think people are missing the point if they think that this book intends that you should have a  "miserable life and save and have no fun". I think the point is that our economy has conditioned a consumer hungry, non saving society and it is a lot a question of values and balance. If you are on either extreme of the scale, then you should rethink your ideas. You cant take it with you but you also should leave a little for rainy day and waste not-want not, lol.    
 I used to have to pull my computer out from under my desk to attach a flash drive or scanner or camera because I only had 2 usb ports and they were in the rear of the computer.  Now I leave the hub attached and setting on top so I can attach the peripherals.  I leave the printer attached in the back.  The only drawback is it is not usb 2 so it isn't as fast, but so far this hasn't been a problem.  I do have one flashdrive that it wasn't able to power up.  But overall it was a big help 
 I've gotten through about 1/3 of the book and I'm highly amused.  The first 50 pages are muddled and rather pointless so far.  However, I've laughed my way through them.  One thing Eco has is a very sophisticated sense of humor.  If you enjoy a mental challenge and writing that's loaded with wit, I'd suggest picking up this book.  I never knew there were four kinds of people before: morons, fools, lunatics and cretins.  And I may just be a fool.  :) 
 Ah, the great Dior, by which all other 20th century designers measured themselves against; from Yves St. Laurant to Coco Chanel, they all viewed Dior as the master.  Even today his name is synonymous with style and elegance.  This book is thorough and well written, Dior was a fascinating man and he is really fleshed out here.  Very good book on a singular talent 
 There have been dozens of movies and television shows that capitalize on the legend of Robin Hood.  This version is clever and funny, and the music of country music legend Roger Miller makes this movie one for everyone to watch.  Everyone knows the tale of Robin Hood.  Forced to be an outlaw, though always loyal to King Richard, Robin Hood fought against the usurper Prince John.  Robin Hood sheltered and protected poor people and redistributed wealth from the rich to the needy poor.  Robin Hood performed these deeds from his base in Sherwood Forest.  Though we have seen this movie with many different great actors, this version has excellent comedy and very good animation.  Robin Hood is appropriately swashbuckling and handsome, and Maid Marian is beautiful; both characters are drawn as foxes.  In fact, all the characters in this movie are animals, as Alan-A-Dale points out at the beginning of the movie.  This film has its share of great actors.  Englishman Brian Bedford provides a perfect voice for Robin.  Monica Evans, who also appeared in "The Odd Couple," voices Maid Marian.  The role of Maid Marian was the last for Monica Evans.  The incomparable Peter Ustinov ("Quo Vadis," "Blackbeard's Ghost") voices both Prince John and King Richard.  Terry Thomas ("Tom Thumb," "The Abominable Dr. Phibes") is the voice of Sir Hiss.  Roger Miller is the minstrel Alan-A-Dale.  Miller also provided the songs for this movie.  Andy Devine (who had more than 180 movie and television appearances dating back to the 1920's) voices Friar Tuck.  Pat Buttram ("The Rescuers," "Back to the Future III") voices the Sheriff of Nottingham and George Lindsey ("The Rescuers," "The Andy Griffith Show") voices Trigger.  This movie is fun to watch again and again, and is a favorite of children of all ages.  I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a pleasant story to watch, and to anyone with young children.  Enjoy! 
 The documentary Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room had a bit of a rough start. Although intriguing, it failed to deliver the rough sketch of the Enron scandal quick enough. I'll shamefully admit that I had forgotten most of the details of the Enron scandal, as I was in college when it broke and I didn't care too much about it at the time. But, once the overall story had been discussed, this documentary did a fairly good job of telling a compelling narrative and trying to explain the rather complicated financial wizardry that was ultimately the corporation's downfall. The depictions of Skilling were very clear and it was nice to see a woman was at the heart of breaking the story and writing the movie (which was based on a book she co-wrote). Amusing use of music and title-cards kept the pace quick, and unlike Michael Moore's documentaries, this one was actually full of well presented facts. I'd definitely recommend seeing this movie, especially because it reveals yet another reason to hate W and his administration. I wish more people were interested in this kind of reporting and that our day-to-day media was this intellectually engaging 
 "The Conspirators: Secrets of an Iran-Contra Insider" is a shocking look at what secretly goes on in our government told by a first hand eye-witness who once took part in government fraud and corruption. Al Martin, a retired US Navy Lt. Commander and former Naval Intelligence Officer tells the tale of narcotics trafficking, illegal money laundering, weapons dealing, bank, real estate and insurance fraud and corruption by an elite circle of criminal politicians and government workers. Martin writes of a true government conspiracy and cover that involved about 5,000 men and made over $350 billion of illegal revenues, most of which came out tax payers pockets. He speaks of the hundreds of reporters, investigators and insiders willing to deflect who mysteriously died "accidental" death when they grew too knowledgeable or will to talk of what was really going on. Martin boldly exposes prominent politicians, many in high government position, and shockingly our leader. What Martin has written has never been revealed to the public eyes before and writes of accounts people have died for coming across. Martin also gives an incite into what his life is like now, how the government has his house on surveillence and how he fears of retaliation by the culprits he has exposed. Martin quotes George Bush saying: "if people ever knew what we had done, we'd be chased down in the streets and lynched". After reading this book you will never trust the government again 
 B.O.C. is one of the most underrated 70's rock/metal band's!! these guy's were sorta like the first VOIVOD!! they have a very spacey and sci fi feel to them!!

In total rememberence of BLUE OYSTER CULT..one of the first CULT band's that ever lived..LISTEN to this and see why! 
 From the opening chords of Gigi Gryce's "Minority" you know that this is going to be a good album.  During this 1958 session Evans clearly demonstrated why everybody was digging him.  The trio includes Philly Joe Jones on drums and Sam Jones on bass, and it explores the whole range of Evans' talent from the explosively lyrical to modal invention.  Bill Evans was simply a master of harmony and invention.  "Minority" starts the disc off at a quick tempo.  Evans turns out phrase after phrase supported by Philly Joe and Sam.  Evans and Philly Joe trade breaks that demonstrate their inventiveness ending with a subtle duet. "Young and Foolish" exemplifies Evans' ballad style.  His piano is heartbreakingly lyrical above Philly Joe's sensitive brush work.  Evans' solo pieces are exquisite.  In "Lucky to Be Me" his perfect sense of time, space, and harmony combine in a lyrical masterpiece. "Peace Peace" is a modal tone poem equal to anything Eric Satie composed--the clarity of bells, the stateliness of love.  The trio spins Cole Porter's "Night and Day" into another world--some straight ahead, some Latin--as Evans redefines the song in varied rhythmic contexts.  Evans' "Tenderly" swings lightly with Philly Joe and Sam laying down a firm support for his improvisation.  Just listen to the harmony!!  "What is There to Say?" does say a good deal between Evans' solo introduction and his evocative reinvention of the melody and subsequent commentary.  Sonny Rollins' "Oleo" shows Evans capable of hard bop--without loss of life or lyricism.  This could be Bud Powell, but it's Bill Evans swinging here--fresh, tight, and quick.  The bonus track on this album is "Some Other Time" another ballad treatment that favors exquisite modal harmonies--lovely impressionistic lines.  Obviously, I highly recommend this disc 
 This has got to be one of the best deals in the world.  Where else can you buy a quality comforer for $30?  No where.  It is a no brainer.  My wife is happy--I'm happy...If you feel you need to spend up to $150 for the same thing somewhere else...then your missing a great opportunity.  It is med weight.  Not to heavy and not to light.  Enjoy... 
 Not for the faint of heart and weak of stomach, this is one of the best novels I had the pleasure to read this year.  It's a book both wonderful and disturbing in its portrayal of sensuous exoticism and mind-numbing brutality, with Calder's baroque prose rarely, if ever, missing a beat 
 "My Life with the Saints" is engaging, funny, and, most of all, eye-opening.  Who knew that the saints were so real and so relevant to our world today?  And I loved that Father Martin also included the certainly-saintly-but-not-yet-officially-canonized "saints" like Thomas Merton and Dorothy Day.  It may be easy to dismiss the examples of a 15th-century saint because his life was "different," but when you read about more recent "saints" it's hard to argue that saintliness can't exist in modern day life.    I can't think of anyone who wouldn't love this book 
 This ought to be required reading for every journalist already in the profession, and every journalism student. It gives a valuable insight into the process of journalism: fact-checking, source confirmation, and most of all, careful restraint in reporting.  Woodward & Bernstein didn't simply report what they'd heard, as so many of today's reporters seem to do. They went through an intensive process of interviewing multiple sources (including, but not limited to, "Deep Throat"), and they went through careful peer reviews and editorial reviews  before each publication.   It was interesting to read about White House Press Secretary Ron Ziegler's constant denials, obfuscations, and direct criticism of Washington Post reporting. It is eerily reminiscent of current White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan. (I guess somethings never change. 
 A very entertaining film made during the cold war. There are numerous humorous scenes that typifies a New Englander, from the town drunk who envisioned himself as reinacting Paul Revere's famous ride to the old Veteran who thought he should organize a militia to protect the city from what was viewed as an impending attack by Russians who only wanted to find a way to get themselves back to sea.  I think it is well done.  Alan Arkin does a great job portraying a Russian officer who is frustrated with his Captain 
 This was a good book, but nothing special. This book tells the story of Galwyn Varianus who works for his cruel uncle. It tells of how he meets King Arthur (Lord Artos) and of how he runs away from his uncle to help King Arthur in his quest to find big strong horses to carry his knights. As soon as they get the horses, this book focuses on the horses and we are allowed to forget King Arthur. Galwyn learns how to take care of the horses, which have hoof problems. These hoof problems create a need for Horse sandals, and Galwyn becomes one of the first farriers 
 Contact is the best musical that I have ever seen.  This is defiantly one of the reasons why I bought the CD.  The reason why the musical is great is because everything ties in beautifully with the music.  If you have seen the play, I defiantly recommend buying the CD, after seeing it how could you not?  After I saw the play I loved it, but thought that 30 buck or whatever they were selling it for in the lobby after the show was way too much.  So I waited and bought it at a media store.  It was one of the best investments I've made concerning music.  All my memories of the play flooded back.  If however you have not seen the play, the music is still superb.  My best friend has never seen the play but I let her listen to my CD and her favorite song ever is now Farandole (#4).  So even w/o the background of the play, the music is still very powerful.  The other uniquely great thing about this play is the fact that it has so many different styles and types of music.  That alone makes it a great addition to anyone's collection.  It will open you up to different styles of music which you might not have been able to appreciate before.  It's a mind blowing play and a mind blowing CD with eclectic, imaginative, and powerful music 
 I simply LOVED Mike's book - I found it hard to put down.  Each page uplifts the soul, lightens the spirit and quite often makes you laugh out loud.  I continually found myself nodding my head and having multiple 'aha' moments - this book really makes you stop and think.  A must have for anyone seriously embracing spirituality and on the path to self-enlightenment.  Sandy Forster, Author  'How to be Wildly Wealthy FAST; A Powerful step-by-step Guide  to Attract Prosperity and Abundance into Your life TODAY! 
 This is the twenty-third book in Terry Pratchett's series on the Discworld - a flat world, supported on the backs of four massive elephants riding on the back of a planet-sized turtle. Anything hilarious can happen here, and eventually does.   This book returns us to Lancre, a relaxed land under the guardianship of a group of witches, the foremost of whom is Granny Weatherwax. But, when king Verence invites a family of vampires from Uberwald to the naming of his new daughter, they decide that the invitation was to take the country over. But, Count de Magpyr isn't your run-of-the-mill vampire - he eats garlic, plays with holy symbols, watches sunrises, and does not fear Granny Weatherwax. Can Mistress Weatherwax save Lancre from descent into a modern vampiric hell? Perhaps, but first she must keep herself alive!  This is another great Discworld book, one of my favorites. As with many of the later Terry Pratchett books, this one is not laugh-out-loud funny like the early ones were. I mean, it is quite funny, but even more so, this is a suspenseful book that is guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat. The characters are fascinating, and the plot is great!  So, if you like the Discworld books in general, then be assured that this is one of the greats. And, if you are a fan of witches, then this is just the book for you! I highly recommend this book. 
 This was the book which actually introduced me to astrology, and it remains by far the best I have seen after all these years, both in that category, as well as a general book on the topic for the whole spectrum of those acquainted with the field from beginners to scholars. It is a serious, easy to read, no-nonsense primer, which at the same time acquaints the novice with the actual philiosophy behind the subject in the form of concise delineations, and that is what is really important. More than that, it is also devoid of the mumbo-jumbo which many use to try and "spice up" and mystify an otherwise very real art, and which has ended up in discrediting it and making it a laughing stock. I will say no further, suggesting to the reader that it should be read directly instead to form an opinion  about it, rather than reading its reviews. 
 I am taking Mr. Levack's classat UT, and of course this book is required reading. Regardless I would probably have gotten the book sooner or later. It is AMAZING. Extremely detailed, delves into both the magical and legal proceedings on the Witch hunt. The focus is on WHY something like this happened, and I feel Mr. Levack is incredibly inciteful in his ideas 
 This is one heck of an eye-opener of a book!  The only thing I've read that was more intense than this was Jackson McCrae's "The Bark of the Dogwood."  And to think, "Minds" has been out for quite a while. Where was I?  This well-written and complex book will shake every notion you've had about multiples and put a new face (if not several) on this illness. Highly recommended 
 This book is very good. Simple instructions, best results. Get this one 
 DO WHATEVER YOU MUST TO GET THIS BOOK 
 I first got introduced to Sheryl Crow by watching a promo video of some alternative acts when the "Leaving Las Vegas" video came on.  I was immediately blown away by the video and especially by the music.  I thought this new girl with the great voice will go far and I wasn't wrong.  The sound is well produced on this disc and every track is capable of being a hit single.  Highly recommended 
 So, Bloc Party's sophomore album is incredible. Not nearly as fast paced as their debut "Silent Alarm", as a matter of fact there's no song on this album which would fit on that album. This album contains so much more emotion and feel than were used to seeing from Bloc Party. I've lived in England since February 2005, and this album feel's like it. Every song on the album is very well put together, and there is quality felt all around. From Song for Clay (Disappear Here), which makes you want to party and thrash about, to SRXT, which is so melodic that it gives you goose bumps, this album is awesome. Definitley a diamond in the rough. I've listened to the whole thing front to back round 20 times or so, and it's better every time I hear it. So, if you want good Brit/Post-Punk/Indie/Rock, Bloc Party's new concoction is all you. Buy and enjoy 
 It's amazing that a musician as sonically adventurous as Prince would become one of the biggest pop stars in the world, but in the 1980's that's just what happened. And yet at the height of his popularity, Prince never seemed to try to cater to the masses. "Around the World in a Day", which followed the runaway success of "Purple Rain", is evidence of Prince's uncompromised vision. Easily the most experimental album of his career, Prince combines Beatles-like psychadelia (the title track), classical music ("Condition of the Heart"),  political protest ("America"), standard Prince libido ("Tamborine") and good old-fashioned pop ("Raspberry Baret"). "ATWIAD" is second only to "Sign 'o the Times" as my personal favorite Prince album 
 Jane Jacobs writes well and the book is full of a-ha! moments.  Chapter 2 is brilliant.  If your city or neighborhood is threatened by developers who don't share your values, or you want to plan a development that will remind people of San Francisco or Paris, then this book is for you.  
 Yes, the book is repetitive.  But it didn't bother me much because I got to learn more about the star I've admired for so long.  If you want to know more about Natalie Wood, read the book.  One problem: the ending raised a lot of questions.  Which I suppose is appropriate, given that no one really knows what happened to her except Natalie.  I just wish there was more fact than heresay.  
 Being in the 40-something age bracket, I've liked John Waite since his days with The Babys but really only grew to LOVE him in the 80's when he went solo with "missing you".  It would be really hard to pick my favourite JW song but this album is definitely my favourite. Being an Aussie, I have to order all my JW music via the internet and I envy you guys in the US.  Some day I plan to get there just to see the amazing JW in real life.  My favourite song on this CD would be "Price of my Tears" but there's so many brilliant songs on this CD. It's hard to describe the effect his voice has on me but it's like being taken to a different place. No one else has that effect on me!  As our Aussie 'Molly' Meldrum says, "Do yourself a favour" and buy this CD!...and try all the others while you're at it!! There will never be anyone who moves me like John Waite. 
 I own many of Marsalis' discs and this one is my  fave.  It is near perfect if not perfect.  "The Burglar" is unbelievable - check it.  The beginning and continuing background rythym is superb and  matchless.  This disc bangs booty 
 great book very helpful, give a very rigous program and help you step by step.  very rewardin 
 This CD is totally off the hook. I have yet to hear a song from Tech N9ne I have disliked, he is the best rap artist out there right now, and I don't believe there could ever be a rap artist that was better. If you like this CD, get all of Tech N9ne's CD, you will be pleased, I GUARANTEE IT 
 It is obvious Ann Wall Frank loves homes. Her beautifully written text is like poetry, and the photography is stunning.  It is a must have for anyone who cherishes making a house a home.  The humor, warmth, and intelligence  of Ann Frank's writing style sets this book apart from others of its kind.   We in the northwest are proud of our style, and Northwest Style captures  who we are perfectly. Encore 
 This double cd set is an excellent representation of the music I experienced first hand at The Garage. It's amazing how music can transport a person through space and time. I would recommend this compilation to all "Garage Heads" and to anyone that knows a garage head and has seen the look in their eyes when they've tried to describe the feeling of being in The Paradise Garage. Larry Levan was simply a master. Words fail me but the goose bumps speak for themselves. Let us never forget. LONG LIVE PARADISE!! 
 This is probably one of my favorites.  She has characters you care about from the beginning and the deceased father's entangling demands to inherit his property and money are an added way of punishing his children for his indifference to them thoughout their lives 
 I went for this book at first because of the photos -- riviting. It was really comprehensive in having photos of him, and also of the times he lived in, espeically the sixties. Once I started reading the book i just coulnd't put it down. I had no idea he was so smart and driven (both by rock and roll and by his own demons) and also so strangely vulnerable at the same time. Great read. I highly recommend it 
 This edition of the Bible in the Contemporary English Version is good value, and has clear type with good legibility. This edition also includes the Apocrypha, giving it added value.  Colin Lun 
   I researched and tested portable DVD players for quite some time, wanted no less than a 9" screen and couldn't justify the expense of a quality laptop PC w/a DVD drive. It came down to the Panasonic DVDLS90 9" or the Phillips PET1000 10.2". I decided on & purchased the Phillips based on multiple online reviews and hands-on experience with both at the local electronics superstore. My comments:  The Pros:  1) EXCELLENT picture in all respects, best in the portable DVD world. Resolution/sharpness, response time, color accuracy, etc. is the best I've seen. The Panasonic had a TERRIBLE picture (non-progressive) that artifacted badly especially with animated material and was considerably less sharp and color accurate.  2) Handy slimline remote that does everything except load the disc and order the pizza.  3) All the cables you'll need (AV-RCA, Component vid, S-vid, Cig lightr cord, ac/dc cord). The Panasonic only came with AC & Cig lightr cords.  4) Overall sexy & high-end looking slimline player 10.2"W x 1.2H x 7.1"D (w/batt: 10.2W x 2"H at back x 8.5"D) The Panasonic unit is only slightly smaller (9.3"W x 2.06"H x 7.31"D) and has a smaller screen.  5) Plays multiple formats as listed in specs, but interestingly enough WILL also play a CDr filled with JPEG images despite reviews on other sites to the contrary (CNET.com). In fact, the unit has an image viewing menu that allows you to display thumbnails and view slide shows. The only drawback is that it will only display filenames up to 10 characters in the old Windows-style file reader, not a really big deal. NOTE: does not recognize avi, bmp, pcx, wav, wma, & wmv files.  The Cons:  1) DISSAPOINTING BATTERY: a) 3 flimsy plastic clips in a row that hold batt pack to player will take NO punishment before snapping off. b) When attached, batt sticks out 2" beyond back of player & 1" below. c) Batt life is rated 2.5hrs, I've averaged about 3hrs with brightness/volume set to mid levels. You'd expect a higher capacity batt with such a nice player. d) long recharge time.  2) Personal Pet Peeve: when playing any recorded disc that has multiple viewing angles (ex: The Vandals - Live at the House of Blues), there is a small but distracting angle icon that appears at the upper rt side of the screen. After some frustration & a useless conversation with a useless Phillips CS rep somewhere in India? who advised me to return the unit for repair (wrong), I found the answer on Phillips website: the icon cannot be turned off when playing a multi-angle disc, so be warned.  3) Some functions (slo-mo) are only accessible by remote so don't lose it. Also hard to read the remote buttons in average/poor light.  4) No included carry case, no handle on the unit.  5) You must press on the disc door near the "open" button in order to latch it, otherwise it won't stay shut.  6) Somewhat noisy drive mechanism during startup & when accessing chapters, but only a slight hum when it counts like when watching a movie. A minor con.  Other reviews have knocked the sound quality. I'm somewhat of an audiophile and have no problem with the quality from this unit. You won't either if your expectations are realistic about the sound that should come out of portable DVD players. Although the Phillips has some annoying design flaws mainly with the battery, it wins in my book because of the unequalled quality of its 10.2" picture, ease of use, cool remote & styling. An extra aftermarket or higher capacity Phillips (when available) batt pack should solve any playing time issues with you international travellers. Get a high-quality padded case and carry it around with the battery detached. I recommend this player for anyone that takes good care of their stuff, values an extremely high quality picture, decent sound and mutiple connectivity choices. This player is not for the kids in the back seat of the soccer mom SUV. Get them a 7" Mintek or Coby. You'll be less angry when they spill their Coke on it 
 my 19 month old loves the toy for its colors, I like it because it allows me to get more chores finished in the kitchen! It has a nice suction base to keep the top steady on tile. It was a little difficult at first, for my son to handle, since a good bit of strength is needed to push the bar down especially if you want to hear it hum and spin fast. The colors are pretty cool, The faster it spins the more colors come out (primary + yellow/orange colors). I like that it holds his interest. A [...] could defentley get this down better but at least there is room to grow! 
 Keith is a legend, but it might not always be for the right reasons. Of course he is the main engine that fuels the Rolling Stones machine, but once you read this book, you get to see the other reasons that have made him a well known icon. This man helped write the songs for a generation, and we are able to get an insight into the man in this biography. We cam see into his childhood, that first meeting with the man he would ultimately become famous with, Mick Jagger, to his decade long struggle with drug use and abuse. This guy defines rock and if you like the Stones, you need to read this book and get an insight in the man behind the ban

 I bought this CD as an anniversary gift for my husband.  We honeymooned on the beaches of St. Augustine, Florida 33 years ago.  We drove our compact rental across the sand while playing Seals & Crofts on cassette.  This CD was a wonderful trip back in time 
 If you are an ipod fan like me, you are going to love this item. You can control most ipod funtions, including the volume. The remote control is more than great, there is not need to point at the dock to change songs or any of the other features.  I recomend this AV Dock 
 I'd like to point out that this is NOT a TREASURY, but a SCRAPBOOK!!  Scrapbooks consist of the strips, and treasuries consist of the scrapbooks. This contains no color, and a minimal amount of srips! I was highly dissapointed and mislead by the title of this item.  
 This is an excellent book about Power Yoga, no matter who claims to have invented it. Baron does a great job describing each pose and modifications.  Despite what others have wrote, Baron does not come off as egotistical or narcissistic, far from it.   However, if you are one of those yoga snobs who believe one must meditate for an hour each day, eat a complete vegetarian diet, balance your chakras daily, and sit around and chant OM then this book is not for you.   Baron takes the mystical and new age gunk out of yoga and gives you the essentials you truly need. Those who question his dietary advice are apparently ill advised about true dietary needs. They should read Eat To Live to learn the truth about what our body needs and how to meet them in a healthy way. Most people erroneously believe the info distributed by many who have invested interest in many studies published today.   I highly recommend this book as well as all of Baron's DVD's. He is a truly great teacher. If you doubt this you should try one of his videos.  
 This is exactly what a cookbook should be, it's as simple as that.  If you are a C# programmer you would be making a mistake to not have a copy of this fantastic reference book by your side.  For any book to be named a "cookbook" I would expect a myriad of problems to be tackled, and a variety of subjects.  I wouldn't want a thin reference manual, yet I wouldn't want problems to go on for pages and pages and pages.  Ideally an examination of a wide variety of issues with concise, straightforward solutions is optimal, and that's exactly what this book provides.  Topics Covered:  01. Number-Related Tips & Tricks 02. String Abilities 03. Working With Classes & Structures 04. Enumerations 05. Exception Handling 06. A look at Diagnostic Tools 07. Working with Delegates & Events 08. Regular Expressions 09. Collections 10. Data Structures in C# 11. Filesystems in C# 12. Reflection 13. Networking code and issues 14. Security Matters 15. Working With Threads 16. A Look At Unsafe Code 17. XML Analysis  From that list of topics, is there any subject that a C# developer doesn't run into some issue with at some point?  I'm trying to write a longer, drawn out review about why you should pick up this book, but it's really hard to do so because I instantly found this book so useful.  Save yourself the time and aggravation and pick up "C# Cookbook" by Stephen Teilhet and Jay Jilyard, I can assure you that you will not regret it.  ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDE 
 This is the best quilting book I've bought.  I love Denyse Schmidt's designs, and she makes them all very accesible to different levels.  The projects are very well explained, with clear pictures.  Very inspirational for the creative quilter 
 Not a primer, not even really a project book. I love this book, I've checked it out repeatedly from the library, and it's the book I refer to when I'm designing things. I can't thank the person enough who was kind enough to put it on my bookshelf. My best friend wants a new scarf, I get this book, I'm working on an afgan for my husband, I reach for this book. I want to make a sampler shawl, this book again. I don't particularly want finished patterns, I like making things the way I want them, this book gives me the tools and stitches to do it with. Plus I prefer international crochet symbols, so that makes it even better for me 
 Look: This is a damn good book. It's a fantastic primer on Structure and Style. I've read it three times 
 DESSA ROSE is a wonderful 2-CD set that preserves the entire original Off-Broadway production of Ahrens and Flaherty's Drama Desk Award nominated folk opera about the relationship of two very different women in the Antebellum South. Dessa Rose, a pregnant runaway slave (played by the endearing La Chanze) is harbored by Ruth Sutton (played by the captivating Rachel York), a white woman whose slave owner husband has abandoned her and her daughter on their isolated farm. As Dessa gives birth and Ruth nurses both Dessa and her newborn child back to health, the wary and feisty women begin to learn what they have in common and finally develop a bond of friendship and trust.  The two heroines go back and forth from being elderly narrators of their own tale to acting out their adventures as young women. Ten other very talented cast members perform the supporting roles of fellow runaways, slave traders, plantation owners, lovers, parents, sherriffs, and a reporter obsessed with writing a book about the rebellious Dessa Rose.  Music underscores almost all of the narration and dialogue, creating an evocative mood throughout and making scene transitions smooth and clear. Traditional instruments add color and texture to the score that is packed with powerful choral pieces, lovely duets, humorous ensemble numbers and thrilling solos. The songs themselves range from gospel to folk to blues to spirituals. Standouts include La Chanze's "Twelve Children," a stirring anthem in which she recites an oral family history to her unnamed baby, and Rachel York's "At the Glen," a stunning ballad that pierces the heart with loneliness and despair.  Both La Chanze and Rachel York were nominated for Drama Desk Awards for their performances in DESSA ROSE. So were co-stars Norm Lewis as the charming and clever runaway Nathan and Kecia Lewis as Ruth's loving Mammy, Dorcas. On this CD you'll hear why. Each actor brilliantly expresses through voice alone all the subtle nuances that were visible on stage. You get a very real sense of what each character is thinking and feeling, and you'll laugh and cry at how their characters - and relationships - deepen and evolve.  The packaging for this terrific CD is every bit as professional as the sound mix and recording. The full libretto and all of the lyrics are presented in book form, complete with hard cover binding. A number of beautiful production photos are also included.  This magnificent two-CD recording is a true keepsake. Even if you weren't lucky enough to see the show live as I was, you will cherish it as a milestone in theater history 
 although there are times when it seems like her voice production needs work, natalie dessay has THE most amazing tonal quality i have ever heard. listen to the ach ich fuhls. she and sumi jo have voices that make you melt, i know i did. her agility and pitch also are astounding. the high G at the end of the ascanio in alba in incredible. i have never been more happy with a purchase EVER!!!!!! 
 This teaches you how to make people learn, not how to teach! I am a doctor, this is about Primary School teaching - best book I have ever read for learning to help students and doctors to learn! Go on, break out of your silo you doctors! Brilliant stuff - read it on one night and change your teaching foreve 
 Very interesting cast of characters, would make an enjoyable TV show, more original than what is on today 
 I have read every book in the Tempe Brennan series; this is another excellent novel. This is one of my favorite suspense series...I eagerly await each new installment.  If you like this book, check out a new author I've recently discovered. I highly recommend Thirst by Dania Deschamps. 
 I consider this the first album in the second half of the career of Oasis. Following the departure of Bonehead and Guigsy, this album is basically all the Gallagher brothers. Having learnt lessons from Be Here Now, Oasis have gone back to a more basic style of production as opposed to the over the top production from Be Here Now. While the songs are not as good on here, they sound better and the whole album sounds as if it wasn't as rushed. This signifies a big change of direction for the band, with little less ego's and a more sober approach to their music, it is only the songwriting that lets this album down. My least favourite of all Oasis albums, it features two really good songs, 6 mediocre and 2 dreadful ones. It is missing another two songs to make it complete, I think it should have included the B'sides 'lets all make believe' and 'carry us all'. It still includes a few Beatle-esque songs 'who feels love' and 'roll it over' and Noel once again takes over lead vocal duties, this time on two tracks, 'where did it all go wrong' and 'sunday morning call'. This is a very important album, it grounded the band again after their ego's had taken off. This helped relaunch the career and because of it they sound at their best today 
 Spellbinding. I laughed. I wept. How could Xerox PARC miss a $500,000,000 patent opportunity in the graphical user interface? Easy, they didn't recognize that someone else might have a use for something they had no use for. Yes, I laughed and I cried 
 1993 was a great year for music that most people never heard of.  That year the Brand New Heavies, Young Disciples, and D'Influence had AMAZING albums.  The latter two received very little popular success here in America which is terrible.  If you can find Good 4 We, pick it up without hesitation.  You will not be disappointed!  I think it is a shame that we have to look to the UK to find bands that are keeping the Soul, Funk, R&B, Disco (Yeah, I said it!!  Disco!) and Acid Jazz alive.  This album has it all.  I won't go into its details because it would take too long.  Just do what you can to get this album 
 I have listened to the cuts from this CD and was amazed at how quickly it  transported me back to the time.  There were several tracks that I was  delighted to see since the artists were not popular enough to have an  entire album re-released.  If you are in a mood for a good dose of  nostalgia, this is the set for you! 
 Some people think Dover books, being cheap, ought to be bad. In fact, this Dover series specializes in "salvaging" great titles that went out of print and are of great intellectual/pedagogical value. Such is the case again for this title. Very well written. Of course, C.H. Edwards is notorious for his book on the history of calculus. Exceedingly clear. I started reading it while taking Calculus II, in search of some more elaborate perspectives. It is that clear.  Chapter 1 is a brief incursion in some topological aspects. Chapter 2 directional derivatives, differentials. Ch3. Chain rule. Ch.4 Critical points. Ch. 5 MANIFOLDS (patches ?! ) and Lagrange multipliers (and this is around a bit over page 100!). Ch 6 Taylor's in one and Ch. 7 several variables. Ch 8 Classification of critical points. Part III begins with Newton's method and contraction mappings. Then goes to Multivariable mean theorem, Inverse and Implicit Mapping Theorem. Ch 4 (III) is Manifolds in Rn and finishes with higher derivatives. Part IV is Multiple Integrals, n-dimensional integrals, Riemman sums, Fubini's theorem, Change of Variables, Improper Integrals, Path Lenght and Line Integrals, Green's theorem, some applied problems, Line and Surface Integrals. Book end with Differential Forms, Stoke;s theorem, Classical Theorems of Vector Analysis, Closed and Exact Forms, Normed Vectors Spaces, Variational Calculus the Isoperimetric problem. Lots, lots of bangs for your bucks. Because of the breadth of the exposition, clarity and price, it's a must-have. You can kind of draw a parallel between this and Hubbard's Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential Forms. Both kind of span the same space. Of course, being older, it doesn't have the same computational flavor as Hubbard's (but then again, it's not really about numerical methods, is it?) 
 Once you can comprehend what these guys are trying to accomplish you will realize that this is a brilliant album. If you haven't heard this yet their sound is hard to pigeonhole it definitly is not metal but it is still heavy, it is not hardcore even if they are on Victory. I guess it is part metal part hardcore, part metal with a good influence from the Swans, Sonic Youth, My Bloody Valentine, and Tom Morrelo at times. Maybe it is best left uncatagorized, in any case the album is just plain awesome 
 Smelling very much of the Chicago post-rock scene, BSS are the epitome of postmodern rock. They are yet another new wunderkind from the burgeoning Canadian scene, on a par with Arcade Fire. Taking a tour through the album you can't help be reminded of Sonic Youth, Radiohead, Dinosaur Jr or Tortoise. And in the middle of all that they pull out a few abstract pieces into the mix. Highly recommended album if you want something less predictable and monotonous, which is the sad state of most of the unadventurous rock that the kids seeem to dumbed down into these days 
 If you want to learn precalculus, this is as good a book as any 
 Cortazar, when on his game, is on the very short list of great story writers.  He has a keen eye for detail and a knack for beginning a story somewhat in the middle and letting the reader catch up.  "Continuity of Parks" is a roller coaster in three pages with great visual details (only "Grafitti" is a better story by him).  "The Night Face Up" is ingenious.  "House Taken Over" is a great example of what he doesn't tell you being more important than what he does tell you!  Expect the unexpected and possibly bizarre.  Cortazar plays by no rules and knows no boundaries 
 This is a good start.  In its sheer breadth of knowledge it covers a vast array of questions from pre-emptic strikes to the status of civilians and the question of responsibility.  WOnderful discussions on all aspects fo waging war from blockades, to the question of appeasement.  A very fascinating read with several minor flaws.  THe first major flaw is the preoccupation of this book with western conflicts.  Major wars, with millions of dead, have been waged in this century alone that did not involve the west, for instance the Iran-Iraq war.  Little analysis in this study is given to the question of a non-western perespective on war and what it means for western nations confronting non-western ones, who live by completely different rules.    THe second major flaw is the all to often obsession with treating terrorism without mentioning Islam.  In the chapter on terrorism and guerilla war their is a disproportionate focus on the IRA and the 'Stern Gang' which would make one assume that these organizations were disproportionatly good examples of terrorism.  The opposite is true.  Not one sentence, in fact not one word in this study deals with Islamic terrorism, which just happens to be the main confict in the world today.  THe question of 'just wars' was obviously aimed at the recent Iraq war, so why not deal with the question of Sept 11?  FLaws such as this point to an overreaching political correctness which takes away from this volumnes very heroic attempt to understand modern war.  Seth J. Frantzma 
 JJ Cale is one of the best singer/songwriters of our time.Cale has a cult following because he is the "famous artist that avoided fame".I think this DVD is the best ever made, honest, and very true to himself JJ is the man 
 Solid book on CS- long read! Many good points- Wish there was a cliff notes versio 
 I've just finished writing a paper for my Advanced Placement Journalism class about freedom of speech and obscenity over the radio. This book was one of my best sources. It portrayed Supreme Court cases and laws passed by Congress in great depth and detail and managed to write it all in a language most Americans will understand. I plan to use this book for every essay I can 
 The deficiencies in the DVD notwithstanding, the film is absolutely worthwhile if you are a fan of the genre.  Casting is superb, especially Olivier.  The plot is rather intricate, and it will almost certainly take more than one viewing to fully appreciate it's depth.  This is, of course, not a problem, when you have a film as terrific as this one.  See it soon, and witness a classic from one of the best decades in the history of Hollywood 
 Exciting and highly entertaining story about 3 men who travel to the centre of the earth through an extinct volcano. Here they come across prehistoric forests, a giant subterranean sea inhabited by prehistoric marine dinosaurs, and some ancient offshoots of man. Although some of the science bits are outdated, implausable and sometimes drag a little, the book is still surprisingly modern and fresh after 140 years. Maybe the first adventure novel of this kind and certainly of influence on modern culture. 
 One of the funniest and most quotable movies of all time.  Well worth the money...in fact its well worth much more than the $10 its selling for.  Its up there with Anchorman, 40 yo virgin and old school 
 Joanne Baldwin is a Weather Warden, someone who can control the weather at will. She is part of a secret group called the Wardens Association, people who control earth, fire, wind and weather. They have been around nearly forever, keeping Mother Nature from wiping humanity right off the map. At the moment, Joanne has a much more immediate problem.  She is on the run from the Wardens, accused of killing Bob, a Senior Warden. He may have been an arrogant you-know-what who few people are sorry to see dead, and it may have happened in self-defense while Bob was transferring an alien being into Joanne's body that is slowly taking her over, but Joanne is still in deep trouble. Her only hope is Lewis, the only Warden who can control earth, fire and weather. But, he is also on the run, having stolen three bottles of djinn (the only being more powerful than a Warden), which makes him the most wanted person on Earth.  During Joanne's mad dash across present-day America, followed by all sorts of "freak" weather, she meets David, your average cross-country hiker. But he is actually a djinn, who may or may not be working for the Wardens. The big confrontation comes in an average-looking house in Oklahoma City, with Lewis and Estrella, an old friend and former Fire Warden, who has her own agenda.  This one is quite good and it is worth reading. It has plenty of action and tension, and the possibility of human control over Mother Nature will keep the reader thinking. It certainly puts the local weather forecast in a whole new light. Keep an eye on this series.  
 My daughter bought me this CD for Christmas.  I listen to it in the car, on the Bose and in the headphones.  It brings back meories of being a kid and listening to my grandparents talk about heading to Reno and seeing Frank, Sammy or Dean.  Or a trip to Vegas.  This is a good album with some great cuts on it.  I could leave Sammy Davis Jr.'s "Yes I Can" somewhere else, but aside from not caring for that song (which is more personal preference on my part), this is one of the most listened to CD's I have in my collection 
 "From Doon With Death" is Ruth Rendell's first novel, and also marks the literary debuts of protagonists Chief Inspector Reg Wexford, and his partner in crime solving, Inspector Mike Burden. At this somewhat late date in life, I thought it about time I explore Ms. Rendell's mysteries, and her psychological thrillers, which receive such rave reviews. "From Doon With Death" was my recent introduction to the author's work. I believe in starting at the beginning. Now I understand what all the fanfare is about. This is an excellent mystery - and it is only her first effort. I know she has matured greatly as a writer in the forty plus years since she published this book in 1964. I look forward to following her development as a writer as I continue to read her books, authored under the name of Barbara Vine, as well as Ruth Rendell.    Margaret Parsons and her husband of six years, Ronald, have  recently moved to Kingsmarkham in Sussex. They are a happily married, rather introverted couple, and keep to themselves most of the time. Although Margaret is a lay preacher at the local Methodist Church, and has some acquaintances there, the two have not made any friends yet. They are definitely not wealthy and live a very frugal existence. Ronald works for the Southern Water Board at Stowerton and Margaret is a homemaker, a good one too. Their large, ugly house, is not well constructed, nor does it have a refrigerator, washing machine or other modern conveniences. It does contain, however, a small but very expensive collection of Victorian literature and poetry, bound in suede, scented leather and watered silk. All are inscribed, on the fly leaves, from Doon to Minna, and the messages are personal, romantic, and intense, to say the least.   At the book's beginning, a frantic Ronald Parsons telephones Inspector Mike Burden, a neighbor, to tell him that his wife hasn't come home that evening. The body of the thirty-two year-old woman, is found the next day, strangled in a near-by wood. She had left home with only her keys and purse, not even her coat. When the valuable book collection is discovered in a trunk in the attic, the investigation take on a new nature. Who are Minna and Doon? And who was Margaret Parsons?   Although the seemingly prim and proper Mrs. Parsons is dead when the story begins, the author paints a vivid portrait of the victim in retrospect, through the testimonies of those questioned in connection to the crime. Chief Inspector Wexford, with his countrified ways and off-beat humor, is a meticulous detective, if somewhat eccentric. Inspector Burden, also very competent, makes a wonderful straightman and side-kick. The narrative is taut, the characters diverse and original, and the mystery suspenseful. I couldn't figure out who did it. Ms. Rendell also writes a scathing commentary about the idle rich. This is a book that stands the test of time and continues to rivet its readers. I highly recommend it. JAN

 The Editorial Review is referring to a different version of Casino Royale from 1967 starring Peter Sellers and David Niven this version is from 1954, it is black & white and stars Barry Nelson. It was originally a live TV movie on CBS Climax. I reccomend this movie to any James Bond fan 
 This little book packs a wallop. It contains a simple but powerful message: to live in contact with God, one need only hold Him in mind, or carry on a mental conversation with Him. The reason why Brother Lawrence's book is so transforming is that one can feel that he practiced what he preached. As he describes the process of practicing the presence, the reader is drawn into the gossamer web of the author's own experience. To begin this practice, all we have to do is read this book. We are given a boost at the beginning; the rest is up to us. Take this book on retreat, or pick it up whenever you are feeling spiritually dry. It will open your heart and nurture your soul 
 I bought the earlier edition of this book for someone else...had no intention of reading it (or keeping it) but started to browse and got hooked!  This book reads like a novel--all the characters are my near and dear friends, the garden fruits and veggies.  Mouth-watering detail sets the stage for getting your imagination started.  What would you like to grow that you haven't seen in the seed catalogues?  A watermellon that can ripen in your northern climate?  Greens that won't be mowed down by slugs in your wet, costal garden?  Perhaps a juicy, sweet tomato just like your favorite slicer, but in a convenient cherry size?  Just when you have all these images of the yummy possibilities dancing through your head, the story turns dark...Unfortunately, the professional plant breeders are not looking for the same things you are.  Professional plant breeders want thick-skinned tomatoes that can be machine harvested, that ripen all at once, and that store and ship easily.  (at this point, I want to yell, NOOO!!! Not THAT tomato!!!)    But sadly, past market forces have inadvertantly destroyed so much of the lovely work of our ancestors to produce flavor, long harvest periods, plants that survive organically, open pollination, and most of all, variety.  But wait!  All is not lost!  Remember how all those wonderful things came to be in the first place?  Amateur plant breeders!  And guess what?  It doesn't have to take a lot of time, or even much space, to start tweaking and experimenting with what you can get to grow in your own garden.  You don't even need experience, let alone a degree.  And she's got lots of stories and examples to prove it.  Then she starts throwing out possibilities I never would have thought of...why stick to things we already grow as vegetables?  Why not domesticate one of the thousands of edible plants that no one else is even working on?  Or how about experimenting with ways to use food that weren't available when it all started, like developing something that microwaves conveniently?  I think Carol Deppe is a creative genius with the rare ability to communicate her passion and knowlege for her favorite subject.  After reading this book, really after reading just the first few chapters, I felt like this is something that I really could do, and can't believe I hadn't thought of it before.  People have been saving seed for thousands of years, it's not rocket science.   For an idea of Deppe's writing style, she's written an interesting article about parching corn that you can find if you google "carol deppe and parching corn. 
 I believe that this is the most important book written on hermeneutics in a generation.  Thomas ably defends the grammatical-historical hermeneutic, and displays where other authors depart from same methodology while claiming not to.  Every conservative seminarian should read this in hermeneutics class in company with Terry or Ramm 
 I put off getting this album for years, due to the bad rap it's gotten as a collection of drunken, rambling monologues. It is way better than that. It does contain some rambling monologues, notably in Sweet Jane (which is about half rambling and half music) and Walk on the Wild Side. (In the latter, Lou says he got so tired of it that he couldn't play it anymore, but now he can, and then he talks for 17 minutes rather than sing a word of it.) The reviewer "x" described the album very well ("It is like going to the zoo, only to walk by the Polar Bear exhibit to see that the animals have eaten the zookeepers.") I can listen to the real songs more often than the rambling ones, but the real songs are indispensable. "Street Hassle" is absolutely incendiary, and I am very fond of the thundering, mumbled "Leave Me Alone" which bears no resemblance to the studio version. The band was absolutely on fire at this show. I've seen Lou three times, all in relatively recent years. What I wouldn't give to have seen him on this tour.... (Also, despite some complaints about the sound quality, it sounded fine to me, and I am pretty picky. 
 I gained a deeper understanding of the conflicts surrounding forestry in the Pacific Northwest. The stories told in this book could never be explained or understood in a 30 second television news broadcast. And while much of the news is depressing, this book offers hope for a brighter future where science, conservation, forestry, and consumer interests can meet for the future use of our forest resources 
 ....this was a SLIGHT letdown for me after falling in love with Moya's (aka Maire) previous release called: "Whisper To The Wild Water".  "Two Horizons" is a good release and stays very consistent throughout most of the entire album with just a few 'pick-me up' songs that bring a touch of excitement to the plate here. I really do like this cd though and recommend any Maire or Enya fan to purchase it. I was just hoping for Maire/Moya to continue to advance in a similar direction as Whisper to the wild water.   The music on here is very beautiful and fluid and I must say that the mood on this one is a unique experience to me which is appreciated. I can't get myself to rave about this one but I can say I like it and find myself drawn to it once in a while when I need to escape into the beautiful world that Moya has created here.   4.3 stars from me 
 roman polanski firmly established himself among american audiences when he took ira levins fine potboiler into a different stratum. of course the movie has taken on an eerily prescient nature what with the events of polanskis life shortly afterwards (and id love to see it with its bookmark, the 1971 "macbeth" -- sadly not on dvd). but this was the best (maybe the ONLY good) performance mia farrow ever gave, and theres a ton of great supporting work, most notably by ruth gordon who turned this oscar winning role into a late career surge. thankfully censorious rules restrained what a few years later might well have given way to excesses. this movie captures 1968 new york city in a manner few others do. 
 Product arrived as expected.  I've had the tooth brush for about a year now and I love it.  One complain I have is that the interior of the brush head can get pretty dirty.  It cleans up pretty well with a soak in warm water and bleach.  I have not tried soaking it in Oxyclean, that might work even better.  
 I admit, it took me about 2 weeks to read this book, but it was good. Jane is a very defined character, and although some of what happens is unlikely to the point of being almost unrealistic, it seemed to make sense. The only complaint I have is that I felt, many times, like I needed a French dictionary at my side. When Jane talks to Adele, and occasionally other people, it is usually in French, with no translation whatsoever. But since it was written in a time when most educated people took French, what can you expect? I would suggest publishers put footnotes with translations. The French is not, perhaps, very important to the story line (not that I would know), but it really bothered me to have no idea what they were saying 
 This is a very good use of your time and money. It would be hard to do Buddy justice without a multivolume set , but this contains some of the best of both traditional and his contemporary efforts. Get it. Don't wait  five long years 
 Like all of Agatha Christie's books this one is full of suspense, mystery, and drama. This one's a little different. However, the story is not really a who-done-it but a who-are-they and how will Poirot stop the Big 4. I prefer the who-done-its myself.  I recommend the book - its a great read. 
 John Carpenter has had quite a bad string of films that fail to live up to the standards he has set with his past works and those fans of his films who have seen him as a master of the genre. In 1995 he came up with a very good film that paid homage to two master writers of the horror-fantasy genre. Carpenter's In the Mouth of Madness was a very good film that thrilled both his fans and those of the horror genre.  Sam Neill stars as insurance investigator John Trent who's hired by publishing editor Jackson Harglow (played by Charlton Heston in a brief role) to find one of their star novelist: the extremely popular horror novelist, Sutter Crane (played with weird creepiness by Jurgen Prochnow). It seems Crane has disappeared and cut off all contact with his handlers just as his latest horror novel's released. Throughout the beginning of the film there's a sense that Crane's latest book has more than an entertaining effect on those who've bought and read it. Homicidal individuals Trent encounters throughout the film and all linked to Crane's book and what he thought was a fictional New England town used in all of Crane's books. The town of Hobb's End was a definite homage to Stephen King and H.P. Lovecraft who also created the fictional towns of Castle Rock and Arkham to locate many of their stories.  Neill does a great job of conveying Trent's bewildered, confused and ultimate descent into the mouth of madness Crane's writings seem to have opened in reality itself. From the weirdly peculiar to obscenely homicidal going ons by the townspeople of Hobb's End, Trent's logical nature is put to the test by the Lovecraftian situations and events he witnesses as his search for Sutter Crane leads from him from one horror to the next. The characters created by Lovecraft in his Cthulhu Mythos were never mentioned in Michael De Luca's script but the essense of these otherworldly beings of pure malice and evil permeates throughout the film. There's never been a successful attempt to film a Lovecraft story into a feature-lenght production, but In the Mouth of Madness comes close to achieving it. Even the wooden and under-inspired performance by Julie Carmen as Linda Styles, as Crane's literary agent and Trent's partner in his search, couldn't bring this film down. Carpenter does a great job of taking De Luca's script and creating a story where reality and madness slowly and inexorably begin to mesh to the point neither Trent or the audience knows what is real anymore. The end of the film was great in that Carpenter eschews the usual happy ending of most horror movies and instead finishes the madness he started and sees it through its end just like Trent.  In the Mouth of Madness showed that John Carpenter was still a master of his craft when given the right script to work with. He mixes to great effect homages to works of both Stephen King and H.P. Lovecraft. His film also does a great job of instilling not just fear and horror of the unknown, but also that of losing one's mind and not knowing whats real and what's not. Despite not doing great business in the box-office, In the Mouth of Madness was a very good film that people in 1995 weren't just prepared to appreciate 
 Sick Cd, totaly worth buying.  Shook Ones Pt. II is a sick song, so is Survival Of The Fittest.  CD is solid, and worth buying if you want some old school music to vibe to

 "Finders Keepers?" by Robert Arnett has been honored with the Benjamin Franklin Silver Award of the Publishers Marketing Association for Best Multicultural Book of the Year, the Independent Publisher Outstanding Book of the Year, and the Seal of Approval of the National Parenting Center. This book is better for school-age children, as it really provides a geography lesson, a study in ethics and a brief insight into Indian culture.  The book tells the true story of an experience the author had while traveling through India. He had just bought some postcards when a young Indian boy tapped him on the elbow and held out Arnett's wallet, which the boy had picked up when the author accidentally dropped it. The man thanked him and offered him a reward, but the boy refused to take any money, insisting that he should not be rewarded just for doing the right thing.  I'm in LOVE with the brightly colored illustrations by Indian-born Smita Turakhia, who said she was inspired by memories of the place where she spent her childhood. In fact, even the youngest kids enjoy looking at the pictures, so I skip some of the more technical stuff when I read it to them 
 The first disc of Six Degrees is absolutely fantastic, featuring such gems as The Glass Prison, Blind Faith, and Disappear. The only track that's sub-par is "The Great Debate." But perhaps I'm biased about that, being an agnostic--DT has always had some christian influences in some of their songs, but TGD just takes it a little too far.   As far as the second disc goes...It's a spectacular effort, and DT should be applauded for it. However, it falls a little short. "The War Inside My Head," "The Test That Stumped Them All", and "Solitary Shell" are ASTOUNDING tracks, but the rest are just flat, especially Goodnight Kiss.   I would recomment passing this album over for now if you haven't yet bought such gems as Scenes From a Memory, Awake, and Octavarium. 
 Julia plays a struggling mother trying to make ends meet and then she gets a job and takes on a Giant Corporation in a Court Of Law.Julia manages to extract a lot of information fom people mainly through her mammary glands and the benefits of a Wonderbra but that is just about all that this movie has going for it. I give this film 5 stars because Julia does look pretty attractive in it at most times 
 This is a very interesting novel that captures both the ferocity of the Battle of Antietam and intensity of feelings that people have about the Civil War.  Although at times No Certain Rest feels like it was written by an intellectual news commentator for PBS (which Lehrer is), the book is easy to read and the story becomes increasingly intense as the protagonist gets closer to his conclusion.  The ending also catches you by surprise.  You don't have to be a Civil War buff (I'm not) to enjoy this book, merely a fan of well-written mystery/suspense novels 
 I love anything Barbie, anything pink, and anything that supports the Susan G Komen Foundation.  This doll is all of those wrapped up in one neat package.  I am thinking about giving them to my female relatives for Christmas 
 In Kay Hooper's latest novel of romantic suspense, "Sleeping with Fear," the heroine is thirty-two year old Riley Crane, an ex-army officer and federal agent assigned to the Special Crimes Unit. She is an expert on the occult as well as a clairvoyant with psychic abilities that come in handy in her line of work. As the novel opens, Riley is vacationing in a beachfront cottage on Opal Island, South Carolina. One afternoon, she wakes up covered in dried blood, with no memory of the last three weeks of her life. In addition, her psychic powers appear to be out of commission. Her boss, Noah Bishop, Chief of the FBI Special Crimes Unit, wants Riley to return to Quantico immediately. However, she convinces Bishop to allow her to stay on the island in order reconstruct her memory and figure out who messed with her mind and why.  The plot thickens when the headless body of a man is found hanging over a tree in what appears to have been a satanic ritual. Sheriff Jake Ballard reluctantly asks Riley for her help in solving the case, although he is furious that she dumped him for Ash Prescott, the local district attorney. Riley confides in her old army buddy, Gordon Skinner, that her mind is playing tricks on her, but she tells no one else about the gaps in her memory. She is even reluctant to be honest with her lover, Ash, especially since she barely remembers how their relationship began. The only certainty in Riley's mind is that someone close to her has targeted her for death. As the weeks pass, Riley senses that she is missing something important, but in spite of her best efforts, she cannot get a handle on the case.  "Sleeping with Fear" is a suspenseful and engrossing page-turner.  Riley is a courageous, tough, and tenacious protagonist, and her torrid relationship with Ash heats up the pages. Although the dialogue is a bit stilted and the conclusion somewhat implausible, books of this nature are meant to be escapist entertainment. Judged by this standard, "Sleeping with Fear" delivers the goods, skillfully combining romance, elements of the supernatural, and crime in a neat enough package to keep Hooper's fans coming back for more. 
 This story of the 'Can Do' must have come up during Mr. Tougias' research into his previous book, 'The Blizzard of '78,' (which is still available). The previous book takes place on land, a lot of people stranded on the freeways. This one takes the reader to sea aboard the 'Can Do.'   'Can Do' is the motto of the Navy Seabees, and the captain/owner was a retired Seabee. He must have felt that he 'could do' what the Coast Guard in their 44 footer couldn't do. Although the 'Can Do' was a 49 foot steel hulled ex-pilot boat, it just wasn't up to 40 foot waves and 100 mph winds. When the engine was killed, the boat and its crew were doomed. The 'Can Do' was a strong boat, but the Coast Guard 44's are damn strong. Further the Coast Guard boats are designed for this kind of storm. I'd have been pretty scared to take anything but a submarine out in that kind of weather.   This book is based on the recorded radio messages received from the 'Can Do.' The radio kept working up until the very end, providing an in depth look at a disaster that is rarely seen 
 This is an enchanting composition reminiscent of ancient Greece, and Egypt. The harp and keyboard evokes a sense of mystery. This is my favorite Steven Halpern CD so far. I find I can listen to it during the day as it is more uplifting. It has "higher" notes which wake you up, but are still relaxing.   Steven Halpern's music is spiritually uplifting, is very pleasant to listen to and you will find yourself immediately feeling more relaxed while listening to this CD. Steven has sold over 4 million albums world wide and I can see why.  ~TheRebeccaReview.com 
 Each chapter in this book is filled with tales that encourage audience participation and interaction. The stories are simple to learn and to tell and involve all sorts of activities such as singing, dancing, drumming,  acting and improvisation. Each story is accompanied by any necessary music  and a list of materials or props. At the end of each story, MacDonald has  included "Tips for Telling" which outlines a strategy for the storyteller  and "About the Story" which offers some more information about the story.  Each chapter begins with a short description of the actions required in the  chapter and some behind the scenes tips for controlling the audience.  In  addition to the full-text stories that are included in each chapter,  MacDonald recommends other stories that would be appropriate for the same  actions. Chapters are organized to encourage the reader to take on more  complicated storytelling roles as they progress through the book.   Beginning chapters are dedicated to one action such as singing or drumming  while final chapters include using actors from the audience and creating a  story theatre.  Another nice feature of this resource is that stories come  from all over the world, from Thailand to Gambia to China.  This would make  these stories an excellent addition to a cultural or geographic study on a  specific country.  This book would be a great purchase for anyone working  with children.  MacDonald's comments make storytelling much less mysterious  or frightening for those not used to performing in front of a group.  The  twenty tales included here, along with the many others that she suggests  make for unending ideas 
 Without a doubt, Lois Lowry's books stand out when compared with some of the other fare on contemporary bookshelves --- and thankfully Lowry has been recognized for it. In 1990, she won her first Newbery Medal for NUMBER THE STARS, a fictionalized account based on the true story of how a group of Christians in Denmark saved their Jewish neighbors from persecution during World War II. She received her second Newbery Medal in 1994 for THE GIVER, probably her most well-known book to date. Now comes another book that is so beautifully written and so poignant in message that its sure-to-be glowing reception just might give new meaning to the expression "three time's the charm."  GOSSAMER tells the story of a group of mythical creatures (for lack of a better expression to describe them) who are responsible for the creation and distribution of dreams. After being assigned to various households by their leader, Most Ancient, the creatures settle into their roles as dreamweavers by acquainting themselves with objects in the house (photographs, articles of clothing, trinkets on a bureau) that contain significance and memories of the owners. After they have gathered enough meaningful fragments, the dream-givers combine them to create a story, or dream, to bestow onto the sleeping inhabitants. This process is, in fact, how dreams are born.  So, too, are nightmares created by the evil Hordes, who attempt to undo all the good that the dream-givers impart by banding together to flood their victims' subconscious with dark and stormy thoughts. If enough insidious nightmares are inflicted upon these sleeping individuals, their waking hours can become increasingly negative and damaging until they no longer can remember how to be happy and at peace. In this agitated state, they are a great risk to those around them and to society as a whole.  In addition to providing a unique and imaginative explanation as to where dreams and nightmares come from, GOSSAMER also tells the moving story of an angry boy and a lonely old woman who are brought together under unfortunate circumstances. The boy has been taken away from his parents because his father beats him and his mother, and the woman is lonely because her husband died, leaving her alone and without many friends. As a way to find companionship and to give back to the world, the old woman agrees to take the little boy in for a summer until his mother can get back on her feet. The bond that forms between the two is so subtle yet so ripe with feeling that by the book's conclusion, you wonder how the two ever could have been apart.  Lowry's latest offering is simply magical. It is clear that she has taken great care to write a narrative that will both teach and touch its readers. A book full of gentle spirit and pure beauty, GOSSAMER is definitely award-winning material.     --- Reviewed by Alexis Burlin

 I started reading Mosley years (and years) ago, and wondered for a second when I saw Blue Light on the shelves if it was really by the same author. There is a great science fiction/fantasy story in here (if you hate sf viscerally, maybe you shouldn't read it: if you have an open mind and can risk it, you should) and what seemed to me a delightful wistful remembrance of times past in a hippy-freak california you'd have trouble finding these days... I get one of my favourite emotions from this novel: nostalgia for the future (the future the blue light heralds). Where did it go?  I hope another story in this sequence appears almost as much as I'd like another Socrates Fortlow book 
 Book publishers have been searching for new markets by publishing what are called micro-histories like The History of Lint or some such thing. Paul Johnson isn't aiming for that market. He tends to write sweeping histories that reveal patterns over time. The History of Christianity is just such a book and is an excellent resource for those interested in the rich and inspiring history of the Christian tradition.   The story begins with a chapter titled "The Rise and Resurrection of the Jesus Sect" where Johnson lays out just how the early Jewish followers of Jesus managed to steal the thunder from the Jews and become the first universal religion concerned with all humanity and not just the members of a select group. The next chapters tell the story of how the faith survived the decline of the Roman Empire and the darkness that followed. The books traces through hundreds of years of history, weaving in the various voices that carried Christian thought forward and brings us finally to the date of publication in 1979.   As an avid reader of Johnson's work, however, it should be noted that he writes differently now than he did in 1979, and much better in my view. His older works use language that is dense and assume the reader knows a great deal going in. You'd best keep a dictionary handy when you settle in to read this book. Also, his perspective, always strong and present in his works, was much more pessimistic in his earlier years and may have been influenced by the anti-authoritarian tenor of the sixties and seventies.   While I wish he would update this work to accommodate his newer style and perspective, as well as cover the latest history of Christianity, this book is still a wonderful work and well worth the effort.  
 Thomas Paine's "Rights of Man" is truly a classic defense of self government and reprsentative republicanism. Paine copmletely demolishes Edmund Burke's defense of aristocracy and monarchy as outmoded and absurd institiutions. Paine shows the immorality of monarchy and the plunder that it commits on it's own people through high taxes,unjust property laws,and priveleges for the nobility. Paine shows the virtues a representative system has over the monarchial form. He denounces  aristocracy and monarchy as "frauds" and based upon tyranny. The first review by Will Murphy critsizing Paine as a sort of statist is way off the mark. Paine did recommend many ideals of the welfare state. It must be remembered he was speaking to an age where a large wealthy aristocracy ruled alongside the monarch, living in luxury off the high taxes drained from the middle, lower and working classes. Paine was one of the formost defenders of freethought in religion,speech, and ideas.To imply Paine was a sort of 18th century fascist is utterly absurd and ahistorical. Paine was not an enemy of property, just an enemy of aristocracy,who in his day did not obtain property by hard work. Usually property rights in monarchial nations were written to favor the wealthy and powerful, and grant them priveleges at the expense of the populace. Paine completely destroys the ideal that a chosen few were meant or ordained by God to rule. If you love freedom, you can't go wrong with the "Rights of Man" 
 Everytime that I listen to this CD, or any other Police album, I think what if....What if Sting didn't want to go on and pursue other interest? What if the Police were still around today?? The Police might be one of the greatist rock and roll bands of all time, and thats saying alot since they only released 5 albums (that contained orginal material) This happens to be my favorite of the bunch, even though they are all equally good. Since I figure that most people that are reading this are Police fans, the ones that aren't or  are only familer with the songs that you hear on the radio, then you are missing out, because on this CD there isnt one bad song. If you want to hear one of the best 3 man bands, then this is right up your alley. I believe fans of all music will treasure this, and even if you can't stand Sting, pick this one up just to listen to Stewart Copeland, one of the best and most under-rated drummers of all time..ENJO 
 I've read some of the other reviews on this book and am a bit annoyed with most of the negative one.  Before answering the negative comments, let me say that I've been following the diet for 7 weeks and have lost 20 pounds. The thing I like best about it is that it's the ONLY diet I've found that allows me to eat the quantity of food I'm eating, and still keep my calorie count at about 1350. I love having a full plate and a full tummy. With this way of eating I get full at all 3 meals, have 3 snacks during the day, and am still able to lose weight. On Atkins I got full, and my lipids and sugar were great, but I didn't lose much weight because my calorie count was too high.  On Weight Watchers I was always hungry, because I invested too many of my points in refined carbs and grains. This works for me.  I'm planning to use Dr. Heber's earlier book "What color is your diet," for maintenance. I have my physician's enthusiastic blessing for both.  BTW - I have no cravings.  I'm easily able to say no to candy, chips, cake, cookies, etc.  My pre-diabetic metabolism is loving this!  Here's a typical day's menu for me:  Breakfast: Shake made with 1C skim milk, 1 scoop protein powder, 1/2 a banana and 1/2 cup of frozen raspberries.  Lunch: Salad made with 3 C romaine lettuce, 1/2 a cucumber, a 1/4 of an avocado and 3 oz of roast chicken.  Dinner: 4 oz lean ground turkey burger smothered with sauteed onions and mushrooms, 2 C pureed cauliflower (a la Atkins), 1 cup thinly sliced butternut squash sauteed in a small amount of olive oil  snacks/dessert:  1 C non-fat cottage cheese with 1/2 c pineapple; 1 clementine orange; 1 c watermelon; 1/2 cup blueberries with 1 T low-fat coolwhip.    All this runs about 1350 calories, with 140g of protein (1 gram for every pound of lean body mass I have), and is about 20% fat. A smaller person, with less lean body mass, should be able to eat closer to 100 g of protein and still get all of the fruits and vegetables in, for fewer calories.  My reaction to other comments about the book:  1. I read the book cover to cover and (unless I missed it somewhere) I didn't see the name "Hebalife" anywhere in it. It does NOT promote any particular brand of protein powder. It does suggested using "flavored" shake mix (vanilla or chocolate), but I ended up getting plain unflavored protein powder (Genisoy) that I could mix with skim milk. If I want chocolate I add a tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa for 15 calories. For the person who said the shakes taste horrible, well, for goodness sake, try a different brand, and be sure to add some fruit!  2.  How can anyone say this is not a healthy diet? You end up eating a huge amount of fruits and vegetables, healthy added fats like olive oil and avocado, and lean protein.  No one needs grains in their diet. They're just not necessary.  I use a computer-based program (fitday.com) to keep track of my calories/carbs/fat/protein and 32 different nutrients.  I consistently take in well over 100% of the RDA's for all nutrients (except vitamin D, but you get that from sunshine too), without taking any supplements. And I get about 30 grams of fiber a day.  4. Even some of the people who said they liked the diet didn't seem to be really following it.  A nutrition bar for lunch and a reasonable dinner? That's not what this diet is about.  You're supposed to eat from all 7 colors of fruits and vegetables every day.  You can't get them in if you don't eat them at every meal and for snacks. Nutrition bars are not recommended in this diet. Have a huge salad with meat instead!   If you follow the diet the way it's laid out, it's very healthy and satisfying.  But like any diet, if you stop eating that way and go back to eating the way you ate before, yes, you're going to gain the weight back.  That's how you got fat in the first place!

 It's a shame we can only give a great album five stars because Clay Walker's "Greatest Hits" deserves about 5....thousand! I bought this album quite a few years ago, but I have never had the opportunity to express my opinion regarding it...until now. In my opinion, there is no singer who can put the emotion into a song like Clay can. He can sing the slowest, most beautiful love song like "Watch This" or he can turn it up a few notches with an ubeat toe tapper like "If I Could Make A Living." My personal favorite, "Rumor Has It," is a track that any music lover would wear out in a matter of weeks. His two new songs, including his Top 5 hit "You're Beginning To Get To Me" are great additions to the CD. He's got it all from his first, "What's It To You" to his most current when this CD was released in 1998 with the Jimmy Buffet sounding "Then What." It's been about 3 years since this album was released, and I've yet to hear a better CD. So, if you wanna play a beautiful song for your loved one like "Hypnotize the Moon" or express your love in a more "fun" fashion with "Only On Days That End In Y," then you HAVE to buy Clay Walker's "Greatest Hits." I'm telling you, you won't be sorry 
 For those who read the editorial review, know that the "paperback version" is actually an entirely different translation, and while it is abridged, this version is not.   So, for those who read the editorial review and were concerned that this translation was abridged, don't worry, it isn't. However, for those of you who read the editorial review, which sings the praises of the editor, and think that you're getting a version of innordinately high quality in this book, you're not.  the translation is very awkward at points.  it still gets the point accross, just sometimes with little attention paid to grammar 
 I am not going to say that this book will change your life as an adult, but it'll remind you of a important principles. It, however, may be much more impactful for tweens and teens ... it'll make them question their decisions. I am not one for not eating the marshmellows, at all ... this book will remind us all that at least we at least that there's a decision to be made. 
 It's a pretty good CD. I like it. I recommend it. "Jump, Jive an' Wail" is an AWESOME song. The only 2 songs I don't like on this CD are Pennsylvania 6-5000 and Gettin' In the Mood. They were Glenn Miller songs from the 40's and I was disappointed that Brian Setzer changed them too much. It would have been better if he played them more like the original versions. But anyway, the CD is still really good. 
 The Dark Child also known as "The African Child" is a childhood account of a Guinean writer, Camara Laye. In the very sentimental book the author writes about his childhood in Kouroussa, a village in Guinea. He credits his father for his foresight in giving him a western education despite knowing that their ties will be altered soon. He writes lovingly about his mother for her excessive protection as he embarked into adulthood and also his doting grandmother who viewed her grandson as above faults. His father realizing the changing environment of Africa opted to send his son to school instead of spending time in the forge. His mother on the other hand is tearful when Laye departs to France for a study leave. He also writes about his friendship with Fanta on their way to school. As a grownup man living with his uncle in Conakry, he developes a relationship with a half-caste lady, Marie Lorifo.  The African Child replaced The Narrow Path by Francis Selormey as my favorite African autobiography.  When Laye returned back from France, he married Marie Lorifo. But his life took a drastic turn later on in the sixties when he went on exile to Senegal to escape Sekou Toure. His parents died during his years in Dakar. His wife was unjustly imprisoned for seven years by Toure while arriving at the Guinean airport to visit her ailing dad. When she was released seven years later, she divorced Laye because he had married a second wife. Theirs is the saddest love story that I have read and I cant understand why such tragedies would have befallen one of my favorite authors. Laye died in 80.  Echoing the writeup of one of the reviewers, I ask in a similar vein, "Must every book written in Africa deal with the negative influence of colonialism"? Reason why I asked this is that Laye's novel was savagely and unjustly attacked by some of his contemporaries in Africa.   Another great read is So Long a Letter by Mariama Ba 
 this one dives deep, now.  everytime i hear this double cd, i think of two hip hop joints: IT'S MY THING by epmd and NO TIME by lil kim.  the two songs they came.....................WAIT A MINUTE, IT TAKES TWO by rob base and dj easy rock of course!!!!!  the THREE songs that these three classics came from plus kay robinson's funky version of THE LORD WILL MAKE A WAY SOMEHOW just does it for me.  i love blowing dust off rare stuff, now.  you like doing that too, check this one out 
 You need a strong stomach to read the grueling ordeal of a 12 year old girl in Cambodia under the Pol Pot regime. The latter and his cronies turned a whole country into a concentration camp guided by the iron fist of a centrally planned economy which was based on rice production quotas. Starvation and killing of whole families including babies were part of normal daily life. The author herself lost nearly all her family. The slogan was 'be deaf and dump if you want to survive'.  Exceptionally, this book also relates the disturbing facts which happened in a Red Khmer camp in Thailand until one year after Pol Pot's defeat by the Vietnamese.  Molyda Szymusiak tells only the facts. She doesn't explain the overall picture of Pol Pot's regime, politically, socially, economically or internationally. Therefore I highly recommend the eminent works of David Chandler as well as Philip Short's magisterial biography of Pol Pot (Saloth Sar).  This book shows painfully the disastrous consequences of a power grasp by ideological fanatics who created a one party state bureaucracy which wielded total uncontrolled power over the population. This regime was a terrible shame for the left.  A very disturbing read 
 Even if creepy medical stuff scares you, this book is a "must read"! Dr. Nagami is a real heroine for people who get awful things growing in them and no one but a sleuthing infectuous deseases specialist can save their lives! The Red Cross First Aid course isn't enough. Be safe. Read Maneater 
 Good book to bu 
 Gunton begins his study by showing the uniqueness of the Creation Ex Nihilo to the Christian faith.  Other mid east legends are dim copies.  Despite the universality of evidence, there is a corresponding universality of failure to read it correctly (Calvin).  Creation is the outcome of God's unrestrained love.It is Christo-centric. It is through and to Christ. The incarnate one entered into history and creation to redeem it.  Gunton then sets the stage by showing the biblical context out of which the doctrine of Trinitarian Creation was realized.  Old Testament.  God's creation is rooted historically. It is not eternal. New Testament. God freely willed creation. velation 4:11). Christ is the mediator and sustainer of creation (Heb. 1:2).Christ's miracles over demons is a oretaste of the future liberation of creation (Romans 8).As Christ is the mediator of creation, the Holy Spirit is the animator of it.  This ties together in the resurrection of Christ.The freedom of God in the created order. The destiny of the created order is related to the resurrection of Christ.  Next he examines the Greek Worldview, showing it be pessimistic and dualistic, incapable of answering the ultimate questions.  Ontology: Pantheism:  Is the universe divine? If God is not personal creator, we then have an impersonal force governing reality (c.f. John Frame, Apologetics to the Glory of God, p.35-40 for an excellent discussion of personality and deity).  To personalise the non-personal is to succumb to crude forms of superstition.Only a theology which distinguishes God from the world ontologically justifies the practices of science.  The Hero of the study is Irenaeus.  Trinitarian Mediation:  Irenaus of Lyons Goodness of creation If God the Son takes upon himself a material body, then nothing material can be intrinsically bad. God creates out of nothing. There are no degrees of being but only two realities:  God and everything else. Although very good, creation, even before the fall, was not yet complete and perfected.  It is waiting for an eschatological perfection. Salvation is that which returns creation to its directed purpose. The world is to be understood as a process, but not--as in contemporary process theologians--a linear process.  All in all it was a fascinating study, save a few faults.  He tried his darndest to exonerate Darwin, to no avail.  Despite all of Gunton's brilliant reasoning--and mind you he is sharp--Darwin, given Gunton's own admissions elsewhere, could not account for human personality and dignity given his premises.  Second, is a faulty over-reliance on several flawed studies of Calvin, rendering his discussion of primary-secondary causes problematic.  But other than that, a superb study 
 This cookbook is a must-have for every person who ever uses a kitchen.  It has all the basics, like how long to bake a potato or cook a chicken, that young people away from home for the first time (or those of us with bad memories) need.  But it also has delicious recipes for the braver sorts and even nutritional info for the diet conscious!  People have called me from across the country for recipes from this book.  I have used it more than any other cookbook by 100 times.  Everything I have ever made from this book has been a hit.  Betty has my highest recommendation 
 I thought this book was a great introduction into Native history - and a great intro of the many powerful, brave and heroic leaders of various Native tribes. I've learned so much that I now wish to learn more about these people. And what a inspirational book! I recommend it to anyone - especially those in need of a personal gift! (Find her on the web and she'll autograph it!) This will be high on my holiday gift list! 
 this is a part of greiner's theoretical physics series.  this physics series have been used as a standard textbook in many schools, and its original german editions have been educating generations of german  physicists.  except for some problem in the translations, this physics  series is excellent 
 This book takes a long-range look at the problem of how to revive the American labor movement. It rejects quick-fix solutions and argues that: (1) Labor movements grow mainly in relatively brief periods of upsurge, as at the beginning of the 20th century and during the 1930s; (2) Upsurges happen in unpredictable ways due to a confluence of factors many of which are beyond the control of labor leaders and organizers; (3) During upsurges, workers develop new forms of solidarity that extend across boundaries of craft, industry, race and sex - often in defiance of official law.  So what should labor activists be doing between now and the next upsurge?  Most of the book is directed toward answering that question.  Clawson analyzes a number of organizing projects and campaigns.  He is especially anxious to highlight successes, but does not shy away from criticizing failures.  His tone throughout is supportive and respectful - both of professional organizers and worker activists.  The book is indispensable for anyone who is sincerely interested in helping to revive the labor movement 
 This album inspired me to get into more rootsy, more down home music that I usually don't listen to. Roseanne Cash has developed a critically acclaimed and commercially successful career with her own personal brand of country, pop, rock & folk and more. I saw her perform most of these songs on Austin City Limits and a couple of music videos and was very impressed. I'm glad I've rediscovered her smooth, soulful voice again. "Rules of Travel" is a piece of pop and country music that is just great. This album is rockin, soulful, joyful and mournful. The arrangements of the songs are really good. When you strip away all of the glitter, glossy production, and record company push in popular music, you get something honest and real, something like "Rules of Travel". I really like this album to to point that I listen to it every day. 
 this video is the best chinese action movie i've seen besides some I've seen a few years ago with Vivian Leung. The action is great, all the actors/actresses were Great! I liked it so much more than the original crouching tiger hidden dragon.... I would definitely watch it over and over and over again.! 
 Marcia Willett's "A Week in Winter" is a very much modern day novel woven in a familial paradigm spun from threads of characters who appear in all dimensions absolutely real and vibrant and full of life. This is a book that comes as a refreshing read and employs a realistic portrayal of life in ficton. "A Week in Winter" as the title itself suggests is the life of a famly during Christmas and in a limited space and time windows the sudden and occasionally abrupt changes in the lives of a plethora of characters ranging from one-year-old Luke to old Maudie Todhunter. This is a moving story about human passions,dreams,hopes,expectations,acceptance and inability to go beyond the insulated boundary of perception,a riveting tale about man's tryst with inevitability and most importantly his own self.  Set against the backdrop of a week during Christmas time,Marcia Willett's amazing piece of literature revolves around Moorgate,a house of contention on the edge of Bodmin Moor in Cornwall,England. Indeed it is the proposed selling of Maudie Todhunter's late husband's home that spells troble which ripples diasaster and severe coldness across the family. Maudie is the second wife of Hector Todhunter and has never been able to make the transgression from a stepmother to a mother for Selina and Patricia,Hector's daughters from his first marriage to Hilda. Selina has been an eternal enemy to the hapless Maudie whose life has been rendered forlorn by her husband's death. Her only means to gain some respite from the gloomy atmosphere is exchange of emotions with Daphne,Hector and Hilda's old friend,and occasional but just as buoyed and joyous visits from Selina's daughter Posy. A disenchanted stepdaughter,a huge figure's death and financial insecurity are not enough to conspire and rip apart Maudie's life,and now that she has put Moorgate on sale,things are going radically out of hand.  Selina is fuming with rage at the inevitable sale of her father's home and like one of her realm---that of emotional unbalance and indecision of mind---is making all sorts of execuses to impede the sale. She coaxes,pleads and even threatens her husband Patrick Stone,a disillusioned and resigned-to-fate man,to but Moorgate but the odds are heavily stacked against her. "What is one man's meat is other man's poison". In this case though,the adage becomes "What is one man's poison is another man's meat". Rob Abot is the caretaker of Moorgate but given the splendor and charisma of the house he's steeply in love with it. He has not enough finance to buy it but an unconceived meeting with Melissa---who lives in London along with her writer brother Mike and his son Luke,and is a prospective buyer of the property---sripts a fantasy tale that is full of promise and anticipation Rob and Melissa both fall in love at first sight with each other and the five days spent together at Moorgate are the few moments of unassuming glory and fun before the threatening darkclouds swallow them up.  "A Week in Winter" is not just simply a novel about the selling of a house and the consequence of this act;its moral conviction and conjuring up of vivid truths of life are more taut ideas. The book has a tragic note right from the very inception and this sombre picture is carried throughout until the end punctuated by happy incidents. This shade of pessimism might be the flip side of the book but then again,life at its best never promoses any fairytale gratifications. The best feature of this book is the picturisation of the characters of the characters as possessing stories of their own;each figure has its own story to tell,a story patterned in overlapping patches of black and whiteand all stories are distinctly different and so all the more better for the construction of the plot.  Marcia Willett's magic lies in her well-drawn characters all aspiring to jump out of the pages,turn to life and form a part of the reader's environment. Each character is well-defined and massively crucial for the gradual unfolding of the story. "A Week in Winter" is an ebullient book that mirrors life in its exactitude and involves condensed descriptions and measured glimpses of intrinsic emotions and feelings. Patrick Stone's sudden realisation of his position and his metamorphosis,Daphne's acknowledgament of a dark secret,Selina and Maudie's relationship and a slight repitition of feelings of one generation in another are the most critical junctures of this lovely and exotic book. The authoress makes her book an absorbing read and we seem to live the experiences of the fictive characters ourselves. A fluid narration held by certain dynamic reflection moods,invokation of tragedy,romance and Nature and a brilliantly construed idea make this book a wondrous book,one that never attempts to gallop away from life's destined campaign 
 Oliver Stone released this film prior to his blockbuster, Platoon.  Like many of his films, some of the truth tends to be exagerated.  In real life, the murders of the 4 nuns took place during a rode block by the El Salvador National Guard, not a death squad, as was portrayed in the film.  Despite the shortcoming, it's the performance of James Woods (Oscar Nomination) and great dialogue that makes this movie work.  In the end, this film is a powerful indictment of the US government and it's policies to fund rouge nations.  It shows we haven't learned anything from Vietnam.  
 This is an amazing work. The Mayan Factor is a must for everyone who is genuinly interested in Mayan enigma.This book answered and clarified my many years of wonder about Mayans and their obsession with time; and of  course, like all good works, leaves you with other interesting questions.  Do yourself a favour: read this book 
 I'm really enjoying this clock radio. I looked around quite a bit before I found this with all the features I needed. Only one possible flaw is the display is still very bright when dimmed. I like that I can operate everything with one hand and it sure does not slide around on the nightstand (it's heavy). Good sound too!.R 
 I haven't seen anything this funny in a long time.  There doesn't seem to be anyone in Hollywood (who's funny) that isn't on this DVD.  The old (Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, Gilda Radner, Jane Curtain, The Blues Brothers, etc.) and the newer (Mike Meyers, Chris Rock, Will Farrell, etc.).  Some of the best SNL ever and the DVD has got to be over 3 hours long.  I really enjoyed this and will watch it many times with my friends and family.  You get your money's worth here, and more 
 I have hypermobility syndrome (my joints are highly flexible) and I am also a plus size woman.  I have tried several Yoga program DVD's before and I have enjoyed them as well as being very frustrated.  Although I like to "feel the burn" on occasion, many Yoga DVDs for average size people push my body to the limit (even though I'm a flexible woman).  I thouroughly enjoyed this new perspective on Yoga.  The moves have a lot of fluidity, and the DVD isn't so long that you feel totally drained at the end of it (which, with a good Yoga workout, you shouldn't anyways).  When I'm done, I feel stretched, refreshed, energized, and confident.  I plan to begin using the DVD on a daily basis, however, as most of the DVD is relatively simple for me to do, I could see myself having to incorporate more challenging poses in the future.  I can't wait to get Megan's book Mega Yoga - I think this will help me get a more personalized Yoga program.   
 I have two 3 year old daughters who love all of the Richard Scarry videos.  This video helped them recognize and learn their ABC's much better than me quizzing them with flashcards all summer!  They will watch this video every day if I let them 
 "Welcome to the Fall" by 32 Leaves is a great album.  I'm very pleased with it and glad that I decided to buy it after hearing these guys on PureVolume.  I would have never heard of them if it hadn't been for their homepage spot on PureVolume that made me click on them and have a listen.  Kudos to the band for having the entire album up on PureVolume available for preview through streaming so that you could really see what you were getting.  To me that displays some confidence in their material, which they should rightly have.  It's true, these guys do sound quite a bit like a few different bands at different times (A Perfect Circle, Ra, Deftones, to name a few) but they do have a sound of their own.  I was a bit disappointed that when i received the CD there was a sticker on the front announcing "For Fans of A Perfect Circle, Deftones and Failure".  I made the conclusion that these guys did have some familiarities to those bands which I love before I got the sticker, but I thought it was kind of wrong to bias the new listener into thinking these guys are another knockoff of APC or Deftones, because they most certainly aren't. I will admit though that they do have many similarities to APC (vocals and bass lines most notably). The songs on this album are quite diverse yet meld together nicely to form an ambient mixture of progressive and alternative rock music.  Most of the songs on the album (with the exception of the last one) contain fast, driving rhythms behind some great vocals. This album is also very accesible : I found myself singing along to many of the songs on the first listen and after many listens have even found myself obliged to have this on as background music while driving or studying, even when I wasn't fully paying attention.  Overall, if you do like A Perfect Circle you will most likely like 32 Leaves as well as long as you listen to them with an open mind and aren't trying to compare the two bands because they are both different in their own ways.  Pick up this album if you want to hear some good rock music from a rising band. 
 Herbst does not contend that political geography is the sole determinant in explaining the precarious state of contemporary African nations. Rather he asserts that precolonial social and political norms as well as post-colonial adherence to an imposed state system (reified by the Addis rules) have contributed most to the Continent's current plight. He emphasizes that throughout history, African rulers have had a perpetual disregard for consolidating power in the hinterlands. By means of rational cost-benefit analysis, African rulers historically concluded that the costs of extending formal political authority into the hinterlands pointedly outweighed the purported benefits. Instead, African rulers focused their attention on the capital city and its immediate environs. This precolonial practice soon became a leit motif in African politics. Rulers in contemporary African states continue to focus their attention on the political consolidation of urban centers. When the independence-era African rulers acceded to inheriting the colonial boundaries, Herbst suggests these leaders may have become even less wont to broadcasting their writ of authority. Territorial integrity and the inviolabliity of borders (two salient precepts of the first OAU summit at Addis) convinced African leaders of the futility of broadcasting power past the capital. With no external security threat it seemed pointless to extend political control. Factors such as national design, political geography, and lack of infrastructure (esp. roads) are all strictures exacerbating the sense of alienation and disaffection hinterland populations experience as physical isolation is coupled with political disenfranchisement. These externalities also contribute to many African leaders' reassertion that the travails of broadcasting power are too costly. Consequently, the political ambit of African states remains modest and the prospect of significantly increasing the scope of political authority in contemporary African nations remain dim. Herbst has devised a cogent, compelling, and provocative analysis of state consolidation in sub-Saharan Africa devoid of the many fictions tied to the putative European model. An amazon review cannot do this book proper justice (there is much more I have failed to touch on). I only wish to convey that Mr Herbst has afforded us an indispensable opportunity to enhance our understanding of an intriguing phenomenon. States and Power in Africa is a truly outstanding book 
      I really liked this book. I liked this book because I relates to me and what I like.  This book relates to me because I like basketball and so does Bix and Jerome. They like to play alone and really work on their game and so do I.  At the end they finally get togethor and work on it.  That is what my dad and I do.  So I would recomend this book to anyone who likes sports. 
 An excellent and very informative read.  If you liked James Herriot you will be able to see that the son has inherited his fathers qualities and gifts for telling a good story 
 «At You Birthday Party» was the third and - in my opinion - the last of the classic Steppenwolf albums. After those two groundbreaking blues rock albums «Steppenwolf» and ««Second» this (underrated) Gabriel Mekler produced set also contained all the power and inspiration you liked on those two albums. There are great rock tunes like «Rock Me» or the sublime «It's Never Too Late» (both were released as singles) , even heavier tracks like «Jupiter Child» or «Don't Cry», ballads like «She'll Be Better», piano/organ boogie («Cat Killer»), funny jams and the most beautiful birthday song you'll ever hear («Happy Birthday»). Charismatic singer, strong lyrics, superb playing. What more can you hope for? «At You Birthday Party» is a work of true genius and a classic rock album of the late Sixties 
 When God Builds a Church is one of the most captivating books ever written if you are interested in growing a church. The principles Bob Russell discusses could apply to any church of 20 or 20,000. It is a great story of how God does amazing things in a church that is faithful to Him and completely gives the church to Him. It is inspiring, uplifting, imformative and the book is hard to put down 
 This collection brings together three remarkable novellas by Joseph Conrad: Youth, Heart of Darkness and The End of the Tether. In Youth Charlie Marlow recounts the troublesome voyage of the old ship Judea and its wretched 600-ton cargo of coal. The same Marlow also serves as the narrator in Heart of Darkness, undoubtedly the most famous of the three stories. It details how Marlow takes on a foreign assignment as a ferry boat captain on the Congo River in order to restore communications with Kurtz, an eccentric ivory procurement agent isolated in the secluded midlands. Finally in The End of the Tether Captain Whalley, a former dare-devil skipper, sacrifices his retirement and embarks on a precarious voyage on the steamer Sofala in order to support his distant, beloved daughter.   Like many of Conrad's early novels these three stories are set aboard ships. These stories tell of men who go beyond the normal routine of life to challenge themselves, whether from curiosity or necessity, in order to obtain what they seemingly cannot reach. Conrad depicts these desperate men with a vigor that on its own is already enough reason to dive in these stories. But there is much more. The real power of these masterpieces will only surface after a second read. The first reading is like a voyage into the unknown, not unlike the main characters would have experienced it. Only on a second or third reading do you become more aware of the subliminal power of the words and can you appreciate the full power of the colorful narrative. This way the at first read overly long descriptive passages get more and more significance and surely reveal their significance to the story.  One of the many layers to the stories is the drive to react against the self-proclaimed dominance of the human race: both against his environment as against his fellow man. In Heart of Darkness Marlow even literally proclaims that the unbounded exploitation of the natural resources is a disfigurement to the human conscience. Therefore it is not surprising that theme of alienation was craftily interwoven in John Milius' script for Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now loosely based upon Conrad's novella.  Not everyone will be charmed by the dense narrative and slow pace of these stories. But if you manage to see beyond this dated style, what is left is simply a masterpiece 
 Good book if you are 100% new to SQL and the concept of queries.  Not good if you're looking for a more specific language techniques for particular brands of sql.  This book serves well as a nice thick primer before moving on to a more product specific topics.  
 I bought this book a long time ago and have read it countless times since then.  It is one of my favorites.  It is real, well-written, and honest.  
 This is the best value I've seen for a dinosaur set. My sons love it, and several of my friends have gotten it for their own children after they've seen the kids playing with ours. The volcanoes, rocks and mat are a real plus, and the dinosaurs are big enough to be fun for the kids. They play with this set A LOT 
 i like this camcorder because of 2 options that no other camcorder has.  1. can take pictures  2 has that light in the front that let you shoot in the night.  I will highly recommended buying this camera 
 Maria Muldar began with Jim Kweskin's Jug Band. She sang that in the Jug Band. She improved on her own, she had attitude. I appreciate that. Caroly 
 An excellent educational experience for the entire family 
 I think this book aptly showed the flames without having to resort to hideous details for the most part. I also thought that alternating text of the twins and Mengele himself made this book much more effective than it might have been, if an alternate approach was used. This is in short a very tastefully done book of probably the most distasteful material in the history of the human race. All the twins deserve a special place in the hearts of humanity forever. 
 This is a scenario not even Richard Feynman could have imagined when he helped to form Friends of Tuva. Thanks to this group's effort to bring Tuvan throat singers to San Francisco, Paul Pena was able to realize a dream that lifted him out of the depths of dispair and take part in the tri-annual Tuvan throat singing competition in Kyzyl.  This remarkable story not only tells the tale of Paul Pena, best known for penning Jet Airliner, but of the unconquerable spirit of Tuvans who for centuries were subjected to Chinese and Russian rule.  Deep in their throats they came up with a harmony that has beguiled musicians the world over.  But, it was Paul Pena who seemed to unlock the mystery to the western ear and not only take part but win over the Tuvan audience with his brand of kargyraa style singing.  The most amazing part of the story to me is that in order to learn Tuvan, Paul had to learn Russian in Braile in order to translate the words into English, since Tuvan was so rarely heard beyond the steppes of Asia.  This film is so deeply satisfying in its honest presentation of events by the Belic brothers.  The enormity of such an undertaking hit them like a thunderbolt when Mario Castella, one of the few other Americans to appreciate Tuvan throat singing had a heart attack, and Paul was running low on medication to treat his depression.  Worried that it might be the drum the crew had bought as a souvenier, Kongar-ol Ondar, who had befriended Paul, had the evil spirit removed by a shaman.  The storm passed and Paul and the crew were able to enjoy the remaining days in Tuva with Kongar taking them to his home village where he was finally able to get Paul up on a horse and complete this incredible journey.  This is a film you will want to purchase so that you can watch it again and again.  It opens up a new vista for those unfamiliar with this incredible music, bringing it home by showing you its wellspring and introducing you to the marvelous Tuvan people, through the ear of a very special man, Paul Pena 
 I own several books of conversations with authors.  This is the first one I've wanted to read cover-to-cover without pausing for a breath.  It's the first one I haven't been tempted to skim, looking for the best nuggets, because this one is FULL of nuggets.  Capote isn't afraid to say, flat-out, what is on his mind.  The chapter about his contemporaries is particularly interesting to me.    For instance, of Faulker he says:  "Well, he was completely reckless.  I'm not a great admirer of Faulkner.  He never had the slightest influence on me at all.  I like three or four short stories of his, 'That Evening Sun,' and I like one novel of his very much, called LIGHT IN AUGUST.  But for the most part, he's a highly confusing, uncontrolled writer."  Which is all absolutely reasonable.  Then Capote adds, "I knew Faulkner very well.  He was a great friend of mine.  Well, as much as you could be a friend of his, unless you were a fourteen-year-old nymphet.  Then you could be a great friend!"  And Capote doesn't hold back about any of his other contemporaries, either, like Ken Kesey, Jack Kerouac, Norman Mailer, Gertrude Stein, and more.  For instance, when the interviewer expresses his respect for Bellow's HENDERSON THE RAIN KING, Capote says, "Oh no.  Dull, dull."  This book also has several photographs of Capote.  The quality of the photos, at least in my softcover edition, are rather poor, unfortunately, but many of them I've never seen before, such as the one with Truman showing up to a court appearance on a drunk driving charge in shorts!  The caption reads:  "He [the judge] was very insulted...Actually, I looked quite smart.  I had a very smart pair of shorts on and a very smart jacket and shirt and sandals."  In some ways, this is like reading a great comedy routine, yet there are definitely undercurrents of anger and sadness in this book.  I highly recommend it.  
 Universal released the title in summer 2003 and returns with a "collector's edition" at the same price. The main upgrades are Dolby 5.1 audio and an audio interview with Astrid Kirchherr, the German photographer who took the Beatles' first publicity shots. The anamorphic widescreen images (1.85:1) seem about the same as on the 2003 disc, good but sometimes grainy. Other extras, duped from the old DVD, include a director's commentary, a pair of deleted scenes and various interviews that tend to repeat material. Packaging is a lot classier than on the old DVD.   "Backbeat" takes the time to let its bogus Beatles perform entire numbers, mostly soul covers. The real music came from a "grunge" supergroup put together for the film by producer Don Was. The new 5.1 audio sounds sensational, with a vibrant and musical surround stage.  Director Iain Softley ("K-PAX") tells how he spent six years researching and writing the project, inspired by stylish photos he saw of Kirchherr and her lover Stu Sutcliffe, the Beatles' first bass player. The "Backbeat" script was based on her recollections; it focuses on the couple and jealous guy John Lennon.  This might not be a Beatles film, but there's an undeniable thrill when, late in the story, the Paul McCartney character switches to his trademark German bass and the fabled front three wails on "Please Mr. Postman." The film's downer ending gets drowned out by the joys of "Twist and Shout" and the promise of Beatlemania 
 I recieved my book in a timely manner, and without damages. I appreciate the ease of purchase and the timely delivery of my order. Thank you, and keep up the great work.  P.S This book is a must have for Graphic Artists! : 
 This is quite simply the best short comprehensive history of the Civil War available, and has been since it was first published 20 years ago. It was the best short history of anything since Gibbon, and nothing has really rivalled it since.  McPherson places battles, people and politics in a definitive context that strikes the reader as being as close as any human can come to having a "true" understanding of that War.  It is EXTREMELY well written as well, and set the stage for the Ambroses and McCulloughs who followed through and popularized scholarly history 
 I consider this my textbook for recovery.  All types of infidelity are aptly described, and the common traits in the cheating spouse, the affair partner and the betrayed are well illustrated.  The research-based nature of the book is informative, comforting and easy to comprehend.  It did not feel like just another therapist giving their two-cents on the subject.  I plan on giving this book to friends and family members getting married.  In fact, it should be required reading before the ceremony.  The book is long, but don't let that intimidate you.  As a betrayed spouse, I could hardly put it down until I learned all I could, and put myself on the road to recovery, even if not immediate reconciliation.  If you can't afford a therapist, I doubt you could do  better than this guide 
 The typical leadership book is filled with the same old techniques that leaders can employ to inspire, direct, persuade, and monitor the activities and results of followers. The premise of this book is different: leading leaders is a special skill, distinct from leading followers. Salacuse, a well-respected law professor and former dean of law schools at Tufts and Southern Methodist Universities, has done a fine job with this volume.  Even without all the great advice about working with the elite, with the experts, with the cream of the crop, the slam-dunk for me was the fascinatingly insightful comparison between the leadership styles of two people who held the same job at different times. Readers will thoroughly enjoy and benefit from Salacuse's side-by-side presentation of George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush. What dramatically different styles of leading leaders! The full-blown contrast of the two men was one of the most instructive lessons I've read in any management or leadership book. The theme was carried out through the book, gently reminding the reader that there are different ways of leading leaders...that will produce different results.   Readers accustomed to the ubiquitous List of Seven somethings that crop up in far too many books will not be disappointed. Salacuse gives us Seven Daily Tasks of Leadership. You'll learn how Direction, Integration, Mediation, Education, Motivation, Representation, and Trust Creation enable leaders of leaders to build meaningful one-on-one relationships with respected colleagues to generate success. Plenty of examples from various fields give the reader all sorts of personal connections.   You'll gain a lot from this book. Highly recommended. 
 IT'S A WONDERFUL STORY, I'VE ENJOYED A LOT READING IT, AFTER THIS AND "DARK PRINCE" I NEEDED ABSOLUTLY MORE...I'VE BOUGHT  EVERY BOOK OF CHRISTINE FEEHAN 
 Oh my gosh, my daughter absolutely loves this cat.  She has named the cat and each kitten, and plays with them together or separately with equal fun.  They are velvety soft and the magnets that hold the kittens on are quite strong so your child can lug this toy around without losing the babies!  Worth every penny 
 While expertly crafted, this is not a pretty novel, nor is it gentle.  The subject matter -- abduction of a child -- is somber, as are a few gruesome descriptions of death and dying.  The plot twists and turns, as befits a LeHane novel, and one way or another this complicated story finds its way to a denouement which the reader may not find satisfying. But you can usually trust Lehane to take good care of you in this, one of his finer books.  And not only are there plot twists to wrestle with, there are more than a few serious moral issues that will have you squirming or at least scratching your head.  All in all, this was a solid, enjoyable thriller.  The reader will feel his time was not wasted 
 I'm not a big fan of self-help books, and usually avoid them like the plague.  However, I recently heard Victoria Moran speak at a convention on women's health in Cincinnati, and was enthralled by her - both by her youthful, serene personality and the substance of her speech. She is an adept storyteller, and I was on the edge of my seat during her speech. It almost seemed like she was speaking just to me.  So I picked up a copy of this book at the convention, and after reading it through, it now has a permanent place of honor by my bedside.  It's a beautiful book, and shows women a way to give tribute to themselves in what they do, and how they do it. There's something about her writing and philosophy that is very appealing.    Since then, I picked up a copy of "Younger by the Day," which I just began and am loving it. It is especially hitting  home for me, since I just turned 50 when I began reading it. Eventually I would love to have all of her books stacked in a pile by my bed. They are rejuvenating for the mind and spirit, and they make me feel good about myself.  I would also recommend visiting her website at www.victoriamoran.com 
 Big improvement over Final Straw, their excellent previous album.  Bigger sound, better melodies, more confidant singing and songwriting.  High points are tracks 1, 3 and 11 - all tremendous in entirely different ways.  I still think the comparison with Coldplay is valid, but Patrol have better lyrics - less spacey, less pseudo-U2.  Lightbody has become a truly great rock singer, and if the band continues to improve their sound, Snow Patrol has what it takes to be world-beaters.  Like emotionally charged, but soothing modern rock albums? Then BUY THIS ALBUM 
 I love this book. It is great to read more about Edward. He is even scarier than first glance. Yet with a deeper look into his life it is easy to understand why. Can't wait for the newly Anita Blake obsessed maniac to show up in St. Louis 
 I read this book over 30 years ago and it remains one of the most impressive works I've ever read.  It was actually I book I got from the book club because I forgot to tell them not to send it to me.  I thought that I might as well read it and I was thoroughly astounded by what it had to say.  The author, Desmond Morris, takes a look at man as a part of the animal kingdom and gives us a portrait of a species only slightly above other genuses and species.  His examples and explanations are thoroughly compelling and one comes away presuaded.  The question is; persuaded of what?  Does "The Naked Ape" denigrate humans or elevate our fellow primates?  You decide when you read this most enjoyable work written by an author who knows how to communicate his ideas 
 Delafield's Diary of a Provencial Lady is a classic that shares company with the likes of Eudora Welty, Kate Chopin and even Twain. Unlike Welty, Delafield is chatty. But don't let the airy prose fool you. She captures  all the wit and humor of a woman's provencial life in England. Where  Chopin's Awakening is tragic and dream-like, Delafield's world briskly  bumbles along. Her use of present tense almost makes you breathless.  Delafield immediately sets a quick pace and you want to read on and on to   to keep up with all the "goings on" in the book. The piece is  masterfully written and is a must for those looking to expand their  literary boundaries 
 I've been vegetarian for 19 years and vegan-ish for 13 of those years.  I've got my share of veggie and vegan cookbooks, and this is the one I go to first.  The great feat of the book is that it makes simple, ordinary ingredients taste wonderful together.  Every recipe I've made has been a pleasant surprise at the end.  I like food spicy, and I always tend to question the spice measurements of most recipes, but Donna Klein's recipes seem to always get it just right.  I also like that the recipes are free of soy products and meat substitutes.  Another reviewer complained that the recipes were old hat, but I wonder if that reviewer actually tried them out or just read them.  Have faith that these recipes will surprise you with their great flavor, even when extremely simple 
 Third eye blind's eponymous debut is a stunning and invigorating listen from start to finish.  The infectious and cleverly crafted 'Semi-charmed life' and the powerful semi-ballad 'How's it going to be' (two of my favorites) are just the tip of the iceberg.    Tracks 1-10 are all amazing and all speak their own personality, even if perhaps a tad subdued. Then something truely incredible happens, the band tones down slightly and brings the true magic to the table for tracks 11-14.   'I want you' is a catchy little ditty, a tad repetitive, but still great, 'The background' has one of their most beautiful sounding choruses. Those two songs set the listener up for 'Motorcycle drive by' and 'God of wine' which are, hands down, Third eye blind's best songs (both lyrically and musically) and quite possibly the best songs ever written. The former having a nice use of layers and an amazing breakdown in the middle, and the latter having an incredibly  powerful and climatic ending. I'm sorry, but words cannot describe these songs and their genre-smashing greatness.   In short, Third eye blind's 'Third eye blind' = strongly recommende 
 Skagen makes this watch very thin and lightweight with an unbeatable affordable price for titanium watches.  The watch is only categorized as a fashion watch because it looks good for its price.  The quality of the clasp is terrible.  I bought this watch for my boyfriend for vday and he said that the clasp keeps on popping off easily.  He does like the watch besides of that factor cause it is light and great for a everyday beater watch 
 Easy to read, full of wisdom.  I never could figure out how to use Myers-Briggs.  I can use this everyday with everyone I meet.  Useful for all ages, both sexes.  Entertaining presentation helps emphasize a language of Colors that is non-threatening, non-emotional, and constructively wonderfu 
 I purchased this book to learn more about the field.  The author is experienced,enthusiastic and honest in presenting what can be a very lucrative career field 
 did you see the movie?no?well ok then ill tell you.this is the book that made ken kesey[hippie extrordinairre] famous and funded his acid tests.anyhow,the movie follows the book quite well which is good.its all about this guy who fakes insanity in order to be released from a work farm and put into the funny farm.only its not so funny there and he decides to rebel.it will take you through a range of emotions from hysteria to balling your eyes out.its a great book everbody should read. 
 This is an extremely well-written book on the financial and emotional guidelines for estate planning.  My wife's father committed several of the oversights highlighted in this book, and today she and her brothers no longer speak to one another. Believe me - you don't know your children until you see what they do with their inheritance.  Anyone over 50 with a modest estate would benefit immensely from reading this book.   
 I am a Moor and I relate to the stories well. The stories reminded me of the things to avoid for the things that will come. A Moorish Empire will rise again.  Irving starts with his personal journey then he has several stories of gallant and modest characters which makes you feel your in the garden or the palace. It brings back what love was and how it should be. I really like the story of the Father striving to keep his son from learning about love. I know no matter what you do you can never lock love away because of its power and its vast estate one would have to know it is impossible. This is a worth while reader for anyone who knows and wants the best from humanity for it is the Moors who created civilization and it is their station to restore it 
 I loved the kids with wings as a family.I especially loved max,frannie, and kit. This story is good and heartfelt. It made me want to fly and punnish the bad scientists. I recomend this book to anyone who loves sci-fi and fantacy awsome book. 
 I have lived with this book on my shelf since 1973 and I can say that 1) it will indeed change your life and 2) it will teach you to strengthen your imagination to such a point that you will be able to "use" it to achieve certain things--whether real or the result of self-delusion, or real in spite of being the product of self-delusion, I will not begin to say.  But 3) this book does hint at, and eventually allows you to understand, the awesome reponsibility of traveling on this solitary path and 4) it will ultimately leave you wondering why such comparatively trifling achievements, at such great personal risk, are really worth the problems that one encounters in one's daily life through practicing the exercises.  Consider the fact that almost everyone who advances on the road to Hermetics endures chaotic lives and risks a terrible end.  Bardon himself died under mysterious circumstances, and he is just one of many.  Therefore, read the biographies of other practioners first, weigh the pros and cons, ask if a controlled form of madness is your destiny, and by all means beware before using this book.  You just might end up wondering if what you are seeing is "really" there, or merely the product of your imaginative training, and which "really real" is "real"?  The awkward translation and the Germanic lore do not bother me in this training manual as much as they do in Bardon's more literary efforts.      
 This is one of the best mystery novels I have ever read.  This book, like in most cases, is better than the movie.  It is a very in-depth type of book.  *** Recommended Reading-  "Body Of Evidence" by Patricia D. Cornwell.  ** 
 I have been weaving for about 2 years and found this book to be very helpful.  It answers many technical questions I've had about various weave structures.  The author discusses the structure, provides simple examples that then become building blocks for more complicated examples.  She then provides beautiful examples of her work along with the structure explanations.  The explanations are advanced in a logical order  easy to follow and she often provides information on why certain fibers are good choices for a particular structure and what happens when less desirable fibers are chosen. This book is well thought out and very logically presented.  In my view, this is a great book that will provide useful information to even the most advanced weaver 
 I'm not a life-long fan. I heard a few songs on the radio, was impressed by the quality of the song writing and the vocals. I got lucky when I bought this CD. It is enjoyable from beginning to end. Remember music before MTV made image more important than talent? This is it. Take it from a middle-aged father, do yourself a favor and listen to this music - it takes you away to peace and pure enjoyment. I know that this vocal group has been branded as outside the mainsteam, but it is so superior to the top-40 junk that it's amazing. I'm only sorry I didn't find it sooner 
 This review will be used interchangeably for a few titles. Event horizon, The darkness (Anna Paquin), And Jeepers Creepers. These are all excellent in one way or another, have good production values and acting. Jeepers has the best movie monster creation of the last 20 years. And the darkness has a great story and a solid non happy ending. Event horizon has excellent acting by Sam neill and Laurence fishburn and a truly creepy story. The bottom line is you see reviews for movies like these and Wes Cravens They for example where many people give them 2 star ratings while going on and on about The grudge or the ring 2 or house of wax, Blair witch 2 and Ring around the rosie (one of the worst and most pointless movies Ive ever watched.) This just goes to prove once again that the average person refuses to think and doesnt want a movie that might require any thought to follow. Originality is punished by the masses because clever things make them feel dumb 
 This book went beyond my expectations by presenting the history of chocolate in an unbiased, academic yet readable format. A far cry from high school history textbooks, the authors enchant the reader with stories and historical tid-bits while maintaining a cohesive whole. I definitely recommend this book to chocolate connoisseurs, history-buffs, and chocoholics alike 
 Perhaps because I find great solace in nature, I have found this little  book with beautiful photos, prayers, meditative thoughts, to be a great  comfort and an excellent gift to those who are in mourning 
 This book really helped me to put things in perspective and gave me a new insight that empowered me.  I don't feel like I'm a victim relationships anymore, but actually am more aware of the choices that I have made. I would recommend definitely recommend this book 
 Wilkin points to Scripture's instructions as to the most important element in a disciple's jouney: the assurance of one's salvation. In an easy-to-read style, he shares John's excitement for making sure people understand the freeness of eternal life (John 20:31). This is one book I buy for others on a regular basis.  
 The period during which Chicago released their first eleven albums, the Terry Kath era, is generally acknowledged to be their creative zenith.  For comparison purposes, I will leave out three of these albums:  IV (the live album of performances of previously released songs), IX (their first greatest hits album), and XI (with which I am less familiar.)    The remaining eight albums can be grouped thus:  The Sprawling Double Album Masterpieces:  CTA, II, and VII. The Very Good Albums:  V, VI, and X. The Inconsistent Efforts:  III and VIII.  As brilliant as is Chicago's recording history, they never put out a perfect record.   Each of CTA, II, and VII contains far too much landmark material to have been confined to a single LP, but none of the three is without its dry stretches (sides four on CTA and II, and side one on VII.)  But each of these double LPs are without doubt Chicago's greatest achievements, next to which the other Chicago records suffer by comparison.  Those are the discs on which Chicago dismissed the boundaries of popular music, packing every manner of harmonic and rhythmic experimentation successfully into structures that didn't easily condense for radio play.  The fifth and sixth albums are commonly described as the ones on which Chicago abandoned the upper reaches of their jazz-rock experimentation, pursuing more digestible, simpler pop tunes.  While it's true that each of the fifth and sixth records is more concise and pop-crafted than are the double-album magnum opera, they are far deeper than this description credits.  Chicago VI opens in startling fashion, with Robert Lamm's gorgeous but bitter "Critic's Choice," consisting only of Lamm's voice and piano.  This establishes the album's mood.  It's tuneful, but far more introspective and haunting than much of Chicago's previous work, especially than their traditional up-tempo openers.    Throughout VI, Lamm pours his heart out, expressing loneliness and disappointment in his California experience (an sensitive contrast with the amused cynicism that Steely Dan expressed on the same subject.)  The song that originally opened the second side, "Something in this City Changes People," is well reputed for its graceful three-part harmony, but for this listener, the musing, brooding opening, Lamm alone on the piano, is when it inhabits its deepest, most poignant place.  Lamm is not, on this album, about being a hit-maker, but rather about venting a backlog of emotion.  James Pankow's contributions to VI include the two powerhouse hits, "Just You N' Me," and "Feelin' Stronger Every Day" (the latter a collaboration with Pete Cetera.)  Great as these pieces are, for my money it's the lesser-known pieces that make VI one of Chicago's best records.  Lamm and Pankow each contributed terrific up-tempo pieces in addition to the pieces cited above:  Lamm's "Darlin' Dear" and Pankow's "What's This World Coming To." Each is irresistibly funky and good-humored.    If I had to pick a single Chicago cut to play for someone who had never heard the band, I would seriously consider "What's This World Comin' To."  With a single Chicago cut, you usually have to choose between Terry Kath's vocals or Pete Cetera's.  "This World" by contrast brings all of the band's great elements together.  Kath, Cetera and Lamm all sing their lungs out, and the whole band stretches out together with a furious power.  Your adrenaline will be pumping by the gallon by the end of the cut.  Chicago VI's first side is one of the best they ever laid down.  The second side doesn't hold to the same standard, but it's a ridiculously high standard.  This edition of Chicago VI contains two bonus tracks. They are interesting, worthy additions, but not the seamless products that are many of the other cuts.  Chicago band members have reminisced about the difficulty of recording this album at high-altitude, with shortness of breath, and general disorientation.  If that's true, they hid it well.  The horns have rarely sounded better than they do here, and the same is true for the vocals.  Aficionados should listen to and study CTA, II, and VII before this disc.  But for anyone who just wants a great single Chicago disc, this one should be strongly considered.  I would buy it even before its biting, well-regarded predecessor, V.  Chicago VI is one of their very best 
 We have had a set of eight of these in Sea Mist and have used them for morning coffee for several years.  They will sit on Fiestaware saucers just fine.    I have never burned myself with the handle as mentioned below, but tend to hold it with two hands or with the saucer together, not just by the handle.  Fiestaware is very sturdy and even if the handle were larger might feel heavy in one hand.    (They are made like hotel china, essentially.  Homer Laughlin is a hotel china company, in fact.  The first set of dishes I had from them decades ago were some of their hotel line.)  For a bigger cup for cafe au lait style, I can recommend the Fiestaware "jumbo cups."  We have a set of those in Sea Mist and use them for coffee, but also for heating soup in the microwave.  They are both great.  Never been disappointed with Fiestaware 
 I'm very discouraged by country radio's inability to play anything but the "top 20" hits.  It seems like most of the time I tune in, I don't hear the great country music found on the albums in my collection and I live in Indianapolis with the supposedly highest rated and CMA & AMA award-winning country radio station in the country!    At any rate, this album is a great blend of country-pop and Jessica's delivery of the emotion of the songs gets better with every album.  She's definitely growing up!    Keep up the great work, Jessica.  If you loved "Who I Am" and Faith Hill's "Cry", you'll love this album.  
 Victor Hugo never did anything by halves. His NOTRE-DAME DE PARIS begins as a tour of Gothic Paris and ends as a monumental and melodramatic Grand Guignol. Needless to say, all the film versions focus on the wrong character: Quasimodo is by no means the main focus of the novel, and the novel certainly is misnamed when called THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. The hero, if there is one, is the cathedral itself, brooding over Renaissance Paris like a horror from another age.   The only character who is not not overdramatized appears only once in an unforgettable vignette at the very end: Louis XI, King of France, who has been called by the historian Philippe de Commynes "The Universal Spider." Louis; his grasping barber, Olivier le Daim; and his grim hatchet man, Tristan l'Hermite are unforgettable and more sharply drawn than any other Hugo characters I can recall.  John Sturrock's translation is well done except for his occasional inclusion of an archaic term without footnote or any other comment. Most notable are two items of apparel I still cannot visualize, namely bycokets and actons. Yet every Latin phrase, and there are many spoken by Pierre Gringoire and the student Jehan Frollo, is faithfully translated.   Also useful would have been a map of Louis XI's Paris. I was frequently confused about where the action was taking place, because most if not all of the place names were later superseded by others.  I would venture to say that no one reading this novel will ever forget it. I first read it more than twenty years ago, and it still sprang into my mind as sharply-etched as before.  This edition is unabridged. Although Hugo sometimes tended to go off on tangents, I could not think of a single chapter I would axe. Even where it does not add to the plot, it adds to the atmosphere of a city in which life and love were cheap, and no infraction was ever left unpunished by the most dire means possible 
 The ideas that Frank shares within Exuberant Animal, with the world is a greatly needed gift. The wisdom within the pages is enriching, safe, and joyous. Frank offers a timeless, universal approach of self-care that is organic and sustainable. The book offers a message to follow some of the wisdom of our past in todays abstract world, inorder that we live a livestyle of harmony; making a difference in the world  for all living creatures 
 The answer for me is ... rarely is there enough good, insightful commentary in these sets, but this set has it pretty well done.  The special features are, for the most part, unique to the specific movie, and add interesting background notes.  While SUSPICION is one of my all time favorites that I can watch a million times, the suprise of this set for me was I CONFESS.  Hitchcock really delves into his twin interests of wrongful imprisonment and religious conviction.  It also includes a delightfully misty romantic flashback which is silly and endearing because it is the lopsided memory of someone obsessed in love.  (Another favorite theme.)  These are not Hitchock's glossies (except for DIAL M, and North by Northwest), and I do prefer them to some in this predominantly smaller, darker set.  This set seems to be fairly random - but - definitely worth every penny 
  I saw the movie The Producers in 2004 or so.. It was so awful that I had to get the original. And boy am I glad I did.. It was the best comedy that we have seen in a very long time. 
 Does anyone have the instrumental to BT's Never Gonna Come Back Down?  It had a part I really liked that I couldn't hear with the vocals in the background.  It's the song they play while they're hotwiring the Ferraris (and Sway says "Hello, ladies.  Always was a sucker for a redhead.") 
 Like most new things, Las Vegas had growing pains as aptly depicted in THE BATTLE FOR LAS VEGAS.	 	We have all heard of Bugsy Siegel and on the other side, Eliot Ness...but how many are familiar with the likes of Tony...The Ant...Spilotro?  There is speculation as to how Spilotro got  his nickname...some think it was a shortened version of his given name...others thought it was due to his stature.  However the name The Ant came about, he is introduced to us in this exciting portrayal of how Sin City was steeped in not only sin but greed as well. 	 From murder to skimming to prostitution, this account tells it all.  We meet the city officials as well as the law enforcement personnel who were `in the pockets' of these crooks.  The general Las Vegas public appeared to be more obsessed with prostitution than they were with the mobs.  There is a theory that most mob crime is mob upon mob and the average citizen would not feel the tentacles of this corrupt octopus.  The public was so concerned with the sex crimes that they voted out their Sheriff, McCarthy, who went after the mob with a vengeance. 	I would like to see the movie Casino once again now that I can put names to the characters with a much better understanding of who they are...thanks to Dennis Griffin. 	If you'd like a vivid portrayal of how Las Vegas was tamed, be sure to put this on your reading list. 
 A worthwhile read from a very knowledgeable scholar.  The religious views of the Egyptians impacted their entire life experiences. 
 I bought this book at the Hong Kong airport last August and it has been my  favorite flight companion since then. I was able to put the book down between flights, but the detail and depth of this long-winded memoir are so rich that the author has built a San Francisco high rise in my head.   The intimacy of Sean's tween/teenage confession brought me into the world of my new, wealthy, bad boy, wanna-be cool kid friend, suffering from his own entrapment in desire and frustration. Sean does not stifle his compulsion to be seen as tragically comic martyr. The language carries a freshness of naive youth, while simultaneously demonstrating profound grown-up wisdom and humor for the petty melodrama of it all. The writing is psychologically insightful into a mind of privileged youth, unable to adapt, and crippled by anxiety and self-doubt.   I loved how the infantile nature of Sean's emotional longing drew me into feeling like Sean's friend, and parent, while simultaneously knowing that despite his struggles with his narcissistic family, the apple does not fall too far from the tree. There is not much to the narrative of this book, the real juice of it is for the reader who would like to get into the mind of Sean, a not-so-privileged rich kid from 80s San Francisco.   This book is a must read for a window into the struggles of teenage autonomy, family dynamic and the development of addictive neurosis 
 This book discusses the theological basis of southern slave society.  Anyone who questions the religious self-righteousness of the southerners  should read this book because it highlights the contradictions inherent in  the hateful southern society and the teachings of Jesus Christ.  I have  acquired a much greater understanding of the history of the religious  right, and, being a southern black trying to understand the hatred around  which I live, this book enlightens my perspective 
 Although its principal character, Mr Harding, the Warden of Barchester, suffers abject misery and extreme anxiety during most of this novel, the reader of "The Warden" will enjoy one of the happiest, richest and warmest experiences to be gained from the whole of English Literature.    Untypically short, yet three years in the making, "The Warden" has a simple structure that Trollope utlized again and again.  Take a moral dilemma of some sort, one that provides endless pros and cons to be argued, one that possibly takes many hundreds of pages to resolve, explore its social, political and financial implications, and show how it touches the lives of characters not too unlike ourselves.        The dilemma here concerns the income of Septimus Harding, the Warden of Barchester.  Under the terms of a will, dated 1434, twelve superannuated woolcarders were to be accommodated in an almshouse, receiving one shilling and fourpence per day.  A residence was to be provided for a warden who was to receive the income from the remainder of the testator's property.  Now, more than 400 years later, there seems to be an imbalance in these depositions.  The almshouse inmates continue to receive only one shilling and fourpence, while the warden, living on the proceeds of some valuable properties, receives eight hundred pounds annually and the use of the warden's house.    The dilemma faces a young Barchester surgeon, John Bold.  If he allows the imbalance to continue, the wishes of the original benefactor, he believes, are being nullified.  If he succeeds in having the warden's comfortable living discontinued, he will lose forever the possibility of making the warden's daughter his wife.   And so the issue is taken up, argued and publicized.   As Anthony Trollope reveals in his autobiography, this tiny novel was successful enough (it earned him twenty pounds) to lead him to consider writing more of the same, and he soon began "Barchester Towers".    English actor Sir Nigel Hawthorne, brilliant as Archdeacon Grantly in a memorable TV adaptation of this novel, revisits Trollope's Barchester to provide a robust, opulent, complete and unabridged reading that no Trollope enthusiast should miss hearing.     
 And, I guess, will not get it ever 
 Although this book has been written almost 50 years ago it still provides basic insight into our behavior in the modern world. 'Money, prestige and power are the main incentives today for the largest section of our population - that which is employed'. This probably holds still today whereas some of the major concerns of the fifties are not concerning people any more.  A book to read and think about 
 This is an excellent book of golf humor.  It covers all aspects of humor heard on the golf course.  I laughed at the excuses and saw myself and my friends throughout the book.  It is the type of book that you can sit down  and read  or pick up and browse.  If you love golf you will love this book 
 Generally very good nostalgia. More variety in stores would be appreciated. However, I realize information is limited by historically available photography 
 This is an outstanding purchase at a great price and quick service and delivery thanks amazo 
 This is a brilliantly scripted and acted action-suspense-thriller. Some scenes are extra-violent, with one prison guard having his torso carved in half with a power tool during a break-out; in another scene, the chief  villain is sent flying off a tower and ends up pinned like a beetle on a  pole. The first half is undoubtedly the best, with its tense and absorbing  psychological battle between Earl Blake (John Lithgow) and Nick Styles  (Denzel Washington) the smart, wise-cracking cop who put him away, and who  then turns succesful District Attorney. It is Styles's success that Blake  venomously grudges and so he hatches an elaborate and devious plan from out  of prison to destroy Styles. The second half of the film is characterised  by implausibility and anti-climax. But on the whole, the dialogue is above  the average and the action has a hard-trimmed, gritty quality about it 
 This was the first John Grisham book I ever read and it was the best.  NON-stop action, suspense and thrills.  You cannot put it down.  A FOR SURE recommendation 
 The blade and foil combination is the least expensive way to go to replace both of these parts. They fit, look and feel EXACTLY like the original 
  as usual this novel about a bounty hunter was laugh out loud funny all the the way through.  A good pick-me-up read 
 This is a powerful film which features Robert Duvall as a classic tough-guy insensitive, non-PC career marine officer and jet-fighter pilot.  The plot turns on the relationship between this incredibly gung-ho marine and his family, which has not completely bought in to the protagonist's 100% dedication to his marine identity.  His teen-age son, in particular, is not cut from the same cloth as his father, and has no wish to follow in Dad's footsteps.  This results in a conflict that this film handles excellently, and this film is a fine character study.  Duvall is simply brilliant, and the rest of the cast turn in fine performances.  The viewer learns much about the Old South in this film also, with all its grace, culture, manners, and sadly, its bigotry.   This film manages to both inspire and depress the viewer, but it is a powerful viewing experience that is well worth watching and owning 
 Suffering, as so many heartbroken lovers can attest, offers a (dialectical) door - and passing fearlessly through it grants the possibility of renewal. (This is the core concept underlying the AA credo 'hitting bottom first.') Here is the sound of that gateway itself - scored with lush Hollywood affluence, sung with the desperate resignation of the drowning. This is proof, of all the celebrities, Sinatra translated to art the actual living tissue of human experience. To love, to suffer, to dream - itself the (terrifying) secret of life. Listen at your own risk 
 I really liked this movie.  Even with Jeff Fahey looking ill and  somewhat seedy.  I'm not sure what that's about but don't count on him for the interest.  He's necessary to the plot!  Natassja Kinski is beautiful as always and sexy to the nth degree.  The real eye candy in this film is this young man, Josh Holloway.  Money bones with the square jaw and chin, and dimples you could fall into.  I've never seen him before so it was a real treat for me. True, the story is pretty predictable.  The erotic scenes between Kinski & Holloway are very intense. Great chemistry here. To me, Holloway was the most impressive in his role.  He does a great job of portraying a psycho who is used  by the good psychiatrist Fahey who tries to manipulate him into killing  his wife for her money. You love and hate this psycho all within a matter of minutes.  But I think it is primarily because this movie depicts him being used and abused by the doctor/husband and you feel sorry for him. Holloway has a real talent for conveying anything and everything with just a look.  Just pure entertainment.  I think you'll enjoy it 
 In my never-ending search for smaller and lighter travelling accessories, I have tried many power strips.  This is absolutely perfect for my purposes!    I have not yet found a more compact strip.  Not only that, but the design of two widely spaced outlets on each side of the strip permits me to attach ALL my DC converters.  This is something I usually can't accomplish with a SIX outlet conventional strip.  The four outlet stip actually takes up so little space in my carry-on that I am planning to buy the six outlet version before my next trip.  Tiny, incredibly well designed, solidly engineered, and light.  What's not to like?  Highly recommended 
 "Halloween H20" is the best since the first two films from the late 70's and early 80's. I was not expecting the genuine suspense that this 7th sequel provides. This one kind of dismisses part 3-6 as if they were never made. For many that may not be a bad thing. Out of the two latest installments like this film and "Halloween Resurrection".."H20" is much superior! "Resurrection" is a joke! Jamie Lee Curtis dies in a stupid way and the story they came up with is laughable. You'll have to see for yourself on that one. With "H20" keeping with the spirit of the original 1978 classic, you can't go wrong with this "20 years later" anniversary film.     
 CHINESE CINDERELLA      Chinese Cinderella is a breathtaking memoir by Adeline Yen Mah, a young girl from China who is mistreated by her family. Adeline tells about what happened in her life and how she moves around in China in the 1930's and goes to different boarding schools. Near the middle and end, her life begins to fall apart and a lot happens. I think that girls from the ages 12+ would like this book because it's about Adeline's life. I hope you enjoy the book, I know I did! 
 Timeless Face is an exercise program that goes much deeper than just skin care.  The exercises also help emotionally.  I suffer from depression and found in the past nine months of regularly doing both the facial and acupressure techniques that I feel better afterwards.  I feel less tension in my face.    Just as exercise shapes and contours the body, exercise for the face can shape and contour the face.  What happens when specific exercises are used for the face?  The muscles become stronger and the skin becomes resilient.  The user looks refreshed because the droopy skin has been revitalized.   Resistance exercise has proven to tone and lift the muscles in your body.  Facial muscles are no different.  They, too, firm and lift with exercise. The nine-week program introduces two easy-to-perform exercises per week that target fifteen areas of the face and neck.   This highly effective program will improve your upper eyelids, your brows, your upper cheeks and double chin, jaw line, turkey neck, wattle, vertical forehead lines and much, much more.   
 David Fideler is an excellent and able scholar of early Christian history,  symbolism, and epistemology.  This work is a treasure trove of mathmatical  and geometrical information, as it links the 'New Song" of the New  Testament with the timeless harmony of Orphic, Platonic, Pythagorean, and  Kabbalistic number theory. While those thoroughly enmeshed in the 'only  Christians have the truth through Christ our Lord Amen' paradigm will no  doubt be horrified to read this text, we urge all Christians, Gnostics,  Mystics, and people of learning and goodwill to give it the attention and  praise it demands.  On a less positive note, one could have hoped that  David would have brought the practical point of all his knowledge out.   Perhaps he himself does not perceive farther than the psychological and  academic-paradigm-busting aspect--which is, in itself, enough of a  recommendation. Be that as it may, this is not a book to miss 
 Book was received in good condition and received in a timely manner 
 This book covers the tax advantages of each type of corporation and the types of liability of each type of corporation. Being sued is a major concern of todays business and there is information for covering ones own butt in different corporation types. It discusses our culpability and financial responsibility for each involved/concerned individual, officer and shareholder.  
 If you want to learn more about the use of drawings in assessing clients, "Kinetic-House-Tree-Person" is a great book to read.  I was fortunate to have studied with Mr. Burns and his work is outstanding in the field of interpretations of kinetic/house/tree/person drawings. Through this book, I have learned how to interpret the drawings of my clients. The kinetic/house/tree/person drawing is an important diagnostic tool in working with children and adults.  Mr. Burns's extensive use of diagnostic drawings with his clients of all ages is thoroughly documented throughout his books.  Not only do I highly recommend this book, but his others as well.  While many of them are out of print, you won't be disappointed if you are fortunate enough to find one.  For sure, you want to add "Kinetic-House-Tree-Person" to your collection of clinical resources 
 This book was very insightful, and it leaves me to wonder what kind of updated version Mr. Hofstadter might right if he could witness America now. I actually don't think he would be surprised 
 As an avid Feynman fan, I was excited when I saw this volume appear in bookstores earlier this year.  I was not disappointed.  Michelle Feynman, the adopted daughter of the esteemed scientist/safe-cracker/bongo-player/raconteur Richard Feynman, has done a truly outstanding job of compiling the most compelling of her father's communications.  These letters span a lifetime, from Feynman's undergraduate days through his service on the Congressional committee investigating negligence in the Challenger disaster.  What really shines through in all of Feynman's correspondence is his zest for life, his helpful and infinitely curious nature, and his penchant for being quite the cut-up despite being one of the hardest-working physists of his era.    If you have enjoyed reading or listening to other volumes of Feynman's exploits; if you have only approached him as a student of physics; even if you've never heard of the guy, I heartily recommend this book for a few hours of pleasurable reading which will give you insight into the mind of a great thinker and a very compassionate and wacky human being 
 I recently went to New York and found it quiet amazing to watch things from Empire State building. It does not have that adjustability but than that is mentioned in the product description. For the price it goes for it is definitely a very good product 
 Ok Kids, get your copy and hit the books! Who knows what nuggets are inside this darkest of all Dicken novels... Enjoy summer reading until the Fall Season!  
 This book shows you how to "jump the line" and become financially successful faster then you ever thought possible.  Brian Tracy Author and International Renown Speaker 
 I read the Classic Comic version of this book many times when I was a kid. I've only now just read the original and found it's haunting beauty lingered in my mind for the last 2 weeks. The description of Abels mental  travails at the end of the book is a particularly memorable and inspired 
 Like The Annotated Alice, Martin Gardner's annotations set this version above the rest.  The politics and economics of England in the 1870's are prominent in the characters (and in Holiday's caricatures) and Gardner's notes are very relevant in putting what appears to be nonsense into historical relevance.  Also included is a very detailed Bibliography and two Appendices - "A Commentary on the Snark" and "Fit the Seventh and a Halfth" - that Gardner has rounded up 
 Well, maybe not. Unless there was cable TV, a DVD player, and a local video store. But still, this is the best reference on the market when it comes to cast/crew biography. The listing is exhaustive of directors, actors, writers, producers, and others who made important milestones when it comes to film. Included are film terms. It's true that this is not a film encyclopedia, actually, but there are those on the market already. So if the argument here is about the "title" of this guide, get a life already. Maybe you feel you got took...but, by far, you have not. This is the best desk reference of its kind. Believe me. I'm a film producer, writer, and cinematographer. But, above all, I'm a critic and this book is the one guide I would NEVER do without. A good compliment would be, as one reviewer mentioned here, Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide. However, an updated copy of that is released every year late summer-early autumn. So, if it's spring or summer, wait for the next copy. You'll get all the recent films of the last year then. Maltin's guide has details about each film that will be found in no other film guides. Buy it-and buy the Katz guide for sure 
 I would argue that "The Invisible Band" is Travis' best album, though it's not "great" per se. Every song here is fun and catchy, even if the singer is a little questionable and the lyrics are usually not that interesting (they can be at times, however). The songs are usually pretty energetic and feature some lesser-used instruments (like the banjo on the first track), but sometimes they slow down a bit like on "Dear Diary". The best song here is easily "Side" which has "hit" written all over it. This is essentially the song that got me into this album. The instrumentation is pretty good, although it's not necessarily new. The singer's reminiscent of My Morning Jacker's Jim James at times. It's slightly a guilty pleasure, but not by a great measure. Overall, if you like pop rock then chances are you'll like this CD. Recommended!  Highlights include: the entire album 
 Terry Pratchett writes a wonderful book.  This book is no exception.  It involves the witches from the hills with the young witch from the chaulk.  Highly recommended.  Entry is reasonable, but "hat full of sky" is the starting point for the series and since all the books are great, why not start there 
 I have seen this movie many times, but it's always fresh.  My husband and I laughed out loud and had a great time watching it again.  I really enjoyed the special features the DVD offers on John Wayne's son and on his legacy.  AWESOME FIVE STARS AGAIN 
 This book covers two areas of computer technology: creating USB based mass storage systems, using either rotating (disk) media or flash storage. It offers guidance and examples for each of these with a focus on the special requirements and limits of embedded hosts that access USB storage devices.   A design engineer who's task it is to design a USB based memory subsytem has options.  He or she can contact various device manufacturers, request data sheets, and demo or development boards.  This step will be needed.  Next is to prototype several such devices, to create software drivers, and to debug the hardware and software.  One could "google" for sources, and start there, or... One could purchase Jan's book and get a head start with both hardware selection AND with software driver development.  
 [A review of the 2nd EDITION, published in 2006.]  Ok, the back cover has an endorsement, "The most successful sysadmin book of all time". This is hyperventilating that you might not want to take literally. But having said that, the text is a very comprehensive distillation of what a linux sysadmin could be expected to perform. Crucial tasks like backup, adding users and disks, and understanding the makeup of the linux filesystem are explained in detail. Not quite to the depth that you can modify the actual source code of a linux implementation; but that is far more specialised knowledge for other texts.   Another interesting aspect is the analysis of various network protocols. It dumps on FDDI, ATM, Frame Relay and [to a lesser extent] ISDN. The authors have quite strong opinions on the failings of those protocols. Quite a contrast to networking books that might give these protocols much technical explanations, but not divulge the drawbacks that emerged when the protocols were deployed.  Unlike many sysadmin books, this one also has exercises in each chapter, that expand on the chapter's themes 
 I've been an avid PA reader since nigh on 2000 can't recall the actual date I got hooked on it, but I have to say that the way it is written and illustrated had me from the start.  The humor sometimes borders on crude remarks, yet it is direct to the point, which is why I believe it has been so successful.  Their remarks center around video games and the video game industry, but overall, they embark on a flurry of comments that go through the whole spectrum and not just games.  The illustrations have evolved through the ages, and right now you have the chance of reviewing these original drawings, on paper!!  Personally I just had to have this, but others may find that it is simpler to go online and Check the Penny Arcade Archives, having read them for the last 7 years or so, I found that I wanted to be able to review them offline as well, in the comfort of a la-z boy, and without the permanent glow of radiation from my monitor; YMMV 
 Excuse the pun, but I would give this ten stars if I could.  This black comedy/satire has so much going for it, I hardly know where to begin. This film, along with 2006's "Thank You for Smoking", proves that it is possible to produce an adult, intelligent, and thoroughly entertaining film without pandering to the lowest common denominator mentality that most producers aim for.  The entire cast and acting is top notch. Broderick and Witherspoon are the only big names.  The rest are character actors you may or may not have seen before.  The movie is REAL.  It was shot in a real high school in Omaha, using real high school students as extras.  Sometimes, you can see actual classes in session.  This gives the film a realistic feel.  Anyone who has attended high school has had a Tracy Flick and a Paul Metzler in their class. They are not simply stereotypes--their existence in real life makes the story real (the president of MY senior class was on the football, baseball, and basketball teams, and later became manager of the New York Mets when his professional baseball career was cut short because of a knee injury).  I found Jessica Campbell to be the surprise delight in the movie. She is as disaffected as Paul and Tracy are normal.  When they are giving their speeches, Tracy delivers a by-the-book speech, and Paul delivers a barely coherent speech (leaving the galleries staring silently). THEN, Tammy starts HER speech with "Who cares about this stupid election?" She promises to do only one thing as Student Council President--immediately dismantle the student government so nobody will have to sit through one of "these stupid assemblies again!"  She speaks the truth, and the former darkhourse candidate is rewarded by thunderous applause and hoots of "Tammy! Tammy!"  She is punished for her impudence with a three-day suspension ("Being suspended is like having a paid vacation.")  An entertaining movie that actually makes you think, with many memorable lines, with actors who look like real people, with an intelligent, literate story line, "Election" is simply too marvelous for words 
 In the early 80's,the hard rock band I was in listened to this during our "personal" time,away from everybody else,just to get our head's all in the right place.  Every song is good,it's classic Hank Jr.,and the ZZ Top and Skynyrd covers are done with reverence. If you like Hank Jr. at all, you gotta have this one 
 Mark Bassett's "Introducing Roseville Pottery" quickly became my  favorite Roseville guide. It is comprehensive, easy to use, and the vases  are beautifully photographed. Patterns are listed alphabetically, with  years of production noted, along with a description of colors and shapes  used, the shape numbers where applicable, and values. If there's any fault  with this book, is that it does not give a value for every shape (though  enough to give you an idea). However, it appears there is a paperback value  guide on the way to fix that. There is also a wonderful chapter with  photographs of various marks, signatures, and labels, as well as an  appendix regarding reproductions and fantasy pieces. One caution to  Roseville lovers, after an hour paging through this book at the real  Roseville, you'll be picking out new patterns to pursue 
 This book is the standard reference for all numerical linear algebra.  It is a graduate-level applied math textbook written by practicing professionals for practicing professionals.  If you are new to the topic you would probably prefer something like James Demmel's Applied Numerical Linear Algebra.  If you are interested in implementing the algorithms in this book, stop right now and first make sure that you can't use MATLAB or LAPACK instead, or even ScaLAPACK if you need a parallel implementation.  Getting these algorithms right is hard, and the hard work has probably already been done by somebody else.  LAPACK contains the accumulated wisdom of over forty years of research in numerical linear algebra, and MATLAB contains LAPACK.  Don't re-invent the wheel.  On the other hand, if you want to understand how LAPACK works, or if you need to understand its numerical accuracy and stability, then this is the book for you.  Another reviewer has mentioned that this book contains numerous errata in the formulas.  This is still true as of the third edition.  Usually it is possible to detect and correct these errors by reading and understanding the surrounding text, but beware 
 This is one of the finest shows ever to be put on television+a prime example why network executives are ratings driven clueless morons.  For a show of this calibre to be cancelled while dreck like Family Matters,Americas Funniest Home Videos+Full House are allowed to continue ad infinitim is unconscionable.  Rarely has television see a presence as luminescent as Sela Ward--I am beyond thrilled that she is back on TV in "House".  The story of two broken families trying to pick up the pieces and find happiness again is done so well it is almost heartbreaking.  Adults+children are given mature storylines+allowed to excel--especially Julia Whelan+Evan Rachel Ward.  Ward especially is as revelation--more so in season 2 where she is given as story line that should have won her an Emmy.  Shows like this are the reason TV was created.  The 3 seasons of this show contain more real heart and drama than a 7-10 year run of the crap on today.  This is probably the finest ensemble drama since St.Elsewhere.  I would give it 10 stars if I coul 
 Difficult to read in the beginning but picked up and was hard to put down!  Reader became attached to both the hostages and the terrorists.  The last chapter was a shock - I doubt anyone expected that outcome 
 I couldn't ask for more.  It dropped right in and worked flawlessly.  I connected it to a 4-port 3.5 inch front-bay USB 2.0 hub using the internal USB port, and that's working just fine too.  The hardest part on that was prying out and breaking off the little metal bay cover that the Dimension 4100 uses for RF resistance.  Now I have so many USB ports it's almost ridiculous.  I have all of my toys connected and still have ports left over 
 a magnificent mix of pictoral and narrative. as enthralling as a british mystery,  you can't wait to pick it up and read and delight at the pictures 
 I got my copy of Homeschooling, The Teen Years and read it through immediately. It was such an encouragement. Although we have been homeschooling for more than five years, sometimes I get cold feet and fear  that we are not doing enough.  Cafi's book points out the many ways we  educate our kids every day and gives suggestions for new things to try. I  highly recommend this book to people who are considering homeschooling  their teens, and especially to those who are already doing it 
 I'm SO happy!!! Cry-Baby AT LAST ON DVD!! about time! This is a MUST SEE MOVIE! If you havent got it, GET IT! If you havent seen it, SEE IT! Its one of those movies that makes the world a better place ;-) Cry -Baby represents every adolesent girls dream,he sings, has a bike, and when the Squares cant beat him, thay join him! Its a classic and a MUST have for any movie mogal 
 I love this book and it truly changed my outlook on my life. Its not a quick fix book to just help find a boyfriend. Its a book that makes you really dig deep and look at yourself. Not only is it a wonderful story about the author and a process of healing but she makes some great points that just made me think "wow, that is me and she is soooo right". It was a huge eye opener in many ways and helped me see why I kept dating the loosers I was and kept letting people negatively influence me. It helped me to really see what was going on and break that cycle so I could focus on other parts of my life. Since doing so I have made a lot of life improvements and am happy to say... have met an incredibly wonderful man and am in a solid loving relationship. The book changed my thinking from" I don't think I will ever get this" to "I don't deserve any less than what I want". I highly recommend it 
 I purchased this book for my son in second grade who is  captivated by the tragedy of the sinking of the Titanic and this book was perfect for his reading level and probably younger readers too. He has watched several movies about the Titanic and he took this book into school today to share with his class. It gives a very good account of the facts and brings the reader forward to it's dsicovery in the 1980's. It is a good book for the kids to read to themselves or for parents to read to them. I liked it myself 
 I consider myself an experienced reader and am not so easily wowed by a 'nice story'. However, this was very enjoyable, and I finished it in a day! It's got romance, erotica, adventure and more. I'd recommend it to anyone (except perhaps my mother....) 
 I have found this book one of the most useful ethnographies for teaching undergraduate anthropology courses focusing on schooling in cultural context. My students find the book very accessible, and often say how  surprised they are at how little they understood of their own education  before they encountered Eckert's work. The book successfully addresses  cultural aspects by framing them in a coherent social structural analysis.  Concrete examples and straighforward evidence support the theory, which is  presented so well that is remains within the grasp of most undergraduate  students. Perfect for complementing ethnographies of schooling outside  North America. I consider this book essential reading for anyone planning  to teach in the public school systems 
 This is a really good book. It really shows the bacics of philosophy. When  i came home i have been wanting to read the rest of the book badly 
 My first "dummy" book.  Easy to read & follow - a great resource. I knew NOTHING about horses - needed to learn.  VERY helpful introduction to the whole world of horses and horse riding! I'm sure this will be a resource I'll keep around for awhile 
 This Eeyore is so much fun.  I gave it a 4 because the little butterfly is too easy to lose, but if Mom and Dad are diligent to keep the part with the toy and teach Baby to keep them together, I think there is also something to be learned with this, plus the fact that he is so DARN cute and the little voice is sweet and soothing. "GOOD NIGHT BABY."  Just precious.  Baby quickly learns that Eeyore only works with the butterfly rattle.  I thought the ears would be easy to break, but they have taken a lickin' from my grandson and still work.    Nana Ka 
 I have always been fascinated with Lady Jane's story, ever since I was a child. I have read most of Alison Weir's non-fiction books and loved them, and so I really looked forward very much to this book. And it didn't disappoint. She has fictionalized the story very well, holding strong to accuracy (and we know we can trust her in this, as a historian) and the few liberties she has taken (for example, Lady Jane's presence at the execution of Anne Askew) are not glaring or out-of-place.  The relationship between Jane and Guilford was portrayed as brutal, perhaps overtly so, but I much prefer this over the notorious innacuracy of their relationship in the 1986 movie. Again, a place where Weir had to "fill-in-the-blanks", and I am glad she did so in a more realistic way than others have chosen to when telling this sad story.  The constantly character-shifting narration did not bother me, although at first I was disappointed in the choice of the executioner's narration for the final scene of Lady Jane's life; I would have preferred Mrs. Ellen, as it seemed so impersonal. But ultimately, maybe this was a good choice; Jane herself was, in that situation, detatched from those who had cared for her, and so why shouldn't the reader join her in the hands of this stranger?  The author's afterword, to me, was one of the best parts of the book. You can tell she is excited about her first fiction. She's sharing her experience of having written it with the reader, even mentioning how she had to "use her imagination" in parts. It's endearing. You can tell she had a good time writing it, and I appreciate that she shared those feelings with us.  "Innocent Traitor" is a good book, based on a horrific and tragic story, and I'm very glad this respected author decided to tell it accurately.  
 If you are already a Lauren Dane reader, you know that you are guaranteed to fall absolutely, madly in love with her characters. If you have never read Ms. Dane, Giving Chase, though not her first book, would be an excellent book for a first time Dane reader.   Dane does it again, weaving a tale of a spunky, independent, strong woman with a fractured past. The leading women in her books always represent how, no matter what your past, you can overcome, and through it all, still deserve love and passion. It isn't hard to fall in love with the men in Dane's books either. Beyond being beautiful, the level of adoration and abandon they display in their love is breathtaking.   I will say that the pace of this book was unusual. Not only by Dane standards, but by standards of most books. The way the story is told, is like a passionate night with a lover. As the story moves on, Dane brings the characters into conlict, climax and resolve multiple times. Just when you think that all the loose ends are covered, Dane throws a plot twist that keeps the ride going. It helps that one of the characters is completely unbalanced, but it kept things from being formulaic.   I started reading this book at 1:30 AM because I couldn't sleep and needed the escape. At 7:00 AM I was finishing the book (no sleep). I could not leave those characters. I cried for them, I cheered for them, I felt as if I was having holiday dinner with them. Even the supporting characters are extremely well developed, with their own past, personalities and agendas.   Giving Chase will take you to the edge, bring you down and ramp you right back up again. Although the sexual content comes far later than expected, that is part of the enticement and anticipation. This is a book that feeds the Lauren Dane addict 
 Having not known much about Capote before reading this biography, I have since become fascinated with his writings and his outrageous life.  The biography is told mostly through interviews with Truman himself and verified from many of his friends and family (since Truman was known for his exaggerations).  It was a great insight to a wonderful writer who had a hard but colorful life 
 The book arrived on time and in great condition.  It was an enjoyable read 
 This is not a technical book.  It's a very clear discussion for the lay (though scientifically inclined) reader.  Each chapter covers a different disaster, some of which are more well known than others.  Surprisingly, even the events I thought I wouldn't learn anything new about, like 9/11, the Columbia Space Shuttle, and 3 Mile Island, were fascinating and filled with information I haven't seen elsewhere.  The best chapters have great diagrams showing the sequence of what went wrong.  My only criticism of the book is that there aren't more of these.  On top of the specifics, Chiles builds interesting and convincing arguments for why things like this happen, and how people can make them less likely in the future.  The book is very cool -- like a series of short "Into Thin Air"/"Black Hawk Down" diasaster stories, all of them good 
 This is the first book on dieting that I have actually ever read past the third page. I read it from cover to cover in one sitting. Not only does the information make perfect sense, it works. I went from a size 10 to a size 4 in three months and I even cheated a little. I had started reading other information on low-carb diets, but most of it was so strict, I don't know how anyone with a family could stick to them. I am a true believer in this balanced way of low-carb eating. I have purchased about 10 of these books just to give out to friends. If you are serious about changing your eating habits permanently and maintaining your desired weight, this is a perfect place to start 
 I found about this book through the reference section of the "Blink" by Malcom Gladwell. Though Blink is more interesting to read, this book has more stuff in it. This book helped me tremendeously in understanding the decision making when faced with time constraints 
 Though I may agree that BiterSweet may not be as enjoyable (merely for the fact that the debut KIM Richey, was nearly flawless), it is certainly a great album by a highly talentled artist.  This album features her crossover hit "I Know", which is socmething the debut can not claim.  Richey's hit from the first album was "Just My Luck" which was widely recieved by country radio, but "I Know" made it continuously onto VH1, which I can recall the black and white video to this day. :)  I highly reccomend this disc as comparred to "Rise" which i found to be a bit too experimental for Richey, though I admire her for trying new things.  In addition to the debut and this release, my favorite Kim Richey release is "Glimmer", which features my fav song by her "Keep Me" as well as many other great song!  Rock on Kimmy! : 
 It's amazing how much information is in this rather small book. You could keep it in your pocket as you built your own functional yurt. The writing is to the point and very informative. I've checked out many books on building yurts and this is the best. High points of this book for me: clear patterns, listing of materials and tools needed, time estimates for building, vocabulary of yurt parts, basic history of the people who use yurts, their various regions, and yurt variations. Get this book if you really want to build a yurt and do it right 
 This is a copy of a sketchbook of Cezanne's pencil sketches.  It has a good introduction and explanation followed by a listing of the sketches and then finally all the sketches.  Interesting to see if you like to draw, and especially to see if you enjoy Cezanne's paintings 
 It shows a side of drugs that people without an addiction are rare to find.  It is an honest account from a not so honest guy about an absolutely shameful pastime.  I love this book 
 Are you the type of person that is planning on going to college, but doesn't have the money to do it? Well this is the right book to read. This book may be written in poems but it doesn't mean it rhymes and it's boring. This book talks about a young teenage girl named Lavaughn.   Lavaughn is a 14 year old girl in her freshman year at high school. Lavaughn's character in the book is interesting because she is just like any girl at high school she is smart and a really nice girl. She likes to help people a lot and she is the type of girl that appreciates what she has since she lost her father she knows she has to become someone in life to help her mom out. She plans on going to college. But her problem is that since her mom is the only person she has and the only person that works she doesn't have enough money to do so. So she decides she wants to help in someway.  She decides on working to earn and save some money so that she will be able to go to college. Lavaughn then takes a babysitting job. She is going to take care of 2 little children, Jeremy and Jilly who are not even potty trained yet so they most likely depend on her for everything. She takes this job to help a young mother named Jolly.  Jolly is a young 17 year old mother. Jolly has many problems. First she has two kids that she has to take care of alone. Then she has been sexually abused too many times. Jolly is a young mother who works hard to feed her kids and pay the rent alone. Since she doesn't have parents and doesn't have the baby's daddy with her. When Jolly gets fired after being sexually abused by her own boss she doesn't do anything but instead tries to find another job. This is a problem for jolly because since she got pregnant at such a young age she didn't even finish school and nobody wants to hire her now.   Jolly doesn't have no where to pay Lavaughn from and Lavaughn needs the job and the money for her college. When Lavaughn's mom finds out that jolly doesn't have a job and that her daughter Lavaughn is not going to get paid she doesn't agree and she tells Lavaughn to look for another job instead. But will Lavaughn listen to her mom or will she help baby-sit the children for free while Jolly looks for another job? Find out what happens in make lemonade.  This story is really interesting because of the condition Jolly lives in and because of the way she is. She doesn't have anyone to help her and she doesn't do anything when she got sexually abused. Also the way she handles things and just goes along with them and the way she is able to barely handle them.  I felt really good reading this book because it just kept me interested in wanting to know what was going to happen next. I really liked this book because it talks about the goals that some teenage people have and the way that some people's life are. This book may not be based on a true story but it has the true story about what life is about. I really recommend this book `' Make lemonade `' to everybody, not just to certain people. I recommend it because it's not about romance or about war but it's about life. Something that everybody should be interested in. 
 I rarely give any movie five stars but this one deserves the rating. The first time I saw this movie I was completely freaked out, I had a hard time sleeping for a week; across the street from me there is a well next to an house i could hardly look at it for three months with out having an strong urge to run back into my house and hide. Recently I found the cursed video on the internet I can't sit through ten seconds of it. So if you want to be scared watch this movie you will not be dissapointed.  P.S. if you want to freak out your friends download the video from the web and after it's done playing make your phone ring and watch the fun. 
 If you had acted on the advice in this book 3 years ago you would be rich, but don't let that stop you from reading it now.  By most historical models the stock market remains wildly overvalued and the information in this book retains its validity today.  This book is a joy to read and offers balance to the talking heads at CNBC and the other mainstream media outlets that could never call a top to the market, but issue new prognostications about a bottom every week.  The information on short selling alone is worth the price of the book 
 Now that i have had this on my camera for a while now, my camera feels so weird with it off, i love the grip it gives and the extra battery life is great for those all day shooting events that i go to. I wish the buttons were the same plastic/chrome color as the ones on the camera but its a well built product and works fine so i cant complain 
 i really didn't expect much from this product. In fact, i left it in the box in my yard all winter. The weather here finally improved, so I decided to break it out and see if it would really work. to my surprise, i found myself spending an hour hitting forehand after forehand. it really works and helps improve consistancy of strokes and allows you to really hit out on your shots. a great investment for those who like to swing a racket and smash a tennis ball 
 History often creates more fantastic and dramatic tales than any writer's imagination can produce, and this book is no exception.  Bergreen did a fine job, to be sure, but Magellan, his mutinous crews, and the sea did the hardest work for him.  Almost all of the detailed information regarding the great voyage came from the very well written accounts of Antonio Pigafetta, the original, firsthand chronicler of the journeys.    The task left to Bergreen was merely to translate and organize the historical accounts into a flowing tale in modern English.  And he does so very well.  For those who are not already familiar with the voyage of Magellan, this book is both a decent history of this most important event as well as a really good story.  Without straying too far from his purpose--that is, telling the tale of the adventures of Magellan and his crew--Bergreen lets you in on the interesting, but minor details of the story.  Little tidbits like the amazingly high profits to be made on spices that drove men like Magellan to make so perilous a journey (one sack of spices could feed a family for years in Europe), and the financiers in Europe to back such voyages (bankers made all the real money then, and governments were frequently in debt--much like today) provide the reader with very interesting insights into the lives of these people who lived half a millenium ago 
 I really think you can never go wrong with Mr. Potato Head ... it teaches kids problem solving and creative thinking, while also letting them practice their small motor skills.  Plus, it's fun!  I've caught myself reliving my childhood by playing with this toy as well.  I will say, at 18 months, my daughter still puts a few of the pieces in her mouth.  So, we took away the earrings and flower so she didn't try to swallow them.  The one dissapointment is the suitcase.  I thought it'd be a great way to keep all the pieces together, but ... First, the case falls apart on a regular basis.  It's easy to put back together, but it's a pain to deal with.  Second, it's difficult to simply throw all the pieces into the case - they really have to be put in a certain way to all fit in properly.  I can do it with a few minutes of work, but I can't see my 18-month old having enough patience to do it.  I gave up on the suitcase after a few weeks, and put the pieces in a see-through bin.  The case is a nice idea, but it didn't work for us.  The problems with the case would not stop me from getting this set though - it offers a lot of variety 
 Aaaah, what a wonderful trip back in time this album gives me! Junior high and high school come wafting back to me with every well-loved song.  Barry White was quite a versatile musician, and this album even taught me something about musical history that I never previously guessed.  While I've always loved Barry's vocals, and always adored "Love's Theme" (the ultimate make-out song), I had no idea that Barry's own orchestra performed it.  The quality of the recording is top-rate, and it really is a highly enjoyable trip down memory lane.  I just wish people would stop referring to this sort of music as "nostalgic."  I REFUSE to feel old enough to classify anything I danced to as a teenager with such a dry and dusty old word.  And no matter how old the music on this CD gets, it will never be dry or dusty 
 I had never heard of Sears homes until I found out that a home I had previously lived in, was one!  Since that day, I have read and researched these fascinating timepieces and how they fit into our American history.  Whether a history buff, architectural/house buff or if you simply love to learn, Rosemary Thornton's love for these homes and their value comes through in her books, teamed with her obvious extensive research, to provide a wonderful read.  Any book where you can feel the authors passion, and have it rub off on you, is special.  I also own, and recommend, her book "Finding the Houses that Sears Built", which has some of the same information, but more pictures of actual home styles and plans.  Both books are worth it!  I have officically become a Sears Home advocate!!!!  Thanks to Rose! 
 Du Maurier captures the essence of Victorian hierarchal society in the must-read.  Through her controlled use of dynamic prose, this classic romantic suspense practically turns the pages on its own.  Set in the heart of Maxim de Winter's gargantuan estate, Manderley, the narrator learns about Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, and her untimely death.  This novel proves that some secrets, no matter how hard one may try, refuse to stay buried.  
 It's been my experience that singles which only contain remix versions of the same song are either hit or miss, with little middle ground. Fortunately for Jewel, remixes of her songs tend to be good. This new single is no exception. I can definitely see how "Only One Too" would make a catchy remix/dance song, and these 5 tracks offer plenty of toe-tapping. There are no real surprises, and the beats are rather predictable. But it's still a worthy Jewel single.   All in all, if you liked her "Serve The Ego" single you will like this one. Recommended 
 This is very good information that is to follow.  He has done a good job on focusing on wellness and how to achieve this.  I like most because anyone can do it and it does not take a Doctorate degree to follow.  Thanks for putting this together.

 "A Tale of Two Cities" is one of Charles Dickens' greatest and darkest novels. Set in the final quarter of the 18th century, Dickens presents to us the brutality that led to the anarchy of the French Revolution, as seen by Britons and by the Revolutionaries themselves.  Today's readers may seem put off by the overwhelming amount of coincidences that occur in the book, but no one I know of thinks it made the story suffer. I have taught "A Tale of Two Cities" many times and not one student had a problem with this. In fact, very few students disliked the book.   Which brings me to another point: the Dover Thrift Editions are great money-savers. For two and half books, they get a well-bound and printed, quality paperback that won't hurt their already financially-strapped wallets.  Rocco Dormarunno College of New Rochell 
 You either love John Mellencamp or you don't. I do and have since I watched the old "Friday Night Videos" on NBC-TV way back when. John is a part of our heritage, Americana, whatever you want to call it. "Freedom's Road" is a continuation of John's journey which I still believe is not over. I truly hope John will continue to provide us with his talent and keep the spirit of America alive and well in his writing and lyrics. The music will flow naturally from him and his accomplished band members.  If you are a fan of John Mellencamp, get this album now and start enjoying it. It's been a long time but the wait was worth it. Congratulations, John! Keep up the good work and may your spirit soar higher and higher until you reach that final resting place 
 Excellent choice of artists to reinterpret and reinvent Leonard Cohen's tunes and classic lyrics.  Martha Wainwright's, The Handsome Family's and Nick Cave's interpretations stand out --made me go back to my Nick Cave collection and look for his own interpretation of Tower of Song.  Even those who might be a bit tired of Cohen's original mesmerizing, yet  at times monotonous, vocals will really appreciate this collection.  I look forward for more like this

 I lived the first 30 years of my life less than 30 miles from New Auburn, Wisconsin.  So when I fortuitously discovered that the author hailed from the same neck of the woods, I promptly purchased the book from Amazon.    When it comes to reading for pleasure I read at a snail's pace. A John Grisham novel typically takes me several weeks to read.  By comparison, I actually read this book at record breaking speed.  It was impossible for me to set this book down for long.    There were times when I was nearly rolling on the floor laughing but there were even more times when I literally shed a tear or two.  Most books don't engage me emotionally to this depth but then again most books are not written by such an insightful person,  Especially when it comes to matters of human nature and mortality.    And yes, mortality is an issue that this author brings to the fore on many occasions.  In fact, if I had to sum up a central reoccurring theme it would be this.  We humans are on this planet for a very short time and are balancing on a very thin and precarious wire each and every day that we rise from our beds.    I never felt that the author was an especially cynical person but rather a realistic one who chose to contemplate death as he continued to learn how to help others to live.  His choice of an altruistic occupation simply confirms the lesson that many wise persons have learned, that "there is more happiness in giving than in receiving."    This book moves quickly with plenty of realistic and graphic imagery of his experiences in the rescue field interacting with scores of colorful characters.  The author is an excellent wordsmith and is incredibly introspective in the matters of the human psyche.  I am hooked and intend on reading his other offerings.       
 The book links globalization to the development of sport as a business. It's a great read and the authors take readers into the future of sport business based on the identification of a number of globalization trends. The book is a must for marketing professionals in the business of sport 
 The D.O.C. could have rivaled the greatest MCs alive like Rakim, Chuck D, and Ice Cube.  But his vocal chords were tragically destroyed in a car accident after he released this CD.  This cd is very good.  It is one of the few albums you can listen to from track 1 to the end.  Of course these days it's basically impossible to find one.  The beats are great, and the lyrics are clever, although sometimes i feel they could have been better.  His harsh sounding voice has a nice feel, and although he did release more albums after this one that were lyrically better than this, his (lack of a) voice kind of killed them.  Dre's production is sick.  Overall this one's a 4.5/5.  1. It's Funky Enough      -Beat: 5      -Lyrics: 4      -Overall: 4.5 Sick beat on a classic first track.  2. Mind Blowin'       -Beat: 4.5      -Lyrics: 4      -Overall: 4.5  3. Lend me an Ear      -Beat: 5      -Lyrics: 4.5      -Overall: 4.5 A very hot fast rap by D.O.C.  4. Comm. Blues A break  5. Let The Bass Go      -Beats: 5      -Lyrics:4.5      -Overall: 5 Great song with a nice bass.  6. Beautiful but Deadly      -Beats/guitar: 5      -Lyrics: 5      -Overall: 5 My second favorite joint on the cd.  Some great guitar solos.  Rapping on top of a guitar is a very nice touch.  Love it.  7. The D.O.C. & The Doctor      -Beats: 5      -Lyrics: 5      -Overall: 5 One of the (many) classics on the cd.  8. No One Can Do It Better      -Beats: 5      -Lyrics: 5      -Overall: 5 The title says it all...  9. Whirlwind Pyramid, 9.5/10       -Beats: 5      -Lyrics: 5      -Overall: 5 Great great great...  10. Comm. 2 Another break  11. The Formula      -Beats: 5      -Lyrics: 5      -Overall: 5 amazing song.  12. Portrait Of a Master Piece      -Beats: 4.5      -Lyrics: 4      -Overall: 4 Very good faster rapping by the DOC.  13. The Grande Finale      -Beats: 5      -Lyrics: 5      -Overall: 5 My favorite track.  It features NWA, with raps by ice cube, ren, and eazy.  I loved the NWA stuff more than the individual joints by all of them, so throwing the doc into it is like heaven for me.  overall i say this album is a must have for anyone who's into the birth of hardcore/gangsta rap from the Golden Age 
  Oh thanksgiving day, I am thankful for this book and the great help it was for me during the past year. If you are applying to law school or even thinking about it, get this book, it is very helpful. It has examples of essays to help you figure out how to write your personal essays, it also has a time line, so you can schedule the year accordingly until the time you are planning to get into that law school of your choice.well that is just couple of examples, but it is great. Good Luc 
 I'm currently a student at St. Louis University, Parks College of Engineering and Aviation.  I am a sophomore in Biomedical Engineering, and although I have not done extensive study with the book, our dean of  Biomedical Engineering at Parks and other Professors at SLU rate this book  as one that we should not have only for class, but to keep for our whole  lives as a Biomedical Engineer.  This book is great because it can be used  at any sequence of a undergraduate degree program in Biomedical Engineering  with easier topics such as Ethics to very challenging topics 
 Straight from Amazon.com the world's best set of salt and pepper shakers. Not only are they functional but good looking as well. They fit perfectly in any cooks hand. Wouldn't know what to do without them 
 I had never read a Ludlum novel until this one, although I have seen the "Bourne" movies. The Prometheus Deception is one of the best suspense thrillers I've ever read. It keeps you guessing and it is very fast paced. And it wasn't a simple plot, but a web of intrigue. I enjoyed every page and highly recommend it. I look forward to my next Robert Ludlum. 
 Lemon Jelly is one of the most unique style's of music that I've heard.  They combine speech recordings with looped samples from various sources and manage to create beautiful music.  "A tune for Jack" has a nice jazz piano lick, a baby saying "oom-baby, ba-bum-ba-bum ooom-baby," and and a laid-back beat.  At the beginning a man is in South America capturing a sea elephant and there are these barking noises that sound gross.  It's hilarious!!  These guys have a great sense of humor and it really shows on this collection of ep's.  This album can be very thought-provoking on some tracks such as "page one."  It's not like really deep metaphoric poetry like on most pop or rock albums because it is a voice recording probably taken from some book on evolution or something.  But, the combination of the vocals and the sampled pianos, bass, guitar, and what not create an atmoshpere or mood that draws you into a different world as you ponder what the man is saying.  A few of the tracks don't have any words, but they are also excellent.  "Come" is such a dreamy, laid-back, and simple, song - a perfect closer.  The harmonica meanderings on that song are so great.  They take the song to a new level.  It is hard to pick a favorite from such a diverse, yet equally good album, but "the Staunton lick," and "page one" are two of my personal favorites.  But, seriously, this album maintains it's excellence from track one all the way to nine!  It will take you on a rollercoaster of  thoughts, and feelings that will surely leave you gaping and drooling for more sweet lemon jelly 
 My grandmother buys baking soda in bulk and loves using it, so I bought this book for her one Christmas.  She seems to like the book and has been able to use many of the suggestions.  One of the tips that she found helpful was using baking soda for cleaning the oven.  Baking soda can provide a natural alternative to many other products.  This book can be an inexpensive gift or a helping hand for you 
 I believe Al Reis is one of the most important contributors to the principles of marketing as we know. I read this book and his other book about Laws of Marketing years ago. I still think the ideas in these books are timeless. I still browse them from time to time to refresh my memory. I would recommend this book to anybody who wants to be a businessman or successful in their careers. I believe it is a neccessity to learn about the principles of branding and marketing in today's business world wether you are in marketing, advertising or finance. Easy to read, great to learn. 
 I'm an avid movie maniac.  I have certain films that I can only watch at certain times of the year, and do, every year.  Other Peoples Money, starts off my fall movie viewing, after Halloween of course.  I love the new England Autumn charm of this film.  The story is good, dialogue clever and the chemistry between Miller and DeVito is scary.  An unlikely romanic couple if ever there was.  A Classic in my book 
 This book offers immediately usable healing processes that even those who are not familiar with meditation can use. I found Dr. Gaynor's approach of healing from deep within the spiritual core to be immensely moving and  transformational. I have used the processes myself with astonishing  results, and I highly recommend this book to anyone with issues that need  healing, whether physical, emotional, spiritual, or all three 
 a little too raunchy for me, and ok i guess that is the point, so congrts to the author for that but i think it takes away from the level of funniness.  you can be funny w/o being so rude and obnoxious.  again, that is funny but a little over the top that's all 
 I bought this for my 3 year old daughter 3 months ago and we love it.  I like the sensible safety features and sturdy workmanship.  She likes the bucket in back, lively colors and comfortable seat.  It is missing some features the other Kettler trikes have, but this one is available for half the cost of the more expensive Kettlers.  It has the 45 degree turn restriction which helps prevent tipping over (As with any trike some spills can happen over months & years of active use - please use helmets!).  It is adjustable for rider size and is fairly easy to assemble despite slightly sloppy assembly instructions.  It doesn't have a bell, but my daughter enjoyed customizing her bike with a bell of her own choice (an extra $6 at a local bike shop).  The trike is sturdy but not too heavy like many trikes can be.  It "goes off road" on bare earth under the spruce trees in our yard, but we got it mostly for sidewalk use - where it does well.  My only other minor quibble is that the plastic tires skid on some dry smooth surfaces.  I think any child would be delighted with this tricycle 
 Bought this book for my mother in law, who has been trying to find it for years.  It's a one of a kind narrative that's unique in that it is about a soldier who went all the way through the Revolutionary War from beginning to end.  She was thrilled and said it was a terrific source of insight and information 
 If you loved the first one then you'll most likely want more!  The show is incredibly addicting, because it's so well done, fun dramatic writing and acting.  What's different with this season compared to the last one?  The actors have grown more into their characters, before it had made more teen angst; this one has more adult angst.  Sandy and Kirsten are by far still the central unit in The O.C., but even they begin to have some obstacles and troubles thrown into their rock solid relationship.  Kelly Rowan "Kirsten" does some of her most finest acting work for the show in this season, taking her character to dramatic heights noteworthy of critical appraisal.  Ryan ended the second half of the first season by becoming a little too meddling into everyone's affairs, and making bad relationship choices, but he then slowly gains a little bit of your trust on him again in the second season, by taking it down a notch.  Seth was once the most entertaining one has now become a little on the annoying side in this season.  You want him to stop rambling and back away, let the other characters shine.  Marissa's character actually gets better in season two; she becomes much edgier, a little more self aware and much cooler.  You get the feeling she is completely in tune with what's really up with everybody.  The gay rights activists should applaud "The O.C." and Mischa Barton for crossing the gay line to a huge teen audience in a positive way.  Julie was the ultimate villain in season one, now you almost feel like maybe she doesn't mean to be so bad, and actually does have heart, but then you hesitate to make that assumption, she teeters on that fine line of being good and being bad, making it all the more fun to watch! This season is darker, more drama, more twists, and more added characters to complicate matters, a definite must see if you enjoyed the first season 
 I bought the two pack of these old gems! Man was I impressed with the color and tranfers! The stories are...well... 1950's Western Oaters, as they were called back then. Mostly churned out quickly and frequently, and so these should be viewed with the Saturday matinee attitude, with buttered popcorn and soda in hand! But man the color is just GREAT! Yahoo Buckeroos!  
 I used this book in conjunction with "Probability and Random Processes with Applications to Signal Processing" by Stark & Woods, and I would have to say that this Schaum's outline filled in the gaps nicely. Stark & Woods has a nice selection of exercises, but unfortunately there are no solutions to any of the problems in the book, so you have no way of knowing whether or not you have grasped the material. That is where this outline came in handy. It manages to cover all of the issues in random processes, including basic probability, random variables and multiple random variables, functions of random variables, convolution, estimation and decision theory, and queueing theory.  Chapters five and six on the processing and analysis of random processes are particularly useful to those readers who are interested in applications to signal processing and communications theory. Each chapter has an excellent selection of exercises with solutions to test your knowledge. The only possible drawback of this text is that it often approaches the material from a mathematician's viewpoint more than that of an engineer. Therefore, there are quite a few proofs included as exercises that probably won't be that helpful for students of the applied sciences. The reader should already be comfortable with multivariable calculus as well as linear algebra to get the most from this book. Also, though chapter one reviews probability quite well, this should probably not be your first excursion into the subject. The only difficult part of random processes that I found this book a bit weak on was on the subject of functions of random variables. Again, this is probably because this text takes more of a mathematician's point of view and functions of random variables is more of an engineering subject 
 I am a beginner guitar player and I think this book is easy to follow. 
 Like many of Christoper Lloyd's books, Lord Cochrane is lively and very readable. He would be thrilled to see it back in print. There is renewed interest in his work this Millenium year due to his close ties with  Greenwich and the Royal Naval College (he wrote the guide to the chapel for  example). His book on Nelson is also an excellent read 
 To correct a previous review: THE BIG TIME was originally published in 1961. CABARET was first produced in 1966. While the book may be about time travel, it's unlikely that Leiber actually ENGAGED in time travel in order to rip off the plot of a musical in order to write it 
 I've been looking forward to reading this two-part book series since it was first announced. The first volume includes stories that cover Star Trek: Enterprise, Star Trek, and Star Trek: The Next Generation. For the most part, I wasn't let down. The authors of this book really seemed to not only offer wonderful stories that covers Trek's interesting 'Mirror Universe' but they also offer something new and fresh, things that were not present in the episodes, creating a sort of definitive history of the Mirror Universe.  For me, the first two stories, Enterprise's 'Age of the Empress' and Star Trek's 'Sorrows of the Empire', were great. These stories compliment one another, continuing where respective episodes of the shows ended. The Enterprise story was so well written that I could easily get into the story and visualize the characters and see this playing out in the television series. The only part that let me down about the story was the last page that ends with a minor cliffhanger. Is this going to be followed up in another book in the future? If not, what was the point of it? It ends the story on a note that I hope gets addressed in the second volume of stories. If not, it's puzzling and awkward and weakens the story.   'Sorrows of the Empire' picks up where 'Mirror, Mirror' left off and follows the rise and fall of Emperor Spock from the Star Trek series through the era of Star Trek: The Undiscovered Country. This is by far a must read. It was worthy of being its own stand-alone novel, epic, moving, well written. It plays to the fan's fancy; you get a rather Original Series story; and examination of morals and an individual's sense of duty and obligation that goes beyond his or herself, cameos from the main original series crew (with the exception of Chekov, Rand and Chapel) through characters who played a major role in the movies (Dr. Carol Marcus, David Marcus, Colonel West, Admiral Cartwright, Sarek, Amanda, Saavik, Valeris, the list goes on). It was gripping from the first page to the shocking (even if expected) ending. This would be one of those stories I'd recommend any true Trek fan to read and dare not to get into and appreciate and like.   Then, this is where this first volume takes a dissapointing turn for me. We go from two great stories that have some continuity between them and feature the casts and characters of both shows ... to a rather predictable, ill-thought out, dull, fan-fic-ish 'amateur' feeling 'Next Generation'. You can gather from the title, 'Worst of Both Worlds' what it deals with; the Borg of the Mirror Universe. Sounds interesting but it was a let down. After reading the first two stories, I expected more from this. It feels as if this story takes a great detour from the previous stories, not adding much at all to the 'history' the first two stories seemed to build up and instead offering a story that was bland and packed with average writing and every predictable line and outcome you can imagine. By the end, I found myself rolling my eyes and hardly able to get through the story. Unlike the other stories, this one features just Mirror Picard and offers a few cameos of recurring TNG characters. No Worf, Riker, La Forge, Troi, Crusher, Guinan or anything. Even with the inclusion of Vash and Gul Madred, this story couldn't be saved and seems like a waste of pages and space. I'm sure a better story, featuring a few more regular characters, could have been throught out.   Besides the dissapointing 'The Next Generation' story, this was a great start to the Mirror Universe books. I'd like to think (though I know it's not the case probably) that TNG's story lacked a pressence of other stories out of respect of Mirror Worf, Troi and Crusher and others having larger roles in the older Mirror Universe series 'Dark Passions.' In all, the first two stories play out like great television shows if not movies. They're great, worth the read, easy to get through, will leave you wanting more. TNG's story doesn't add anything to the mix; the Picard character, even if being of another universe, seemed dull and poorly written, and the Borg of this story are simply jokes. I'd still recommend you picking up this book to get exposed to the rather sorted and epic history of the Mirror Universe. 
  We all know Night of the Living Dead is a classic, for it's zombies and for its social commentary. Mike Nelson's commentary alone makes this dvd worth the price and then some. It does however make you really miss MST3K though 
 I first purchased Tropic of Cancer prior to this book, but had not as of yet read it when I came across this collection of essays and stories.  I enjoyed it so very much.  Reading his essays gave me great insight into who Henry Miller was, after reading this book I was able to start Tropic of Cancer with a better understanding of his writing style.  It enabled me to better appreciate his writing and understand his significance as a writer.  Tropic of Cancer is highly erratic, reading "Wisdom of the Heart" allowed me to understand that this is what Miller would be like and I was ready to embrace him, after coming away from "Wisdom" with a sense of what his philosphies are like.  Some of the stories are admittedly trite and the book's entire collection is somewhat ragged, but certain writings really shone, and Miller's philosophies rang loud and clear throughout everything.  An excellent read for someone who is curious about Miller the man and not yet ready to embark upon the Tropics 
 I want to say to all customers who are interested in electronics that this is the best book for students and engeeners ever written 
 I am a sixth grader. Small Steps was a different book. I've never read anything like this before. It was very interesting. It was a great follow up to holes. On a scale from 1-10 I would give this book an 8. I highly recommend this book. It is fascinating, it keeps you guessing, surprises you, and is funny at some parts. If you liked holes, you should definitely read Small Steps. The only thing that surprised me was it didn't show how Stanley's life went after Camp Green Lake, it was about Armpit. I was surprised because I thought it would be about Stanley. But, its not. Armpit is cool, so I like this book. So is Ginny, Armpit's neighbor, she's awesome. This book is awesome. Armpit is a beast. He is working for a landscape company. It describes how he gets sweaty. Too much information Louis Sachar! It was gross. The good part Is the book is good, but they can leave out some details. Anyway, this book was super cool like Armpit. Don't let X-Ray fool you in this book. He is not cool. Armpit is cool. Not X-Ray. Even though it may get into a little too much detail the book is still good. It's still good even though X-Ray isn't cool. X-Ray is a loser. I hate X-Ray. Armpit is a beast though. I wish I never read this book so I can read it again and again. That's how beastly this book is. Small Steps is beastly. Read it.   J.G 
 I'm not sure how Gary Larson continues to write consistently funny books.  But, I'm not going to complain.  This book has a laugh on every page.  Once again there are the hilarious human and animal characters that make up  Larson's wacky world.  In addition, there is a centerfold of cows of our  planet.  It is definitely a worthy  addition to the Far Side collection.  I  highly recommend this book to anyone who needs a good laugh in their life 
 Without a doubt, this CD is above average. All the clarity, thoughtfulness, savvy and wit packaged into this project outshines all neosoul/hip-hop/r&b/urban alternative/nu-jazz and introspective rock CDs released that year. There are no disappointments- and Forte balances his ill-gained street credibility (via his lockdown) with his powerful, soul-wrenching introspective lyrics (it's hard to call them simply, 'lyrics') better than his more popular contemporaries that dare to shine light into their insipidly shallow, diamond-bezeled, champagne drenched lives. This is real hip-hop, or at least what I believe it should have evolved into. If you have been waiting for Mos Def to do another CD, and you have been severely disappointed by the copious effluence of r&b garbage on the radio, and you respect GENUINE talent- buy this CD. You will be glad, and sad. Sad that we have to wait 14 years for John's talent to shine again. However, he's certainly worth the wait 
 This is a good deal, but as others have stated, it is smaller than normal. The last time I got a pair of Skechers it was 8 ½, so I figure I'd order 9 this time based on the other reviews. That was a mistake. I returned it for a 10 and it fits fine. So order 1 to 1 ½ size larger.  This is my fist dress boot and I noticed that they do not fit as snug as slip-ons, but that's probably inherent in the boot design itself. Anyway, the boot is well constructed. The heel and sole look like they are hard, but they are very soft, so it is comfortable 
  Crackerjack little suspense thriller based on a Graham Greene story about a boy (played by Bobby Henrey) who idolizes the butler (Ralph Richardson) in his residence. Set in a foreign embassy in London, Richardson is having an affair with the embassy secretary (Michele Morgan) and is almost convicted of murdering his battleaxe of a wife (Sonia Dresdel). Keeping secrets and telling little lies, which everyone bombards Henrey with, have a lot to do with the suspense of the movie. The ending, where Henrey almost unwittingly sticks his foot in his mouth to re-implicate Richardson after his innocence has been established is wonderful. The two lovers are a bit pale and bloodless for a couple so illicitly in love, but that's a minor fault in this excellent movie. Carol Reed's direction is superb, especially his work with Henrey 
 This is simply a great film, with Adams writing screenplay and directing.  I can't really compare movies and book, they both have their own features.  That aside, hold on to your seats!  Can't help but agree with the BBC, "It's Bloomin' Brilliant!"  Blu-Ray adds to the wonderful experience.  -DrMA 
 i used to watch this movie when i was a kid and i was looking for it everywhere for a decent price and amazon was the only place i could turn to 
 It is good to see the powers that be in the DVD world are not ignoring classical music. I have been wanting to see Horowitz material reissued in the new format and I was not disappointed. Comparing the DVD to my LaserDisc, I find that the video portion is somewhat superior on DVD, with improved clarity and contrast. The sound is also better. There are two audio versions, the original non-compressed stereo, and a new Dolby Digital 5.1 track which will knock your socks off. If you have a DVD player, this disc is a must, if you haven't purchased a player yet, this is incentive to get one!   Unlike the Pioneer DVD release, this Sony release contains Horowitz's final encore, Rachmaninoff's Polka VR.    Now, how about putting the other Horowitz videos on DVD?  
 I doubt that some of the examples were true to life.  Some dogs were at first presented as knowing as much as a 3 year old human child.  These dogs were presented as responding to long sentences and did things that dogs just cannot do.  Then the book analysed these impossible canine responses.  And I do not accept the book's analysis.  These fantastic canine responses could not have happened as the book asserts.  However, the material presented seems sound enough in principal.  I guess the author was taking artistic license to amplify the points of his thesis.  Whatever, it doesn't matter.    This book does support many of my own observations and has given me insight into dog behavior that I was not yet aware.    I am 67, a lifetime dog owner who spent a year working full time for a Veterinarian when I was 17, and presently have a 5 year German Shepherd.  If you are a typical dog owner you will gain much from this book 
 Everyone who has testified in Court has at least one horror story where the attorney made them look foolish or worse.  This book prepares you with an understanding of the process, procedures and roles of courts and attorneys.  Knowing how to handle those tough situations can increase confidence on the stand and reduce the disenchantment of having been "brow beaten" by an attorney. Everyone, but the most experienced expert witness will find this book invaluable 
 Otto Preminger's follow-up to his ground-breaking film noir "Laura" is an off-beat, dark and foreboding tale of con man Eric Stanton (Dana Andrews) who arrives in a small California coastal town with literally no money in his pockets. He is soon under the spell of sultry waitress Stella (Linda Darnell). They have no dough to marry, however, so Stanton plans to get hitched to a wealthy heiress, June Mills (Alice Faye), and then get rid of her and take her fortune. Stella, however, is not exactly sitting idly by - she has many boyfriends and dates that infuriate her lover. Ultimately, things don't go as planned; Stella is found murdered and Eric is the prime suspect. Surprisingly, June stands by him and tries to have him cleared.  David Raksin again provides a haunting theme, with Dick Haymes providing the vocals for Stella's favorite song, "Slowly" that plays repeatedly at the diner where she works. The relationship between Andrews and Darnell is very daringly portrayed for the 40s - what Preminger was able to get away with is amazing - I'm surprised the censors weren't all over him! And Faye and Andrews actually end up sharing the same bed in a motel room (although their characters are married at this point) but considering the production code, it's amazing that the scene was not cut out by the censors. Charles Bickford provides the right amount of suspicion, cynicism and ulterior motives as the local police detective who knows much more than he will admit. Darnell's role as Stella was a turning point in her career - she went from portraying virginal heroines to tarts and femme fatales. Her chemistry with Andrews is explosive; it could almost be considered a entanglement that calls for a restraining order. Faye's blondness and Darnell's dark brunette coloring give the distinction between heroine and temptress.  This film is most remembered for the fact that this was the last film that Alice Faye would make for over 20 years - she was so angered because much of her screen time was reduced in favor of Darnell (although she placed blame on the studio, not Linda), that she left the lot in a huff and threw her keys at the guard.  The DVD transfer is great; it looks especially good since the film has been out of circulation so long. Interesting extras, including photo galleries, the theatrical trailer, and commentary by noir expert Eddie Muller and Dana Andrew's youngest daughter, Susan, who gives some wonderful insights into this under-appreciated actor.  Not as classic as "Laura" but definitely a good example of what dark film noir is all about 
 I did not think it was possible to exceed the old second edition, which I already had.  If you are patient with this dictionary, you can decipher the meaning of just about anything you find written down and much of what is spoken.  They give very good examples and hold back nothing.  HarperCollins uses a no-star, one-star, two-star and three-star rating on words so you know if the word can be interpreted as something vulgar and just how vulgar it really is.  The 8th edition uses highlighted text, which makes finding meanings, etc much easier.  I think the binding quality is equal to that of my second edition and thankfully, ch is no longer a letter 
 This book has EVERYTHING you could possibly want for any kind of space clearing.  It has different ways of clearing your space as well as explaining it in plain english.  It also taught me a lot about things to have in my space to make it better as well as how to have things placed.  This book is a must have for having a comfortable home 
 This book should be required reading for anyone contemplating a purchase of property on the eastern coast.  While the "pulpit preacher" tone gets tired, we are seldom aware of just how much change occurs over a relatively brief period of time.  Pay your money now or a million when your lot is under water in another 30 years 
 I was a little skeptical about a "learn while you drive" product, but this one is very good.  I know Spanish and some French, so much of the Italian sounds familiar and flows well from what I already know.  The instructor is excellent... not condescending, doesn't move too fast, and inspires confidence.  And for heaven's sake- don't even think of buying just the two-CD "intro" version!  If you are at all serious about being able to learn and speak Italian, the first two CDs will only "open the box" and whet your appetite without really teaching you enough to make sense 
 I read this book after already having begun my layman's study of relativity theory and quantum physics with other books and materials.  However, I found this book to be much more informative and well-written than I expected it to be.  The presentation of the history of science leading up to Einstein was very thorough.  The discussion of his theories of relativity is an excellent place to begin one's study of special and general relativity.  Moreover, the book also provides a decent biography of Einstein, as well as an introduction to quantum physics.  Those who are interested in further exploration of modern physics might want to read Hawking's "A Brief History of Time".  I would also highly recommend Banesh Hoffman's "Relativity and Its Roots", which provides a more thorough and detailed yet highly readable explanation of Einstein's theories 
 If you program in C or C++, you must read this book if you want to consider yourself a superior programmer.  If you are a college student, definitely read this book. Koenig fills in a lot of gaps left by authors of  introductory books on C or C++.  Why do I mention C++?  Because C++ is far  more than just objects and classes.  The lower level implementation of  functions is still basically C programming. He includes chapters on  linkage, the preprocessor, and portability. It is a short book that is  definitely worth reading 
 being that this is the first set of knives I have ever purchased I really have nothing to compare them to. However I must say in the short time I have owned and used them I really can't complain. They are sharp and feel nice in my hands. they seem to have great balance and I definitely have noticed that they cut smoothly and with minimal effort. compared to other knives I have used I would say that these are far above the rest 
 This series in general, and the Jeter book in particular, are great for a 5-10 year old sports nut.  I read this with our 6 year old, a chapter a night for a couple weeks.    It's well written and moves quickly.  It makes reading fun by being about something a sports fan kid will really enjoy.  And Jeter in particular is a good story because he's such an great role model for kids -- he crosses racial divides, espouses the virtue of hard work, respect and not taking anything for granted.    Highly recommende 
 Reading this book is like watching a train wreck in progress.  You can't take your eyes off of it because you want to know how it all works out.  When I was putting together a course on psychology in literature a friend gave me this book but made me promise to return it because it was a favorite of hers.  After reading it, I can understand why.  The author does a fantastic (although disturbing) job of describing the life of a woman with schizophrenia while also discussing the impact that the woman's illness has on her family.  While reading the book the reader often begins to feel the anxiety and frustration experienced by Sylvia, a woman with schizophrenia, and her family, and can see in their mind's eye how the disease unfolds and engulfs their lives. 	This is a great text for a student of psychology who is interested in descriptions of the disease and also of historical (1970s) views of the mental health system.  It would also be helpful for the family members of a person diagnosed with schizophrenia to read so that they can have a greater understanding of the life of a person affected by the disorder.   
 I really like this game and remember playing it as a kid.  It's a great game with easy to understand directions. The only downside is when you're done the fully assembled game doesn't fit back into the box.  And attempting to disassemble it is NOT something I would recommend.  Therefore it's highly likely that the six bean bags will get lost and if that happens, the game is useless.  
 This walkman plays tapes and offers FM/AM radio station tuning, which is terrific for when I'm going for my daily walks. The sound is clear and it's a great price.   The batteries last for 25 hours, which is about a month's worth of daily walks. I would recommend this for anyone who wants a simple to use and inexpensive walkman 
 This one has it all!  Romantic tension, exploding ships, climactic battle scenes, and (my favorite) ingrigue!  The characters, are at their most Jack-and-Stephenesque.  O'Brian manages to fit more meaning and emotion into a single simple sentence than any author since Austen and he manages to fit more events into this book than many of his others.  Anyone who has gotten this far in the series doesn't need me to urge them to read this one, but I couldn't help but sing its praises 
 We will be  discussing this book among others at the Colby College Great Books Institute  this August . The theme of our selections is "Do Unto Others". I have  just finished reading  Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed  and cannot praise it enough. Beautifully written  and with with a powerful  message in light of current wars. Nonviolence must have deep roots and  strong branches  before it can bear the fruit of Le Chambon - a village  which rescued Jewish  children during World War Two. Pastor Trocme  and  Edouard Theis believed that nonviolence involves preparation and  organization -Page 35 -We might begin to prepare now  by learning about   these good  people (French Huguenots) who lived their faith . To them all  lives were precious. I hope others will read and review  this book  and  share their thoughts  with  us. tjl@ultranet.com Thelma J Lebeau 
 Picard covers an era of British social history, the 1700s, that has received relatively little attention. The book is divided into four parts: The first part covers London's infrastructure, and the other three parts cover the three major socioeconomic categories: poor, "middling," and rich, although the rich get rather little page space. There are over 50 illustrations.  This book is reminiscent of an encyclopedia: For each heading there is a description of one-to-five paragraphs, making this an easy book to jump around in as the spirit moves you. A less charitable description would be to say that the style is disjointed. The amount of detail is impressive, and the reader is given a thorough introduction to daily life of that era. The author often launches into remarks that are intended to be humorous. I imagine this was done so the book would not be dry reading, but her comments often seem gratuitous or disruptive to the flow of the material. There is very little here specifically about Samuel Johnson; this is a book about his era, not about him.  I preferred a very similar book, "1700: Scenes from London Life" by Maureen Waller. Waller's book covers the identical material (50 years earlier) and has a more cohesive style of writing 
 Of all the baby food cookbooks in my collection (English, Chinese and Japanese), I have to say "Simply Natural Baby Food" is by far my favorite. I like it because it's concise and informative, and it incorporates some old ingredients that I grew up with, e.g. dried seaweed and tofu, and some new ingredients that I'd happily tried such as Tahini and Hummus. More importantly it caters to the needs of babies with food allergies and always offers alternatives. The simple and healthy finger food and snack ideas have been lifesavers for us since my son has to stay from many common food allergens. As for those recipes that call for nuts, skipping this particular ingredient does not affect the flavor IMHO. Last but not least, like other reviewers have commented, these recipes yield creative and delicious dishes for the whole family to enjoy. 
 This book is not only a wonderful window into the feminine side of the Beat movement - but also a wonderful way to experience (however vicariously) what Di Prima felt, all of the emotions involved in learning who you are as a woman.  Of course there is sex, she gives a depiction of what truly mattered to her as a young woman: the poetry, the culture, the poverty, the sex.  This book is not pornography, it's an experience unlike any you'll find in the literary world of today. 
 This is the stuff that happens behind-the-scenes: the tensions, the strategizing, the pressure.  Figure skating isn't just what happens on the ice.  It involves real people, and this is a more intimate look than what you'll see in those little snippets that ABC Sports over-produces 
 This is a remarkable book. Dr. Weinberg covers a wide variety of cancer-related topic and show amazing expertise in each. In addition, the writing and illustrations are excellent. This is a wonderful schlolarly review of what we know of cancer 
 This is not an everyday run of the mill herbal like those so readily available on the "new age" market today. This one is filled with real herbal wisdom, time tested recipes, and good old fashoned root work. If your looking for a bunch of fluff then look at lleyyllyns silly wastes of paper, if you want something of substance then check out this one 
 "A Life" is the best book on painter Georgia O'Keeffe available. Every moment in Georgia's life is written about with painstaking detail. Nothing is missed. From her relationship with Alfred Steiglitz and his entourage from "291" to her intimate relationship with sculptor Juan Hamilton. I can't say enough how amazing this book is and how enjoyable it is to read 
 I find this book so inspirational and read something from it every day. Brother Lawrence has tremendous insight into the question of how to get closer to God 
 When I first saw this book on the shelf in Barnes & Noble I read the little summary on the inside of the cover.  I thought, "Well, it sounds good and I need something to read, so I guess I'll buy it."   After I got home and started to look through it more, I saw that it was entirely written in poems, song lyrics, journal entries, etc.  I thought, "This sucks, I'll probably never be able to read this very well."  Then, after the first page, I realized it was the exact opposite.  Despite the writing style, I was totally absorbed in the book. This book is incredibly insightful and the different points of view make it really interesting.  This book has become one of my favorites and I highly recommend it 
 I just got the cd today and I cannot stop listening to it.  Aphrodite really lives his name down, "The King of Beats," in this CD.   From track one to the last track, it is non stop grooves and beats.  If you  are the jungle, drum and bass type who likes to "Rock Da Funky  Beat" (as my favorite track suggests), get this.  If you are an all  time lover of the cut "I Got Five On It" get this.  I have not  heard any mixes for these 2 songs like this, ever.  Aphrodite, you did it  again, and as long as you are around, I will forever buy this musik 
 Very funny. Good continuation of Jim Qwilleran's life & adventures 
 Stephen Gould has written some of my favorite books, including Jumper and Wildside. Both of these are considered `young adult' fiction, of for no other reason but that their protagonists are all `young adults', and the themes revolve around growing up kinds of things.   Blind Waves deals with adults, adult themes-though nothing particularly dark or explicit-and tackles some global near-future issues, in particular the consequences of global warming and rising sea levels. It doesn't spend much time analyzing or agonizing over the things that led to this state of affairs, but just sets the story within that context and spins out a cool yarn about intrigue and dastardly machinations among those policing illegal immigration in the flooded southern US. Plus there's a love story between the two main protagonists; which is kind of at the heart of it all and provides the thread that holds it all together.   I just like Blind Waves. It's the kind of book you re-read when you're not in the mood to tackle anything new and potentially problematic, and you just want something light, and yet not shallow and definitely entertaining.

 I am not a fan of the Carpenters but when I was younger (25 years ago) I knew a lot of their songs but considered my self a "rock and roller" without a decent gear to listen to.  With good equipment on hand now and collecting albums of my youth in SACD format, I decided to buy this one and was surprised that the remastering was one of the best I have heard.  I am a stereo only person because I do not find the hometheater enjoyable.  I tried it for 5 years (from 1991) but did not get the satisfaction I have now with my stereo equipment.  My equipment has high end sound with a medium high end price.  To this day, I have yet to hear a system better sounding than mine  (Yes I am biased!).  High end does not mean excellent sound because I tried to listen to well known brands and I could not get satisfied with the sound.  I believe the key to good sounds are the amplifier  specs that only two manufacturers still specify. Slew rate and damping factor.  One is Australian and the other Swiss.  I have the Australian brand to beat.  Speakers  and interconnects are secondary but to me, electrostatic speakers are king! SACD players that are mid range suffice 
 i never thought this guy was actually making a prediction i just thought it was a fictional story based on revelations....lol.....it is a bit of predjudice and racism in here but it was entertaining 
 I've lived life in the fast lane while never really giving real thought to God, Salvation, or the price paid on Golgotha for righting the fall of man. Oh, I had read the Bible from cover to cover, more as a great history book than anything, and I thought I understood Salvation. John Stott's book "The Cross of Christ" was assigned as required reading for a university course some years ago. Many memories have faded over time since, but Stott's words and message have stuck. I recommend this book for anyone wanting a better understanding of the price paid for our individual Salvation. We truly do have a loving and merciful God. I recommend this book second to only one other in print besides the Bible itself, "The Desire of Ages" by E. G White and Pacific Press 
 This is a great introduction to essentially all the renewable energy resources available. Chiras takes a sensible, realistic look at a number of options for both reducing your dependence on fossil fuels as well as saving money. He talks about which solutions work best in which climates and gives tips on where to begin wading into renewable energy.   I originally bought the book as a resource to help us select which renewable energy options were viable in our new home design. It served that purpose well but I will also keep it handy as we move forward as Chiras goes beyond the typical introduction and gives planning suggestions and some detailed discussions on sizing and maintenance of a few systems.  Note that this book is targeted at home owners wishing to retrofit their EXISTING homes for renewable energy. Repeatedly throughout the book, Chiras recommended his book "The Solar House" for those of us designing new homes. I plan to read that book before building but still found a lot of useful information in this book 
 I'd love to meet Kelly. She's such a beautiful girl and I love her music. It makes me feel young again.  I can't wait until her third album, I love both the first and second ones 
 Barrett Browning's sonnet sequence is far from the sloppy, sentimental doggerel it has been made out to be. Instead, the poems examinge Barrett Browning's guilt over her brother's death, her awakening passion for Robert  Browning, and her fear of an inability to love. If one looks very closely  at these poems, what appears is not a tribute to Browning, but in fact a  brilliant woman's realization that her life has been totally sterile, and  that she has now been placed in the precarious position of having to make  choices that will alter the course of her life. Tehcnically, the poems are  brilliant; written with all of Barrett Browning's characteristic blend of  caution and verve 
 Treasure Island  By Robert Louis Stevenson.   I am a twelve year old reviewer that is in the 6th grade. I enjoy fantasy adventure books the most. I have quite a good memory for the details in books that I enjoy. If  books  are not of interest to me I have trouble getting through them and then I forget about what's happening. I can never forget about a good book. I always go back to check  out a good book over and over again until someone will buy it for me. I like building my own library because then I will always have the book I want there to read. I stay up late at night reading and if I'm lucky I might stay up the whole night reading. I am someone that does not enjoy looking up words in the dictionary so I just read on and try to figure it out.  Treasure Island was not a book I stayed up all night reading, but I still enjoyed reading it. It hand the adventure I wanted, it hand mystery, and it hand a lot of  sword fighting. 	A strange pirate named Captain Flint walks into the Admiral Ben Bow Inn where Jim Hawkins and his mother own, live and work. Little does Jim know that this man will change his life forever. Captain Flint has a treasure map that another pirate named Long John Silver wants more then anything in the world. This map will lead the Long John to the treasure. When Flint died Jim found the treasure map. Soon after he finds the map pirates attack his house and Jim must flee. When Jim goes looking for the treasure he has to work for a mysterious cook named Long John Silver. When they set upon there journey to the island in search of the treasure Jim gets put to the most challenging tasks. When they see the island Jim gets betrayed by Long John Silver and his cronies who want the treasure more than anything. When Jim gets on shore he must fight pirates for the treasure.  As Jim is running through the jungle he finds a man named Ben who was marooned on the island. Ben knows his way around and he may help lead him to the treasure. Jim might lose his life looking for the treasure.  	I thought that the author had a very interesting way of writing. He would go all out on the exciting parts. I think he made the  most important parts of the story sound dreadfully dull. This was a book that I would not stay up all night reading. At some parts I felt like just closing the book and throwing it away. Then he would pick it up again and make it exciting and it made me want to continue. One thing I liked was how I could relate with the character, Jim, at certain points in the book. Something I thought was good was how the author made you use your imagination for the island and how you could picture Ben, the man, and how he lived on the island all alone. The author expressed Jim emotions very well. I could tell when he was scared,  sad and mad.  I would recommend this book 
 Keeping my review simple.  This is a great series - I own book one and two.  If you think you will like it, you will love it 
 Protagonist Donna Trenton sure is in hot water, or should hot weather be more appropriate.  As if being trapped in a dead Pinto with a sick child in the middle of summer while a mean dog surveys the vehicle isn't enough...  But when the mumbo jumbo beast happens to be inflicted with rage on top of that, you can safely say that, besides being toasted in many ways, this lady definitely should have stayed in bed that faithful morning.  But, alas, like in any Stephen King novel, one has to pay the price, and since woman adultery is the case here, poor Donna has a lot to chew on, to say the least.  Writing in a alcoholic stupor (as stated himself) clearly doesn't stop King from delivering an effective read.  Indeed, CUJO is gutso with lots of blood, excitement and canine hair.  Its first half may be in neutral mode with its character development and action setting, but when the gear is shifted, watch out.  Driven to despair has never been more fun in the hand of this Maine man.  Cloned perhaps in its "Jaws" bite, CUJO is nonetheless pure King when it comes to compelling plot.  Just like its Saint-Bernard creature, the author clearly knows how to deliver the goods with drooling edge of your seat moments and in-your face action prose.  Yes, the novel aims for the bubble gum crowd but what a flavorful load of fun this one is--enough to hail it worthy of a sleep-depraved moment award, for sure.  Enjoy.-----Martin Boucher 
 This classic work is still on my bookshelf, well-thumbed and well-loved after 34 years of being part of my life. I can't recommend this highly enough  
 I looked at a few of the health/wellness diaries before purchasing this one.  I'm happy with the purchase.  With the "Look Inside" feature you see exactly what the journal pages look like before making the purchase.  That was the deciding factor for me purchasing it.  Recording in a journal like this can help you find out how the weather, certain foods, exercise, stress, etc. affect how you feel, especially if you have a known condition where you have good days and bad days.  The only negative I see is that it has only 95 journal entry pages, so you can use it for about 3 months or can stretch it a little if you use it every other day or so 
 Jane Austen wrote some of the most remarkable romantic novels in English, and Emma is said to be written at the height of her powers. Like all her novels (Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility), the narrative is simple, straightforward and the story develops through seemingly commonplace conversations and events. Emma is twenty one year old daughter to rich Mr Woodhouse, "full of trivial communications and harmless gossip." The story captures how Emma comes to terms with her own errors of judgement, and how she discovers her liking and love for one of the chief characters of the novel. (Perhaps giving his name away here would be sacrilage on my part!!). The cast, the locations, the conversations are set in distinct Austen style, rooted in rural English counties. The romances are Victorian, and progress through delicate, slow developments that a through, diehard romantic is bound to like. Emma's actions are governed by her own romantic fantasies, where she tries to bring people together playing a matchmaker, and her failures as well as successes make this novel an interesting read. A treat for Austen fans! 
 A true tribute to the man whose movies are still unnerving and shocking. He make lyrism when RKO asked him to make films from horror titles as "Cat People", "I walked with a zombie" and others during the '40s. If you love horror, if you love movies, if you are a film buff, what are you waiting to get this 7-movies-5-disc-boxset 
 Really a great can't put down book full of interesting tidbits of information.  At least for me, it was full of things I'd always wondered about.  Great book 
 This is word for word the same book as another of sugarmans books: Advertising secrets of the written word. That book is an excellent book on copywriting and marketing. Buy this book save a ton of money to aquire the same info. 
 Groundhog adores running around and playing with his friends. So when winter comes, he decides that he won't be hibernating this year. His friends warn him that he'll only end up feeling cold and hungry, but Groundhog refuses to listen. Unfortunately, Groundhog soon finds that refusing to hibernate has only left him feeling lonely, as all of his friends have decided to take part in "the long nap." So Groundhog comes up with a wonderful idea, that will trick his friends, and give him something to do...he decides to announce that Spring has come early! But when his friends discover the truth, they decide to play a little trick on Groundhog. One that he'll never forget.  It is so rare to find children's books about Groundhog Day, so I was ecstatic when I stumbled upon Margery Cuyler's GROUNDHOG STAYS UP LATE. Groundhog is an adorable character who never learns his lesson, while his friends are little tricksters themselves, who love to take part in a good joke every now and then. The delightful story, accompanied by Jean Cassels gorgeous illustrations, will leave young readers enthralled with the story for hours, and parents may find it a challenge to pry it out of their little hands. A delightful story!  Erika Sorocco Book Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspape 
 I have known the book by reputation in several texts of urban sociology. The book, however, is much more than most writers have implied. The profound knowledge of Berman about European cultural history is admirable and helpful for getting a deeper understanding of the development of ideas of modern 
 Now people consider this ol' school.  I remember when this joint came out "Ish is real" and "Masta I.C." were in the deck in heavy rotation.  This was when nobody knew Irv Gotti, Ja Rule, DMX or Jay-Z and they were all a part of this LP.  Unfortunately, Mic Geronimo never got the credit that his counterparts did, but I honestly think his 1st LP was better than the other artist's cataloge.  (Except Jay-Z)  This LP will make you want to get a pair of Tims and represent.  There's only a couple of tracks that make the LP a little bumpy, Mic's attempt at making a radio/R&B track.  But all n' all a dope LP!!!  But, if you did dig those R&B joints, cop his 2nd LP and if you thought those tracks were wack, avoid his 2nd LP like the plague. 
 Leland provides great insight into suppressed information related to the old Etruscan Paganism of the Early Roman Empire and Italy. The first part of the book contains descriptive insight into over 60 Gods and Goblins of the old religion, whereas, most other texts only contain up to 25 and often confuse the details. A greater number of suppressed names and deities are discussed in detail in this work, then in any other text I have researched in relation to this old way of life. The second part offers various Incantations, Divinations, Medicines, and Amulet Creation. The book is heavily illustrated which is another thing that is uncommon in books on this subject. This book is highly recommended for anyone studying the occult, and makes for a great desk reference for followup research. 
 Of all of Nora Roberts' books--and yes, I've read them all--this is my favorite.  It is undoubtedly her funniest.  I first read it six years ago.  I loaned it to a friend who forgot to return it, so I had to buy it again.  I'm on my fourth copy now, I've read it probably ten times, but I keep on loaning it out and reordering and re-reading.    The characters are lovingly developed, and the dialogue quick and genuine.    Dora, our heroine, is a gutsy gal who takes no gruff off anyone, especially her new tenant, ex-cop Jeb Skimmerhorn.  They're a recipe for great romantic sparks and hot sexual tension.    This is truly Nora at her very finest.  I wish she'd write another just like it.  Or almost like it 
 Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass reveals Whitman's passion for nearly every aspect of life, from amazement of great ships to the enchantment cast by the beauty of a sunset.  The juxtaposition of ideas from line to line creates a vivid imagery throughout the poetry that gives the reader a sense of life as a whole; Whitman describes the broadness and complexity of his own experiences and thoughts with ease.  Large sections of the collection are devoted to discussion of a broad array of subjects.  For example, section three, entitled "Song of Myself", extends for about fifty pages and poems within the section are distinguished only by numbers.  Although the numbers work to separate the ideas found in the passage, the thoughts still flow into one another, causing the text to present a challenging and sometimes exhausting read.  However, other sections such as "Whispers of Heavenly Death" give relief from the dense material.  These contain shorter poems with titles that usually aim to indicate the theme of the poem.  They are more concise and easily understood, because Whitman appears to organize his thoughts, condense them, and put each one into a titled poem.  Overall, the entire collection presents classic free verse poetry that retains timeless concepts and revelations of human emotions.  And because of the grand style and often elevated language in the declarations Whitman uses to communicate his position on elements such as life, death, emotion, nature, heroes, love, politics, etc., the collection could be seen as something near contemporary epic poetry.   	Leaves of Grass also demonstrates Whitman's incredible self-awareness; the lines in the poem "O Living Always, Always Dying" are an example of his confidence as they state, "O me, what I was for years, now dead, (I lament not, I am content;)  O to disengage myself from those corpses of me, which I turn and look at where I cast them, to pass on, (O living! always living!) and leave the corpses behind."  The importance of this self-assurance is that Whitman creates a more stable bond between himself and the reader, because when he gives his advice the reader becomes more liable to accept it as a plausible truth.   	This collection of poetry has much to offer to a variety of readers.  Since it is so broad based, anyone should be able to read it and find some concept of interest.  Whitman himself appears in his poetry as a diverse individual, and therefore more people can make a connection with him.  And even if there happens to be little for one to relate to, the beautiful descriptions and classic language themselves can become valuable souvenirs in the reader's memory.     
 Not having practiced yoga in the past, I was pleasantly surprised that the poses presented here were easy to execute after only a few attempts.  I now look forward to using this DVD to relax, especially before bedtime.  It appears to help me sleep better, clear the sinuses (!), and increase flexibility.  My running workouts (I am a half-marathoner) have even been enhanced since I began using this DVD.  I am hoping that this practice will positively affect fertility by improving my overall health and well-being.  I'm not pregnant yet, though!    
 Excellent movie.  Just what was required for the paper on sterotyping and prejudice in the nazi war camps 
 It doesn't take long for the reader to get broken in along Fletcher's trail of adventure from the Mexican border of eastern California to the Oregon border. The author takes us along the Colorado trail following the river for a number of days until we spring for the Mohave desert. Fletcher had placed, before his hike, a number of strategic caches of water along his desert route. We are as anxious as he to get to the next cache, particularly as we approach Death Valley in early spring before the overwhelming heat sets in. His descriptions of desert flowers and rolling mounds of sand stretching to dark and spiney ridges rising from the valley floor compel us to make plans to visit Death Valley in the near future. We are relieved when we hop out of Death Valley into the Panamints and scrub forests of the lower Sierra. When we climb high into snow country, our eyes hurt in the glaring snow. But the chill of fourteen thousand feet is more than welcome after the hot Mohave sands. We walk along with Fletcher in the high Sierra to push our toe across the border and touch Oregon soil. We experience the heat, the rattlers, the desert poppies, the cool downsloping breezes from the high Sierra, and the icy waters of alpine streams by reading THE THOUSAND MILE SUMMER. Such a book is a rare treat for those of us seemingly locked into a time-pressure capsule of corporate wor

 I thought "Star Trek:  The Movie" was an extra-long, expensive TV episode.  "The Wrath of Khan" is actually a movie, starring the Star Trek characters.  Ricardo Montalban was even better here than in the original ST episode "Space Seed" (and he was good in the original).  He made an excellent villain here.  A couple of side comments.  When Khan was introducing the surviving creature of the planet, his voice made me think of Rourke on Fantasy Island.  The other comment is something I'm sure all Trekkies caught when seeing the movie:  Khan told Chekov he never forgot a face.  Yet Chekov did not show up until the second season, while "Space Seed" was from the first season.  Those who have read my other reviews may be aware of my division between true science fiction, science fantasy, and science horror.  The Star Trek franchise has dabbled in all three.  This story, though, falls into the true science fiction category.  The speculation is on science being able to create life.  Yes, this movie is more of an adventure than anything else, but the futuristic side is based on possibilities. My wife thought it was too violent; this movie may have received a PG-13 rating if that rating existed.  But I found this to be an awesome movie.  
 This rack is made very well.  I saw the exact same one for sale in a local container store for $50. Most all racks that I have seen are made for women's shoes and just are not large enough for a man's shoe.  With this one, I find that it works better with men's shoes if you only hang 4 pairs on each of the 3 racks, leaving one space between each pair.  By doing this, the shoes slip on and off easily.  This works out fine as real men never have more than 12 pairs of shoes 
 Gorgeously crafted, eloquent, beautiful, gripping, powerful.  Simply an amazing book.  All of Pat Conroy's books have common ties to his childhood, and this one is perhaps the best of them all 
 View this as a reference manual. I started reading it with the intention of going start to finish, but I found that to be a sure cure for insomnia.   If you want to look something up, it's fine, but it's definitely not spellbinding 
   I bought this to try and get constant "knots" out of my wife's neck and lower back, and boy... let me tell ya' ... It sure has saved ME a lot of time and sore hands/fingers !   I used to spend almost a good 45 minutes trying to get the "knots" worked out quite often. The percussion along with the HEAT feature sure helps with that now.    This has a switch for 1.) OFF  2.) MASSAGE  3.) MASSAGE/HEAT. It is by your thumb (IF strapped on your right hand). The variable speed switch is the rotary dial that would be at the end of your ring finger.   I think the ONLY drawback that we can find with this is that it has only 1 heat attachment. The other 2 screw on attachments are made out of a hard "pliable" (and I say that loosely) hard rubber/plastic compound and are NOT capable of conducting the heat. ONLY the Red attachment is.  Inside of the percussion head on the massager (where the heads are screwed onto) is a metal shaft where the heat emits from. The only attachment that has a  metal center  that contacts that also and will conduct the heat is the RED attachment. The Black ones do NOT. If you attached them and accidentally & hit the switch PAST massage and into the HEAT zone, you might have some melted black attachments !! 
 In typical Toby Keith fashion, this album delights the senses with a variety of music tunes filled with humor, great vocals, and catchy lyrics.  A must have for any Toby fan, and a great start if you are exploring country. 
 Muy pero muy bueno, es mejor todavia que el primer dvd que salio de esta gira 
 I use this book all the time and have found it extremely helpful while undergoing chemotherepy,all the recipes are very well thought out and very tasty 
 In Strategic Thinking, Simon Wootton and Terry Horne teach step-by-step the thinking skills required for sound strategic planning. The authors set out questions to ask and teach how to learn to formulate strategies and write clear and concise strategic plans. The steps taught are easy to apply in the real world. The authors used a very practical approach, and wrote in simple language. The book also has a CD ROM with practical examples that can be used as templates to facilitate the formulation of strategies.  The book teaches a nine step process covering the gathering of information, formulating ideas and planning action. The gathering of information involves an analysis of what is changing, carrying out an audit and reflecting on what one knows. In formulating ideas, one is required to predict where the organisation is headed, decide where it should be going and take care of obstacles to achieving organisational objectives. Planning action involves thinking creatively about alternative courses of action, evaluating their feasibility and making decisions on implementation of the plans.     The book enables me to carry out a systematic process of arriving at optimum plans and strategies for my organisation. I am now aware of the full range of issues to be considered in a systematic thinking process by examining a set of relevant questions and answering them objectively before formulating strategies and writing clear and concise strategic plans. 
 This book was GREAT. I t was almost being part of the book observing the situation. All of the characters were cool, with their own personality, that made it hard to make anyone the bad guy. It's a non-stop roller coaster ride, then you are wondering how in the world is this going to work out. You laugh, you cry,and then you relate to each character as it unfolds. It was hard to put the book down. The bad place was "BAD" but the journey to the bad place is what you never forget. I give Frank Pollard props, he did become a hero. Thanks Koontz 
 The book is brief, the language is simple, and the best of all...it works.  This handy, and concise book will teach you how to manage your life (Not only your Work!!), and thus reduce your stress, simplify your life, and get the work done in less time.  What you will find in this book is an easy to read story, that quickly teaches you three very successful and practical management techniques: One Minute Goals Setting, One Minute Praising, and One Minute Reprisals.  Its story format makes this book readable and light,.. but yet very insightful and effective. You will want to read this book over and over, just for the pleasure of doing it. I bought this book 13 years ago, and I still enjoy reading it 
 Wonderful!!!  Donny Osmond is still the greatest!!  His music is wonderful and he sounds great!! 
 This is a modern pharmacology text on herbs and prescriptions. Unlike some older texts this fine reference book includes many features not found elsewhere. It includes photographic pictures of each herb and provides in both simplified and tradtional Chinese characters. The chemical composition is badly needed as both modern pharmacists and patients alike need to know what they are dealing with, other than just exotic PinYin names. The pharmacological interactions and author's comments are also welcomed as the effectiveness from modern clinical studies are required in any modern medical book. The only inconvenience I found is that the constant use of this 1200+ page book caused sore on my thumb and fingers. As more and more updates are added, frequent users would prefer a digital source (e.g., XHTML, XML etc) to get the latest update. The advantage of hypertext will allow one to navigate quickly with the click of a mouse without having to flip through pages or using indices. At present, 23% of medical professionals are now using an online source and it is expected more and more will do so to stay current. In sum, this is a highly useful book which will get to its place. Reviwed by Sam Shueh, medical librarian 9/25/04       
 OK To You Out There Who Don't Own This Wonderful Sci-Fi Action Motion Picture. then i would suggest in getting it because it a great set not only do you get the theatical version that was shown in theaters the  first time, but you get the director's cut which in my opinion is better. the sound and picture are excellent  those of you with a good dolby sound systems should try the 6.1 mix it great and at this price you'd be crazy not to. i think the story of stargate is just wonderful it's about time travel and lost civilazations James Spader  stars as a professor of archaeology and ancient lauguages is contacted by the goverment to solve a mystery within it's wall once opened then maybe secrets can be revealed of long lost  civilazation in another universe. it's great story love it.

 This book strengthens the fact that the holocaust is overrated. Even though there is now doubt that the holocaust existed, this book presents facts that it might have been a political theater 
 I've had a copy of this book by my side for the past 25 years. It is one of the finest business books of all time, especially for entrepreneurs. Despite the dated nature of some of its content, the concepts are as important and useful today as they were when first put onto paper.  One of my favorite chapters is Chapter Four: Market Gap Analysis. This chapter alone is worth many times the price of the book. As the author says, "Market gap analysis is an extremely powerful tool for uncovering those areas in the market in which demand far exceeds supply. This tool, coupled with the verification techniques of Chapter Five, will assure your company of a lucrative market." Whether you are seeking to identify a completely new product or service, or to expand your current company's lines, this chapter is invaluable.  I found it amusing what other reviewers have written about losing copies of this book. I have also loaned out copies of the book never to have them returned, and I've resorted to keeping a few extra copies around. I can't think of any other book that I've valued so much to do this with 
 Most people can say they know San Francisco/Bay Area, Los Angeles/Orange County, or San Diego. These are the places people typically hit up when they plan a trip to CA. Having lived several years in SoCal, I found this book opened my eyes to all the state has to offer. It balances the sections on the large cities with other destinations and activities. You can easily stay with friends in LA or SFO and get a better tour of the town than the book can offer, but what about Death Valley or the Redwoods or PCH? This is where the book has been of great help to me 
 Julie and Romeo Get Lucky by Jeanne Ray is the sequel to Julie and Romeo.  Jeanne Ray's writing is so spot-on accurate, sometimes I swear she must be recording people in their home and then simply transcribing it!  But she's so much funnier and sweeter than real life.  Romeo throws out his back carrying Julie up her stairs and ends up an invalid in her bed.  Nora, Julie's oldest daughter, is pregnant and on bed rest, so she moves home too.  Sarah, Julie's granddaughter, is obsessed with Willie Wonka & The Chocolate Factory, and so the story goes from there.  Julie can't grab a spare moment to herself when everything is falling apart. Ray has a unique talent for describing physical comedy that few writers can manage.  I found myself laughing and gasping out loud at poor Romeo.  I wish life was as sweet as it is in Ray's world, and I treasure the moments I get to spend there.  Read her other books as well; they're all winners. 
 Anne writes a very alluring story of a tender memory that obviously has impacted her life.  The joy of love filled family gatherings during the holiday season as she grew up with her family must have been something to behold.  she describes the gatherings making you visualize what it must have been like, with vivid smells of holiday cooking and the secret of what makes it taste so good.  She writes with love in her heart honoring the memory of the one who made it possible.  I loved this story and recommend it to everyone. Thank you for a great read!   Tory Lynn    
 This audiobook on CD was a great listen. It is unabridged on 8 CDs and runs for 8 hours. The narrators do an excellent job of reading; the narrators each seemed to really understand their character's personalities, and it helped me enjoy the book more, hearing it read aloud.   My only complaint about the book or the narration was that the narrator's voices sounded much too alike, and I often got confused as to which character's point of view I was listening to at any given time. It was easy to figure out within a moment, but I would have preferred it to be clearer.  As to the plot and writing itself, I found the book very thought provoking and engaging. I cared about the characters and could see even the conflicting points of view. I'd recommend this book highly, either on audio or in a hard copy 
 Pearl Jam has made a career of hiding from the press and keeping a deliberately low profile. But they are known for giving goodies to their hardcore fans. I would have thought that PJ never allowed anyone to take pictures of them, but apparently Mercer and Peterson have had free range to take any pictures they wanted with the band on tour. There are only a few "publicity" shots where the band is clearly posing for the camera. The majority are onstage action shots and candid moments which provide a lot of insight into the band's personalities. There are also many great shots of the fans. Each of the four core members seems to be showcased equally, with some shots of their various temporary drummers. The funnest aspect of the book is watching the guys' image change over time - from overdressed, long-haired alt-rockers in the early days to their current scruffy low-maintenance "regular guy" look 
 I can't believe how many people are bummed with this CD! It shows that the group has matured and has learned from their mistakes. After listening to Ixnay and Americana in my home gym for 3 months straight, I got this CD, mostly for "Da Hui". (I saw the video on their website and liked it straight away.) Although I was initially disappointed in the length, I got over it and I like every song on this disc.  Things get off to a rollicking start with "Neocon". The musical imagery suggests the Zanarkand blitzball stadium, all lit up at night, with the cheering crowd, and the band at the center of it all. "The Noose" shows some older colour that Offspring is known for, while keeping up with the times (after all, they MUST adapt with the changing taste of the public or they will be gone). I found "Worst Hangover" to be amusing, but I can imagine being annoyed upon repitition of it. Perhaps they were making fun of ska music? "Lightning Rod" (very reminiscent of "Dammit I changed again" but better) is quite fast and entertaining, and definitely imaginative. "Spare Me the Details" is quite goofy but cute. Why does Dexter keep dating these loser girls that just mess with him?? I was disappointed to not hear the hula record preceding "Da Hui", but when I realized that it was just for the video, I managed to accept it as is. "When you're in prison" is quite funny. I own a lot of gramophone recordings, and this sounds just like one, but Dexter's Californian accent gives away that something isn't quite right with the age of the recording.  But that's all a matter of sheer interest! I just wonder what the heck Dexter was thinking when he authored this song.  In conclusion, it's a good disc, although a bit too short. But what I don't see people acknowledging in their reviews is this: Pop it into the disk drive of your computer and watch what happens. You get Offspring wallpaper, a tour of their studio for Splinter, and the "Da Hui" video. This explains the 30 minute disc. According to their website, Offspring are presently recording a new disc. I hope it's good, ya 
 I have a Black Cat that is over 20 years old. I enjoy using this calander each day. The artwork is very good on the 2005/2006 and hope they make a 2007 
 Columnist, consultant, and best-selling author Rhonda Abrams has written a clever and enjoyable book that compiles the simple wisdom of motherly advice into a basic primer on ethical business behavior. Without offending the mothers of the world, this isn't a book to read if you're looking for real-world management technique. It is however an entertaining and sometimes inspiring collection of aphorisms that is especially compelling when presenting luminaries like Southwest Airline's Herb Kelleher expounding on the virtues taught them by their own moms. We [...] recommend this book as a refreshing break, and as a great gift 
 I really liked this book. It had a romantic appeal and vivid, memorable characters. The plot was also fantastic. Wilkie wrapped up everything quite nicely at the end--I won't say anymore for those who haven't read it. I didn't feel there were any unbelievable coincidences in the plot. It was a little slow at first, but once I got into it, I couldn't put it down. Some parts were hilarious. This book has it all. I would definitely recommend it. 
 This movie breaks some story rules, including introduction/insertion of random new characters towards the end. Still, funny enoughfor a movie that seems to try so hard to be so good and comes out oh, so bad. *grin* Definitely worth watching 
 This is an excellent sounding reissue of a classic LP and this CD is worth buying for either diehards or the casual fans:  The original LP is all mono using the 45 versions, and while there were very early CDs that used the LP master, but the stereo collector community complained so Columbia remastered the disc to use the stereo LP versions to please the stereo oriented collectors in a hurry.  In 1999, the Greatest Hits LP was reissued again on CD, this time using the 45 versions in stereo that came from the promo 45 stereo single masters and this release became the first time the 45 versions ended up available in stereo for wide release.  So collectors, audiophiles and casual fans should buy this CD.  If you want a greatest hits collection with the LP versions, buy the "What Goes Up?" 2 CD set or track down one of the 1980s CDs of this compilation that use the LP versions 
 Junie B. helps remind us how to put others first.  Children tend to get so caught up at Christmas with what all they can get and need to have on their own lists that they forget to think about others - both the receiving and giving aspects of Christmas!  We can all remember having to be nice to someone we did not like and Junie B. is placed in just that type of situation.  Junie B.'s reactions are just what we've come to expect of her through this series, however, her actions almost catch you unprepared 
 If you like High On Fire, then buy this CD. On a couple of the songs Matt Pike tries some cleaner vocals, it's good 
 I guess it was "what a babe" from the other review that prompt me to review. I'm hoping that "babe" in the other review means what a woman, what a soul and in this movie she is it all. I have seen all her movies and own many as well as her recordings from the beginning. If you review her songs from '48 to 59' especially and hold dear all those movies, there is only one conclusion beside that It's Magic, and that is she is truly in my heart My Secret Love 
 These really do work!  Once you've got them on right (it took me a couple tries, but then I got the hang of it) they really STAY on and do the job wonderfully.  They do hurt a bit taking them off (I've found that if you take them off in the shower it helps, much like a band-aid) but otherwise they're very comfortable to wear, and I always forget I even have them on.  They're a god-send for today's tight-fitting fashions 
 Finally, every one of the Schoolhouse Rock -- as well as a few I don't remember 
 A Theory of Justice is surprisingly accessible, even to those of us with out extensive training in philosophy.  Rawls briefly examines two of the most influential Western liberal philosophers (Locke and Mill), and then proceeds to construct his own Theory which builds on Locke and Mill while solving for some of the deficiences in each.  As Rawls admitted, the gist of his Theory can be gleaned from the first part of the book, though the book reads easily enough that one should be able to get through the whole thing fairly quickly.  I highly recommend this book to those who think of philosophy as convoluted jargon written long ago by men in powdered wigs and robes, as well as to those who are unsure of the philosophical basis for much modern liberal political thought.  A remarkably accessible and important development in liberal thought 
 Being a John Keegan fanand having a long-standing interest in WWI, I was thrilled when I first heard this book was published and I ran out and got a copy immediately.   I was not disappointed.   All I could think to say is, Mr. Keegan brings his formidable guns to bear on an already thoroughly analyzed topic.  His skills as a writer and military historian make this one of the premier books on the subject.  The maps are superb and complement the text perfectly.   The photos and illustrations place faces on names and give a sense of characters involved.  It lacks the popularity and readability of Mrs. Tuchman's _Guns of August_ but provides more of a view from the trenches and maprooms making a great work of military history on the war.  A very worthy piece of work on the topic.  
 This book is written with heart, soul and spirit.   A book to use and refer to as well as delight you along the way 
 After I read and enjoyed The Meaning of Everything, tackling this book (which I saw reviewed in The Weekly Standard) was a natural "second step" for me.  Hitchings includes sufficient background material on Samuel Johnson to enlighten the uninformed without losing sight of his major goal, which is to demonstrate how Johnson tackled the daunting task of compiling an English dictionary in the 18th century with few models and minimal help available.  Cleverly, Hitchings uses actual definitions of words from Johnson as the equivalents of chapter titles (I wonder just how long he had to fish through the dictionary to find words and definitions to match the progress of his narrative).  An excellent effort.  
 I just finished viewing this incredible, astoundingly intense motion picture for the very first time after hearing about it for 20 years. Philip Baker Hall (who played the character of "Library Cop" on "Seinfeld") essays the part of Richard Nixon in an unforgettable one actor performance. The film had been shot at the Univ. of Michigan, the crew composed largely of UM students, while director Robert Altman was doing a short hitch as filmmaker-in-residence there and has the interesting, "you are there" immediacy and intimacy of a filmed stage play or TV show.  The set is a large, wood paneled office, apparently in Nixon's home in San Clemente, a few months after his August 1974 resignation from the Presidency. An angry and restless Nixon nervously paces back and forth with a glass of scotch whiskey in one hand and a loaded revolver lying on his desk, yelling angrily into a running tape recorder about the details of his childhood, adult life, controversial political career, his deep and unhealed resentments and miseries, repeatedly hurling a stream of caustic invective at portraits of Dwight Eisenhower, Jack Kennedy and Henry Kissinger, reserving most of his vitriolic (yet fascinating and perceptive) bile for Kissinger, rarely (typically) blaming himself for his own misdeeds, all the while intermittently and nervously scanning a battery of CCTV monitors whose cameras are already observing and recording him. Nixon on several occasions mentions the mysterious "Bohemian Grove" located in rural northern California (a subject of much "conspiracy theorizing" in recent years.)  This film is a must see, if for no other reason to experience Hall's stunning and overwhelming performance as the desperate and doomed Tricky Dick, to appreciate Altman's unique cinematographic and directorial style and to vividly grasp the nature of an bafflingly influential human and cultural "focal point" in recent American history. Additionally, whether one is or isn't a Nixon hater, after finishing this film one may gain some understanding of and deeper insight into if not grudging respect or sympathy for this undoubtedly gifted and highly skilled yet incredibly tormented and angry man whose character, behavior and personality was a rare and corrosive but powerful and unforgettable blend of all of the tragic protagonists that had ever emerged from the works of Shakespeare, Dostoevski and Conrad to Fitzgerald, Beckett and Pirandello.  Hall's Richard Nixon, like Marlon Brando's character of Col. Walter Kurtz in 1979's "Apocalypse Now" is a poignant and intense collage of what some might term a classic "American archetype;" a brooding and obsessive "failed overachiever" whose single-minded drive to reach that nebulous yet seductive goal of "being somebody" had been completely and irreparably derailed at the final bend by the same volatile forces that had also driven him relentlessly and vindictively toward that goal, leaving all sorts of tragic wreckage, human and political, in his wake. Was Nixon good, bad, both, neither or something else altogether? And finally, from the opening scene of "Secret Honor," a more specific and pointed question arises, one that persists all the way to the film's final two words: Is there a little bit of Dick Nixon in all of us? 
 I bought this book firstly because I'd wanted to read up on problems with amalgam fillings in teeth, but I am now hooked and can't put it down!  It's absolutely fascinating, and covering so many subjects and viewpoints backed up by scientific research and facts.  It really makes you think twice about a lot of "stuff" you thought you knew!!  and gets you thinking about things in a different way.  A "MUST READ" book.  I've ordered more for relatives 
 Charlaine Harris is addictive-watch out.  You start timidly with one and before you know it, you have finished her last book and are boo hooing that it will be forever before she finishes another one.  Great book, really believable characters.  It was one of the most delightful reads I have had in a long time 
 It is hard to top Allport's thoughtful and understated erudition as he carefully demolishes many of the prevalent reductionstic fads and fallacies of 20th century psychology.  Reading and rereading this book represents  time well-spent.      What do Gordon Allport, Bob Hope and Drew Carey have  in common?    Answer: They were Clevelanders 
 By the fact that so many people are so enraged over a guy who only writes a book about the fact that liberalism is bad for the country and that America is a good place, shows how utterly perverted and reprehensible our society has become. You would think that Sean Hannity had written Mein Kampf. I mean this is merely a book that criticizes the liberal agenda. Not only that Hannity respects the Democrats of JFK and Roosevelt and Truman. The main problem is the Democratic party today, wants partial birth abortion on demand, hates Christianity, wants open borders, hates America, defends those who blow up our buildings. No gee Sean you're a really "hateful guy."   Have you all lost your minds? Do none of you have an ounce of sense left? Do you really think that a guy who writes a pro-American book is in the same class as Hitler? If half of what is written on this site reflects the feelings of our society then we have a society of nothing more then moral idiots.   This is a great book, well documented and rational, something that the left can't handle. If my review makes you mad then tough, get over it. 
 Desserts 1-2-3 is a creative, well put-together cook book.  The book is broken into 5 recipe categories: "Fresh Fruit Desserts", "Custards & Souffles", "Cakes, Cookies, and Tarts", "Chocolate", and "Ice Creams & Frozen Desserts".  There are many beuatiful photographs, on avaerage I'd say about every 3 pages or so.  Be sure to read the introduction at the beginning of the book.  At first, I was a little bugged that some photographs presented lovely extra embellishments, but no instruction on how to make them.  For example, the picture of the Cinnamon-Baked Apples with Apple Butter looks great, with a fancy little caramel candy design stuck into them.  I couldn't be sure it was in fact that, though, becuase there was no explination besides how to make the apples.  In the introduction I found that they were indeed simply melted sugar, hardened into a fancy little swirl. The rest of the extra embellishments are pretty much self-explanitory, but author Rozanne Gold explains a few more in her introduction as well.  This book also includes a "Fat-Free and Low-Calorie Recipes" section and a conversion chart in the back.  The fat-free/low-cal section is actaully just one and a half pages that lists the names and page numbers of previous recipes that are low in fat, or that can be lowered in fat if ingredient subsitutions are made, and it lsits what ingredients those are.  These pages also list which recipes are low in calories, and the amount of calories they have per serving.  I haven't needed these pages, but they are well-organized and look very helpful.  After each section, there are one or two pages of extra ideas relating to that topic.  For example, after the Fresh Fruit Desserts, two pages hold a bunch of extras, such as "1-2-3 Apple Ideas", "1-2-3 Berry Ideas" and so on.  So far, I've found this book to be really great.  It exceeded my expectations.  I checked it out of the library, which is great because I get to use it now all I want for 21 days and can see if I'd like to buy it, or even just check it out again :)  I suggest doing the same to see if you like it enough to purchase.  Enjoy! : 
 Charlie's parents once needed some money - as college students they both took part in a drug trail. The drug unknown to them had queer properties and the trail may have reulted in at least one death. In a million to one shot they ended up married and had a child, the hold over from the drug trail, the enhancement of their latent talents such as telepathy and telekenesis led to Charlie being born in possession of a talent all of her own - she can set fires at will. Her parents keep this very secret, they know that if it were to get out then people would want to take their daugther and study her because they come to realise what she can do is probably what the original test was all about. They struggle to deal with her as a baby - can you imagine a baby crying because it wants feeding only to have the curtains set fire? Her father can use what he calls a 'push', he can make suggestions to people and make them do things but it causes him pain and damages his brain - when he comes home one day from work and finds his wife dead and his daugther missing he sets out to get revenge. He finds his power lacking, the more he uses it the less it works, he gets his daugther back and they end up captured again by a covert government agency 'The Shop' who then try every dirty trick in the book to get the girl to use her powers. Her father is a spent force and they are seperated in a compound - her only friend is a daily cleaner...or so she thinks. Double crossings and devastation - the child will never be free while she has these abilities. She suffers the greatest loss imaginable. A book that blisters with storyline and in the end, there is only one option available to her. Burn it down... True King - a blaze of glory.  Long but worth it 
 This field guide is very well organized and illustrated.  It is quite complete.  With over 300 pages of information this is a must for westerners 
 Winter Solstice is just one of the few bands out there today that is full of promise and just waiting to blow up, which is apparent on "The Fall of Rome".  Featuring some dynamic guitar work and nearly death metal-esque vocals, this Virginia based "metal core" outfit has all the ingredients of being successful in the metal genre, much like Killswitch Engage has had recently.  Standout tracks include the opening "Following Caligula", the title track, and "Malice in Wonderland", all of which show Winter Solstice's promise, even though the album wears thin after the first half.  That in itself is the only downside of "The Fall of Rome"; it sounds more generic as it reaches the end of the disc, but the promise is still there, and Winter Solstice has the formula of being something great.  All in all, "The Fall of Rome" is a worthy listen for new and old metal heads alike 
 Considering all the bad press Tom Cruise and this film got earlier this year I wasn't expecting this film to be all that great.  I mean, by the time you get to the third sequel of film there is rarely anything original left.  Granted, this film is not the most original of plots, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was, what a great job J. J. Abrams did, and what a great cast the film had.  It was much better than I expected it would be.  As you watch the film, you can definitely see J. J.'s "Alias" touches all over the place.  There were even a few times when I wondered if Sydney Bristow was going to jump, which would have been SO cool.  Tom Cruise too a lot of crap for this film, whether that was deserved or not due to some of his antics I don't know, but he was very good in the film and it keeps you attention from start to finish.  If you're looking for a great action film that is also beautifully filmed and well acted, M:I3 is your film 
 Rose Red returns to the world Robin McKinley created in Beauty, retelling a folk story of Beauty and the Beast with new insights and perspectives. Enchantment, dreams, and new awakenings permeate this gentle story of Beauty, who can transform anything; even a Beast's demeanor. 
 Five years ago Emmylou Harris "Portraits" was released which is as good as any career highlight box set in music.  The  "Elvis 50's Masters" covered only half a decade and doesn't count.  I can honestly say "Portraits" is ten times better than "Anthology",  but in all fairness there are radio people out there, the get in the car and go crowd.  For those fans, this collection is better.  I still give "Anthology"  a 5 star because  Emmylou takes the hands on approach to ALL her recordings and has the reputation for never making a bad song, including the singles.  She's takes an average song like "Here, There And Everywhere" makes it twice as good. If some of you still question how great this lady is, how many other female stars from the mid-seventies are still filling the halls in present times?  Enjoy this collection or the box set, they don't come much better than Emmylou Harris - the greatest female Country Rocker of alltime 
 I'm not a Stephen King fan, because I can't read his books (too scary!). This, however, is not a horror tale, but bits of memoirs wrapped around writing lessons. A good book for any writer to have 
 I quite simply loved this book.  Sure, it wasn't perfect and had a few holes, but it was an absolute blast to read.  I found myself reacting to it like it was a movie at times.  I could not put it down and I most definitely recommend it 
 I always liked Doris Day movies.  I like them so much that I contacted Doris Day.  Surprisingly, I received a personal letter and a signed autographed photo.  Doris will and is always the most charming personality and will forever be around in her films and music.  She's one of the few in Hollywood who has done it all. 
 You may have the chance of getting the whole album collection of Simon & Garfunkel. I cannot. If you're walking the same way as I am in this, get this CD and you'll be very happy! It has almost all the best and more popular songs of this crafted duet of great American singers/composers. Sony/Columbia has made a great work with the digital remastering 
 Seneca's brand of Stoicism emphasized the philosophy by which his reader might face life's setbacks. In particular he considered it important to confront the fact of one's own mortality. The discussion of how to approach death dominates this book, which is a series of letters to relatives and friends.  Seneca himself was ordered to commit suicide by the Emperor Nero, and did so in A.D. 65.  This book also elucidates the author's pet peeves, many of which sound quite modern:  *	Men who comb their few strands of hair forward in an effort to hide their baldness *	Historians who memorize obscure dates and battles in an effort to appear knowledgeable *	Collectors and hobbyists of any sort *	Sports fans (men who sit at "a wrestling ring...keenly following the bouts between boys") *	Men who pretend they're younger than they are *	Lunatic poets who prose on about love *	The current mode of dance (mincing and wriggling)  There is very little talk about love or mitigating the pain of death through love.  In fact, Seneca recommends that we detach ourselves from strenuous goal-seeking, repeated indulgence in sport and play, or overindulgence in anything.    Everything in moderation.  Yet his wife did commit suicide with Seneca.  Was that out of love or fear?  This small book (106 pages) gives its reader a window into the life and customs of the Roman Empire as seen through the clear gaze of one of its eminent philosophers. 
 I used this book for a junior composition class I took. I am terrible at writting and this book made it a lot easier the examples are well laid out and the material is as well. A good technical book. It helped me write a resume that worked 
 I am in real estate and I offer a copy or recommend this read to everyone who has a property to sell. I was impressed with the method. Proven results show that sellers who followed her ideas have gotten better offers. Many of the ideas are offered in the staging shows you see on HGTV. Martha's advice is practical and even has tips on how to keep the house looking great during the period of the listing even when you are very busy and have kids running around the house. Its a great resource!  
 I haven't read Louisa May Alcott's Little Women but I recently listened to the audiobook recording which was read by Jamie Lee Curtis and I thought it was a very good story and I liked the characters, especially Jo, Marmee and Laurie. Jamie Lee Curtis gave a wonderful reading performance and I would have liked it if this had been an unabridged audiobook intstead of just abridged but unfortunately she only recorded an abridged version but anyway I highly recommend this audiobook and I will have to look for the paperback book too 
 This CD is off the hook!  When I first heard it, I played it over and over again.  It is definitely in my top 10 of favorites.  Everyone (and I do mean everyone) who I have let listen to this CD loved it.  There is such a good variety and there is something to satisfied every mood.  The tunes are very catchy, groovy, sexy.  It has it's own unique sound, a strong refreshing jazz groove. I have listened to snipets of the other Soul Ballet CD's, this one tops them all.  This CD belongs amoung your collection.  You will not be disappointed 
 I enjoyed this work tremendously. Ms. Robinson obviously researched the facts throughly, then combined them to illustrate her theme, how travel can change your life. Included in her personal travel research was a visit to Hemingway's Cuban home. His style must have rubbed off on her. Her sentences were simple and crisp, flowing logically. I found her descriptions of the locales very vivid, employing a multitude of colorful adjectives and power verbs. I recommend this work to anyone who has traveled extensively. For those who have not traveled a great deal, this work may motivate them to do so 
 This is a rare, beautifully written personal memoir of a most unusual family in the Vietnam war. The author was a prominent anti-war priest: his father was Lieutenant General Joseph Carroll, Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.  Highly recommended 
 My 8 yr. old daughter and I loved Fairy Houses and can't wait to get started making our own as soon as the weather warms up this Spring. We are extremely interested in all things fairy right now and have been devouring anything on the subject we can find. There aren't a lot of books that are devoted to the subject of fairies and we loved this one. The illustrations are quite beautiful and we got lots of ideas on how we could build our own in the back of the book. We also ordered Kristen's Fairy House video, which I have heard good things about, and look forward to viewing. My daughter says, "This book is cool and I got lots of ideas to build my own fairy house. 
 I was first introduced to D.H. Lawrence in a Brit Lit class when I was in college.  We read SONS AND LOVERS, and I was totally blown away by Lawrence's verdant prose and by the novel's brutal, uncomfortable beauty.  My professor mentioned LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER frequently while we were studying Lawrence, and since then I've wanted to read this later, more well-known, more controversial work.  Finally, two years after that class, I got around to it.  LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER tells the story of a young woman named Constance Reid, who marries Sir Clifford Chatterley when he's home on leave for a month from the battlefields of World War I.  After a month of honeymooning, Clifford must return to the war; and sadly, when he returns six months later, he comes home "more or less in bits," paralyzed from the waist down. The newlyweds settle at Clifford's family home, Wragby, near the industrialized town of Tevershall.  Although Clifford cannot please Constance sexually, he and his wife are intellectually connected; they make love with words, and at first this is enough for Constance.  However, a brief affair with one of Clifford's colleagues makes Connie aware of her more carnal needs, of her desire for physical pleasure.  Enter Oliver Mellors, the Chatterleys' groundskeeper who lives a life of solitude in a secluded wooded cabin.  In Mellors, Connie is awakened to a higher consciousness, to the power of sexual pleasure and mutual satisfaction.  Her relationship with Mellors helps her emerge from her cocoon of prudishness to become a highly sexualized being.  The affair continues under Clifford's nose, and he is either too inattentive to notice or just pretends not to.  As a baronet, Clifford is in a position of power, but he finds himself completely powerless.  The mines of Tevershall, which he controls, are dying; and not only is his industry dead, so is his sexuality.  He, and his business, are impotent.  What makes him so interesting is the almost tender way in which Lawrence portrays him.  The scene in which he tries desperately to force his wheelchair's dying motor to roll uphill while Connie and Mellors look on is particularly heartbreaking.  Clifford is vain, and he has no use for sex or other things of a physical nature, but he also knows that the only way he can produce an heir is if Connie has sex with another man and allows Clifford to claim the child as his own.  His lack of power, and his reaction to the knowledge of it, make him compelling.  Unlike Clifford, Connie's other love interest, Oliver Mellors, is confident and unashamed and almost pagan in his celebration of physicality. He's a surprisingly endearing character, a common man with some very intelligent things to say, who isn't intimidated by class boundaries, who doesn't chastise himself for ravishing a married woman.  Constance Chatterley is a woman awakening to her sexual self, and Lawrence chronicles her metamorphosis in explicit, sensitive detail.  It's suprising how well Lawrence was able to write from a woman's perspective.  However, Connie's perception of her ideal relationship near the end of the novel probably didn't quite ring true for many female readers of the time (at least, not that they would admit):  "Complete intimacy!  She supposed that meant revealing everything concerning yourself to the other person, and his revealing everything concerning himself.  But that was a bore.  All that weary self-consciousness between a man and a woman!  a disease!"  It's observations like this that made LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER so controversial.  LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER has probably remained so popular for 80 years because of its sexual content, which was undoubtedly completely immoral for the time period in which is was written.  But of course the content is not anything too shocking in today's world of pay-per-view pornography and busty women on the covers of erotic fiction sold in supermarkets everywhere.  However, this book shouldn't be bunched into that category, by today's standards or any other age's; I would like to think LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER is still popular today because of Lawrence's incredibly brave writing.  Lawrence expounds on many controversial ideas in this, his last major novel before his death in 1930.  The novel is rife with criticism of post-WWI England and the failures of industrialization to support a growing economy.  Lawrence believes sensuality should be the means of connecting with environment, not through the workings of iron and gritty coal.  In LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER, industry is impotent; but men and women are sexually alive.  My only issue with the novel is that some of the sex scenes are absolutely ridiculous, and read like Lawrence was writing them merely for the shock factor.  His language is often unnecessarily crude, and the whole "John Thomas" and "Lady Jane" thing is just silly.  However, this ridiculousness is balanced nicely with some beautiful, sensual descriptions:  Connie's first orgasm, the use of twined flowers to symbolize purity in love, the beautiful language Mellors uses in his letter to Connie at the end of the novel:  "I love the chastity now that it flows between us.  It is like fresh water and rain...like a river of cool water in my soul."    It's undeniable that Lawrence's prose is absolutely intoxicating and exciting, and he proves it again and again in the pages of this novel, written even as his life was ending.  And that's what makes LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER memorable: not the sex, but the words used to describe the sex.  LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER is an intimate look at love and sex, a novel whose popularity has remained for 80 years--and probably will remain far into the future, and rightfully so 
 As was written by the copy editor to introduce the foreword by Ms. Zwinger to my recently published book "Deep Immersion: Thoreau's Engagement with Water" (Green Frigate Books): "Few have ever been so 'haunted by waters' - to use Norman Maclean's wonderful phrase - as has naturalist and 'water logged' nature writer Ann Haymond Zwinger." This particlar book, like all of her works, very much offers a deep well for thirsty minds 
 Beauty may hide a demon while the hideous may conceal a true warrior heart. This chapter in a quest for truth illustrates a reality as old as man. Will our heroine come closer to her true birthright? You'll have to keep reading to find out 
 James' style is indeed difficult. I found that reading some sections of the novel aloud helped me keep my focus and enhanced my enjoyment of James' language. Also, I read the Norton Critical Edition and the critical essays that accompanied the text help me get a lot more out of the story than I would have been able to on my own - Milly, the American innocent vs. the mercenary and dehumanized Kate Croy; Densher as typical Jamesian hero, charming, goodwilled but morally indecisive; self-consciousness or self-knowledge as characteristic of James' greatest heroes and heroines 
 Nestled between electroclash and chill, Client is an interesting female duo who find Depeche Mode acting as generous benefactors on this latest release, City. Signed to Mute, featuring Martin Gore and produced by Andy Fletcher, it's no small wonder that tracks such as One Day At A Time - with its Debbie Harry-style vocal - are ringers for Depeche Mode's quintessential sound and said track would be a perfect addition to any edgy radio station playlist. Strangely enough, City's other two stand-out guests (notably featuring on separate tracks) are The Libertines mainstays Carl Barat and Peter Doherty. After releasing one of 2004's most outstanding albums in The Libertines, why not sprinkle a bit of the magic dust on Client's new album too? Barat's appearance on Pornography harnesses the droll monotone delivery and deft lyrical turns of peak Pet Shop Boys - "Just you and me pornography, just you and me monogamy" - and emerges as a synth heavy killer a long way from the guitar driven rock of Barat's regular job. The English lasses behind Client - Kate Holmes and Sarah Blackmore (from defunct UK pop act Dubstar, responsible for the excellent 1995 single Stars) - initially come on like a dimorphic mix of Curve (particularly on Radio) and Human League at their majestic Dare prime, thus making them obvious rivals of Ladytron and Black Box Recorder. Although not meeting the continuous highs of these competitors, the effective percussive additions such as the tooth-drilling sounds on Overdrive and the air raid sirens of In It For The Money add frantic appeal. Electroclash may be dead, but Client is ensuring that its chilled out little sister is still kicking on nicely. 
 Wow, what can I say that 100+ other reviewers haven't already said, except, "Far out, dude!" This is a terrific read for people who don't normally read fantasy, provided you're willing to open your mind a bit. What about the younger readers? No problem--they will "get" this book where some adults won't. It's not so much about magic as it is a magical adventure in "suspension of disbelief"--my favorite phrase when it comes to fantasy writing. Enjoy 
 Not as good as Point of Impact, but still a very good read and gets better as it motors along. Would make a good movie 
 Approach this title with a nuanced eye. A national culture that has bequeathed to the world Shakespeare, Churchill, and the Beatles, not to mention Chaucer, the Magna Charta, and Princess Diana is not dissolving anytime fast. It is even questionable to propose that the England of 2006 is no longer a world power. What it is not, however, is the seat of a world empire, which seems to be the lament of author A.N. Wilson and the inspiration for this historical essay.  This is an excellently researched and documented work that appeals to both sides of the brain, a compelling read with a clean chronological line and an interdisciplinary look at English social and political life. From Laurel and Hardy to the discovery of DNA, Wilson chronicles change on the island itself and in the nation's place on the world stage. Some of this decline, as Wilson interprets it, is discretely laid at the feet of the United States, which in the context of twentieth century world events seemed somewhat odd to me.  The author begins his critique with the death of Queen Victoria, appropriately enough, in 1901 and the accession of her son, Bertie, as he was known, to the throne as Edward VII.  [John Adams giving way to George Hamilton, so to speak.] Victoria and the obsequious Disraeli had cultivated a "cult of empire" during the last quarter century of her reign, a heightened popular sense of the old maxim of the sun never setting on the Union Jack. Wilson implies that such a strategy was too much too late. For all practical purposes, by 1901 Britain presided over a commonwealth of nations. The empire, by this time was basically India, and as England's need for India increased this subcontinent was becoming harder and harder to manage.  Later in the work Wilson will debate at some lengths the diplomatic and military options open to England in the Munich era and afterwards. In retrospect, though, the critical decisions about England's future were made in the 1901-1914 time frame. While Theodore Roosevelt in the US and young Winston Churchill in the Admiralty fretted about a global naval arms race, British royalty and high society danced through the last idyllic years prior to the world wars, comforted with the news from the Indian Viceroy Lord Curzon that India was secure along her northern borders and that the British overlords were much loved.   Churchill, attuned to the naval state of affairs, switched the British Navy to oil burning locomotion in 1913, and then discovered that oil from the Middle East was getting harder to come by. The problem was an increasing German presence in the East, perhaps most obvious in the construction of railroad lines and roadways from Berlin to Bagdad. [134 ff] Clearly, England would need its subject India as a counterweight to German expansion eastward. My school day history books never described World War I as a quest for oil, but Wilson provides a compelling argument to think so. With a different energy policy and a more clearheaded Indian policy, England would have had no compelling reason to enter the fray.  The miserable experience of World War I began a tumble of dominoes through Versailles [which did not solve England's Middle East woes], depression, World War II, and the loss of India. Wilson chronicles the impact of each upon British society, including the development of "The Special Relationship" between his nation and the United States. Wilson chooses not Roosevelt and Churchill but Laurel and Hardy as his metaphor [Stan Laurel having been born and educated in England before teaming with Georgia's Oliver Hardy] in a rather touching essay. One reads here the author's suppressed but real emotions about the American displacement from the Empire.   This American motif appears time and time again. Wilson believes that England survived the Great Depression in a more effective and humane fashion than did the United States. Later he trumpets the socialized health plan of the late 1940's as an act of beneficence beyond the capacities of the US political system, and he comes just short of alleging that the US took advantage of British nuclear research to develop atomic weapons. He concedes, however, that without US [and Russian?] military force life under Hitler would have been unbearable, consigning the American nation to a kind of necessary evil status.  Wilson chastens his own country for its management of Indian affairs and the shameful denouement there after World War II. The appointment of Lord Mountbatten to India seems to him particularly despicable. But he notes that England did not have a monopoly on rogues, and he is not worshipful of Gandhi or enthralled by Nehru. He laments the great loss of life during the Indian realignment as a metaphor of just how far England and the rest of the civilized world had fallen in fifty years.  In a sense the first and last chapters of this work convey a different mood than the rest of the work: the first featuring the clotheshorse Bertie and the last the young and charming Princess Elizabeth. That royal succession could be celebrated uninterrupted so soon and so enthusiastically in 1952 after two generations of war and its attendant dictatorial demands upon the citizenry is a strong indication that the mystique and identity of England is not gone. The author knows this, but he mourns the loss of place enjoyed by his country in the 1800's and he is cautious about the future. In the final analysis, like a true Victorian he carries a thinly veiled disgust with the decline of civilization itself, with perhaps the unexpressed regret that much of the desecration was self-inflicted.    
 It is a very good book, but might be rather basic for advanced financial people. However, it is very easy to follow, so it might be good 
 This is billed as the definitive sky atlas and delivers on that promise.  The book is large (12" Wide x 18" tall approx) and opens wide with a spiral binder.  The charts are fold out, so each page is approximatley 2' x 18", if you plan to use this in the field, you need quite a lot of space.  The paper is very heavy and the quality of print is good.  The atlas comes equipped with a transparent scale/stencil to overlay on the charts to assist with star identification.  This edition has white pages with black stars,  I would imagine that for field use, this could also be somewhat overwhelming for climatized night vision, unless you use a very dim red light.  Ovarall, I am very happy with this atlas 
   In this day and age of the so called "emo" music and people who are so ignorant that they are calling groups like Def Leopard and Metallica punk music, it is refreshing to listen to a group that actually has talent.     Granted, Per Gessle's voice is not on par with someone like U2's Bono (but then again whose is?) but Mr. Gessele's song writting skills are  unique and the lyrics are good to sing along to in this day and age where actually writting your own songs is virtually extint.   We all remember "It Must Have Been Love" and "Joyride" from the good ole 90's.  It goes without saying that those two songs are well done.  However, not everyone may remember the little known "Never Is A Long Time", but this song is a hidden jewel.   "Don't Bore Us, Get To The Chorus" will definetely deliver your bang for your buck;  whether you are already a Roxette fan or just someone looking to try out some good music from a group that has talent, you won't be disappointed.   Why not try a group that does have talent, unlike the saccarine Britney Spears pop or Avril Lavinge's "my-life-is-so-horrible" punk music that does nothing but pollute the environment's airwaves.   Roxette is refreshing - a breath of fresh air. 
 I first used this book in my graduate program in a class for communication and leadership. This skills taught in this book are outstanding.  Now, I plan to use the ideas from this book in my own career, as well as helping an undergraduate peer staff at a university learn the basic helping guidelines. This book is highly recommended 
 If you like your movies filled with a good story line, suspense, intrigue, and Robert Redford, you'll enjoy this movie. The CIA stuff and a guy stuck between a rock and a hard place make this movie one that you don't want to press the pause key on your remote to get a snack. A movie made in the mid 70's really is a quality film. Great shots of the World Trade Center with a scene actually taken from within one of the Trade Center Towers. Limited profanity and killing. Just enough to give the film the reality to deal with the subject matter. A guy flick for sure, but Redford will not be too hard on the eyes for the women. No disappointment purchasing "Three Days of the Condor" 
 I had forgotten how wonderful Randy Travis sounds live. This video reminded me. I just sat in awe of the talent this guy has! He can sing a song technicaly very well, and at the same time, tug your heart strings. I was reminded of how a warm and charming person Randy Travis is and how well he can sing. Amazing.....truly amazing 
 I suffered from terrible verbal abuse as a child, and now as a mother have had a very difficult time seeing our daughter in any pain.  This book has helped me to understand more clearly that true, Christ-like love gives us the strength to help our children to live assertively, and that while we work to protect them from harm, to try to protect them from every day life and consequences hurts them significantly more in the long run.  It did a great job of teaching how to parent with high though realistic expectations of your children, while always giving them the unconditional love and encouragement that they need to have happy, successful lives.  
 this book, the Education of the Heart, is translated in Chinese. When I read this book, I am enjoyed. it is not book than can read at once, but you could read it every time. In this book, the greatest man ask me what is the soul,and how to care of it. sometimes, I feel so tire that can't do anything, and by reading this book, I could gain the power for my life. Well, I like this book.  I hope you like it too 
    A work of art...Carol Marsh was Beautiful and talented.   Brings back fond memories.....I was in  the seventh grade when I  saw it in the theater.. 
 This volume is probably not as good as the 1st or 3rd books in the series, but it is still one of my all time favorites.  Caro is clearly an obsessive researcher, and sometimes he gets bogged down in providing context.  But he completely delivers on his objective of showing how Johnson acquired and used political power.  To the extent there are flaws they are crimes of passion.  Caro has such intense love/hate feelings for Johnson and the detail and storytelling are incredible.  Quite simply this series sets the standard for non-fiction writing in my mind. 
 Everyone else has already said it so well... don't spend another moment's hesitation on whether to buy it or not... just buy it!  It is absolutely the sewer's bible!  And I loved the comment about bringing it with you to the fabric store.  I do a lot of fabric and pattern buying online and I have found that I don't complete the purchase without first referring to this book!  Okay, 'nuff said 
 Brings back memories of walking through the cursed passages of Count Dracula's castle with the legendary whip of the Belmont clan. 
 This book is a must have for all who work with people with the hepatitis C, have Hepatitis C, or loves someone who has it. This book saves lives ! Thank you Mr. Dolan 
 I got this to be a supplement for my 5 and 6yo dd and they have done it with ease. It is not very challenging but is great for more independent busy work. I think it is too easy for my 6yo. In my opinion it is more of a preschool workbook. Highly recommend for a 4-5yo. 
 This is a good book for someone who can act on things. I was shy most of my life and worked hard to earn a degree from a good school only to fear talking to people so  I sent back to work in a factory. I did not know how to switch gears and mix in a business setting or others where I did not know people. It really hurt and I was determined to get over this. I found this book over 12 years ago and really took it to heart and figured that I would try to do some of the things the author was talking about and just kept building for there. If you can learn from book and try to act on them within reason when you do not have the answers yourself then this book might help you. I give it to my up and coming staff as part of their development if I think it will help them in social/business setting. While I still have a big shy side no one reallyknows it unless I tell them and I speak on a pretty regualr basis to various business and other groups 
 I'm not going to spend time raving about the movie, because I'm going to assume that if you've got this far you already know how wonderful it is.  What I think could be far more useful (as this is an area where I have been burned) is some comparison between the two DVD editions I know of.  I have copies of both the Kino Video edition and the Image Entertainment edition.  My preference is for Image Entertainment for the following reasons:  (1) The print seems slightly cleaner (and most helpfully, the DVD packaging warns you about the horizontal line across the top of some scenes which is a defect on the original film)  (2) The intertitles on Image use the correct expressionistic style as per the 1920 release.  from what I recall, Kino's are the 'normalised' printed intertitles from 1923.  (3) The Kino version has possibly the most insensitive layer transition location I have ever come across.  For reasons of their own Kino put an intertitle before the final sequence in the asylum, and it would have been a natural place for a layer transition.  Instead they put it a few seconds into the final sequence (and only a couple of minutes before the end of the film!).  Image has no layer transition.  (4) Both scores on the Kino version are dreadful.  One consists of strange electronic noises, while the 'orchestral' one is pretty inappropriate.  Instead Image chose a very nice specially composed score by Timothy Brock which is a remarkably effective pastiche in the style of Alban Berg (very appropriate for an expressionist film).  (5) Image has a commentary track; it's not clear that Kino does (I can't remember, but certainly it isn't mentioned in the blurb on the back).  Just about the only plus of Kino is that there is considerably more bonus material (43 minutes from 'Genuine: the tale of a vampire' as compared to about 3 on Image).  However, if the price for that is the awful layer transition, then I know which I prefer.   So that's why I prefer the Image version and wish I hadn't bought the Kino version 
 The whole book is really good, but three songs became the ones that I enjoy the most - Music of the Night, All I ask of you, and Wishing you were somehow here again.  But all the songs are really outstanding.  The cool thing is that they sound just like the original music.  I enjoy sitting down at a party or something and playing it....everybody drops what they are doing and starts singing along, its good music to know  ;)  
 The First Year- Parkinson's was easy to understand.  The use of personal accounts, some emtional situations and sprinkled with humor throughout, helped to make a connection with this reader.  The wide range of relationships affected by a chronic illness were clearly identified by Ms. Christensen.  I strongly encourage you to read this helpful and insightful book whether you are a "Parkie", know someone who is, or are in the healthcare field and have contact with "Parkies", this book will open your eyes 
 I have to admit that it wasn't necessarily the type of story I would have grabbed right off if it wasn't for the name of Jeffrey Eugenides. However, a moment into the book and I was drawn into the world, the ancestral history, the future, the family, the life of Callie. Each one of the characters is so humanly flawed, so sympathetic that even when they are making decisions that makes you cringe just ever so slightly, you can still understand them and love them. This story has given me hours of wonderful literary pleasure - both in reading and in discussion 
 A very compelling read.  My wife and I both read it and loved it.  We picked up another novel by Mr. Iles and are looking forward to it.  It is definetely worth your time 
 Brimming with references to Jung and the Bible, Ego & Archetype  fulfilled every expectation I had.   This book covers the journey of the  ego from the crimes undertaken in the Garden of Eden to the reconciliation  in New Jerusalem.  A perfect compliment to any collection of Jung's work 
 People are often confused about sex, not only when this novel was written, but even in this seemingly oversexed era.   DH Lawrence wrote this lyric and sensual book, where the heroine Lady Chatterley, who was well-born and well bred, happens to be married to an invalid, whose injuries were sustained in World War I. Her husband is a baronet, Sir Clifford.  The love interest in the book is Sir Clifford's gamekeeper. Connie Chatterley is not a virgin when she has this affair, but Mellors, (the gamekeeper) awakens her to life, to higher consciousness that comes with tender lovemaking.   It would be insultingly simplistic to say that Lawrence believed lovemaking is really the solution to the poison of industry, mechanization, and lack of awareness and connectedness to one's environment. Although the invalid and sexually incapable Sir Clifford is a symbol of the impotence of modern mechanization, Lawrence believed that lovemaking is only the solution when it's done right. In other words, with tenderness. The author was certainly not advocating misogyny or meaningless sex. He was saying, with sexual love where the lovers have body awareness, as opposed to cerebral awareness, which is from the mind, only part of the body.  Do we have too much sex in our age? What Lawrence would probably say, is that we have too much cerebral sex. We are not connected to our lovemaking.   This book is not pornography. Any one who believes that it is porno should read Lawrence's essay entitled "Pornography", where Lawrence ridicules pornography. Why? Because it does dirt on sex; it makes sex look dirty. In reality, pornographers hate sex; they make it look ugly and trite.   In a digital internet age, like the industrial age of the 1920s, there is no connectedness with the body and the world. Our age is filled with pornography but not filled with the kind of sex Lawrence believed in. The search continues. 
 This book is ostensibly about marketing, but much of the information is of general relevance to running your own business.  I received my MBA from an Ivy school, and I have to admit that a substantial portion of the material in the book was stuff that we never covered in marketing classes.  Overall, a very useful book about starting and operating your own small business.  I highly recommend it 
 Best Boy draws you in from the start, as Philly is immensely sweet and likeable, but the films emotional effects are cumulative. Ultimately Phillys plucky spirit becomes an example of courage that all we "normal" people could only hope to follow. The documentary deservedly won 1979's Best Documentary Oscar.  Dont miss this highly affecting piece 
 This is the best song book that Brown has come out with.  When i first heard this music i didn't really like it.  Now it has grown on me and i can't stop listening to it.  He gets so much emotion i can't believe a human actually wrote this!  i also saw the closing show of this in NYC and it really shows that there are 3 sides to a story, his, hers and the truth.. 
 This is a book worth buying.  It is not at all highly technical and anybody can read this work, but that does not at all mean that it is not informed by great scholarship.  The book is divided into two sections.  The first section is made up of small introduction to Hebrews, Colossians, Matthew, John, Mark, and Revelation.  This fact alone makes the book worth buying, because Wright is extremly insightful.   The second part of the book is divided up into subjects.  Most interestingly is that Wright deals with the subject of Hell.  Again, if this were the only chapter in the book it would be worth buying.  I do recommend this book, along with all of Wright's work 
 This is a really fun book, I enjoy the cutting and pasting stuff. I am 10 so I am not really challengend on some of the crafts. The DVD crafty fun is really good for my age, I have learned how to make christmas stuff, iron-on tote bags, necklaces and other really fun stuff 
 This is a smart, funny exploration of one of the lesser-known elements of the high-stakes art world -- the right of an artist's estate to declare a work "authentic" or not.  The questions of authenticity that drive the plot are also reflected in the book's narrative structure, in which the story is told through two competing voices -- one a defeated, cynical, world-weary artist and the other his slow-witted, demanding and cantakerous brother  Neither is a particularly reliable narrator, but the truth that emerges from their combined account is surprisingly sweet. 
 With not even being a big theme park fan, I found this program to be SO interesting.  I actually saw it on TV but am now buying the DVD as a gift.  It is fascinating to see Disneyland and Disney World come to life and all the thought and creativity that produced it.  Anyone who has that curious streak and always ponders "How'd they do that?" or "I wonder how that works??"  will LOVE this show.. it is SO COOL!  Sharon A. 
 Nearly everyone in the world knows All-Star by now,but does anyone realize that Smash Mouth was originally ska.  This is a great album exept Walkin on The Sun, which later caused them to sell out.  My favorites are The Fonz and Nervous in the Alley.The Fonz was released as a single but didn't get much airplay.Nervous in the Alley's first inpression is a pop/punk song at the beginning but then it cruises into hardcore!  I say any punk or ska fan should check this one out 
 I admit ive never heard of this guy before but i picked it up due to the reviews and i really was great. The mixing is top class and the beats/grooves are great. Anyone into GU will appreciate this CD. Cmon people its like wat, 8 dollars used for 2 cds, its worth every penny 
 Don't Give Up on Me was fine enough, but it wasn't really a soul album and it was far too subdued. On Make Do with What You Got, Solomon really cuts loose, and he's got a band full of seasoned soul musicians (Ray Parker Jr., who played with Steve Wonder and led the soul band Raydio pre-Ghostbusters, Bill Withers' drummer, Muscle Shoals guitar great Reggie Young, and Solomon's own church organist, among others) with him. The result is stupendous.   The lead-off track is a cover of a Coco Montoya song that sounds just like the Stones circa Exile, but with better vocals. It's just amazing. Fading Footsteps and the title track are both stomping soul number with a slightly more modern (like, mid-seventies) feel. The rest is mostly ballads, including scorching takes on The Stones' I Got the Blues, a Hank Williams gospel song.   This is a fantastic album that any soul music fan should love. 
 I am sorry, but I never read the book, but I purchased it as a gift for friend. However I had the pleasure of meeting Mr Simmons on a tour of Charleston, South Carolina in 1998. He is an incredibly lively person who is full of humor and has countless stories to share. I remember one in particular, when he spoke of his years as a boy when there were only horse & carriages for transportation. Then he said the age of the automobile came to be and folks would stop whatever they were doing to watch in awe as the automobile went by. Then he chuckled quietly as he descibed the same behavior today when a horse & carriage goes clamoring through town.   There are no words to describe the artistic craftmanship of Mr. Simmons iron works, you simply have to see for yourself.  As for Mr. Simmons, he is a proud yet humble man about his craft, his works and his life, you should meet him for yourself 
 Many books have had the word "classic" hung upon them for many reasons.  Few though deliver the goods on as many levels as does this novel.  This book is funny, alarming, exciting, sad, and thought-provoking.  The three buddies are sort of seventeenth-century drunken brats with swords whose hearts are nevertheless in the right place and win through at the end to save an empire. There are places in the book that are simply funny, something that Hollywood has keyed on.  There is a ridiculous aspect to the whole thing that is veiled only thinly in the book.  The book has some really sad twists and the ending will make anyone think.  At the end, though, most readers will agree that this book stands by itself and richly deserves the appellation "classic."  The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the outdated language.     
 This was an enjoyable book to read because it presented an intriguing subject, it presented the subject in an even-handed manner, and it was well-sourced.   Each chapter contained numerous footnotes that provided the reader the opportunity to consult other publicly available resources to learn more about the subject.   I personally enjoyed the behind-the-scenes look at the independent gas station, refinery, delivery business, and Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as it provided a comfortable understanding of how these businesses operate and corrects mischaracterizations that could have easily formed about these entities.   I learned especially of the chemical similarities of branded gasolines, as well as the tiny profit margin earned by gas stations.   I recommend this book with pride 
 I just finished this one. WOW! I couldn't put it down. Han Nolan is one of the best writers I have ever read. All her books are just as great as this one. I can't wait 'till she writes another 
 Very good and entertaining movie.  Great assembled cast and fun to watch.  I especially liked the mix of old western firearms that were used and the complexity of some of the characters.  Highly recommened for western buffs like me 
 This book is an accurate account of the horrors and stereotypes that surrounded Diaspora Africans in America.  It is my hope that every African American read this bok, and treasure it as I have 
 This book dispels may ill-conceived notions people in developed world have about people in the rest of the world. Explains how the inability to put a value on assets in various parts of the world is a major cause for stymied growth. And the reason for this inability to quantify assets stems from the extralegal ways in which the assets are obtained.  Emphasizes the importance of institution building (over long periods of time) for the capitalism to really work. Explains why institution building is not always easy. Explains how, to set things right, extemely unpopular measures have to be taken (which upsets the some people who are afrid to lose their influence) which in many cases leads to unrest resulting in rollback of reforms.  Explains how to bring extralegal sections of the society into the fold in order to ensure long term success. Mentions the transformation of US over centuries into what it is today (largely governed by the rule of law) 
 I loved the characters as much as I have in his other books I have read.  A lot of fun 
 I absolutely Love all of Nicholas Sparks' books. I have read them all and if want a great read with a touching story then he is the author for you. Exciting/Compelling You can't go wrong here.  And I always preorder his new ones..... I'm addicted 
 I loved Perry's first WWI novel, No Graves As Yet.  I've been anxiously waiting 2 years for the 2nd installment.  It was even better than the first!  
 This is definitely a good read if you are interested in treating yourself or someone you care about using Glutathione.  It goes into a lot of detail about how it works, and I found it to be worthwhile. It talks about some other aminos that are helpful to use in conjunction with the Glutathione 
 Just got this product for my birthday, because the armband that came with my Nano was too small to fit around my upper arm. After reading the review by InAlaska, I decided to give this one a try as I am close to the same size (5'11" 225lb).   The item is just as described in his review, and my thoughts are pretty much the same (my screen protector was NOT damaged). The package is a good value and 90% of people who purchase it will be very pleased.   Unfortunately, I'm in the minority, because it is still too small to fit comfortably around my upper arm. If your upper arm is 17" or larger, the armband will not fit unless you pull it uncomfortably tight (cutting off circulation). I'm going to try to stretch it and see if it will eventually lengthen. If it works, I'll amend this review.   Still, a solid 4 stars for quality and value. 
 While many philosophical texts can lay claim to a good cerebral work-out Massumi makes sure you don't forget that the body and sensation are very much part of this process. As he says "There is no thought that is not accompanied by a physical sensation of effort of agitation, (if only a knitting of the brows, a pursing of the lips, or a quickening of the heartbeat). This sensation, which may be muscular,...tactile, or visceral is backgrounded. This doesn't mean it disappears into the background. It means that it appears as the background against which the conscious thought stands out: its felt environment." These musings on the sensations and functioning of the body are not without larger consequence. Massumi elequently re-introduces movement, dynamism into the static and spatially orientated positional grid that is the basis of much analysis. 
 Very interesting book for those of you who really need a comprehensive, thorough, and easy to implement strategy regarding distribution channels. It changed my previous perception about channels as a consequence, and create a new perspective about channels as a source of new business and new alternatives of go to market. In addition, it gives an almost prescriptive list of to-do things in order to create a channel model, and to measure its impact 
 This movie is hilarious and the best thumb movie i've seen. The people that don't get it are people who aren't to bright they like average humor but if you have an I.Q. of at least 50 and like off beat humor then you will enjoy this great thumb movie 
 After seeing the reviews above I feel a fair review is overdue.  My first thought on hearing this album was "what a chaotic mess of soundscapes!". But there lurked charm enough to keep me returning to it, one song at a time. Perhaps the greatest problem with it is that there are no bad or weak songs on this disk. Every track vastly different in musical terms, but the overall theme is like a series of moods/moments extracted form your souls long journey.  It took me not just days, but over two weeks of random track listens to get my head around it, now its by far my fave Vai disc. The performance is nothing short of viruosity, there is no-one who can shred like steve. Each song showcases a different aspect of this artists unbelievable talent, not just as a guitarist but as a composer. The melodies are hauntig. The layering leaves you discovering new sounds and noises even months after the first listen. The chord progressions complex and profound. The extremely diverse choice of sounds ensures that when you get to the end of it you are left craving for more.  The lack of boring and "idle" musical moments means that this is music for intelligent ears. Its far to intense to be left playing in the background. It's in your face and will consume every moment of your attention from start to finish.  The passion and cleverness of this work is not obvious at first but it will grow on you to the point of becoming addictive. Take your time, maybe listen to one song at a time. Eventually the puzzle will come together for a totally uplifting and inspiring listening experience 
 At a time when we all seem to be reassessing our priorities, this is the perfect gift...for yourself or someone you care about. It is an easy read filled with wise, inspiring thoughts. Packed into this slim volume are powerful tips for refining your focus, buoying your spirit, and putting your "some day" plans into motion. Reading it reminds you of your power to set things right and challenges you to live fully each day of your life 
 Seyyed Hossein Nasr may not be the most well-known Muslim author in the West, but that is to our detriment. This Iranian-born philosopher is clearly one of the more compelling voices in his faith and one which should be heard much more often.  "The Heart of Islam" is, as the title suggests, another book which sets out to explain the basics of Islam for a Western audience. What sets this one apart from the rest - totally aside from Nasr's abilities as a writer - is the fact that the same author has to his credit "The Young Muslim's Guide To The West". Nasr, it would seem, is quite gifted at explaining cultures to each other.  The basics of the religion are all present and correct. In fact, as a specialist in the field, I find that Nasr's outline of the basics is often superior to many other authors as he breaks down the various types of action (permissible, forbidden and so on) with scriptural examples - which is a feature very few books have. If all you're after is a quick run through the basics, though, the Five Pillars and so on are more than covered here. There is also a well-argued piece on jihad, that area of Muslim doctrine which is so easily misunderstood.  For the beginner, however, "Heart of Islam" may not be the best book to buy. Nasr's style of writing is a little too literary at times and his approach to various aspects of his religion is slightly more mystical than perhaps it should be. I understand that he describes himself as something of a Sufi, which would also explain the prominence he gives the Sufi concepts of "tariqa" and the like. This is not to say that Sufism should be ignored totally, but there is a risk of losing perspective with the structure Nasr has adopted here.  Additionally, the final quarter or so of this book leaves the "Introduction to Islam" subject matter aside and delves into a combination of Nasr's own philosophies and some defences against common criticisms. In the former case, the fact that the author is a capable philosopher is definitely a good thing, but the environmentalist arguments (particularly) appear to be tacked on with little real thought for how the book will read. Some sections, in fact, feel as though they were taken straight from another book and inserted holus bolus into this one. Perhaps not the most far-fetched idea, given the timing of "Heart"'s publication, although this sounds more uncharitable than it should. In the latter case, the responses are well-written but feel a little tacked on again - although not as much as the philosophy. Some of this may be due to my own academic background, and more might be due to the intervening time between September 11 (after which many of the criticisms Nasr responds to began to be aired in the media) and now. That said, it is important to read the responses to criticisms of "the human rights record of Islam" - which is a common concept, albeit an unusual one in historical terms.  All in all, "The Heart of Islam" is a fine book with many useful things to say. The specialist - or at least someone with a general background in Islam - will probably get a little more out of it than a rank beginner, but there is no one for whom this book is not recommended 
 For anyone that will be involved in helping defend the teaching of quality science education, this is an essential sourcbook which concisely reveals the real concensus of the scientific community regarding creationism. A  good source for providing information to local school boards and others who  may have become confused by Creationist propaganda and may be confused  about the real nature and stance of modern science 
 It is inconceivable how they could make such a good movie. This is one of those movies that the story is being told and periodically you are drawn back to the reader and listener to see what they think of the story. The reader is a grandfather played by Peter Falk and the grandson that is listening to the bedtime story is Fred Savage. Watch the expressions on Prince Humperdinck's (Chris Sarandon) face as he gets foiled again. Exceptional good story and actors. Lots of mush and unexpected trials.   See Peter Falk again with Cyndi Lauper in "Vibes" (1988).  
 Forget I, Claudius. Here's the real dirt. Tacitus? Boring. Suetonius is the one who told us everything we want to know about early imperial Rome. For the longest time our English translaters were too timid to tell us in English what Tiberius was up to on Capri. Robert Graves catches a lot of heat for transliterating rather than translating but he still does better than the ellipses and phrases left in latin that preceded him. Too bad he'd lost the sparkling prose by the time he wrote his novels. Doesn't matter at all: Twelve Caesars has well-shaped prose, plot to spare and the most colorful characters ever. Fiction wishes it could compete 
 According to a lot of the bad reviews, it sounds like you are trying to make this out to be a video game design book... but it's not, it's a book on game design in general, NOT JUST video games.  Video games are a manifestation of the category of games.  Readers of this text MUST be aware that this is not a narrow visioned book like most video game design books, it talks about a whole lot more.  But because it does, it can't go into specifics on video games... which you can get in other books that disgruntled readers are mentioning.  Overall, you must understand the focus and aim of this book to appreciate it.  And intellectually stimulating?  VERY!  This book not only teaches you games but makes you rake your brain while at it, questions the fundamentals of most games you played as a child.  Very intersting 
 Almost everything written by and about Feynman is refreshing, like a breath of mountain air, or, more often than not, a much-needed slap on the face.  These letters are no exception.  Much of this effect is a result of his take-no-prisoners attitude when it comes to purveyors of intellectual hokum-In particular, his insistence that what one is working on be falsifiable.  In other words, if what you're working on is not testable or not at least foreseeably testable to see if you are correct or incorrect, then what you are doing is not science, it is philosophy, and rather bad philosophy at that.     These sort of refreshing reminders are particularly important today when "string theory" is all the rage, as popularised by Brian Greene et al, a theory which, even Greene admits, will probably not be testable in your or my lifetime.-Feynman, terse as always in such matters, expresses his opinion about string theory in one of these letters---"I don't believe in it."  It is ironic that Greene cites Feynman so often in his books.     But String theory aside, Feynman enthusiasts will find perhaps a wider, more three-dimensional perspective in these letters than in other books.---They will find, in his letters to friends students admirers etc., wonder of wonders - a wise, articulate man.    
 Personally, I like this set of songs for the hook-laden tunes and more-thoughtful-than-the-average-pop-album lyrics, but the relative musical merits have been covered in the other thousand reviews so I'll just mention that I give it an extra star for the cool,unusual video for "Why Can't I?" included on the CD 
 I go back and reread this book every couple of years-- it is helpful for all sorts of relationships, not just marriage.  I always find something new to work on when I read it.  And (unlike some other reviewers) I think it's critical that the advice is based on research and not on someone's opinion.  Some of what he has found contradicts received wisdom about marriage.  It is a little baffling to me that people turn to books such as Dr. Phil's book on marriage (which cribs pretty liberally from Gottman's work) or that horrible "He's just not that into you" book (which appears to be written for 12 year olds) when Gottman's popular books are just as readable and understandable.  And Gottman's work is based on years of studying actual relationships.    Also, they are better written 
 When I bought this album. It was 1988. Like Buckley, one of the reviewers below, I find this to still be one of my favorite albums. I guess some of this happens to do with my love for Philip Dick's quasi-science fiction. I remember when Spin magazine (back when it didn't suck) did an interview with Sonic Youth around Christmas-time in 1987-88 and they talked about Dick's influence on their lyrical style, specifically on Sister. Sister seems a concept album to me, always a good one to turn to when you feel nihilism or a slight twinge of madness/worshiping of false idols coming on. This was the Spin Interview, I think, when Thurston Moore said that when he was a teenager, and people wanted to go see Led Zeppelin, he'd say: "**** Led Zep, let's go see the Ramones!" This has always stuck with me as being one of the great punk rock comments of all time, and sum up the sheer coolness factor of Sonic Youth. 
 The second half of the CD amazing but the first ones are excellent 
 This book made my laugh, cry, feel like I was not alone.....I hope Joy writes another and soon..... 
 Riane Eisler's Tomorrow's Children is a thought provoker and conversation starter.  So many education books are about getting the knowledge and skills to "fit in" to society's opportunities. Tomorrow's  Children challenges the reader to expand their vision and expectations of  education. This follow-up to the Chalice and the Blade offers practical and  hopeful examples of how to access the "hidden curriculum" beyond  textbooks and polemics.  If you want to know how to find materials to  encourage meaningful and relevant learning, this book is for you.  If you  want to know the specifics of making change in your local schools  (concerning the content, process and structure of education) this book is  for you.  If you are interested in finding kindred spirits to promote  practical examples of collaborative problem-solving, a peaceful response to  adversity, gender equity,and environmental sensitivity this book is for  you. If you appreciate thoughtful and thorough and careful writing free  from jargon this book is for you.  If you are interested in specific  references of books, websites, curriculum packages and supportive  organizations this book is for you. I am a Professor of Education.  I am  fussy about what I read in this field.  I am drawn to clear and concise  writing which honors the intelligence of the reader.  Tomorrow's Children  does not disappoint 
 I am an engineer who has read many books, good and bad, obfuscating and illuminating, and concise and lengthy.   This is the best by far on the complex (double entendre intentional) subject of DSP.  His appendices alone are worth the price of the book.  I wish every course on DSP used this text 
 Unlike most design books, I felt a strong emotional attachment to the succinctly conveyed advice, demonstrated in inspirational, calming pictures. I actually find it calming to review after a long day as well.  I recommend taking your time and thoughtfully trying to digest its messages, as oppose to glossing over the pretty pictures 
 It's amazing to receive two books on honey and honeybees virtually simultaneously from different publishers, but that's how the publishing world goes, and Sweetness And Light is one of the two, following the stories of bees and honey from ancient to modern times. Hattie Ellis' history blends social issues, science, travel and nature insights, and comes from a columnist who specializes in writing about food. Lively anecdotes follow the history, especially the individuals involved in pioneering discoveries in the field. A 'must' for honey historians. 
 I love this book. It's a good refresher. I recommend it for every first time breeder BEFORE you even decide you're going to breed. It's easy to read and the information is extremely helpful. It's not as indepth as I need, but a good cursory look. Don't stop your breeding library search here, keep adding to it 
 I was very impressed with the texture of these shadows. They slip on softly with a great feel and last all day or night with no creasing. I also like the way the colors will go on subtley with a light touch or with a heavier hand build up for more intensity. The color selection is gorgeous. Just one word of warning -- you can't really go by the color samples. It's better to see them in person. I bought Lilac Mist which is beautiful on the brow bone and was very close to what I was expecting. But Paris By Night looks like a gray but is actually a deep mauve. I was dissapointed until I tried it. It contoured my eyes beautifully and while intense is very natural looking. This is about the fourth time I've bought Laura Mercier products and I've been totally pleased with the quality. 
 As a newspaper photographer who is doing more and more freelance photography Harrington's book gives me a great resource to help me make wise business decisions. From big concepts to small details he covers it all. His case studies provide practical know-how that easily translates to my experience. This is a must read for photographers and those who hire photographers 
  Toward the very beginning of Michael Pollan's "The Omnivore's Dilemma", there is a rather simple statement of purpose of what is going to transpire over the following 400 pages.  "This is a book about the pleasures of eating, the kinds of pleasure that are only deepened by knowing."  Over the course of the pages, Pollan leads us toward the intimate processes that supply four meals, from McDonald's (where apparently one out of three children are getting at least one meal a day) to a modern hunter-gathering meal (or as he says, "a meal eaten in full consciousness").  The omnivore is an animal that requires neither a vegetarian's or carnivore's dietetic imperatives.  Each meal is suffused with choice.  A koala bear is tied to eucalyptus leaves (or a baleen whale to plankton) in ways that we can't understand.  In fact, much of brain thought function may have evolved in posing the question: "What should I eat?"  An interesting feature of the opacity of modern food production is how unclear the answer to that question is.  It's unclear that the hamburger prepared for lunch comes from a cow.  It's puzzling to see the connection between that chicken nugget and the chicken.  Even more puzzling is the nutritional differences between the salmon caught wild in the ocean versus raised in a fresh water farm.  Particularly when the cow has been fed parts from chicken, the chicken from the cow and the salmon from corn.  The question then can be not so much what should I eat as what am I eating?  Wendell Berry defines eating as an agricultural act, so it is fitting that most of the detai in this book is in the food system of this country.  Pollan examines how food comes from seed to the plate (or in the case of those soups that you microwave and serve right out of the designed-to-fit-your-car's-cupholder cup).  The star of the agribusiness model (and therefore, the reigning supermarket champion) is corn (maize).  Pollan refers to corn as the "proto-capitalist plant".  It has a duality of being both a food and an abstract commodity (a deferred food).  In many ways, it is a species that has evolved in total dependence of humanity (to seed it, havest it, distribute it and have it colonize currently over 125,000 square miles in the US-an area more than double that of New York state).  Another adaptation that is keen for business is that recently engineered seed has qualities that don't propigate to to the next generation.  That is it allows the seed companies to not only sell you seed this year, but have you coming back for more next year (because the seed you might take from this year's crop will be far less productive in the next generation).  The overgrowth of corn has led to many sorts of uses of corn as a processed food.  It is used as feed to all manner of animal.  It is used mixed in with fuels.  It is used as a filler.  It is used to put the sheen on a magazine cover.  When Pollan sits down (in his car on the highway) to his McDonald's meal, the soda (high fructose corn syrup), burger (beef that was grain fed at consolidated animal feeding operation), fries (immersed and sponging up corn oil) are more corn than not.  There are nutritional problems to eating beef that are fed this corn-centric diet.  They are higher in saturated fat and lower in omega-3 fatty acids.  Ruminants have adapted through evolution to eat grasses and have rumen specifically to process  those grasses.  When they eat a diet of corn, they are subject to rumenitis (among other ills).  They need to be medicated with Rumensin and Tylosin to survive the corn diet they are fed on the feed lot.  It is so injurious to their health that 15%-30% of feedlot cattle have abscessed livers.  As poorly as ruminants are adapted to eating corn, humans may be as poorly adapted to eating ruminants who are adapted to eating corn.  We may see this in the rates of diseases like obesity, type-2 diabetes and heart disease.  Pollan makes an interesting comparison to the early 19th century "Republic of Alcohol" calling our current situation, "Republic of Fat".  The supersizing effect on U.S. culture has been such that per annum, per capita consumption of sugars increased from 128 pounds to 158 pounds in the 20 years between 1985 to 2005.  Worldwide, the UN reports that there are now more people over-nourished (1 billion) than under-nourished (800 million).  The industry that drives this runs on cheap corn fuel (literally to some degree as ethanol becomes more ubiquitous).  The cheapness though, has hidden costs.  Corn production in the current agro-industrial sense requires fossil fuels for the means of capital that plant and harvest it (combines, tractors, etc.), but also for the nitrogen fertilizers (synthesized from natural gas).  Corn price shortfalls are subsidized by the government (which results in perpetual corn over-production).  The corn operations are a small set of seeds that are grown as a monoculture with pesiticides and fertilizing and soil management that compromise the farmland ecology.  And as far as costs go it piles up because plants grown in synthetically fertilized soils are less nourishing, are more vulnerable to disease and pests and polycutures are more productive and less prone to disease than monocultures.  There are other alternatives to this industry.  There is an organic movement that has been developing since the 1960s and also a local foods movement movement which can be viewed in the growth of farmer's markets over the past 40 years.  Pollan's second meal represented foods that come out of the organic movement, but do not share the local nature of the beyond organic or "Clean Foods" movement.  This "Big Organic" shares some of the industrial nature of the mainstream agrobusiness, while excising the use of synthetics (particularly fertilizers, pesticides and antibiotic medications).  Clearly, "Big Organic" attempts to address some of the more egregious failings of agrobusiness.  It's an incremental change, though, when fossil fuels are not used to fertilize the soil, but are used to haul in the manure that will do so.  It's a small incremental change indeed when an out-of-season bunch of asparagus is flown in from Argentina and marketed as organic.  It's quite hard to see what is organic at all about that refrigerated 747 ride (Pollan described it as tasting like cardboard, so it wasn't a even a guilty pleasure -- more of a guilty mild-annoyance).  In the smaller scale, the local, clean food movement, Pollan spends a week on a farm owned by Joel Salatin in Virginia (with a farmer who would not FedEx food out to Pollan in Berkeley, CA).  This represents the shift of focus from the industrial to the artisanal model.  The farmer Pollan stays with advocates management intensive grazing.  The benefits of this farming practice is that the livestock grazes off grasses and the grasses in turn feed off the nitrogren in the livestock's manure. In effect, the grass grows and feeds the cattle, the cattle clip the grass (and take care of any trees or shrubs), the poultry follows up and takes care of grubs and insect, not to mention grains left in the cattle's wake.  It's a symbiotic process.  The manure from both sustain the grass as the grass sustains the animals.  Which is a brilliant solution to the nutrient problem which large scale industry attempts to solve with synthetic fertilizers and pest controls.  In effect, agrobusiness creates a problem out of a process that has previously been solved.  Prior to the industrial development of fossil-fuel farming, a farm was basically a solar engine behaving basically by the grace of photosynthesis.  Salatin's farm is on a piece of land in Virginia that had been scraped of it's top soils.  Part of the farming strategy is recovering viable pasture land out of a parcel that had been viewed as non-viable.  Topsoil is built up not only by the accumulation of plant leaves and manure, but moreso by the growth and grazing cycles of the grass due to the cattle and poultry.  In a grassland, the greatest source of humus is from decaying roots (which die back to bring stasis with the biomass (i.e. the leaves of grass).  Salatin says that the greatest efficiency of a farm treated as a biological system is health.  For Pollan's final meal, he sought a number of people to assist him in hunting a feral pig,  gathering mushrooms (morels), gathering salt from San Francisco Bay (which he ended up abandoning because of its nastiness), plus various other locally culivated items.  Pollan confronts the ethics of eating meat particularly from the perspective of if one is to eat meat, then one should be able to experience the consequences of the animal's death.  At one point, Pollan's answer to that question is to be a vegetarian.  Ultimately, Pollan is able to eat meat, but one sees him as eating with much greater intention.  Aldo Leopold said, "there is value in any experience that reminds us of our dependency on the soil-plant-animal-man food chain."  Pollan shoots his own wild boar (and ruminates of Hemingway and Jose Ortega y Gasset.  He describes the thrill of the deed and then the guilt, the exhileration and the revulsion.  Ambivalance and ambiguity are a hunter's lot and likely leads to harsh reflection for someone viewing it with great intention.  However, in the same way that it is life-denying to corn-feed cattle for 150 days to create a desirable balance of fat and meat, the act of hunting is clearly life-affirming in preserving a carnivore role and allowing animals that become food to exist with their essential animal character until their death.  What Pollan offers in this book, isn't so much a way of living perfectly as much as pointing out what actually is going on in terms of consequences for these 4 meals.  Specifically, this is addressed by how Pollan himself ended the book.  "We eat by the grace of nature.  What we're eating is never anything more or less than the body of the world. 
 Bringing together an all-star 80's cast, this movie seems to be a mesh of all favorites, or perhaps could be described as an older Breakfast Club. Taking place after a group of friends graduate from college, it deals with the concept of an earlier mid-life crisis, that when you are no longer young, and for the first time, truly on your own. It carries the same air as 80's movies, with its poignant and funny moments, and although it speaks to a slightly older crowd, it can be related to almost any audience. 
 "The Big Show" is a great read for movie (I am) and/or Academy Award (I am not) buffs. Pond provides a detailed backstage look at the "modern Oscars" over one decade, an era that began with the 66th Academy Awards in 1994.   Pond spares no punches as he reports on the show's complexity, the tension between the broadcast network and the Academy, the Academy and the show's producer, the show's producer and the show's public host, and the various talent guilds.   Stories of the people, not only behind the scenes, but also those with public faces (producers, directors, and stars), make the best reading. Readers will be treated to snippets that will certainly reshape their opinion of celebrity and Hollywood.   This most certainly was a "must read" in the movie industry after its publication.  
 To anyone who has wondered why Bono is the way he is, this book pretty much answers any questions you may have had.  He comes across as a very bright and caring person who has a sarcastic wit about him, but who can change gears and get into some fairly deep topics.  You also get to hear why charity is so important to him-the talks on charity were my favorite chapters.  All in all recommended for U2 and Bono fans 
 I thought the Amazon editorial review was very unfair in regards to what he thought of this cd. I'm a big Trace Adkins fan. I got introduced to Trace's music through his Chrome cd and was hooked. He has one of the most amazing, one-of-a-kind male voices in country music today, next to Toby Keith. Trace sounds like no one else. His deep and rich baritone voice has an honesty to it that makes his songs come across with that much more conviction. He can also hit the high notes really good too. When he sings a love song or a song of heartbreak, you know the man means every word! There is nothing artificial about Trace and that is why i love the guy so much. He's an honest, hard-working blue collar man who sings good songs. After hearing the Chrome cd, i went and bought his first cd and this one. I've yet to get his third cd, but will be purchasing it very soon.  I also have his Greatest Hits cd and will be getting his new cd soon also. I enjoy all his cds, though my favorite Trace Adkins cd is Chrome, and i've yet to hear his new cd, which i understand is his best yet. Can't wait to find out! I find that the Big Time cd gets better with each listen. The best track on the cd is The Rest Of Mine. I love when Trace does ballads! But alot of the other songs on the cd are really great. Lonely Won't Leave Me Alone is amazing with the way he hits the high notes for a guy who can sing SO deep with his baritone.  I'm totally thrilled that Trace was recently inducted into the country music hall of fame. This is one country artist who defintely deserves the award. I'm very happy for him!! Way to go, Trace!! You have a fan for life 
 Peter Straub is a literate, intelligent man, who has raised the standards of the horror genre by his involvement with it. His prose reads more like that of Henry James than the pulp fiction hacks too often associated with horror stories. With Straub, sentences never end in prepositions, tenses are never mixed, and (sometimes unfortunately) one word is never used where ten might work as well. One other thing I noticed years ago is that Straub also portrays female characters more realistically than any other male writer I can think of off the top of my head.  I really like Floating Dragon and have read it cover to cover at least three times over the last decade, and also will pick it up a couple times a year and open it at random just to let its vibe affect me, as it is guaranteed to do to anyone. The story here of a wealthy Connecticut suburb called Hampstead, which lies off Long Island Sound, and the series of serial murders with which it is beset with a frequency of about one in every two generations, is augmented by the release of a top secret chemical a local firm is developing on behalf of the Department of Defense. The chemical agent, which escapes to pass directly over the little town of Hampstead, causes severe hallucinations in anyone exposed to it, death in some cases, and in a small percentage of those deaths, the flesh of the afflicted seems to melt from the bone and become a fluffy, slimy ooze. Pretty gory!  In Floating Dragon, the scene is set in the summer of 1980 for a cast of literally a couple thousand characters to survive the presence of both the chemical and the return of a supernatural killer who possesses his chosen agent and then proceeds to become a ripper-killer who leaves his horrendously mutilated victims behind, one after another. A small group, more aware than their fellow townspeople of the dual threats they are all facing, join to find out more about the evils besieging their community. Their research locates records of similar killings from the early 19th century through the 1890's, the 1920's, and the 1950's. They work as one to foil the plan to destroy Hampstead, Connecticut, and around them Straub tells an extended tale of insanity, murder, tragedy and darkness on a scale the likes of which few writers have ever attempted.  This is a dreamy, uneasy, yet pleasing novel that exceeds its author's hopes and successfully brings together a plot of staggering dimensions 
 I must admit that this is the first Hamlet criticism I've ever read, but I was very impressed. The author is deep and thought-provoking and almost humerous at times while considering this work. The book is a bit dense at  times, and tends to make references to other critics that only make sense  if you have read them, but that does not damage the book beyond repair. The  author bringgs up interesting ideas and interpretations, such as the  virgin/whore split in men and Hamlet, that I had never considered before.  This book is worth the time it takes to weed through it 
 I am currently using this book in my Pre-K special education classroom.  It is concise and easy to use.  I am using the terminology not only with the children in my class, but am also having my parents read the book too. The parents like using the same vocabulary that is being used at school.  It is written simply and is not overwheming for the children or their parents. It is fun to play games with the words and it encourages the children to begin using critical thinking. A great way to get your parents involved in classroom learning 
 This book was, at times, painful to read; mind you, this is not because it  was bad.  Far from it, in fact.  Simply put, Fleming's recollections had  great resonance for me, as I suspect they will for many others.  The  honesty and insight I found in the book has stayed with me and will for  some time.  This is nothing short of a masterpiece, and I'm not given to  hyperbole.  (You'll have to trust me on that one.)  Also, I love The  Smiths, which is neither here nor there 
 I mostly liked this book and read it quickly. Hoever I wasn't satisfied with the ending. It left too many questions unanswered and some things just didn't make sense. For example, why was Truscott always following Alex and how did he get all of hs inside information? How could Truscott and Michael Bell know that Alex went to Vermont? How could they end up at the gas station in the rental car without being seen? There were no other buildings around so someone new showing up would be seen. Why wouldn't Alex have heard the shot when Michael Bell killed Truscott. So, basically I liked the book a lot but the ending was a big let down 
    When I bought this book ,I was buying it with my 40 year old son in mind.I thought I would glance at it, and Boy ,am I glad I did.My son enjoys Rock,and even plays a bit of it.I have'nt developed much of a feel for it,but really like Classic Country,Folk,Bluegrass ,Soul,Irish ballads and some Rock and Roll.As a matter of fact,I have heard of The Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia but I didn't even know that Mickey Hart was their drummer.So,I guess I'm really out of my league writing a review on this book;but here goes anyway.  This book bowled me over in a couple of ways.It really convinced me that all music is important and precious.That goes for Hank Williams singing "The First Fall of Snow",Woody Guthrie singing Philadelphia Lawyer,Elvis singing "Love Me Tender",Sinatra singing "New York,New York",Patty Reilly singing "The Town I Love So Well",the music of the Rain Forest,regional and tribal music from around the world, and even my son's Rock.   As a great lover of books,I can't begin to imagine what it would be like if we had nothing that was written prior to 1879.Well,that is exactly what Hart makes us think about,because there is not a single sound that was made befor that date,recorded,and can be replayed today.That thought is mind-boggling;and how many have even given it a thought?   Hart has made major contributions in trying to get the world's music recorded,particularly music from remote areas and cultures.A year or two ago I got the Asch Recordings,Vol.1-4 of Woody Guthrie ,by Smithsonian Folksways Recordings and even though I enjoy it very much,I had no idea what the background of it was--but thanks to this book,I can now appreciate it.   It takes someone with the talent and dedication of Mickey Hart to get involved and is certainly fortunate that he is on the Board of Directors at Smithonian Folksways.    Music and sound are as important as any other aspect of a culture and if not recorded is lost forever. Just think about it ,we have the physical remains of the ancient pyrimids of Egypt to look at or even visit,there are all kinds of written material surviving,but not a single sound of the activity and the songs that must have been sung as they did their work.We dont't have to go back 4000 years;there is not a single battle sound ,music or song surviving from the Civil War.That's why what Mickey Hart has to say in this book is so important 
 Just as a diamond's facets make it shine, At the Bottom of the River is composed of disparate glimpses of brilliance.  Short short stories in a unifying vein of carribean color, these pieces are mystical, sensual and  poetic.  The cadence of Kincaid's language takes hold of you-- you don't  read this book so much as you surf it. . . you breathe it. . . you feel it  resonate within you long after it's over 
 My uncle, Harry Goldsborough, served in CO. F, 2nd Battalion, and I had heard a few stories from my Mother about her brother's experiences in World War Two.  The stories were few and and unpleasant, and I gather that he did not speak much of the war. The reading from this book gave a great insight to where my uncle was during his time in the 80th and what he probably went through. I found the reading very easy and it made me proud of his service to his country.    
 Let me preface this by saying I'm not a very big fan of Jackie Collins, but I LOVE this book.  As you move through 1969 London through the eyes of professional stud Tony Blake, you'll almost feel like you've taken a trip  back in time.  The sex scenes are hot w/o being vulgar, and all the  characters, even the secondary ones, are very well drawn out.  A  scintillating and wonderful trip back in time 
 This is the first novel that I have read by George Eliot and I have to admit that it was not an easy read for me. Many times I found myself having to go back and reread sections in order to better understand them. It took approximately 200 pages for me to gain a feel for Ms. Eliot's style but after that point her writing became much easier to follow and the story so engrossing that I found the rest of the book very difficult to put down!   Middlemarch is a long and complex story about love, duty, ambition and the unfortunate choices made by ordinary people in their desire to become extraordinary, to leave their own special mark on the world. While the novel revolves around several different storylines involving many of the citizens of Middlemarch, two characters in particular and their stories stand out above the rest: Dorothea Brooke, an idealistic young woman who strives to accomplish good works but makes a disastrous error in judgement when  she marries a much older man who is completely unsuitable for her, and Tertius Lydgate, a young doctor who moves to Middlemarch hoping to reform the practice of medicine there and make a name for himself, but who is instead also hindered by an unfortunate alliance to a vain and self-centered woman named Rosamund Vincy. Ms. Eliot moves back and forth between Dorothea and Dr. Lydgate's stories before bringing them together for a very satisfying and masterful ending.  This novel begins and ends with references to St. Theresa of Avila, a Spanish mystic and reformer of the Roman Catholic Church. These passages are some of the most beautiful and profound of the entire book and serve to illustrate Ms. Eliot's message that we do not necessarily need to be a saint or a great reformer in order to make an impact on the lives of those around us. There have been many potential Saint Theresas who, for whatever reason, fell short of realizing their promise and have come and gone with no earthly recognition. But their ordinary lives have intrinsic beauty and value just the same.    One of the most amazing aspects of Middlemarch is that all of its many characters are connected, either by birth or marriage. This turned out to be a bit confusing at times but I was fortunate to find a genealogy chart for the novel on the internet and it proved to be a great help in keeping everyone straight. Again, this is not an easy book to read but it is well worth the extra time and effort. The town of Middlemarch and its inhabitants will stay with you for a long time. Highly recommended 
 Dziga Vertov's film is an amazing and quite daring foray into the realm of experimental cinema (I say this with some reservations -- see below).  The viewer is quite literally transported to the Soviet Union of the past.  We witness love and loss, happiness and sadness, life and death.  We witness the beginning of a day and the end of a day, a wedding and a divorce, a birth and a funeral.  All the scenes are real -- the birth is a real birth, the funeral a real funeral, the divorce a real divorce.  Nationalistic and cultural boundaries begin to fade since the events depicted say more about human nature than they do about a particular people. The music is quite inventive and amazing, especially when one considers that only three young men are performing it.  The editing is some of the most astonishing ever to come out of Soviet silent cinema. That said, there is a somewhat irritating political message that comes forth -- that industrialization will solve the problems of humanity, that those who follow the Party line are the ones depicted as being sober and responsible.  So many people are shocked by Nazi propaganda films such as "Triumph of the Will," -- I find it sad that more people are not troubled by Soviet era films which tout the beauty of Marxist-Leninism while ignoring the carnage and sometimes outright genocide (i.e. the Ukranians)carried out by the Soviets for over seventy years.  The fact of the matter is that Soviet Marxist-Leninism slaughtered millions of people and enslaved millions of others.  This is a troubling hunk of history that is difficult to ignore when watching this otherwise masterful work of filmmaking 
 A thoroughly enjoyable story told through the eyes of Rebecca, and three generations of her dysfunctional, albeit loving family. Family secrets abound in Rebecca's tale; a witty, humourous story rife with 70's and 80's nostalgia and some very memorable characters.  Rebecca's search for passion and meaning in her life is well worth a read.  She is sometimes a rather hapless character, and her cold fish of a husband is totally annoying, but Rebecca will ultimately find what she needs most in some very untraditional and wonderful ways.  
 Good selection of tunes spanning Jerry Lee's entire career until very recently.  Remastering done well. 
 I bought this gift for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas. She has been completely in love with this gift since she opened it. We even bought another house/pet shop and car to attach, although it seems difficult for the three houses to work together. I definitely recommend it! 
 The Tiger Rising is about two kids who meet and try to set a tiger free.The first thing that happens is Rob goes to school, on the bus he gets picked on by two older boys named Billy and Norten Threemonger.There was a knew girl in the class named Sisten Baley. Sisten was named after the Sisten Chapel in Rome Italy. Sisten was a very sassy girl who thought her dad was coming back for her.Also Sisten and Rob went through a lot of things before they were ready to release the tiger.When they released the tiger he hesetated on going out.He also ran off when he finally went out 
 I found this book to be very entertaining and education. Kaku's predictions of how future technology will progress seem to be very accurate. Since this book was written in the late 90s you can already see some of his "predictions" starting to come to pass. I also liked the book because it gives a short introduction to different types of technology that many people may not be familiar with (i.e. nanotechnology). It really sparked my interest and made want to go out and learn more about some of these subjects. Although some of the material is slightly dated, don't let this prevent you from reading the book. Much of the discussion is about the "distant" future (2020-2050 and beyond).   This was the first of Kaku's books I have read, but I intend to read his other. His writing style is very clear and easy to read for the lay person.  
 Of course an excellent book, truely a classic. I have read it to my children and will likey read it again to them and perhaps their children 
 And leave your preconceptions at the door. I'm thankfully free from a lot of tired ideas about art and its significance. While I realize the value of putting all your information into a great big idea-structure, why not just sit this one out and watch? We needn't debate whether Darger's mind was great or small, nor must we pretend that, in our atheist grandeur we have burst past the boundaries of small minded religious faith. The point is clear if you've watched the film that Darger had a very different life and experiences from all of us. He is of a bygone age, and perhaps felt himself to be so even in his time. On the point of religion, one must remember that was a ward of the church, working always for a Catholic hospital, when he was not a ward of the state. Furthermore, it is all quite symbolic. It's an imaginary and mythic world, and to take it so seriously is to miss the point. And to art-critique it comes off quite silly and uptight too!   Darger was not mentally retarded, although unusual in behavior. He may have been "psychologically disturbed" but back then very few options existed for someone in his situation. The poor were not taken care of! Without parents to support him it only makes sense in his day that he would have been sent to this place. So, disregard the "mentally retarded" idea. One must listen, and realize that in different times and among the poor, life was entirely different from what we know now, and quite trying!  Yu animated the pictures and like others here I had a problem with it. It was pleasing to the eye but throughout the film I was confused as to Darger's intentions. I felt that they were corrupted, and for a while thought maybe he'd painted in a style for animation. I still don't understand to what extent they messed with his stuff in order to bring it to life. And the last point I had to make - Yu herself states repeatedly in the interview that Darger created art "for an audience of one." True that during his lifetime he made no effort to share, but I can hardly believe that he did not intend to share with us. He even left behind an autobiography, which helps to make sense of the great saga he wrote.   There is a tender seriousness to all of it, one that rises above the immediate assumptions. I urge you to lay down preconceptions and watch this lovely film about an elusive man and the beautiful imaginary realm within. 
 I love this lamp,  purchased two of them for my bedroom, and the 40 watt minimum candelabra (required) bulbs really create the perfect mild light for the bedside. The only thing i don't like it the switch is on the cord and not the lamp itself. I purchased a 3-way touch dimmer to plug it into, which converts it into a 3 way touch lamp, now i love it even more! FYI... this lamp's picture is a bit deceiving it really is half moon shape and not completely round 
 This book is very similar to another book the author wrote about fitness and dieting. The format is the basically the same with the first 60 pages covering emotional eating and the psychological aspects of dealing with food. The last 30 pages is a survey of current diets such as Atkins, Weight Watchers and others. The middle of the book includes a lot on specific weight-lifting exercises and aerobics. A concept I really like is the 5 Simple Eating Rules, which can be harder than you think. I also appreciated the very descriptive tables outlining the whole 12 week program of exercises. I gave 4 stars because I could have done without the emotional eating and diet survey sections. All that said, it's well written and motivating 
 I bought this book as a NY resolution and LOVE it.  My husband and I read from it before we go to bed and on long road trips stemming deep conversations.  We feel exhilarated, educated, and much more.  Regardless of personal beliefs, this book explains the Bible in our generation's terms, meaning a churchless many (including myself).  This book makes it fun and easy to learn about the Bible.  
 Neuske's Bacon is simply the most divine bacon eating experience you'll ever have.  Smoked in Wisconsin over applewood, it is delectable, luscious even.  They cut it lean so that there is no rubbery, fatty bits like you find in store-bought brands, yet they leave enough in to give it that robust flavor.  It is worth noting that America's Test Kitchen did a Taste Test of Bacon, in which Neuske's was a participant.  It did NOT come out as No.1, because tasters thought it was "too smoky".  If you like smoky bacon like I do, that sounds like crazy talk, and you should definitely try this bacon.  The results of the taste test indicates to me that there are those who prefer their bacon less smoky, and I suppose that if you are one of those people, you may not like this bacon after all (even thought it is the best ever).  Be careful though: once you eat Neuske's and love it, you won't be satisfied with store-bought ever again 
 Phil Janou proves once his admirable gifts as Director thanks to his powerful visual narrative and daring shot angles.   In this case, a retired cop is an involuntary witness of an airplane crash that almost kills him and his wife since they were fishing in a sunny day. Without thinking it twice, he drowns to save possible survivors and gets to rescue a lovely child. This fact will be the dramatic overture which will work out as a violent premise that will be related with dealers. Violent and very effective thriller. Baldwin is superb, but Jill Stuart Matheson didn't achieve the expected results, she looks like some distant and inexpressive of this secondary character.      
 A former reporter, columnist, and editor for the Taste section of the 'Star Tribune', Ann L. Burckhardt has written or edited more than twenty-five books on food - including the original edition of the "Betty Crocker Cooky Book". So she brings a very special expertise to "Hot Dish heaven: Classic Casseroles From Midwest Kitchens" where she has compiled an impressive collection of mouth-watering, palate-pleasing, appetite satisfying, kitchen-cook friendly recipes showcasing what the casserole can do ranging from ordinary family meals to gourmet dishes fit for even the most elegant celebratory dining event. The recipes (ranging from Old Standby Hamburger and Rice Bake, to Satisfying Shepherd's Pie, to Beef Chow Mein Hot Dish, to Mom's Bread Pudding) are grouped into seven sections; Casserole Classics; Round the World in a Casserole Dish; Comfort Foods for Busy Days; Hot Dishes for Potlucks and Church Suppers; Satisfying Side Dishes; Breakfast and Brunch Casseroles; and Warm, Wonderful Desserts. Enhanced with two appendices featuring 'Cream Sauce' and 'Pastry Crust', as well as an informative introduction by Karal Ann Marling, "Hot Dish Heaven" is a simply wonderful addition to any family cookbook shelf, and a 'must' for the community library culinary collection 
 This book is a wonderful read and performs a great service for those of us who don't necessarily have the same tastes as the men in charge of wine recommendations (Forgive me Laurie Daniels and Jancis Robinson.)  We buy most of the wine, yet almost all critics are men.  So, here is a group of women we should promote and support.  I love wine, but I don't necessarily like the recommendations of Robert Parker and the Wine Spectator.   (Is it because we have more taste buds and are more sensitive to some of the tannic monsters created by many male winemakers?) Now, I'm going to look for the wines these women create. Kudos to all of them and to Deborah Brenner for such a great book! 
 I am a student pilot working on my private pilot's license and have been wrestling with my own fears and anxiety while flying solo.  A friend got me this book for Christmas, and the stories have been so riveting and inspirational - now I can't wait to go flying again!  What sets this book apart is the quality of the writing and the storytelling - each of the authors/writers in this compilation is skilled not only in flying but with the written word!  Excellent, I cannot recommend this book highly enough! 
 As an MBA professor of creativity management, I will use this book in my next semester. It is a delightful read and I heartily recommend it for readers seeking to expand their minds and the application of their creativity 
 Listen to "All the Way" then listen to "Just like Heaven" by the Cure. The bass lines are almost identical 
 I debated a long time on whether or not I should buy the product. I decided to get it and I'm 100 percent glad I did. In fact, I wish I would have purchased it sooner. For me, this was worth it 
 Yet another case of man's inhumanity to fellow beings. The story is a fiction, but could very well be a true one. Yakov Bok is a remarkable character who hung on to dear life, even in instances where the average person would have just given up. Bibikov brought some beam of hope into Bok's life, only to be taken too soon - an example of hope being shattered in the most desperate of situations. Familiar? The story was well written and is easy to relate to. It's a fiction that is consistant with historical facts. It is highly reminiscent of Nazi Germany and the experiences of Jews in general all over the world. Most admirable, however, was the relationship between Bok and Shmuel (his father-in-law). This book is a must-read 
  yes it is true,if you can read you can cook french.Julia and frendshave made it most easy to cook the french way and enjoy it 
 Vertebrate Life would serve as an excellent upper-level college textbook to anyone interested in becoming informed about vertebrates.  Professionally, I am a physicist, who after visiting the American Museum of  Natural History's Hall of Vertebrates, wanted to learn more about the  subject.  Even after reading Vertebrate Life, I don't think that I could  point out the squamate bone on a fossilized skull.  On the other hand, with  733 pages, it is unfair to critize this book about a lack of coverage!  The  authors provide several pages of excellent references at the end of each  chapter.  So, if I really wanted to be able to identify a squamate bone,  I'm sure that I could have found out from one of references.   However, I  was troubled by a number of typos, some of the them serious.  Figure 15-3  appears to have the second half of the figure repeated as the first half.   It would have been nice to see missing illustrations.  Figure 3-6b  identifies the Otic capsule as "Optic capsule" at one point.   This confused me for a while. Even with all this, I was fascinated by what  I read, and read the entire book, cover to cover, all 733 pages worth. For  the serious student of our natural world, I would recommend spending full  price for this book, and plan on spending more than a few hours with it 
 Fran's passion for chocolate definitely shows throughout the book. I have made three of the recipes (so far) and all have been big successes.  The chocolate cake torte was divine as were the truffles and base for hot chocolate (or just spoon eating out of the bowl in my case).  The book is very precise and the recipes appear to be well tested for the home cook.  I even tempered chocolate for the first time with success following her directions clearly detailed in the book.  The only fault I can find is that not every recipe has a picture which would be inspiring and helpful, though many of the recipes do have pictures.  It is a beautiful book and should be on every chocolate lover's cookbook rack or living room table. I find myself returning to her book for fail safe recipes even over the Chocolate Bible and The Art of Chocolate. 
 In this modern world, it's hard for us to see how the "wild people live.  The People of Kau showed how the people tattooing, hunting, fighting, & dressing up etc.  They're the really collectiable pics.   Just Buy it..... 
 Girlfriend is a classic and maybe one day he will top it; 100% is real close - albeit much different in sound. The guitars are great especially on Sick of Myself, We're the Same and Get Older. We're the Same was also one of the best videos of the year. Kimi Ga Suki is the third best album 
 This book recounts in full details the idealism and ultimate sacrifice of the Germans, ethnic Germans and European volunteers in the Korps which fought to stem the Red Bolshevic hordes from the cradle of civilization. 
 My almost 2 1/2 year-old son is crazy for Thomas! This was his first train set and he loves it! The tracks are easy to connect for him. The only down side I would say is that the cars do tend to fall off the tracks somewhat easily. But he has no problem re-attaching the cars by their magnets and getting Thomas and friends going again. Great product, and a good price 
 No fair to compare any Fields to `69 Love Songs' - very few things in the rock and roll annals in our lifetime will come close - and I was hesitant to forgive the gimmicky all-the-words/songs-start-with-an I or I, but with Stephen Merritt, you can't assume anything ploy-ish.  This is simply beautiful.  Frangible and tenacious at the same time, heart wrenching and funny, irony abounds.  And as averse as I am willing to call it a `gay' standard, `It's Only Time' could/should be a defining moment in the fight for a basic human right.  Hear that, Dubya? My grade: A 
 Jonathan Safran Foer and Alan Elsner are commonly inspired by their Ukrainian travels seeking WWII ancestry info...Foer to write pulsating drama and Elsner to expose human tragedy.  "There but for the grace of God, go I" writes Rush Limbaugh on his drug addictions.  Many hundreds of thousands of Americans, however, are in prison today for the possession of one or two ounces of marijuana.  A May 2005 page-1 piece in the Wall Street Journal points out that US prison populations have quadrupled to 2+ million Americans since 1980, and it's all about drugs, and much of it is about marijuana.  If the $40 B prison business bothers you...get Alan Elsner's 'Gates of Injustice' If the 'politics of prisons' bothers you...read Elsner's book. If recidivism bothers you...buy this book. If you'd like to hear from the inmates themselves, from the prison guards, from the probation officers, from the police and the judiciary, themselves...read 'Gates of Injustice'. If you'd like to reach out and advocate for a more sane system with your state-wide Judiciary Committee or Governor, and need more info...I would sincerely & heartenly recommend Alan Elsner's 'Gates of Injustice: The Crisis in America's Prisons' 
 Livin Proof got slept on harder than the floor at Central Bookings and ain't nothin' harder than a clear coated stone floor! This is one of my favorite albums for two reasons. Reason one: This is arguably Premier's best produced album to date. Reason two: Although Group Home aren't the nicest n!$$az on Earth (Malachi is borderline wack, sorry!)the Brooklyn/Bronx combo manages to win you over as they take you on a lyrical cab ride through the streets of New York. In fact, Lil Dap, who you may remember from Gangstarr's "Speak Ya Clout" and "I'm The Man" is actually  pretty deep with poignant lines like "I'm not about killing my people but you know how it go/work wit' me not against me and we'll make mad dough" from the combustible  single "Living Proof". Standout cuts include "Life in The Inner City", "Superstar", "The Realness" and my favorite, "Up Against the Wall (remix)". Pony up the scratch to cop this album; a must have for the boom bap enthusiast.  If not for the realness that the Group Home bring to the michael (that's a microphone to my retarded crew), then for Primo's flawless production. Did I mention that the beats were hard 
 You feel like a kid again when you get these small treasures to read. Treasure Island is one of those little books that you have to read. I read it as a child and you don't appreciate them as much then as you do now looking at the book and thinking back to when you first read it. Now I want my kids and someday my grandchildren to read it, too. It's a great gift to start a little ones library with. 
 It's a great book with suspense in every page! However it is not for kids. 
 Great story, reads very well.  Very hard to put down.  It's also a very different concept from most books i've read.  
 Those of us who love our kitties to an almost "nutty" degree will appreciate the psycho cats depicted here!  Another book with humorous cats worth having is Henry Beard's "French For Cats: All the French Your Cat Will Ever Need;" Bob Walker would no doubt like to have a few pictures of a cat with Le Trombone (the wild paperclip)!  
 In my consulting career, I have worked on lots of models to value M& A candidates, to restructure debt, to perform due diligence etc. My main problem was that I always found it difficult to get a good reference book on valuation. Most books just give the basics of DCF and treat valuation in a straightforward manner.  Arzac's book on the other hand treats valuation from a practical and theoretical perspective and is supported by research evidence. I found his book to be very helpful as it contained the different types of valuation tools and arrangements commonly found in practice i.e. adjusted present value, earnouts, original issue discount, synergies and scenario analysis, contingent clauses, entry, foothold and exit options etc. I am an engineer by training so I found the technical notes at the end of the book to be very handy. In addition, the CD accompanying Arzac's textbook is very useful as it provided many essential valuation tools such as option pricing, debt capacity calculator etc. I highly recommend this book to anyone with a serious interest in corporate finance, consulting and investment bankin 
 I had a great time at this movie a few people out of the movie and throw up.I think that's the sign of a fun film.I enjoy how it related everything to the rest of the Saw movies. I think all the clues that were set up in this movie for "Saw 4" are sick.I could wait for the next movie 
 I bought Lee's CD last week...and I haven't stopped playing it since!   This CD is pure GOLD!  Grammy Gold!  There are 18 voices on this CD which make this the most sought after collaborated effort....truly an ensemble to behold!!!  MAGIC HAS HAPPENED AND THIS DOESN'T COME ALONG BUT ONCE IN A LIFETIME!  Lee Lessack's voice brings you to a place of serene happiness and he truly makes you believe the words to your very soul! The brillance of his soft soothing vocals can only leave you with a smile from ear to ear.  This CD is a MUST HAVE for anyone who loves music.  If you never heard the name "Lee Lessack", after one spin of this CD., you will never forget his name!    "In Good Company" is alive and fresh, and just what everyone needs right NOW!  All the singers should stand up and take a bow and Lee...enjoy the applause....you will be hearing it for years to come!  This CD is breathtaking, beautiful and your are destined for all the accolades the Music Industry can bestow upon you....THIS IS THE ONE.....!  This CD may be a "Sweet Mystery" to some, but "May I Suggest" a toast...."Here's To You"...with "Summer Wine".  All of your fans will remain here with "Open Arms" and after hearing the music...we will be with you "For Good"....!  Bravo Lee....!    Love, Maureen Mahoney....x 
 Peter Dale Scott tells us up front that his purpose is not to use the evidence to pinpoint the killer(s) but to illustrate deep politics.  He mentions planting of evidence in various ways to paint Lee Harvey Oswald as part of a Communist conspiracy and as a lone-nut.  Also discussed is the Oswald as double-agent idea, establishing a record of the mail-order purchases when guns were readily available locally and the difference between Marina Oswald's testimony and the official record.  Scott also mentions the 100 names missing from an index of Jack Ruby's acquaintances. These names provided a negative template of organized crime and those with corrupt political backgrounds purposely deleted from official records. There are many other examples of suspicious activity cited. Hoover and the FBI figured prominently, though not alone in the fancy footwork and public relations (media) that made this at least temporarily satisfying to everyone that all was well as the killer was identified.  Peter Dale Scott's investigation and writing is thorough, intelligent and thought provoking.  By the way, at the time of writing this book, Scott named three senior FBI officials most likely to be Deep Throat and one of them was correct, as we have recently found out.        
 This book is the most daunting first hand account of the Gulag that I have read.  Voices from the Gulag and Through the Whirlwind are also well-written accounts.  Man is Wolf caputures the brutal experience with power and eloquence.  From a literary standpoint it is a simple read but from a human perspective it is devastating.  I had to stop reading on anumber of occasions to keep from being in enveloped by the horror of the book.  This book will change your perspective on human nature, WWII and Eastern Europe 
 This is a charming story with interesting characters - including, incredibly, the great bard Talesien - and a story line that doesn't race, but never drags for a moment.  Tamson House and its mysteries are some of de Lint's best, the characters interesting and nuanced (well, mostly - de Lint doesn't seem able to craft a convincing policeman), and the great swooping confrontations between forces of good and evil - and sometimes between good and good - are carried off well.  It has everything you can reasonably ask for in a good fantasy novel.  Fans of de Lint's later work can safely buy this one without disappointment, and if you've never touched one of his books, this is a nice one-off or a good introduction to an excellent body of work.  Seekers of hidden knowledge will find some things of interest here, as well.  If you become enamoured of the weirdin discs introduced in this book, be sure to visit his web site and let him know 
 The authors write about the key factors involved in doing well in the  market--a person's psychological state of mind. Although technique and  tactics are important the trader's psychology is paramount. This is a basic  text for anyone who trades equities or futures 
 I am a huge fan of catchy, quiet folk music with insightful lyrics. If you enjoy this album then I strongly recommend that you check out the following:  1) Ghosts Of The Great Highway by Sun Kil Moon 2) Kings Avenue Joe Kile 3) Subtitulo by Josh Rous 
 Science fiction has always strived to reveal something about human nature, and this disturbing book achieves this goal like no other.  It casts a new light upon what it is people really want, and what happiness really means;  it makes one question some of one's deep values and beliefs. Quite some  time after this book a sequel was published, "The Humanoid  Touch".  It is just as disturbing, partially because having read the  first novel, I think the point of view of the author, or perhaps better,  the 'implied author' has changed.  This in no way decreases the value of  the books, which are a must for any sci-fi reader 
 The book follows the first twenty years of Hayslip's life, beginning in the Vietnamese village of Ky La.  The United States/Vietnam war begins early in her life, and she discovers that her centrally located village is stuck in the middle.  By day the villagers are technically controlled by the U.S./Republican force, and threatened to ensure their loyalty, but by night the Viet Cong attacks and claims the village for their own, a process which is reversed the next day.  The villagers try to pacify each side, and many are destroyed by both.  Hayslip tells her family's story- they alternatively first for and are attacked by the Viet Cong, depending on the changes in the wind.  Quote: "The least you did- the least any of us did- was our duty.  For that we must be proud."  I liked this book very much.  Although I sometimes found it difficult to keep abreast of the movements back and forth in time, it generally fit together fairly well.  Hayslip does not blame either side for the war- in fact, she is attempting to make both sides understand one another better- despite the fact that she suffered brutally from both.  Instead, she tells her story to share the futility of war to get the average person what they really want in life: family around them, lasting love, watching children grow old- peace 
 My friend Tommy who I work with at the Shelter reccomended this to me - he is a gay individual - Now I don;t judge, after all that I have been through in my life - with drugs and pills and whiskey, so I am his friend even though I don't understand his state.  But he said I might get some joy out fo this book - I am recently single, after leaving my husband Rick, who was terribly emotionally abusive.  Tommy said that this book was the original single girl's guide.  But what it really was was a story of a bunch of sad, hopelessly used and abused women.  Even the pretty one is emtionally abused over and over by almost everyone she runs across in the book.  I used tobe pretty once too and I know  what she went though.  I lost my looks from all the worry and wear and tear - I coudl never use the car to go anywhere - Rick hid the keys from me when he was at work - I found his first hiding place - in the sugar canister - but then he put them somewhere else .  So I got a lot of sun damage walking everywhere - I think the drugs also made my skin more sensitive.  We didn;t have books like this or watch R-rrated movies in my house when we were growing up.  My mother was strict and didn;t allow it.  We were alwasy church goers - until the misunderstading with the pastor - and then things were kind of a free-for-all .  But this book is no good for WOMEN.  It makes EMOTIONAL ABUSE seem glamourous.  And it is not.  I know.  neither is drug abuse.  And the book is too expensive.  I am on public assistance and 12 is alot for a paperback 
 "Turn on the Bright Lights" is a great album, but I don't think this band has achieved the level of greatness as of yet to merit a 200+ page-turner 
 The Rose by any name is always the same.  This book is everything the "DaVinci Code" pretended to be.  And oh so very very much more.  The DaVinci Code is stale pop rocks to Eco's exquisite cannoli. Cannoli dolci, rivetingly rich and complex. But your palate has to be ready for the experience- if all you've known is pop rocks, you won't taste it well.  You may be overwhelmed.    Umberto Eco is an Italian professor of semiotics and esoterica, as well as a sometime novelist. This book is his pulp masterpiece, one which will persist and translate down generations, becoming a minor classic to equal triumphs such as Ben Hur, the Scarlet Pimpernel, or the Four Feathers. Like those other pulp classics, The Name of the Rose already has one film version made of it - One starring Sean Connery & Christian Slater. See it, it's good, but nowhere as sweet as the book. Mark this: Hollywood being as creatively bankrupt as it is, this glorious story will be revisited.   In any case, unlike those books, Eco's is heavily levened with philosophic and historical references, which if you pursue them, will  - no joke - give you at least a semester's worth of quality undergraduate education in the humanities.    To the story:  Umberto's hero, Brother William, is a Franciscan monk in the mold of St. Bonaventure & Roger Bacon, one of those early mystical empiricists for whom light - and hence the entire material world which was revealed in it  - was a testament of the Living God Whom illumines all things, and Who clarifies all thought.    This same science - Bacon's empiricism, and the Franciscans' fascination with optics (manifested especially in an obsession with grinding lenses, as Br. William has in the book) feeds the rise of modern astronomy, and hence Brahe, Kepler, Copernicus & Galileo.   The book begins with William's novice Adso, narrator of the story,  quoting the first verse of the Gospel of St. John: "In the beginning was the Word.. and the Word was God."  In the ensuing narrative, set in one of those grand medieval monasteries which translated classical thought - Greek, Latin & Hebraic - unto the Germans, thus creating the modern world; the monastery along with its library (one of the largest collections of manuscripts in late medieval Europe) is burnt to the ground.    Thus the word is set alight, consumed, and then extinguished.  The skeins of vellum (skin, or flesh) upon which the scribes inscribed the knowledge were thus reduced to ash, dust.  To nothing.  Meaning disintegrated, annihilated.  Returned to dust.  Embers left frigid, encased in icy Alpine snows.   The fact that William, a student of that other seminal Franciscan influence on modern science, William of Occam (Occam's Razor ring a bell?) uses empirical methods to discern who commits this atrocity, and all the other crimes committed in the story, is significant.  For, even though William is an exquisite scientist, in the end it is all fruitless. The criminal escapes human justice, and human truth is annihilated.  It is all fleeting, insubstantial.    Adso ends his story with a modified quote from St. Bernard of Clairvaux: "Stat rosa pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus," which means : "The Rose stands in its ancient name, naked names are all we have."  (In St. Bernard's original, the word "Rosa" was written "Roma,"  I believe.. But what ever could have Holy Bernard meant by that???  How strange..  Seriously.. the Middle Ages were so very very much more interesting than what they will ever teach you in school.  Catholic triumphalism, Protestant black legends, and secularist sneering aside.  If you want to understand the modern world, what & who we are, understand  Bernard.  Whatever was the problem he had with Abelard, anyway?)        In any case: "nomine nuda tenemus" - This is nominalism.  The rejection of the universal; of mystical integral sacramental unity in things.  It is nihilistic, an assertion that destroyed things leave only names.  That they have no transcendent reality in themselves.  As Abelard said "Nulla rosa est."  Names finally point to nothing.  This is an implicit denial of the eternally present apocalypse, the present parousia, of reality.  Of  sacramental grace.  Of the Church.  Of the Eucharist.  It is nascent protestantism.  Which is to say incipient secularism; sterile rationalism.  It is the annihilation of mystery, enlightenment by which nothing is to be understood.    There is a direct untrammeled line of descent from this failure of medieveal scholasticism to the consubstantial eucharistic theology and textual fetischism of the "Reform," then to Cartesian dualism & rationalism, and ultimately to the enfeebled wordgames of Derrida & Co.    But ignore all that - mere nihilism for fools.  Faith is not rooted in some sterile text.  The Word did not become book, contrary to what the Muslims, Protestants & "Post Modernists" profess (if "Post Modernists" could profess anything ontologically at all..)    No.  He became man, His crucified flesh now transfigured, transcendent, the Seed from which springs a new creation.  There is no flame more fierce than the purgatorial flame of Pentecost; flesh of that flame cannot be consumed.  For the Bush still burns.  Bare your feet & souls.    I am Who am.  From this assertion, all meaning springs.  Every word.   For our knowledge of the Rose is a supra-rational, dare I say Mystical, experience.   Adso's name is a pun off "Ad Simplicio,"  Simplicio being Galileo's Aristotilean foil in his seminal "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems."  This is where Galileo destroys the Ptolemaic cosmology associated with, and defended by Aristole, the master of the Scholastics.  Adso plays Thomas Aquinas (theologian) disciple to William's Albert the Great (naturalist/scientist) master.  Though Adso & William were Franciscan & Aquinas & Albert Domincans, they all four were Aristotileans, all scholastics.  But (ironically) the "scientist" teaches the "theologian," in both cases.  And after intense experiences, both Adso & St. Thomas come to question their rationalistic approach.  Both theologians come to doubt their knowledge.  As Aquinas so famously said of his work: "It's all straw."  So too the aged, nearly blind Adso pens his final line about the Rose.    The Aristotileans are thus undone, not by science (which is far more teleologically frustrated - questions of what orbits where or how fast physical bodies fall will be irrelevant when you are dead) but by the Mystery.  The modern world is a product of Aristotle as communicated, interpreted and critiqued by Muslims such as Ibn Sina & Ibn Rushd; and the Church..  Many might scoff at that assertion, but it is true.  Science is nothing but  categorigization, and logic, empiricism and applied mathematics and cataloguing.   All Aristotle.   Galileo can try to disassociate himself, like a teenager complaining about the old man to a therapist, but he still owes it all to him.    The epistemological problem though is this:  the categories and figures are ours.  And so by definition finally indistinct.  The rose doesn't give a damn what we call it, or of how many molecules it is made.  The Rose is what she is.    Next time you run into Sam Harris or Richard Dawkins ask them for their empirical proof that YWH doesn't exist.    Punny, eh?  Anyway...    So when you read Umberto's story remember that he is riven by all this.  Like Brother Adso he is tempted by nihilism.  Yet he still believes, but knows it is contre l'esprit de l'age, and he's too hip to say it vividly.  So he couches it in Masonic haze.  Don't be fooled, though.  He knows the score.  I only pray he keeps it.     
 Despite some unevenness , this album and its accompanying book are a drive-time hit in our household - amazing considering my kids are 10 and 11 - oh, and a baby, who probably doesn't get all the subtleties, but enjoys the music nonetheless.  Our favourites include: ~Bad Babies ~The Crabby Song ~Tropical Sand ~O, Lonely Peas... which my daughter and I enjoy belting out together!  Others are not as popular, and we sometimes find ourselves fast forwarding through them... such as: ~Rhinoceros tap (particularly the instrumental version) ~Dinosaur round  We are mixed on songs like Bad Babies and Turkey Love Song - I like them, but the kids don't quite "get" the jazzy vocals, I think.  Our "greatest hit" from this album has got to be So Long Doggies, which is just the cleverest, funniest, well-sung thing I have heard for children in all my years of being a parent.  Little kids won't catch all the references, but my big kids LOVE them!  ("BONE voyage...")  Despite these unevennesses, this album makes a great change from all the commercialized kiddie schlock out there.    If you want something you can all sing along to and not have to worry about what kinds of influences your kids are being exposed to, grab this delightfully innocent album and be prepared to sing your heart out 
 If you're looking for a very practical, solidly Catholic , down-to-earth guide to marriage and/or raising children (i.e. Parenting with Grace...), Gregory Popcak's books are for you.  He has a solid foundation in Catholic theology and a real talent for writing.  His books are easy to understand, highly useful and a delight to read.  I especially recommend giving For Better...Forever and Parenting with Grace as a wedding gift to young couples. Such a gift is not only unique, but highly useful and practical.  It's a gift that you know will keep on giving in the most important way...bringing Catholic couples and families closer to God's glory 
 Norman Podhoretz was a New York intellectual in the 1950's-60's, once editor of Commentary magazine. A left-leaning writer then, in the early 70's he began leaning right and became one of the "founding fathers" of neoconservatism. He was an anti-Communist who rebelled against the anti-American bent of the 60's radicals. (The thought of Jane Fonda all decked out in her love beads sitting down with the North Vietnamese leadership to trash all things American still gives neocons the heebie-jeebies.)   This was when he began breaking with old friends, such as the ones named in the book's title. Most of these people (taken from Podhoretz's viewpoint) are not very pleasant. (Is there anything more vicious than an intellectual scorned?) But Podhoretz is very much on the defensive, and like the "lady who protests too much," makes the reader wary. Whether you go along with his politics or not, I thought it was a pretty interesting book anyway 
 Excellent paper for anything you want to print, the colors are amazing and the paper takes well loads of ink 
 This book was fantastic.  I didn't expect it to turn out the way it did, but I was still very pleased.  Dean is one of my favorite authors and he has a big imagination.  I couldn't put the book down. The main characters were life like to me, I shared both Jim and Holly's pain.  I love reading a book that makes me feel like I am part of the characters 
 THE ONLY THING THAT I CAN SAY IS THAT YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICES ON THESE BOOKS FROM AMAZON.  THEY WERE MY FAVORITES AS A KID AND NOW I GET TO ENJOY THEM ALL OVER AGAIN WITH MY OWN CHILDREN 
 I echo the many other praises for this study Bible.  However, I did want to note one particular positive that I think really distinguishes this study Bible from many others.  Other reviewers have commented on the quality of the Introductions, Outlines, and Commentary Notes - and again, I echo those sentiments.  But I would like to point out something I discovered that keeps me coming back to this Bible's commentary notes.    - Each book of the Bible has its own, very extensive, Outline - which is always contained in a grey-shaded box after all the Introductory material.  This helps the Outline to stand out, but not too much.    - However, each level of the Outline, no matter how much of a sub-level it may actually be in the Outline (e.g., II., C. 1., c., (4) in Isaiah = vss. 35:1-10, titled, "The Wonder of Returning to Zion") is always addressed in the Commentary Notes at the bottom of the page introducing that section of Scripture.  I have found this feature to be nothing short of outstanding.  It acts as an anchor, always bringing the reader back to the overall context of the book.  Brief comments remind the reader of how this upcoming section of scripture fits into the overall structure of the book.  I love this feature!  I wish more study Bibles implemented this feature consistently.  It would greatly aid in facilitating a contextual understading of the text.  Often readers get lost in the hodge-podge of notes contained at the bottom of the page in their study Bibles.  Don't get me wrong, these notes are very valuable at clarifying specifics of a particular verse, etc.  The NIV Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible contains all these types of notes as well.  And as other reviewers have noted, they tend to be pretty meaty and promote a well-rounded perspective on the item being commented on.  But in addition, this particular study Bible also contains these Outline level notes that really help the reader to anchor themselves contextually.  This Bible is a very worthy investment.  I only gave it 4 Stars, however, due to the following shortcomings:  - the font size is very small (similar to the Life Application Bible) - the paper has a slight sheen to it, creating a slight reflection in certain lighting; this can make the small font difficult to read, especially for aging eyes (the same common complaint about the Macarthur Study Bible)  To end on another positive: the text is single-column - which I think again aids in reading contextually 
 Top 10 Reasons You Should Buy This Book  This is an excellent and fun book.  A buddy and I used to sit in a greasy spoon diner and make our own lists of top 10's - like the top 10 bands we liked, top 10 girls of TV/film, top 10 everything - so I've always been a fan of lists.  This book brings you to that place. Just hanging with a buddy (who happens to know absolutely everything about boxing) and having a blast, making the most fantastic, eccentric and interesting lists about boxing and boxers.  This is a great and fun book of top 10's of boxing - just like the title says the top 10 book of champs, chumps and punch drunk palookas - really everything in between. You will not be disappointed.  It's fun, entertaining, enjoyable and educational.   A must have for any and every boxing fan. 
 mr. ellis is one of my favorite non-fiction prose writers (up there with lytton strachey, alison weir, and nick tosches). I buy any book with his name on it, but this is my favorite of his. a great book about the country's founding fathers. highly recommended to anyone who loves history. kudos to the author 
 I recommend this book.  I couldn't take my eyes off it since the first page, this is the most touching book i've ever read.  
 I really like this, I started drumming that day and could do it with clear understanding.  He also goes through the video slow and precise so that the beginner can undersand a lot about drums, not only where to hit and when.  I wish it were longer but I will try to find more in this series.  I also bought 2 others that are not nearly as informational as this video 
 I am among those who describe J. D. Salinger as America's least-heard-from, most-missed-author.  I don't know why he stopped writing.  Maybe he thought he had said all he had to say.  And in these "Nine Stories," he certainly said it all, and so eloquently.  My favorite three stories are (in descending order):  "A Perfect Day for Bananafish"; "After the War with the Eskimos"; and "Pretty Mouth and Green My Eyes."  "Bananafish" speaks for itself.  After reading "Franny and Zooey" (certainly the most brilliant treatise on Christianity ever written, my apologies to C. S. Lewis) and "Raise High the Roofbeams, Carpenters", I understood why certain people (like Seymour Glass) are just too beautiful for this world.  "After the War with the Eskimos" can't help but touch the heart of anyone who ever loved Holden Caulfield.    "Pretty Mouth and Green My Eyes" inspired me to write a story which, I fear, is terribly derivitive.  My characters sound a lot more like "The Sopranos" than J. D.'s upper-crusty New Yorkers, but the pathos is the same.  Salinger understands the human heart.  Maybe that's why he is so silent 
 I enjoyed reading Zeises's new novel. Seattle was a great female narrator and was more than a character on paper. She was real, easily relatable since she obviously wasn't perfect.  Critter was even more fun. He acted exactly like I'd think a boy his age would. The fun part was seeing into his mind. His little quirks and reading along with his embarrassing moments.  And I laughed out loud more than once and really felt for the characters till the end. I definitely recommend 
 Firstly, I'd like to point out that the Editorial, though good, has it's facts wrong. This is the OVA parts 1 and 2, which came first. (The series more familiar to fans is probably the 26 episode TV series.) Note: OVA are a direct to video deal in Japan, but without the negative connotations associated with them in the US.  And currently a third part to the OVA is being released in Japan, so this could be considered a work in progress.  Although it has it's faults, I like the OVA the best of the differrent incarnations of Tenchi Muyo!. The emphasis on lineage and the past help to give the audience a better understanding of the motivations of the characters. 
 This book of maps, while expensive, is so much better than those cheap maps being carried by all of the convenience stores and gas stations that there's no comparison. If anything, the level of detail is overwhelming. There's no better way to plan a trip on the less-travelled roads of Oregon 
 Normally I do not read Stephen King novels, but this one was recommended to me as being of a very different nature than the rest of his books.  This is indeed the case, as this is mostly a straight up fairy tale adventure.  It is the story of a royal sibling rivalry, a evil sorcerer, and loyal friends.  More than that, it is King's view of human nature.  King several times ephasizes that some people act completely differently when they think that they are not being seen by anyone, and this watching someone who thinks that they are not being watched plays a large role in the story.  King manages to keep the level of apprehension high through the whole book, in so doing making it a book that is hard to put down once you have started.  I think that the ability to do this is a mark of a good author, and I doubt many people would argue that King is not a good author, whether one likes his normal genre or not.  If you are not a King fan, I think that this book will surprise you.  I have not read King before, and this was not at all what I was expecting a King novel to be like.  I am told that this is because it is not at all like what King's other novels are like.  It is unfortunate that he went back to writing horror novels after he wrote this, as this is a very good book and I would have liked to read more that were similar in nature.  Overall grade:  A 
 My heart sank lower and lower with each successive chapter. This is certainly not a book one can read while couching comfortably on a sofa. If you are familiar with Cambodian history of the Khmer Rouge regime, this book is indeed a chilling read. But at the same time, one can't help feeling admiration for the author's fortitide in the face of unimaginable hardship and horror 
 Peckinpah's "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid" is a rich, haunting, yet demanding work that, above everything else, sees Billy as a creature of his day and age...   He is by no means made a wholly sympathetic character, but who was sympathetic in the New Mexico of 1881? Peckinpah has most of his characters dyed with violence and sniffing the prevailing air of corruption--the chief protagonists, their filthy henchmen, even the onlookers...   Where and what is the law? No one seems to know or care... Garrett and Billy have seen both sides, like almost everyone else...  And among the confusion and violence that is the legacy of range war there is no gleam of purifying light in the efforts we see being made to clean up the territory... The powers that be want Billy out of New Mexico, not for ethical reasons, but rather so that things can be neatly protected for the approaching business exploitation...  Garrett is the man made sheriff to hunt him down and thereby the man who compromises . . . 'This country's getting older and I aim to grow old with it ... there's an age in a man's life when he has to consider what's going to happen next.'  But Billy can't compromise... It's not his way... "Billy, they don't like you to be so free!" proclaims the Bob Dylan theme song, summing up why the power men find Billy so irritating... Perhaps that's why Garrett who has sold out to power is in some ways a reluctant hunter... He salutes Billy's spirit--his very own personal declaration of independence--but he knows it's not the spirit of the new times...  It says much for Peckinpah's way with actors that he gets such admirable performances out of the comparatively inexperienced Kris Kristofferson, as Billy, and Bob Dylan, as Billy's mate... It says just as much for his Westerns perceptiveness that he relies even more heavily on experience... The well-tried James Coburn is both solid and hard to define as Garrett... And then there are the others who know their way around Westerns so well--Katy Jurado, Slim Pickens, R. G. Armstrong, Jason Robards, Jack Elam, Chill Wills... There's not a single performance here that isn't a rounded-off portrait in its own right...  It all adds up to a richness in characterization that is matched by the richness of marvelously composed scenes in which interiors and exteriors alike have been put together with loving care and attention to detail, whether it's a big set-piece 'shoot-up' or a close-up of a can of preserves--how such a can looked in 1881...  Garrett's hunt for Billy is told mainly in set-pieces and it has to be said that Peckinpah makes little narrative concession to an audience in the way they are strung together... But for the out and out Western fan this is a most memorable movie...   
 I finished the audio book earlier this week.  In typical Stephen King fashion, he draws you along the story, twisting several plots into it.  Surprisingly, it was not the main focus of the story that gave me chills, but the last 5 minutes when certain revelations are made, or at least hinted at.  I especially loved the iconography of the statue in front of the hospital, and the often repeated quote which basically said that there was no comfort without pain.  Which I guess can be considered a message of hope, or at least a message that suffering is not done in vain.  But again, it's one of those details that makes this whole story just a bit askew.  Overall, it was a great read.  I really enjoyed the story, it was a bit predictable, but the pace of the words draws the listener along nicely.  I would recomend this book to a friend, but not to my mother 
 The soundtrack is great.  Everytime I listen to it I can't but help to think of the movie.  Which is a good thing 
 For someone just getting their feet wet with personal finance, this book is an excellent introduction. It is a concise and engaging read that all high school students ought to read, as well as those wanting a refresher on money matters 
 I thoroughly enjoyed this story.  I wanted to crawl into its world and just stay there forever.  
 I bought this as research material for codes of conduct. The feel of the book shows the writers background in the clergy, the book focuses more on the traditional courting behavior than on love itself. Its wonderful as a complex example of a code of conduct, but sheds little light in the direction of true relationships. Very interesting as a period piece, its seems to be more reflective of the romantic visions of the middle ages than the reality 
 I'll admit it, right off: at first I just didn't get Conor Oberst (Bright Eyes). I was either too common or too evolved to buy into his thing, whatever it was and is. Many have boasted that he is a genius, and as many others have convicted him a pretentious fraud. Without a doubt, the first songs I heard grew on me and I liked him. I didn't get him, but I liked the music. I exposed myself to more and then started feeling a little duped. There was a rambling quality to his songs: a little over-wordy. And then I felt the emotions he was conveying were a bit forced- as if he were trying too hard. I lost my ambition to know his music better.   Then, serendipitously, I saw him perform on Austin City Limits. Somehow, what couldn't be translated through my headphones became palpable as I watched and listened. There was an intensity I had previously missed that was all too there as I watched him sweat out the songs before an audience. The passion stuck inside me like a sweet and toxic glue and I found myself infected for life. Now I listen to every song as an afflicted man. I innately "get it" and I absolutely love it.   If you can see Bright Eyes, then you'll truly hear him and thus, feel him. That's how I "see" it. And that's how I got it. Look, I was one who lamented the rise of video music, feeling it detracted from the purity of what music is all about, but this is not about video. It's about connecting the person to his or her songs. Who can deny that seeing the Beatles impacts one as much as hearing the Beatles does?   There's a reason many of us go out of the way to see our favorite artists live. Instinctively, we know there is something elemental to watching them play the songs that come from their souls. We must hear AND see the fire to feel the fire. And Bright Eyes is on fire here 
 The Tempest is a play filled with deceit, manipulation and magic.  Prospero was dethroned from his dukedom and sent to an island, he uses magic to lure his enemies there.  This is unlike any Shakespeare I have read before, I  enjoyed but was a bit surprised.  Shakespeare doesn't usually lean toward magic but this time he did.  It was enjoyable, a fast read, that takes a reader into another world 
 I appreciated having my instincts validated by the Sears.  This book takes all the vague ideas I've had about parenting and lays them out in an easy, readable, and sensible way. 
 This is the story of a family who cares for a bird that has been hurt.  The family worries about the bird's health and happiness.  Choices are made and compassion wins the day.  It's a very gentle story for children and touches on themes of responsibility and freedom.  Truly a sweet story 
 The story is very boring.  A middle class family has high aspirations for obtaining upper class status and this `class consciousness' controls everything they think and do.  Despite their foolishness, one can't help but feel sorry for each character (with the exception of the mother) who continually finds failure and disappointment.  The characters are not developed to the point that I usually enjoy, and there are quite a large number of characters.  An interesting thing about the characters is, none of them are `good.'  Probably the closest thing to a good character is Virgil's Boss, Mr. Lamb.  But even he is a business monger, ultimately concerned with his own business.  This reflection on man is insightful.  In real life, are there any people without flaws?  Major flaws?  Even the Bible presents the heroes of the faith as people with big problems (King Solomon was a womanizer, David was a murderer, Peter was a coward, etc.).  In general, people are selfish.  Our motives are selfish, and our own desires drive everything we do.  However, often fiction reflects one or two main characters who are flawless.  In an attempt to make characters likable- reality is bypassed.  This doesn't happen here in Alice Adams.    I believe this book is about expectations.  The Adams' family lives in the false hope of a brighter future, all the while neglecting the life they are currently living.  I feel that this is the same discontenting experience that Westerners face.  Maybe this is even a reflection of the way the author wrote the book- seemingly slow, but with flashes of brilliant foreshadowing which gives hope to the reader that something more grand is on the horizon.     The story is interesting because of the absolute stupidity of this family, and the fact that it probably is a very real experience for many. The story, though slow, is written very well, and was very easy for me to read (a plus for me, I am a bit slow).   It is also interesting because even though the story takes place in America- it seems a different culture.  This different culture was interesting.  I think the difference came in that the story is supposed to have taken place in the South (a foreign country as far as I am concerned), and it probably took place in the very early part of the 20th century.  One aspect of Tarkington's writing that I appreciated was the way he foreshadowed things.  Maybe I appreciated the subtle foreshadowing hints because of the drudgery of the story, but whatever the reason- I think he did an excellent job.    
 this is one of my favorites in this genre, lit adaptations. Hannah Taylor-Gordon is superb, the story is a great lesson, and the locations really fine. 
 I purchased this cable to connect my HD DVR to my Samsung LCD TV.  The DVR was initially connected via the component inputs, but I needed the component port on the TV for another device.  I hooked up the HDMI cable, watched a few minutes of a HD show, switched back to the component cables, watched the same few minutes of the HD show again and I could not tell the difference.  Overall, I am satisfied and would buy the same cable again if I bought another HDMI device. 
 The book--although poorly bound--is written very nicely.  Kunda has a wonderful way of presenting the material objectively and respectfully while still engaging the reader.  There are numerous, minor typos but this does not distract the reader terribly.  A natural progression is found in Kunda's style, where she presents a topic, draws on some familiar day-to-day experiences, and presents the experiments and research that support it.  She explains contradictions and allows the reader to make his/her own conclusions and inferences concerning topics like hot cognition, influences of mood on memory, subliminal processing, false-memories, and influences of culture on cognition.  She, herself, did extensive work in the area of cognitive science and since her passing, will be missed by many as her work was incredibly innovative and interesting.     The book reads quickly and will be enjoyed by most.  The only thing I wish was different about this book was its size (there is so much left over white space on each page--it's unnecessary).  Most people with some experience or interest in cognitive science should find this book fascinating.  Do not expect an in-depth or even moderate assessment of the biological or neurological underpinnings of cognition.  This book explains cognition by reviewing social and cognitive experiments 
 David Riklan has done it again. He managed to get 101 self-improvement gurus to collaborate and share their collective wisdom. The result is '101 Great Ways To Improve Your Life-Volume 2'. The stories will improve your relationship with yourself, others, and the universe. Covering an enormous array of topics, the common denominator of the stories is that they will help you think more positively and feel and function better.  Shirley Cheng's chapter entitled 'Dance With Your Heart: How To Befriend Your Heart And The World Around You' is my favorite. She provides clear guidelines on how to not only dance with your heart but on how to become a dancing heart. It is a beautiful and instructive chapter written by this young woman who is a blind and physically disabled poet and author. I learned more about her by visiting the website [...]  The book is filled with many other stories to help you discover countless ways of feeling better and improving your life. Enthusiastically recommended 
 This book attempts to answer the question-an important one to my thinking-"Why don't our cities look like the great ones: Paris, Rome?"  Rybczynski, a student of architecture and city planning discusses the history of American blunders from the highway to the skyscraper, from the "City Beautiful" movement, to the negro rush toward city centers in the late 60's.  It seems that everything that could've gone wrong, essentially has.  Still, the author sees hope in the forms of a few master-planned towns (east coast), and of the modern suburban mall, which he sees as a place for people to gather and do commerce, while feeling safer than they would in urban areas due to the malls' governing rules and aesthetic uniformities which have been abolished in the name of individual freedoms elsewhere, to our peril.  
 I have to say I love this book.  Easy to use, you can get in get the information you need and get on with your project!!!  Love it...Thanks Sandra Betzina 
 As with most of the other Little Einstein books this is innovative and educational. It's truly excellent coupled with the Galactic Goodnight episode. My 3 year old now knows all the planets

 E. Nesbit's classic story of about some Edwardian children who find a sand fairy one summer is an unsentimental delight. Each day the odd fairy grants them one magic wish, be it beauty, wealth, great size, etc. which will only last until sunset. Somehow each wish they make turns into a disaster, but through their own cleverness and a bit of luck, the children are able to make each problem work out in the end. Nesbit's writing is particularly full of amusing asides and offbeat humor in this one. Her turns of plot are inventive, and as the plucky children face their outlandish predicaments, it becomes clear that Nesbit has her finger on the pulse of the way real children might think. Her work has held up quite well considering it is over a hundred years old. This novel would be suitable for kids in about fourth or fifth grade 
 This is a murder mystery about Kate Delafield, Los Angeles Police  Department homicide detective and former Marine. When Forrest began writing her mysteries, they were published by NAIAD, a small pioneering lesbian press. That Forrest now has a major publisher reflects both the quality of her work and the increased acceptance of diverse types of stories in the mystery field.   It is hard to imagine a more stressful job than the one that Forrest  creates for her character. An upstanding member of the L.A.P.D., her work  brings her into daily contact with death and corruption. Her whole department is under incredible public scrutiny, and at a low point in morale due to the O. J. Simpson trial. Delafield is a somewhat closeted lesbian in a profession where women, let alone lesbians, are not well tolerated.   As the novel starts, a routine arrest goes bad, and not only is a young  suspect killed, but Delafield is herself shot and wounded. The detective's focus should be relaxing and regaining her health, but instead she represents another officer who is accused of misconduct. Delafield's investigation leads her to a tangentially related killing of a gay cop. This in turn reveals a plan to out hundreds of gays and lesbians on the police force.   Kate Delafield solves the murders, but the important issues involve the  injustices suffered by lesbians and gays in the military-like, macho field of law enforcement, and also the moral and ethical issues created by closeted lifestyles. Forrest doesn't offer any easy solutions or pat answers, but does provide a vivid depiction of the stress and conflicts which shape the lives of police officers, what ever their gender or sexual orientation. 
 I guess that's what the intent of this book and it gives examples from an expert in Training. The articles from several experts in the field of training also supports the content and adds value. Recommended if you need an overview, although in some chapters goes into details. Yet, there are several other books that focus on preparation, presentation, evaluation etc. which might be more focused on these topics

If you follow their advice and do what each card suggests, you'll develop a your own strategy that's guaranteed to be successful. There are at least 52 reasons to really like this book 
 Arrived on time and in terrific shape! Thanks 
 I saw this film on a Sunday afternoon many months ago. I have been profoundly changed by this engaging story. It has many layers that I think I will incorporate it into my college class as a topic for class viewing and discussion.   So many nuances concerning religion, conversion, love and a child's trust. Jealousy, bravery, intolerance have been wonderfully illustratd in a way that I have reraly seen covered so well in one film 
 Okay. So Milhone lives in the 1980s. But the cold case she is working on--and that she draws her alternative point of views from--is set in the 1950s. And, boy does Grafton ever nail the 1950s, when TV was just set to burst into our lives, but was still only in the homes of the more monied.  I enjoyed seeing Grafton employ a new device and stretch her writing talents. It allows us to pick up clues and red herrings and see Violet, the missing dame, from many perspectives. That's a lot of fun!  Janet Riehl, author "Sightlines: A Poet's Diary 
 As the wife of a husband with ADHD and mother of a son with ADHD, I have struggled for years like many other reviewers to do what is right for "my boys". Sandra Reif offers some very encouraging and helpful strategies in this books. I think the key point that all books on ADHD need to make is that each person with ADHD is an individual with unique talents and gifts, and we need to view these in a positive light. Anyone who has struggled with this needs to read a book called GIFTED by Kirk Martin. It's actually a novel about a young man with ADD who comes to understand that the "disorder" parents and teachers had considered negative all his life actually turns out to be a gift. I think you can read a summary at kirkmartinbooks.com, it presents an entirely new way to view the ones you love 
 I own the whole collection - 19 episodes in all - my only regret is that this series wasn't continued. It's the kind of story that warms your heart & makes you want to be a better person - everyone should watch it -  young or old.  You will laugh & cry... and never forget it 
 Enjoy the range of songs. They include many of my favorites. I especially like it for my vechicle with limited space. Good sound too, sounds as good as the originals , ( as recorded on the LPs). Ah miss those LPs 
 I found myself right there watching every scene unfold, just when you think you're out of a spot something else pops up. This has been  a wild journey across the realms of space 
 I have to be reminded that God knows me - personally - and wants the very best for me.  Thanks Max for making that so clear.  Mr. Lucados' style is inviting if not inticing.  He uses such a natural "voice" that you are immediately fireside with a chat with the author and with the Savior Himself.  
 This cd would be worth buying even if it only had one song on it - the version of "Pu'u Anahulu" with Martin Pahinui on vocals.  I get chicken skin just listening to this song and how much he sounds like his father!  Of course I love Gabby's version but always wondered what it would sound like without the cheesy strings; this is it.  Unlike one other reviewer, I love the vocals 
 I am not a big fan of ghost stories, but I loved this book.  It is one of the best books that I have ever read.  I had trouble putting it down 
 In the era of self-help, many have tried to write of love romance, & sex.  None succeed to the extent that Person has in this fine text.  By identifying romance as an  act of imagination, a quintessentially psychological act,  Person delivers the insights that can enable the cognitively  oriented lover to achieve transcendence while keeping  one's feet on solid ground 
 Matthew Maly has written a remarkable book that is indispensable for the understanding of Russia.  I am an American living in Ukraine, a country with a culture very similar to that of Russia, and so this book was especially relevant for me.  Maly has the advantage of having one foot on each side of what is a vast cultural and psychological divide, as he was born and raised in Russia, and educated after emigrating to America.  This makes him uniquely qualified to explain this part of the world in a language that the West can understand.  I would recommend this book not only to someone with an interest in Russia, but also to anyone who would like to understand that, elsewhere in the world, people don't just behave differently - they think differently - often in fundamental ways.  Maly explains these basic differences and the reasons behind them.  While Maly's thinking is well-disciplined, his writing style is friendly, fluid, and direct.  His candor jumps off the page at you.  It is not, thankfully, another history book; there are plenty of those, if you want them, but they won't explain Russia as it is - or the Russians as they are.  For me, this was not a "must read" book - it was a "must read twice" book 
 the difference in style and content between her love poems and her earlier works does not discredit her talent.  i loved her then and i love her now.  tolstoy said that all happy stories are the same and yes, love poems can be trite.  giovanni, however, captures the undercurrents of what it means to be in love--the unimaginable joy, the confusion, the warm fuzzy feeling, and even the anger and frustration that come along with loving someone.    the poems are soft and mushy, empty of political conflict, but rife with passion--just like love 
 Very well written.  Interesting.  Kind of depressing but knew it would be due to subject matter 
 Firstly It should be noted that this album isn't the usual collection of bittersweet, Autumnal wry Indie Rock & Alternative Pop/Rock songs that the band are usually famed(& applauded) for. That is a markedly radical one off change in direction for the band, instead choosing to focus on obscure covers songs, leaning toward Alt.Country-rock, (the country-esque "Can't forget/Griselda & Here comes my baby"), all subtly reflective & imitate. Before Stopping to include the 60's rock & roll of "Emulsified" (curiously soundly like rock & roll rocker "Monster Mash"), before heading down the indie rock that they earned their musical stripes for ("Speeding Motorcycle/The Summer/Did I tell you). Impeccably paced (The transitions from country/Americana tracks to Alternative/Indie rock is seamless), and It's nigh on impossible not to nod (or even sing) along to what's being played here, and a superbly focused diversion for Yo La Tengo. And more Distressingly a direction that band chose not to the further explore.  So, with the vast majority of fantastic Yo la tengo albums leaning more towards focused Alternative / Indie Rock, this was a beautifully realised deviation for the band 
 I am a new boxmaker and have really enjoyed this book.  The author explains the basics of a number of different types of boxes that get progressively more complex as the book goes along.  I only dock it one star for the lack of color photos.  As a child of the 80s, I need the flashing lights, I guess 
 The first time I watched this film I liked it.  The second time I loved it.  The third time I worshipped it.  The characters grow on me more each time - I could spend two hours just watching Alan Arkin and Nick Nolte talking about nothing over a bottle of wine.  I'm a Vonneut fan, and this is the only film to capture not just his wit and plot but the wonderful, wonderful characters he creates.   
 For anyone who was taught in school that poetry was dry, cryptic and boring, this is the book that will change your mind. John Fox presents poetry in a way that will make it an enjoyable part of your life, a healing  part of your life, and you will discover your creative self. It leaves you  wanting more. For more, see Poetic Medicine 
 When I read this book it started it was mysterious how Will Staton finds his powers. If you like to read there are five books in the series this is # two. I can compare to other books this is the best out of them all. That's about ten books. There's parts were you don't want to put it down. Its good for projects such as summary's, book marks, comic strips, bubble maps, and post its. Buying this book you wont regret buying this book. If you know someone who likes reading books it may be a good book for them for birth day or Christmas present 
 Classic soul describes both the content of this CD and the sound of Maysa's voice. The music is timeless and the tone of Maysa's voice is otherworldly. Beautifully rich, soul-full and tastefully reproduced, Maysa does justice to the classic's. Of the most beautiful is the haunting remake of Roberta Flack's The first time ever I saw your face. I promise it will make you stop and remember what Love actually felt like.  While she does not stray too far with additional creativity, the original flavor of the music remains, with the smooth, deeply unique vocal stylings of Maysa. If you can earnestly say you are a lover of soul music, and you want to recapture the feeling of listening to music that actually made you feel as though Love was a possibility, then please purchase this CD.  It's just too bad, more people don't know the beauty of this woman's voice.    
 Great movie.   Its a little old school as far as acting and cast, but great film.   This film does NOT express any homoeroticism in it, but just true care for human beings.   The religious undertows are awesome, and the paranormal wonder is so cool.   I highly recommend this film 
 Steven Barnes has created a nice balance between the supernatural element and the traditional elements of an action novel - male bonding, moral dilemmas, desperate combat, military technology and character development.   I liked the fact that his main character breaks some of the typical  stereotypes. Not only is he black, he is also a computer geek and father  whose wife is divorcing him.  Definitely worth reading 
 I had to write a few words.  Every now and then I hit upon an author that pulls and pushes at your heart.  I listen to dozens of audio books every month driving to and from work.  This story was so very well written.  It has real life in it.  It has passion, love, danger, devotion, understanding, pain - it has it all.  It is a must read/listen for historical and just plain enjoyment reasons.  (The plot is in the description.)  I must now seek out other books by this author.  If you want to fill moments of your life with a treasure include this story. doroth 
 I've purchased several books on real estate(RE) investing and this book by far is the best of the lot.  It is written in a concise yet informative manner and provides beginning investors with the techniques and strategies to get their RE investment careers off to a solid start.  I'm sure I'll be referring to this book many times throughout my RE investment career.  I would highly recommend this book 
 I've kept planted aquariums for a number of years, but was intrigued by this book because one of the co-authors is a well-known advocate of low-tech planted tanks.   The format of this book is VERY nice. The writing is friendly and inviting, and there are lots of pretty full color photos. Personally, I didn't learn a whole lot of new information, but it was a pleasant read nonetheless. I would certainly recommend it to someone just entering the hobby, or someone looking for an overview on planted tanks, especially if they're seeking some guidance on what type of planted tank is the best fit for them - high tech, low tech, biotope, etc. All around, a very good presentation, and an excellent invitation to exploring planted aquariums 
 Brings back a load of fond memories, listening to this set.  Both discs are essential in my opinion.  Remastering is superb as is the song selection.  An automatic purchase for all REM people 
 The "Honest Truth" (or, more accurately, Reactionary Bias) does not sound as much against homosexuality as he does unsafe sexual behavior, which many, many gay men do not engage in. Heterosexuals do a lot of stupid stuff too, but we do not blame heterosexuality, we blame the self-destructive behavior. What HT fails to explain in his review is this: How do you account for all the gay men out there (myself included, HELLO) who are not promiscuous and risk-taking in their personal lives? I'd like to here the "honest truth" about that! Oh, and by the way, what makes straight people always think they're such authorities on gays and lesbians? If you want to find a real expert, look no further than an actual gay person. What a concept 
 When I first got this book, I wanted to put off reading it because it's kinda long.  Nothing I haven't done before, but school was going on, and I just wanted something to occupy my time.  Bad idea for this book.  As to the length, it flies by.  I found myself on page 122 and it felt as if I'd just opened it up.  The story is fun.  That's not a word I generally use to describe a book I'm reading.  The style is lacking compared to contemperaries such as Hugo, and there is no real "deep thinking" involved.  It is pure escape literature, in it's finest form 
 In the Holden Caulfield vein, Ford's The Sportswriter grips me in a way that I rarely find in contemporary fiction; by dreary ennui, trademark of a postmodern howl at the universe. The sad, gray cast of characters rings true, especially in their tragedies. I find myself wanting to give a synopsis or something, but I'm not sure how. Just read it if you were ever the kind of kid--like me--who read Catcher In The Rye and immediately aged many years, painfully but necessarily 
 If you're starving for some new concepts to muttle over in your mind, this is the book for you. RAW delivers once again the best from the guerrilla ontologists world. E-Prime, UMMO, Sagan vs. Velikovski, the masks of EXPERTS, and more. Highly recommended, along with the first book in the series 
 This is a book full of time tested techniques for dealing with adversity.  If he had written the book today, I think that he would have focused more on the development of resilience. That concept was in its infancy when he was writing, but in fact many of the practical methods in the book form basic biulding blocks of this important personal attribute.  Not just a book for people in trouble: it wasn't raining when Noah built the Ark 
 I found this book incredibly informative.  The research that obviously went into it is incredible.  I always have the same problem with McCullough's books - they need an editor.  About ten percent of this book was superfluous and just didn't fit.  Still I enjoyed it greatly 
 I've struggled with the guitar for about 15 years. I've taken lessons and bought just about every book and DVD out there.  Most teach you a few old folk songs to pick out on guitar.  Even the teacher i had pretty much just said "heres a chord, heres another chord, now play the guitar"  So much time wasted on learning to convert traditional notes to suit the fretboard.  If only i could go back 15 years ago and hand myself a copy of this book.  Simply amazing!  You'll go through the book and wont believe how many times it will click and you will literally say "oh wow"  This book teaches you not just how, but why, which after reading this book i realized is just as important as how.  Once you learn why the guitar works the way it does you will instantly see how things go together.  Don't wait!  Buy this book yesterday!  I would give it 11 stars if i could 
 While each and every one of these song titles appears on either the first FLCL soundtrack or the second, this cd is still worth picking up. Why? Well, a lot of these songs were originallly included as instrumental tracks on the first two cds, but this third installment features vocals for every single track. Think of it as a Pillows album rather than a soundtrack 
 I have been studying A Course in Miracles for about 30 years and never fully understood it. One reading of DU opened my understanding. Hearing the stories of two ascended masters who realized awareness of oneness through practice of ACIM helped me understand how to apply the teachings to daily life 
 I have played played most of the courses mentioned in this very readable book.  Their experiences brought back many fine memories....  To go to Scotland with good 'buds' and to see how golf is part of the basic fabic of everyday life there, really sums up the trips I have taken.  It is the next best thing to actually going there.  Also true to fact, is that there are really no bad links courses, just lesser known ones....  This read compares very favorably with books such as 'A season in Dornock' and should be read prior to any first time trip to Scotland / Ireland 
 This is great album, especially for car listening.  It's full of great songs by great talent, and has a good bit of humor to it (Rubber Biscuit is one of my favorites, bow, bow, bow) 
 If this is your first Suzanne Brockmann novel, STOP! The "Troubleshooters" series is best read in sequence.  The characters are reappearing and their stories build through out the books.  Understanding the history of the storyline is most significant in "Gone Too Far" which explains the discrepancy in the previous reviews.   I always appreciate the characterization which Ms. Brockmann utilizes in her stories.  She is a superb story teller who teases her readers with bits and pieces of stories about old and new characters.  This makes her series a pleasure to read for those who have traveled with her along her journey... but can be frustrating and confusing to others who come in during the middle of things.   After reading the entire series in a frenzied month or two, I personally hope to read more about Sam and Alyssa in the future.    
 City of Bones by Michael Connelly is the third book I've read by this author, and the second in his Harry Bosch series.  Connelly never fails to deliver with his mysteries and City of Bones was a real page-turner.  Harry Bosch is a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department Homicide Division.  When human remains are found in Laurel Canyon, Bosch and his partner, Jerry Edgar, are called in to investigate.  A forensic anthropologist determines that the victim was between the ages of 10 and 12, and was severely physically abused throughout his short life.  Since the bones have been buried for over 20 years and there is very little evidence, Bosch and Edgar have an uphill climb in trying to identify both the victim and the murderer.  As always, there are a number of factors that complicate their case.  The police chief wants the case wrapped up quickly without regard to whether they've identified the real murderer.  The press is relentless, and someone on the inside is leaking them information.  And Bosch finds himself romantically involved with a rookie police officer-something against department rules.  Bosch is a meticulous and tortured officer, and he leaves no stone unturned in trying to find the real killer.  Even when he has a confession in hand, he doesn't believe the case is closed.    Michael Connelly writes gritty, hard-nosed mysteries which are more realistic than most writers today.  Things don't always work out for the best, and police don't always follow the rules.  City of Bones is not a fluffy work of fiction and Connelly will have you guessing until the very end.  It's also interesting in that Bosch ties in some local history of the La Brea Tar Pits and two murder victims discovered in the pits that dated back 9000 years.    After finishing City of Bones, I next plan to read Connelly's Concrete Blonde.   
 I've noticed a lot of comparisons between "Map of Bones" and Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code," but I read this as a "virgin" reader, so to speak -- in other words, I'm one of those few folks who haven't read "The Da Vinci Code."  To sum things up, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. What follows are some observations:  POSITIVES  1. The mixture of good storytelling with scientific concepts. Yes, the novel did go beyond that toward the end (into pseudo-scientific/religious/faith territory), but by then I was hooked and didn't mind it one bit.  2. Characterization. When I found out "Map" was a continuation of a series (after I had purchased the book), I was afraid I'd get shortchanged when it came to characters. I was wrong. I thought Rollins did a good job, and I especially found myself "caring" for Grayson Pierce, Monk and Rachael Verona.  3. Some plot twists took me by surprise. Looking back on it, they seem a little more obvious now, but more than once I was "thrown off the trail," so to speak, especially with regard to some characters. All I can say is, just about every character has a critical role in the story.  4. "Map of Bones" had excellent copy editing! I found very few errors, and that's a rarity in today's publishing world.  NEGATIVE  1. The ending left a wee bit to be desired. Oh, well. I guess the spiritual journey is never meant to end, so on and on we shall go 
         I love horror movies. Love them. Sometimes though, that love keeps me from enjoying alot of them. I feel I've seen so many that typical scares don't work anymore. Or is it that most movies are so derivative and void of any true desire to unsettle an audince that they really don't work on anyone. Either way, theres nothing more frustrating than going to see a movie that you expect to scare you and realizing that its just more of the same crap. I love either having a good time with a horror movie or being terrified by it and Kairo definatly fits into the latter category.                              The story is basically a simple one, ghosts are taking over by using the internet to breach our world. Anyone who encounters one can't take it and kills themselves. Thats pretty much it, on the surface... but the movie has so much more going on for it as far as a statement about how technology is driving us as humans apart, but thats not why we're watching it is it? The main question is, is it scary and I can answer "oh my God yes!"                         The first half of the movie adds so many subtle touches and presents scenes that end in jarring scares in such a way that they shock you and make you realize you haven't seen anything like this before. kurosawa knows how to craft a scene that seems to be going nowhere end with a bang, but a quiet one. Thats what got me, the fact that I almost never saw the scares coming and they were so a part of the scenery almost that it really seemed as if Id just seen a ghost, until the first time you actually see one in all its glory creeping towards one of the lead characters. I can truly say I've never seen a ghost in any movie  move like that and I don't know that I want to again. Movies like this show whats missing in most big-budget horror movies today,atmosphere and a genuine willingness to unnerve a crowd. The second half however can't hold on to the genuinly terrifying moments of the first, but involves you as the story goes deeper and the characters figure out what is happening to them...and the world. Definatly worth a look and I'd recommend it to own. Tonight being Halloween, you know Im going to show it to people 
 I read this book when I was in graduate school 13 years ago and it gave me an outlook on my life (and how I was living it) that I had not considered before. It helped me recognize that when I did 'impulsive' things, I achieved goals; and when I did 'compulsive' things, I sabotaged those goals. After unpacking this book during a recent move, I re-read it and it holds as much meaning for me now as before; only now, with several more years under my belt, I understand even more clearly the message that Leland delivers. I am thrilled to see that Leland has finally published another book and it is at the top of my reading list 
 You cannot say enough good things about this movie!! Cary Grant was I think snubbed for the Oscar but Jimmy Stewart well deserved it too!! Dinah (the litttle sister) is hilarious! Katharine Hepburn of course shines and her presence is what makes the movie so fantastic 
 A Tme to Kill, the debut novel from Acclaimed writer John Grishman deals with the thinly threaded storylines dealing with a rape and attempted murder of a [young] black girl.  Soon after race issues boil over as protesters on both sides of the fences barrier over the woodwork. Grishman expertly narrarates this complex issue by focusing on the more simplistic, organic notions of the case, and the bodies that are affected by each decision that is made.  True, the ending seems rather rushed and he certainly could of filled another 50-100 pages without question, but in the long run everyone believes that this magnificent story of Racial disharmony in present day and age end up asking, not answering, questions that need to be asked. Grishman was quoted in the reprinted foreword in saying he wouldn't change a word.  With a story like that, you can see that he doesn't need to, compelling storytelling will always be compelling storytelling. In the End Grisham nails it out of the park, and leaves his readers yearning for more 
  This is one of my favorite albums by the master of shock rock himself ALICE COOPER! Alot heavier than previous albums, this record deals with Heaven and Hell, evils of man, death and destruction, loss and loneliness. A great album. brutal and soft at the same time. Another amazing release from Cooper 
 Interesting mix of music. I like most of the songs on this album, a bit on the roots side, kind of folky and kind of bluesy. They are not a commercial band but this is a very easy album to listen to. My favorite songs are "Yours and Mine", "Lucky Dime", "All Systems Red". I have been listening to this CD a lot and it has really grown on me 
 Once in a while, a talent springs forth from out of nowhere to alter, dismay, and influence a particular scene that has grown stale in length and insignificance. Like a calm before a storm, it's placid nature lingers but isn't something to get excited about. The Ramones were one of the tsunami's of Rock.  Watchable and quite revealing, "End of the Century" is a fine tribute to the unlikely foursome who changed the face of Popular Music. Hailing from unfashionable Queens, New York, the motley quartet of Jeffrey Hyman, John Cummings, Douglas Glenn Colvin, and Tamas Erdelyi started out as a group of neighborhood boys with a taste for being different when it came to music. Listening to The Stooges and the New York Dolls when people of the time either hated or barely heard of them, the boys formed their own band and decided to make something out of their limited musicianship, naming themselves respectively as Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee, and Tommy, including the band name as a surname, slashing the s. In a time of pretentious and overblown musicianship in Rock, they unintentionally created a revolution. Punk in it's truest musical sense was born, and the group's first few recordings inspired and spawned numerous bands who have made their own significant contributions in the genre, and which continues to this very day and will continue doing so as long as the world continues to spin.  The DVD features footage of the band's live performances throughout their career with some videos interspersed. Interviews of the band members reveal interestingly the distinct and different personalities which are the trademarks of every great Rock band: the genial and self-effacing Joey, the irascible Johnny, the goofy and drug-addled Dee Dee, and the sober Tommy. Mental illnesses, infidelity, infighting, numerous line-up changes, and many other none too commendable but zany tales color the group's legend. Deborah Harry and Chris Stein, Joe Strummer, "Legs" McNeil, Roberta Bayley, Danny Fields, and Rob Zombie among others, relate their tales and insights on the seminal power of the band.  This isn't the glorius tale of a commercially successful Rock group that one would associate with bands who took chart hits for granted: the video reveals the tragedy of a band that was ahead of it's time. It's deeply saddening to see such an important and highly influential group slog it out in clubs all throughout their long career when they've done so much for a music scene which did not give them back their vast due, causing their demise.  I will always remember Tommy's story when he first heard the group. The boys were playing in Joey's mother's basement, and when he first heard "Judy is a Punk", he said to this effect, "I was astonished. What kind of music was this? What kind of words were these? This is amazing! I never heard anything like this before. That day I joined the group". Had he been more "attuned" to the times he would have laughed or left in bewilderment or disgust. Revolutions are created by like-minded individuals 
 A very rare kind of insight into some of the more complicated  "scientific cases" and the commoner subjects is presented in a highly interesting manner; the book acts as a scientific food (a shot!)  from kids to professors to housewives without technical jargon. Reading  this book makes your heart soar into realms of more subtler thematic fields  (such as evolution, geology, paleontology) that play an exhilarating and  exciting role in our mundane lives to make it rich and vibrant 
 Although we lost Dr. Fleischman early, we say goodbye to the rest of the amazing ensemble cast that was able to convey the notion that very different people can live together and accept their differences, and possibly even learn from one another in the process. Were it only true in the other 49 states 
 It's so difficult to carry a huge diaper bag while having your baby in a carrier.  This product solves that problem!  And it's cute too.  I was shopping at Babys 'R' Us recently and the sales girl asked where I got my "super cute" diaper bag/carrier.  I told her and she insisted to her manager that the store start carrying the item (no word yet on whether or not they will).  I have recommended this bag to all my friends and bought two as shower gifts.  It's the ultimate in convenience and fashion 
 Yup, I loved this book. I couldn't stop thinking about it for weeks after I finished it. I am so impressed with his way of handling an overwhelming situation. He continued to try to find the answer to the way out even as he was dying. It's a book I've recommended to so many people. Lots of them have said "oh, I can't read that book - he cuts off his arm!" To which I reply that the book is about so much more. I was inspired & uplifted. All books should be so moving 
 At first I thought the title was a bit too good to be true, how can anyone change in 10 days? I bought it anyway since being human that we are, easy and effortless is the most attractive option. Well, I read it and applied (actually do the exercises) and it did improve my thinking, then little by little, my actions. I took my time with it but eventually I did learn about enabling new habits, not just discipline, through the steps and methods given in the book (visualization, self-talk, etc). Now, I catch myself talking out of doing things that I should do, I immediately snap out of it and do it. Good book, I'm starting to use it in other areas of my life that needs a bit of work 
 If you are one to start liking a group in a later stage of their career. I always recommend buying a greatest hits cd. Although it doesn't cover ALL of the greatest. It is worth buying. A good value 
 I found this book to be one of the most clearly written texts on the subject of computer architecture(as opposed to the terse, cryptic Astrom and Wittenmark books for control systems, for example.)  Now, a professor can easily test around the basics of any text book by surprising students with unexpected special cases, exceptions, and boundary conditions. But, that is not the fault of the text book itself. If any of those tricks actually appeared in a text book, they would be ignored and he/she would find new ones to test.   Noone can memorize how to think; knowing how to solve the examples in a textbook is only the beginning. That's why there are homework problems.  Unpopular professor tricks aside, I think this is a great book on the topic and it gave me the skills to perform certain assignments on my own during my first engineering job...skills that my employer thought he would have to teach to all us newbies. I was glad I had this book in school.  
 First viewing this book I had my doubts, but reading through it proved it was worth it cost.  This book is for just about anyone who is interested in becoming an otaku, or even someone who has been an otaku for some time.  It gives references to an anime entitle "Otaku no Video" throughout.  Also excellent hints for starting your own anime club in your area.  Fallowed by a list of anime titles, web site, etc...  It gives you infomation, and alows you to come up with some of your own ideas.  If you are looking to become an otaku this book will put you well on the track 
 For the most part, this is a rock-n-roll album with big guitars.  In spots, it's a bit overproduced.  Like all its predecessors, this Oasis album has that air of familiarity and gives you that, "I've heard this before" feeling.  I think it's quite fresh, though.  Oasis is a paradox: they beg, steal and borrow from the Who, the Beatles, the Stones, the Stone Roses, Slade, T. Rex, Bowie, etc, but still come out sounding like Oasis.  With the exception of one or two songs that are blatant rip-offs, the worst that can be said for its originality is that it's "derivative" in places.  This is also the first Oasis album with songs written by the non-Gallagher members of the band, and the first album to feature more than one song by Liam (three, in fact).    "The Hindu Times" (Noel) - Neo-psychedelic.  Big guitars with raga-sounding lead guitar licks and Liam's braying vocals.  In the rhythm guitar you'll hear a smidgeon of "Jumpin' Jack Flash."    This is a song (apparently) about nothing ("I get so I high I just can't feel it.").  It's one of the better songs on the album and a good one to crank with the windows down.  "Force of Nature" (Noel) - This song floated around for a year or two before HC as Noel solo song (he's the singer.)  Noel's vocals are great; he really screams it out.  There's a healthy dose of anger and cynicism in this one, rare for Oasis.  The best line: "I betcha knew right away/It's all over town that the sun's going down/on the days of your easy life."  The ghost of Marc Bolan has certainly possessed this tune.    "Hung in a Bad Place" (Gem Archer) - Though not written by a Gallagher, "Hung" sounds like it would have fit right in on Definitely Maybe.  It's another big guitar song with Liam's nasally snarl.  The more I hear it the more I dig it!  Lyrically, it's in the vein of "Free" by Jagger/Richards: "I can go where I wanna/be where I wanna be now . . ."   This has the makings of a great live tune.  "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" (Noel) - When I hear this song all I can think of is "Dear Friend" off of Wings' Wild Life.  After the slowly plodding piano intro, it turns into a power ballad.  The lyrics are weak and cliche.  Sample: "`Cuz all of the stars are fading away/just try not to worry/you'll see them someday . . ."  This is one of the more disappointing songs on the album and, unfortunately, it ended up being a single.   "Songbird" (Liam) - Liam, with typical braggadocio, declared this one, "Better than anything on Revolver."  The only Beatles song this tune might be better than is "Mister Moonlight" or "Revolution # 9," and even that would be a stretch.  The guitar and rhythm sound like they're taken directly from "Lyin' Eyes" by the Eagles.  It's a throw away and shouldn't be on the album.  "Little by Little" (Noel) - Noel sings this one and does a great job on vocals.  The verses sound like many a Pink Floyd tune.  The chorus makes this a good pop-rock tune.  It has a nice guitar solo.  It's basically about a relationship and inner searching ("Why am I really here?") There's nothing new in it, musically or lyrically, but it's a pretty good track, nonetheless.  "A Quick Peep" (Andy Bell) - Instrumental.  I can't decide whether this is Pink Floyd doing The Pogues or The Pogues doing Pink Floyd.  Either way, it should have been saved for an EP or a B-side.  "(Probably) All in the Mind" (Noel) -  Perhaps a bit of a twist on the whole neo-psychedelic thing.  Instead of dealing with personal exploration, it's about wanting to run away with someone else to another "life" that may only exist in his imagination.  Not bad.   "She is Love" (Noel) - Has a folk-rock-pseudo-soul feel.  Definitely pot-laced.  I think the Black Crowes rubbed off on Noel when they toured together last year.  It's Oasis doing a stripped-down version of "Soul Singing" on Lions.  Very catchy.    "Born on a Different Cloud" (Liam) - A blatant Lennon rip off, this song is drenched in "I'm Losing You"from Double Fantasy.  I swear Noel dug up George Harrison up and got him to replay the guitar solo from "How Do You Sleep?"  The lyrics are even more of an obvious theft, ala "living on borrowed time" and "It's no surprise to me/that you're classless, clever and free."  Yoko should sue have sued Liam for this one.  There's a kind of clever . . . er . . . interesting line: "Talking to myself again/this time I think I'm getting through."  If you like covers of John Lennon's solo work, you'll love this one.  "Better Man" (Liam) - The younger Gallagher takes his turn with a slightly Crowes-esque blues based rocker.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a rip off.  Very good song, certainly Liam's best.  Positive lyrics from Liam who, by all accounts, is a drunken lout.  Very, very subtly, it ends like "Nineteen Hundred Eighty Five" by Paul McCartney/Wings, which probably is no accident.  This track is something like 38 minutes long.  I thought something was wrong with my CD or the player because there was almost a ? hour of silence.  Fast forward to minute 33 and there's a nice little surprise.    Heathen Chemistry falls squarely in the middle of the pack of Oasis albums.  It's better than some but worse than others.  It is a nice transition album between Standing on the Shoulders of Giants and Don't Believe the Truth.  3.5 stars would be a more than fair rating for it, but I'm rounding up rather than down, and giving it 4 stars.  
  Michael Jackson begins the book with a guide to the ingredients of beer and the types of beer and how they are brewed.  That is very informative if you are a beer lover.  He neglects the Westvleteren 12 but that is perhaps because it is near impossible to find in the United States.  Under each beer is a wonderful description of the taste plus a picture of the glass and the suggested serving temperature.  The serving temperature and the type of glass are critical.  Enjoy this brilliant mans book.  By the way he really knows his history 
 Children not only learn what they live but also what they see around them and in the media.  This book isn't exactly a parenting book.  With each value of the poem, she gives examples to reinfore that value 
 Angie is a struggling actress in New York. She also has a penchant for dating men, dumping them, then getting invited to their weddings.  After the third boyfriend in a row calls to advise he is on his way to the altar, Angie decides that she is tired of "loosening the lid" for other women to pop open, and sets out to make her current beau, Kirk, her betrothed. Though they have been dating for nearly two years, Angie has yet to meet his family who live near Boston.  She enlists advice from an old friend from work, who later turns out to not really know what she is talking about. From day one, she plays games with Kirk to become more elusive. It works, and he starts to take the bait. Then Angie wonders, "what was I thinking" as she evaluates whether or not they are meant to be. She is still trying to find herself and not ready to start a family, while Kirk is a workaholic, driven to succeed with his start up software company, and he is not really supportive of her chosen profession.  Angie's family is a hoot - a loud, proud, Italian family from Brooklyn - especially her 84-year old grandmother who is tired of being widowed and steps out with the local butcher, much to Angie and her family's chagrin. They are the polar opposite of Kirk's frosty parents.  Is Angie really ready to settle down and settle all for the sake of being married? Is there perhaps someone else she has had feelings for all along?  Maybe someone right under her nose...  The only flaw in the book was the lack of depth of some of the characters - particularly Justin and Grace. But given that the book was first person - it is probably understandable. Looking forward to reading the follow up - Bombshell - which highlights Grace's romantic struggles. 
 There seems to be so much missing music on this thing that was in the film, or even in the title menu (which I have no idea about because I actually saw it on the IFC channel), but there is one particular song that I didnt hear on the album either. Its hard to even describe it but theyre playing it when he first gets invited to the house and the boy and Theo are walking through the hallways. Its like this really cool kind of guitar thing going. I dont know. Does anyone have any idea what the hell Im talking about????? 
 I was a guest at the recent CD Release Concert in Atlanta. There are really no typical words to describe the concert. It was not just an awesome concert, but it was a life-changing experience. God's oil has truly anointed this young man to accomplish great exploits through this CD. Songs like "Another Place" and "Unfailing Love" will find their way into your spirits and encourage true worship and dependence on our Maker 
 This books gets better with each new edition.

This book comes highly recommended, do yourself a favor and use it to achieve your dreams of being a success in the music industry.  The best money you will ever spend. 
 Review of "HALO"  By DJ Stephens  You step out into a night darker than the Devils hip pocket. Your breathing is assisted by the oxygen bottle attached to your chest as you plummet towards the earth. Everything you need to accomplish your mission is attached to your body because when you do land it will be in enemy territory, where even the smallest mistake could be your last. This is what the Army calls HALO, high altitude low opening, you call it all part of the job, because you are Jeff Barkil, one of the first Snipers to work in Southeast Asia.  In the tradition of W.E.B. Griffin we get a look at the covert operations that may have been happening in the late 50's in Viet Nam through the eyes of Jeff Barkil an elite sniper working for the CIA during the time just before our involvement became public. Come free fall from 20,000 feet into the enemies' back yard. Move through the jungle with the stealth of a natural predator as you stalk your targets. Learn the risks and benefits of working with a team.  This is every bit as good as Mr. Stephens first book "Bearkiller" if not better. A definite page turner. 
 In "How Not to Write: the Essential Misrules of Grammar," William Safire, nitpicker extraordinaire, wags his finger at sloppy writers.  Using large doses of gentle humor, Safire introduces "fumblerules," mistakes that call attention to basic rules of grammar, usage, and style.  Safire, who warns us to avoid the overuse of alliteration, calls his compilation a "ferocious farrago of instructive error," that is "designed to straighten you out without weighing you down."  In fifty brief chapters, Safire wittily taps the reader on the shoulder, and, with a smile and a wink, he urges us to avoid such writing gremlins as run-ons, misplaced modifiers, mixed metaphors, and improper punctuation.  This book offers little that is new for fussbudgets who already adhere to the basic rules of correct writing.  Most people who write for a living or as a hobby routinely avoid double negatives, always use commas and conjunctions with care, and would never allow too many cliches to clutter their prose.  For such readers, this book is not an instructional guide as much as it is an entertaining review.    "How Not to Write" will serve as a useful introduction for novices who need to sharpen their writing skills.  They will learn the proper use of a semicolon, when to adopt a formal or colloquial writing style, and why euphemisms usually "deserve termination with extreme prejudice."  This slim volume is not a textbook or a workbook.  There is no table of contents or index, and the chapters are not organized in any obvious manner.  "How Not to Write" is a painless and amusing primer by a Pulitzer Prize winner who writes a language column for the "New York Times."  If you liked the bestselling book "Eats, Shoots & Leaves," you will also enjoy this lighthearted look at the rules of writing by one of America's most respected wordsmiths. 
 Martin Scorsese's new epic film "The Aviator" makes broad use of a good deal of source material, songs and music from Hollywodd in the transitional period from the 1920s to the 1940s, a period also considered the "Golden Age" of Hollywood in general, and film scoring in particular.  The source music is well represented on the "soundtrack" album.  The film is also very indebted to an orchestral score by Howard Shore who has clearly now come into in his own.  In the wake of "The Lord of the Rings," Shore would have been allowed something of a weak encore, but instead we have another musical triumph. Though not on a scale with "The Lord of the Rings," Shore's music for "The Aviator" proves again that Howard Shore is one of the great composers of film music(we cannot wait for his score for Peter Jackson's "King Kong").  The underlying motif here is the early growth of aviation in general and indeed in film through the life of Howard Hughes, all spectacular stories in and of themselves.  Shore's score does indeed soar to this end with a grand main theme that is in the heroic category.  The opening of the album has been described as a take on the Baroque, but in fact as that section and the rest of the score develops it is much more akin to what could be called contemporary classical music such as that of Paul Hindemith who did some of his best work in that so-called "Golden Age," the 1930s and the 1940s (note Hindemith's "Symphonic Metamorphisis of Themes by Carl Maria Von Weber" for instance-especially the "March"). As such Shore has done something quite remarkable, original but subtly reflective of the period depicted in the film (his inclusion of Spanish motifs is also in this vein).  This is a dynamic, exciting and dramatic score that seems perfect for the time, the place, the figure, and the story.  Sadly, some of the Shore music was replaced in the film with classical and source material.  The album works quite well on its own, and is nicely produced and packaged by Decca.  By the way, Shore conducts The Flemish Radio Orchestra.  The performance is flawlewss, but this will be the answer to a trivia question sometime this year.  A Golden Globe winner for Best Score, but amazingly left out of the running for the Academy Awards. The soundtrack album is ok but quite different than the "Original Score" album reviewed here 
 I hadn't heard about this movie before, until I came across the influences for the Silent Hill videogames. The Changeling was one of them, as well as other movies, books and TV shows. The movie has it's strong point in the story and the time the movie takes to "explain" the situations and the people. It's not just scares, it is more of a suspense thriller than a haunted house movie. It has good enough plot twists to make it more interesting than most "scary" movies. The comparison to The Shining is unavoidable, but no because of the type of story but because of the great delivery and overall quality of the two movies. A definite must-see, and an ovelooked classic 
 I first read Leon Stein's "The Triangle Fire," which discusses the Fire and its aftermath.  I made an excellent choice in von Drehle's book as a followup because of its depth of research and its discussion of factors leading up to the fire, including the strike that preceded it.  Excellent parallels are drawn between the 1911 Fire and the 2001 WTC disaster, right down to the workers being able to look out the windows at a beautiful clear day, and realizing that with the fire directly behind them, their only choice is to jump.  Heartbreaking, enraging and very educational.  Then, as now, business emerges unscathed while the workers pay the price - the Triangle owners went back to work, were completely exonerated of their negligence and were paid for their "trouble. 
 time & go with the audio(albeit abridged) version.I figured it would be light & easy. Not that Gleen isn't smart. It's just that there is no pretense to the man. His stories are interesting if his delivery leaves something to be desired. They reveal little about the inner man. It is a standard, straight ahead autobiography of a man who isn't a writer. He was sucessful in several different fields then retired to do the best part all over again. Hero is an overused word today. But he a real one. That's a go. So are his memoirs 
 These guys need to stick to creating great groove music, and stay away from politics.  In the cd cover the band members state: "We let de-humanising, corrupt insitutions like governments, armies, and banks dictate how we live and die.  We try to find joy and fulfillment in the excrement of these institutions: TV, fashion, professional sports.."  What army ever produced fashions, and what govt. agency produces TV shows?  Why isn't music included? These guys are obviously talented, but they need to bone up on some basic history and take a look around - don't they know that the new establishment producing the things they hate are CEO's of big communication companies 
 IT WAS VERY USEFUL TO SHOW MY AMISH FRIENDS HOW WE THINK THEY REALLY LIVE 
 I have just completed reading this book for a New Testament Theology class.  This book is amazing. I keep a good portion of my school books for future use on a book shelf.  This book does not belong on the book shelf, it belongs on my desk.  I recomend this book to anyone interested in the Theology of the New Testament 
 Rarely is such universal wisdom and guidance captured between book covers.  This book is a must read for anyone in search of objective truth and personal relevance 
 In it's few pages, it conveys such fear that it is almost unbelievable. It is "Aladdin" gone horribly wrong, with the only difference being the paw in the place of the Genie. The people who make their wishes, get them granted, oh yes, but in unusual circumstances...my favourite to this day 
 This book makes the greatest mousepad I've ever had.  Good book 
 I am very happy with the service I have received. It was shipped to me in Australia and arrived in excellent condition 
 Andrew Weil is wonderful.  One should always look into his books for sage advise.    
 This is a collection of 56 poems by various poets.  As indicated by Nancy Willard, the collection started in a shoebox, and it contains poems that are rhymed and unrhymed, traditional and experimental.  The collection starts and ends with poems by Emily Dickinson.  The longest is "The Witch of Coös" by Robert Frost which is 6 pages long.  The shortest is "The White Horse" by D. H. Lawrence which is three lines.  Some are well known, e.g., "The Tyger" by William Blake ("Tyger! Tyger! burning bright..."), while others were obscure before inclusion in the collection.  The total collection is 88 pages.  There is a short "Notes on the Poets" at the end of the volume. 
 Andy Snitzer stirs vibrant emotions in his album Ties that Bind.   His fresh command of the Alto and Tenor sax only accents the clever arrangements which enspirit his composition.   You can easily  associate  his cool lines with brisk images familiar yet mysteriously new to your  ears. His  rock-jazz style gently blends a tasteful,   Sanbornesque  impetuous line with his own intriguing timber.  This album is not only a  catch but also a keeper.      Buy this one 
 I liked this album.  It wasn't as good as his first album, but is not as bad as the Amazon.com review would have you believe.  The songs that save this album are "Took Her To The Moon,"  "Hold You Now,"  and the best song on the album, "Rest Of Mine."  It is a  beautiful love song that he wrote for his wife.  It was released shortly  after my mother and stepfather were married and they loved the song.   Overall, he needs to release a better album if he is going to stay in this  business much longer 
 Sick Puppy lives up to its name.  Hiaasen is as zany as ever, displaying his hilariously twisted sense of humor from the cover (by which this book can be judged) to the last page.  As usual, the heroes are eminently loveable in a deeply flawed and unstable sort of way, whereas the villains are far more respectable members of society--though equally eccentric and not nearly as loveable.  It's pure Hiaasen--a book by, for, and of sick puppies.  
 This is my favorite classical CD of all time.  I can't even put into words how much I love "Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun", lush music that transports my mind to the islands of the South Pacific.  I love the impressionist era in art, and this music is from the same time.  It fits.  "Images for Orchestra - Perfumes of the Night" is my other favorite track.  Much of the music exhibits a highly cinematic flair.   Sometimes I listen and feel like I am watching old movies.  Beautiful images flood my mind; intense emotions, color, and dramatic scenes.  Highly recommended.  Listen and dream 
 I bought this for my daughter's camera, and it is sleek, modern, stylish and durable.  Has a couple of small pouches inside for extra memory cards. It is by far the best case available for this camera, and I highly recommend it to others. 
 One of the greatest - maybe the greatest - album Mr. Waits has given us. Scratch that, one of the best albums anyone has given us.    A harrowing, modern opera with a pathetic Everyman for a hero, Frank's Wild Years has been burnt into many of our musical memories for almost 20 years.  From initial desperate disappearing act to the giddy leave taking of one's senses, helpless resignation and ultimately tragic denouement this album has haunted me from its first, nearly incomprehensible hearing to today.  A remarkable achievement that has not lost a drop of its power or relevance.  You're innocent when you dream . . . 
 "The Mind of Boys..." provides an outstanding insight into the minds of our sons.  This should be required reading for all parents and teachers.  The information is presented in a manner that it is easy for anyone to comprehend.  This book is a great reference tool to help parents and teachers understand how our sons minds work so that we can assist them in their development without destroying the wonderful "boyness" that resides within each of them 
 I first discovered Robert Lacey as an author from his book 'The Year 1000'.  Interesting, accessible, easy to follow, with a good balance of detail and breadth (always a tricky task when writing a popular history), that book was one of my favourites around the turn of the second millennium.  I discovered this book on the shelves of my local library, and have found it equally worthwhile and fun to read.  This book concentrates on the late Middle Ages to the post-Reformation era in English history - in royal terms, the times of the end of the Plantagenets, the Tudors, the Stuarts, the Interregnum and Glorious Revolution (which a history professor of mine once intoned dramatically, 'was neither glorious nor a revolution').  In years, this goes from the late 1300s to the late 1600s.    One of the things that I like a lot about this particular history is that the stories are brief and self-contained while being part of the overall flow of the history of England.  They make for good bed-time reading (the longest of the stories is barely seven pages long, in easy print and easy, storytelling language).  Many of the characters are already familiar figures even to those who aren't Anglophiles - Joan of Arc, Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth the First, Shakespeare, King James and the English Bible.  Then there will be figures that are lesser known but just as interesting - the Roundheads and Cavaliers, Rabbi Manasseh, Titus Oates, the Bloody Assizes.  These are tales told in a simplified but memorable manner, and could serve for younger and older readers as a stimulus for further reading and investigation about topics brought up in the text.   There are a few maps, royal lineage charts, and woodcut/line art drawings throughout the text.  Lacey includes a bibliography for further reading (this contains a good number of website addresses for making further research very easy).  There is also an index, which many popular histories forget, but Lacey is to be highly praised for including one here, making looking up particular names, places and events very easy.    
 1963's "Charade", boasting the once only teaming on screen of eternally debonair Cary Grant and the totally delightful Audrey Hepburn is for me what perfection on screen should definately look like. Indeed with these two legendary performers combining in a tense as well as at times amusing espionage caper set against the background of a never more beautiful Paris what more could you possibly ask for? Directed with flair in the Hitchcock mold by veteran Stanley Donen the two leads have never been better than here and it's a tragedy that Cary Grant retired forever from acting soon after "Charade", thus removing the chance of these two perfectly matched actors ever working together again. What we are left with however is a fast moving, tension filled and extremely good looking thriller that uses the familiar themes of murder, mistaken identity, and an assortment of unsavoury characters all with hidden agendas to create a totally delightful confection that would never be able to be duplicated in today's Hollywood where depicting effortless elegance on screen is a largely forgotten artform by most film makers.    
 Beautiful photos of recipes, however, not all recipes have a photo.  Have not made any of the recipes yet, but sure look appetizing.  
 Naipaul gives a very impressive account of a part of the country that is, as said before, " a nation unto itself". It delves into the psyche of white and black minds. It exposes what Gunnar Myrdal termed  "An American Dilemma" over four decades ago. I am saddened  however by Naipaul's persistent condesending references to the Black  African subcontinent. This theme is quite evident in his other works. It  makes me wonder whether a man so gifted in describing the intricacies of  horrific social designs is himself afflicted with innate prejudice 
 My seven year old loves reading these books over and over again. While she is enjoying the books, she is learning about different places and times in history. She's learned about the Amazon, the wild west, hawaii, the civil and revolutionary wars, the middle ages, ocean mammals, and so much more. I highly recommend the whole series 
 I am a HUGE Will Ferrell fan.  I am also a huge Vince Vaughn fan, so when you get them together with a script allowing them to take over and expose their comedic genius then I am all for it.  Sure, Luke Wilson is the star but put him on the screen with either of the aformentioned and he fades into the backdrop.  The film revolves around three friends, each of which are having women troubles.  You have Frank (Ferrell) who has just got hitched but his marriage is already having trouble.  Then theres Mitch (Wilson) who just caught his girlfriend (Julitte Lewis) having some S&M fun with a few people in their house.  And finally we have Beanie (Vaughn) who is successful and married to a beautiful woman (Leah Remini) and has two children but is missing the fun he once had with booze and young women.  So, in an effort to bring themselves up from the slump they are in they decide to throw a large party at Mitch's new house near the local college campus.  The party is a success and they are the new kings of the town.  (The whole 'Frank the Tank' scene is the greatest scene in the film)  There's one problem, and his name is 'Dean' Gordon Pritchard (Jeremy Pivon in a hilarious role).  Gordon has history with the three party animals and is determined to have them evicted.  So, in an effort to save their home they start a fraturnity which turns into the base for one hilarious film.  Cameos from the likes of Snoop Dogg and Sean Williams Scott as well as the always funny Andy Dick give this film even more cred.  Throw in the spark of a new love for Mitch with the beautiful Nicole (Ellen Pompeo) and her jealous and perverted boyfriend Mark (Craig Kilborn) and throw in Elisha Cuthburt for good messure and you have a non-stop laugh fest that will never get old 
 In "The Year of the Jackpot", a statistician graphs the points of convergence  of cyclycal events.  Overlapping his graphs, he notices that the   wavy lines are approaching extremes.  Interesting times. The story "By His Bootstraps" is not logically sound: How did Bob Wilson get to the other side of the Gate so that he could operate the Gate before sending for the first version of himself? "The Menace From Earth" tackles Earth Moon female jealousy. "Sky Lift" details the heroism of a rocket pilot carying an antidote to the Pluto colony.  "Goldfish Bowl" asks: What if humans were kept as pets by disinterested intelligent beings?  "Project Nightmare" is about Psionic humans who are able to locate nuclear devices and prevent atomic  fusion -- using psi ability.  "Water is for Washing" is about a mega earthquake that creates a new sea between the Pacific Plate and the  North American Plate.  The Gulf of California extends to Los Angeles 
 Absolutely the ONLY book to have for exploring any state really.  State specific of course.  Enjoy my fellow explorers!! 
 This is a real page turner, and that's really saying something considering that this book is hella long.  Clavel is a real student Hong Kong high society, and it is fascinating to watch the Anglo Ian Dunross navigate his way through the Asian way, the mini series of this book is exceptional, I saw it as a kid, and I remember how much I wanted to be Pierce Brosnan, nobody could have inbodied Dunross like Brosnan.  If you enjoy a good read and love learning about a different culture then you will love this book, but be forewarned, is is LONG, and be sure to pick up the mini series it is a wonderful compliment to the book 
 This card work fine, as advertised. Install was a breeze. I highly recommend it to anyone 
 I like the Calcium Cookbook because it has a variety of recipes that are very good. I have already tried several of them and I haven't found one yet that I haven't liked. They are easy to prepare also. I recommend the Calcium Cookbook to anyone whether they are trying to get more calcium in their diet or whether they just want some good tasting recipes 
 Impossible that present day horses would beat any horse trained by Preston Burch.  Just read the exercise prescriptions in this book and be blown away.  I certainly was.  Here is carefully controlled training by a trainer understanding that his horses are participating in an athletic event.  This is a book about conditioning equine athletes and also contains every other aspect of training and caring for thoroughbred race horses in a well written book by an individual who apparently understood the great care required.  I held off reading this fearing it was dated, but what a pleasant surprise to find the extreme if succinct comprehensiveness here, every aspect is covered by a fellow who tried to do everything correctly.  This is Ivers before Ivers, and one does wonder whatever happened to trainers like Max Hirsch and Preston Burch 
 Like the top reviewer mentioned, this book is total theory. I had to get this book for my Introduction To Game Design class at Cornell University. Initially I wasn't really sure what Game Design truly was. This book helped solve that problem. But other issues which dealt with computer game implementation were not answered, because this book is NOT about that topic. Nonetheless, the book was very well written and more formal than other books on Game Design 
 A very well made documentary on a city wide public school dance contest that matches many several buroughs in NYC. The kids here are the "movie" and don't let down just being themselves. Funny early scenes include when dance partners are instructed to look at each other while dancing. This of course can be difficult as a grown up, but for kids it is almost unbearable. Another great wrinkle to this documentary are the interviews with the kids in regards to their dreams, visions, and their day-to-day lives. At times a little sad, but over all a delight to watch given their youthful ambitions and postive thinking.  All the contests are fun to watch and the winners were very much well deserving of the honors.  If you need a nice pick-me-up or just want to smile, watch this movie : 
   Even though it's 70 years after Lou Gehrig ran the bases, Mr. Eig has crafted a masterpiece that brings this athlete to life before our eyes. We see his rise to stardom as a quiet hero, and we see his hearbreaking descent into the physical hell of ALS.  Everyone knows how this book will end, but even so, the final act will leave you weeping.  What a man Gehrig was ! Strong, respectful, stoic, gentlemanly, polite. He played, lived and especially died with grace and dignity. Eig has written a book that will haunt you.  
 This book is about a skeptical journalist who finds himself on a most revelatory venture when he accompanies Ian Stevenson, noted reincarnation researcher, on trips to investigate cases.  He openly acknowledges his skepticism at the outset, and slowly reveals how he became convinced that there is something going on in the area of reincarnation studies.  Ian Stevenson is very cautious and methodical, rejecting any cases that have even a hint of taint of the subjects.  Under his exacting criteria, he still finds some cases that simply cannot be explained away as products of hoax, inadvertent communication of information, or the great catchall, "coincidence" or "lucky guesses."  I appreciated how Mr. Shroder revealed his skepticism and came to an understanding that there is a lot more going on in the universe than what can be explained through traditional approaches to reality 
 In Monstrous Regiment, Terry Pratchett paints a comic picture of the military in a world in that parallels our own. When everything is clear, you find out in the middle of this novel is that this picture is upside down and only bits of it are revealed to you.  We ride in the passenger seat of this adventure with Polly Perks. Polly, a hotel maid, decides that it is her duty to find and protect her missing (dimwitted) brother, who has joined the military. The obvious best way to do this is to dress up like a man and join the military herself.   Along the way we find out who is "running the show" and see that a ragtag bunch of miscreants (Polly's Regiment) can be very functional and indeed creative in achieving their perspective goal(s). 	 In the end Pratchett brings the picture into focus, in the same means as bringing a kaleidoscope into focus. The story was fun and I found myself rooting for the good guys, um girls 
 An outstanding final statement by Big Country.  Solid songwriting and playing from start to finish, including the additional songs not originally appearing on Driving to Damascus.  Two songs co-written with Ray Davies add extra appeal.  Tony Butler did a wonderful job re-mastering the project and Track Records should be proud of such a great project.   
 There are books that are OK, books you like, books you love, and then there a another whole class of very special uber-books that you flat-out enjoy, devour every page, and feel devastated when they are finished. The List of Seven is one of the latter types of books and I whole-heartedly recommend it to others. It gets a six star review from me. Set in Victorian England this book has everything a rollicking good adventure yarn should. Follow a young Arthur Conan Doyle as he gets swept up into a grand adventure with secret agent Jack as they race desperately around the country trying to foil a devilish plot against the crown. Murder, magic, mayhem, zombies, the occult, recidivist arch-nemeses, crazed aristocrats, beautiful girls, reformed second-story men, the British Museum....this is one crackerjack of a novel that will leave you panting for more.  This book features AC when he is still a struggling doctor and before he has penned the Sherlock Holmes stories. Indeed, as you read, you begin to see that the future Sherlock Holmes is built upon AC's experiences with his secret agent friend Jack, who himself is the model for Holmes. This is one of the most inventive, enjoyable and wonderful books I've read in recent years, a superior example of magic realism that thrills you to the last page. Make sure you don't miss the sequel, The Six Messiahs.   The author, Mark Frost, apparently had a hand in the Twin Peaks series, but don't let that fool you or keep you from reading these books. They are as much fun as you can have with a novel in my estimation. I am not sure why Mr. Frost has not written more novels but I surely wish he would. If this book, and the sequel, leave you wanting more fictional accounts of Arthur Conan Doyle battling with dark occult forces then don't miss Thomas Wheeler's "The Arcanum" either. It's another very enjoyable book in the same vein 
 Better than just a beach tote, sturdy bag for any occasion, good price 
 When the first edition of this book appeared in late 1999, it became the antidote for the scary books about Alzheimer's disease that have dominated the literature since the 1980s. By focusing on the early stages of the disease, Kuhn provides the right dose of help and hope to those struggling to come to terms with the myriad changes in roles and responsibilities of all concerned. The second edition provides updated information while leaving intact positive messages about living with Alzheimer's and not merely surviving through it. A new chapter gives voice to experienced family members who share valuable lessons. This book provides accurate information about the disease and useful tips that enable family members, friends and interested professionals to cope with someone's memory loss and other thinking problems. It's the one book that should be read by all starting down this difficult road. And doctors should be writing down this title on a prescription pad 
 Jack the Ripper is perhaps the best-known figure in history whose real identity is obscured. He killed (as far as we know) something between 4 and 9 women in London between 1887 and 1891. He was never caught, and there's no convincing proof anyone ever saw him clearly, let alone came upon him in the act of killing and tried to stop him. He became the subject of rumor and speculation while the killings were going on, and has since been a subject of much speculation and theorizing. "Solutions" to the crimes he committed range from various suspects to a conspiracy of the British Royal Family in some fashion all the way around to anti-Semitic conspiracies.  Author Philip Sugden decided to write this book, and work from as many original sources as he could, recounting only that information he was able to confirm from contemporary records. He generally dismisses newspapers of the era, and tries to rely on police files as much as possible. What emerges is a different picture of the killer and the murders than has been presented in the past, because many previous books have repeated the errors of others while recounting what they believe happened. Sugden does his best to avoid this.  The result is a well-written, detailed, exhaustive study of the killings themselves. Sugden recounts each of the killings in detail, and then spends considerable time telling of the police response to the crimes, their attempts to counter the killings, and especially their interrogations of witnesses. One point he makes clear is how primitive their forensic thinking was at the time: fingerprints were about a decade off yet, and it wasn't even possible to analyze bloodstains to tell if they were human or animal in origin. The police, as a result, depended to a great deal on witnesses and confessions. In crimes of passion or crimes of greed, those things worked reasonably well, but with a "stranger crime" where the killer and the witnesses probably didn't know the criminal, and he probably also didn't associate with other criminals, the chances of catching him were frankly minimal. That's what happened...they didn't catch him.  I really enjoyed Sugden's book. It contains a great deal of information. The author, in the latter part of the book, leans towards one of the suspects (George Chapman) but doesn't insist that he must have done it. He  does think it unlikely that Druitt, Kosminski, or Ostrog were the killer, but in each case his evidence is, like everything else at this remove, pretty much speculation. At least his speculation makes sense, however. Regardless, anyone who's interested in Jack the Ripper needs this book, definitely 
 The vast majority of Americans believe that the U.S. is engaged in a "Culture War,"  Indeed, this is true, but where they go wrong is in assuming that the war is carried out by two titanic forces known as the Democrat and Republican parties - the white and black-hatted combatants, or the black and white-hatted combatants, depending upon where the observer stands.  The truth is that BOTH parties are wearing black hats, and the raging battle played out daily in Washington and the various media outlets is for public consumption only.  The REAL war theater is elsewhere.  My best analogy is a "Punch-And-Judy" show.  While the audience (the public at large) is engrossed in the fisticuffs between two warring enemies, behind the scenes, a single entity controls both participants.  If you wish to see beyond the marionettes and get a look at the puppeteer, you'll need to read printed material that exists outside of The Establishment's  imprimatur.  Such as James Perloff's, 'THE SHADOWS OF POWER.'  I can hear a few of you balking already: "It sounds like he's referring to a...a...a...(shhh)...conspiracy."  Welcome to the REAL world, friend.  It's about time you woke up and smelled the arsenic!  'THE SHADOWS OF POWER' is a well-researched and well-written expose on the heart of the matter: The Council On Foreign Relations - which is not "Ground Zero" of the Conspiracy, but it does represent the visible moving parts, the meshing gears, the framers and roofers and electricians building 'The New World Order' structure from the blueprint provided by the "architects" hidden from public view - the "wizards" behind the curtain.  More than you know, you need to read this book if you.....  * Have no idea what the C.F.R. is and wants.  * Think the Federal Reserve, which controls the U.S. economy, is a government agency.  * Wonder why the U.S. sent young men to fight Communism in Asia only 3 years after permitting (and assisting in) the establishment of a Soviet satellite just 150 miles off the coast of Florida.  * Still can't figure out how and why the U.S. lost that war with two-bit Communists in Asia.  * Were watching nice little stories on the Seven O'Clock news about Presidents Bill 'n' Hill [*See them tote their Bible to church and sing praises with the congregation.]; their nice daughter, Chelsea; and their nice little dog, Buddy, while sensitive technology with military capability was being sold to the Red Chinese without comment from the mainstream media.  One chapter of particular interest is 'A Second Look At Ronald Reagan.'  Reagan "chalked up more government debt than all the Presidents before him COMBINED!"  He was touted as an enemy of taxation and big government, and yet, although he did cut tax rates, "also pushed through the largest single tax increase in our nation's history, as well as boosts in the gasoline and Social Security taxes."  Although critical of Jimmy Carter for abiding by the Salt II Treaty, which the Senate didn't ratify, later as President, Reagan ordered two Poseidon ballistic missile submarines DISMANTLED to ensure we stayed within Salt II limits.  And that's just the beginning!  'The Media Blackout' chapter is also very enlightening.  Here we learn of Nicaragua's former President, Anastasio Somoza's complaint about the deliberate hatchet job he received at the hands of Dan Rather and 60 Minutes.  It reveals the power to promote an agenda and sway the public perception that major print and media outlets possess.  And it should force most Americans to reconsider how many of their current beliefs might have been artificially induced by the manipulative mainstream media.  Perloff wrote this book while a member of The John Birch Society.  Hopefully by now he's realized that the J.B.S. is less than sincere in its efforts to combat global Collectivism.  Although the book was published in 1988, it's every bit as relevant now as it was then because the C.F.R. program hasn't changed - evidenced by today's headlines, and discerned by anyone who knows how the game is played.  If there's ONE thing I've learned in studying politics over these many years, it's this: It's NEVER what politicians SAY that counts; it's strictly what they DO.  To the detriment of the People of the United States, when the Democrat party takes power, it usually keeps its campaign promises.  Equally detrimental, the Republican party doesn't.  And because I love the U.S. Constitution, I despise them both!  Get this book and see who's standing in the shadows and pulling the strings on those two puppets. 
 This movie isn't as good as Purple Rain and the music is just okay but I love the scene with the song "Kiss" and I LOVE this movie. It's so funny and it's cute. And Prince is hott! 
 Bestselling author Truss makes the case that society is rude and getting ruder, painting a picture of a world where people can't say "please" or "thank you", don't apologize for anything, and drop f-bombs at will.  It's a funny book, and I enjoyed reading it. But I don't agree with her.  Do rude people and bad service experiences still exist nowadays? Of course they do. They have since the dawn of time, and every single one of us can rattle off a few choice examples of our own. But think critically: what is your typical, everyday experience with most people you encounter with your bank, your grocery store, or out in public? I'll wager that if you show these people at least a modicum of respect, most of them probably treat you professionally and courteously.  Unlike this author, I've managed large service operations and trained thousands of service employees, and one thing is clear: when you teach people how to handle customer situations, and reinforce it with positive coaching, most quote-unquote average people will in fact develop very good customer skills. Handling difficult customer situations is a skill, not just an attitude, and you need to invest in your people to make it happen.  Statistics actually bear me out on this point. Metrics like the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) have actually been trending upwards over the past few years, and leading companies continue to leverage the "science" of good service to build their market share. If you call Southwest Airlines to book a plane reservation, check on your package with FedEx, or return a shirt to Lands' End, it is highly unlikely that anyone will act disengaged or utter the F-word - and companies like these take their service training and workplace cultures all the way to the bank. Meanwhile, Darwinism continues to weed out the ruder siblings of these businesses, as they keep learning that it is hard to run a business without any customers.  One last point: find me a place where employees don't respect their customers, and I will bet you lunch that it is also a place where management doesn't respect their employees. In my experience, it's really simple - with respect, communications skills training, and coaching, the world is suddenly not such a rude place after all.  -Rich Gallagher, author of "Great Customer Connections" and "The Soul of an Organization 
 As this book begins, author Rosalind Leigh's world is falling apart.  Torn up by a failed marriage, she develops writer's block and is unable to pursue her career.  To jolt her out of the doldrums, her publisher decides to assign her the task of writing a book about Olive Martin, an obese woman who has confessed to the brutal slayings of her mother and her sister.  Rosalind is reluctant at first, but after meeting Olive, she develops a fondness for her and begins to suspect that she is incapable of committing the crimes she has confessed to.  Roz connects with Hal, the policeman who investigated the case, and they form a romantic partnership as well as an investigative one.  This is a well-written book which keeps the suspense going, although the pace is a little slow at times 
 The Preacher series is a "must have" for any collector of stories who likes a little extreme in their fantasy. Some of the greatest lines and characters are put forth by the incredible team of Ennis and Dillon. If one suspends disbelief on one's own feelings about God and the devil, one can enjoy lightheartedly this tale of servitude...or something 
 I have had this book for years and still enjoy readig it.I can not even edge the divinity of this magnificent work. To say the least, Gasazi is Allsburg's magnum opus. A wonderful read for all generations, especially children. I mean, the artwork is far better than regular children's litterary works. Then, a very rare story-line: A boy must venture far into the garden of a wealthy magician to retrieve his neighbor's canine. Far better than The Polar Express, in my oppinion. Now, don't get me wrong, the story-line is no Harry Potter, but still a good read 
 This is a fantastic book on palmistry and hand reading. Loads of great pictures and interesting text make it fun and easy to use. If you are even mildly interested in palmistry, definitely check this book out. It's also great to take to parties and family gatherings- people have a good time reading hands, and it's so clearly laid out that everyone can understand and enjoy. Highly recommended 
 There is a good reason you'd want to buy this from Amazon. The quality. Sure, you can watch it for free on CBS, but the quality isn't very good. It's streamed and the bitrate (quality) is low. Personally, I want to watch Survivor on my 50" plasma, not on my computer screen. So, I use Unbox + Windows Media Center to make that happen. Survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider.

 For lovers of the non-fiction accounts of sacrifices made in pursuit of honor, riches and glory, this book should be a great find. Readers will be convinced beyond doubt of the struggles Magellan and his crew endured in their historic voyage.  Masterfully recreated from several historical resources, biographer Laurence Bergreen brings to life the cost of bearing the title of Discoverer. Resurrected in the story are the deviousness of the human character, the lust for currency greater than gold - the spices, the once undoubted might of the former Spanish armada and the terrible cost for it all - the loss of human life.   Carefully constructed story coupled with an excellent writing, this should be on the reading list of every reader dreaming of the voyages of the glorious past.   - by Simon Cleveland 
 After recently reading and reviewing Nancy Werlin's THE RULES OF SURVIVAL, I went in search of some of her other books. I discovered DOUBLE HELIX, and it didn't disappoint me.  Eli Samuels, salutatorian of his graduating class, has decided to postpone college for a year. His father is not pleased. But Eli is struggling to decide just exactly where he is headed in life. Complicating matters are his relationship with his girlfriend and his mother's illness, Huntington's disease.  Eli and his father have been struggling with Ava's illness for many years, but the end is near. She is confined to a nursing home and not even aware of their visits. Eli's future is uncertain because Huntington's disease is hereditary. His mother may have passed him the gene which carries the disease. A simple blood test holds the answer, but Eli is not ready to know the truth.  Dr. Quincy Wyatt, a famous scientific researcher, offers Eli a job at Wyatt Transgenics. It involves caring for research animals and helping in the lab. The more Eli learns about Dr. Wyatt and the work of his company, the more he begins to question what he knows about his own life.  Using clever twists and turns, Nancy Werlin has created a real nail-biter that makes this book hard to put down.  Reviewed by:  Sally Kruger, aka "Readingjunky 
 UB40, have made a comeback with me.  I have been a fan of UB40 for many years.  I have always been impressed with their style.  When I found the Homegrown album, I was totally amazed.  This album you will never get tired of. Excellent music, stuff to grown on. Another good album from UB40 (but of course).   They have never, ever let me down.  I recommend every fan buy this one. 
 My son adores the Rocket Ship gimmick.  It is really not a big deal.  It is just a plastic rocket ship with a magnifier.  You use it to find a small letter in each place the Little Einsteins visit.  (The letters are visible even without the magnifier.)   It is cheesy, but what can I say?  My four year old son LOVES it.   One thing that bothers me is that the book lists countries--like France and Russia, but then the Little Einsteins end up in Africa.  Excuse me, Africa is a huge continent, not a country.  (They mention it is Kenya.  But the list at the end of the book says AFRICA.)  I grew up thinking that Africa was a country--I don't want my son to think so, too!  Basically, I don't like that it mixes countries and continents together 
 I have given this book to several people in my sales team when they have been experiencing  call reluctance.  They like the book and half of them were able to overcome their problem.  
 Great response in getting the book to me.  this book will come in very handy in the future 
 It really shed light on some concepts that other books simply do not discuss. It is also the only one I know that gives a theoretical basis for understanding dimensional regularization 
   Remember the O. Henry tale of love where the man sells his watch to buy an ornament to his love's beautiful long hair? And she sells her hair to buy him something? John Mortimer updates the meme.    Terry Keegan is a small-time, young burglar about to be released from prson. Lucy Purefoy is an idealistic young woman who believes, more or less, that love and goodness can change the world, so she joins SCRAP (Social Carers, Reformers and Praeceptors). As a praeceptor, Lucy is to befriend a released prisoner and help him or her find a job, a place to live and keep them on the straight and narrow. Praeceptors are, of  course, not to become their charges' friends and especially not their lovers.    You know what's going to happen, don't you?    Terry knows that there is a better, higher road in life, but he doesn't want Lucy's help. He'll find his own way, thank you. Lucy, of course, knows, just knows, she can change Terry's course in life.    The story is told in alternating voices, first Lucy, then Terry. Along the way, author John Mortimer introduces us to characters who are a hilarious send up of contemporary mores. There's Lucy's father, a bishop who doesn't think God is on his side any more, not since the deity smiled upon Bush and Blair. Lucy's mother is an genteel alcoholic, totally self-absorbed. Lucy herself reflects the values of the age, never without a man of the moment in her bed. In all, Mortimer skillfully and efficiently describes our era, where traditional values have been abandoned for . . . well, for whatever strikes one's fancy.    Of course, Lucy and Terry begin their descent along the slippery slope of love. Terry wants to earn the respect of Lucy by doing good. Lucy wants to bond with Terry by understanding what keeps him burgling houses.    The plot is predictable as is the climax, but it's still lots of fun as Lucy and Terry wend their way through one hilarious episode after another. Mortimer has an easy style and is, overall, delightful.    Definitely a light read, but always a very enjoyable one.  Jerry

 As I looked for a book that would assist my dearest friend, plan the perfect wedding for her daughter?I was fortunate enough to come across a copy of ??The Perfect Wedding Cake??. This beautifully photographed collection of wedding cakes not only provided us with practical information (such as how to choose a baker, in addition to a resource guide to the best cake designers in the US), it made a glorious coffee table book as well.  Moreover, the recipes inspired my single friends to create some of the cakes for occasions that call for a touch of ??decadence??! Why wait for a wedding to make one of these gorgeous cakes 
 This book is phenomenal.  Darbyshire debuts with strong writing and even stronger characters.  Best books I have read so far this year 
 My Lord John was Georgette Heyer's last book. It was supposed to be the first of a 3 part series but she died before completing it. It is the story of John the second son of Henry IV, brother to Henry V and grandson of John of Gault. The book begins in the nursery playroom with three little boys and dances back and forth between the views of their beloved grandfather, their father, their step grandmother, Katherine Swynford, the strange and sometimes insane Richard II and back again to each one of the boys. This is an impressive literary feat. Getting into a character's head and making that character come to life for the reader is hard and Heyer did it beautifully. Their are heroes here and villains, pitiful victims and people who were simply trying to get along. Heyer brought the Middle Ages to life. What a shame that she never got to finnish the series 
 This is one of the best non-fiction selections I've ever encountered.  It does justice to its esteemed topic, both in its superb photographic selections and its rich and highly informative text.  Far more than a mere coffee table book, Mr. Keane's solid understanding and sensitive insight have created a work which I refer to often in my own gardening ventures.  I cannot recommend this book more highly 
 The house of scorpion was an extremely exciting book. It kept you constantly guessing what was going to happen next. What i did not like about the book was that Matt started out [..], and by the end of the book, he was [..]. Otherwise The House of the Scorpion always gave a new twist to the story 
 As MATA HARI, Garbo shows us hints of what was soon 2 come(Queen Christina, Camille) but in THIS film she is a sexy siren. No wonder 20s and early 30s people fell head over heals for her. All other "goddesses" are pale shadows. There was nothing as magical as Garbo. The script is corny at times, Lionel B. hams  his part(see Mickey Rooney "do him" in BABES IN ARMS 1939) but the film has a magic air that is spellbounding... In no way a great thriller or a suspenser(laughable when it is attempting 2)but a great GARBO vehicle. Roman Novarro is OK but is ruined with some of the lines he has to say 
 You have worked hard and done a superb job, at least by your own perception.  But it always seems that others around you are more successful.  Depressing?  Similarly, in almost every aspect the company that you just invested is a good company and has been under valued for a long time.  But the company keeps under valued.  The three laws of perception described in this book will tell you the reasons and much more.  More importantly, the author shows the ways to deal with perception of others to in many aspects of your life.  Highly recommended, especially for new graduates entering a different world from school 
 It got seriously wet when the canoe capsized, but kept on going. Not under the water, just well into it. Even the actually submerged 70-300 lens came back to life once it dried out. 
  Everyone is a photographer but there are few whose work stands out above the rest.  If you are working in digital and want to take your work to the next level, this book is for you.  It is authored by a master teacher and photographer, one who has a living connection to Ansel Adams and Minor White--two earlier photographers who helped photography become an art form.  George DeWolfe carries on their tradition. 	His book is not just about digital photography and the fine print. It is about seeing and feeling, about light and color, about artistry and craftsmanship; it is about intimately connecting with what you are photographing, about pride in the image you create and reverence for the fine print. 	The book is nicely designed with hundreds of color photographic examples supporting and enriching the text.  Photographs are shown in pairs, side-by-side, to allow the reader to make direct comparisons of a good print and a really fine print, to see the subtle differences that elevate a print to near perfection. 	This book is a must for every serious photographer who wants to practice digital photography as an art form. I enthusiasticlly recommend it.   Richard D. Zaki 
 Dan T. Carter argues that George Wallace might be one of the more influential politicians in American history. He showed conservatives that racist rhetoric was a vote getter and that southern discontent over the civil rights movement could be mined for election to national office.   Carter is a professor of history at Emory University whose research interests are southern politics. His previous works include The Politics of Rage, which solely studies George Wallace's subconscious and enduring legacy on southern politics. It shows that Carter knows his research in this still-troubling field.    The Nixon campaign took careful notes of Wallace's 1968 and 1972 attempts because white racists subsequently became one of the groups backing the 1972 Nixon campaign. The Nixon campaign had marketed themselves as a return to simpler times, when everything was 'good'. Ignoring the sociolegal realities for most Americans, this approach then virtually presented civil rights policies as an encroachment upon that social standard.   The southern strategy also implied that African Americans themselves were responsible for the resulting social disorder in their communities and had actually been making trouble where there initially was none. Blaming the victim was a convienient way to ignore long-festering racial problems and win elections in the south. It also yielded national election wins for the GOP in the once-solid south.     The Republicans would exploit racial fears again during the 1988 campaign. Lee Atwater, Bush Sr's campaign manager ran a campaign against Michael Dukakis which ultimately elevated racist campaigning to an unprecedented level. Willie Horton was a convicted criminal who had committed a rape and armed robbery while he was out on a Massachusetts weekend release program.   "Independent" television campaign ads supporting Bush emphasized that Willie Horton was a black man. The idea was to 'scare' white voters into believing that Horton would rape their families and/or themselves. Dukakis's election as president would have 'presumably' allowed black men across the country to run around raping whomever they wanted.   Ironically, Dukakis was portrayed as a flaming liberal while he was centrist in comparison to the competing presidential campaign of Jessie Jackson. Both he and Dukakis's running mate, Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen publically called the ads 'racist'.   Finally, welfare reform occurred in 1996 because conservative Republicans were long-convinced that 'welfare queens' were abusing the system and were able to convince voters of the stereotypes. Again, the play to racism paid off for the right. Many of the conservative Republicans who were elected in 1994 were more conscious of their need to appear publicly 'inclusive' than was the Wallace-Nixon generation, but they also did race baiting. Carter concedes that President Clinton (who was a moderate Democrat)did sign that same 'welfare reform' measure, but his analysis focuses on how the Congressional Republicans had such an easy time attacking this program.     The Republican Party is now trying to make public overtures out to the African American community. They are publicly repudiating the ethics of the southern strategy as described in Carter's book because it in effect has demonized blacks for votes. Yet, because the strategy was/is wildly successful garnering votes, the GOP is in an ethical bind. Do they forfeit something which they know is a proven vote-getter or do they try to take the high road and imagine what Abraham Lincoln would have done in the 21st century. Carter's research suggests the answer will be ground in political expediency.        
 Despite its title, "Breast Cancer Husband" is really a book that I'd highly recommend not only to husbands but to siblings, children, parents, friends--in short, to anyone who cares about a woman with breast cancer--as well to the woman herself. The book has much to recommend it: thorough research, jargon-free prose, experts' opinions, survivors' stories, common-sense advice, humaneness and sensitivity, and (this came as a surprise) moments of true hilarity. After you've read it and absorbed its lessons (sample: Shut up and listen), you may be tempted to say, "I knew that!" Guess what? You didn't. 
 If you are going to read only one book on nationalism theory, this is the one.  Smith sets out the major theories of nationalism and examines them critically, while effectively arguing for his own vision of "modern" nations deriving from "ancient" ethnic affiliations (ethnies).  The one major fault of this book is that, like most of the literature on nationalism, Smith is better at defining what nationalism is not than what it actually is.  His differentiation between "ancient" ethnies and "modern" nations is critical, but muddled; his assertion of a direct relationship between these two concepts is less flexible than the rich tapestry of contemporary nations deserves.  Despite these problems, it is still a brilliant and indispensible book.     
 I bought this on a whim cos' it was $2.99.  It's super!

 This is one of my favorite Lennon albums filled with lovely melodies (Whatever Gets You Through the Night, #9 Dream), revealing and ironic lyrics (Nobody Loves You When You're Down and Out; Steel and Glass) and a classy production.  It has a little for everyone from romantic ballads (Bless You) to rockers (You Don't KNow What you Got).  John's vocals are in fine form and he is backed by top notch musicians.  I noticed that another commentator stated that John was in an "artistic slump."  I wish every artist would have a "slump" like this.  This release shows what John was capable of once out from under "The Yoke." It is no wonder that Walls and Bridges features two top ten hits (Whatever Gets You Thru the Night and #9 Dream), was a Top 10 LP, and was one of his best selling releases at the time 
 I found this book to be a good buy for a complete sewing novice. It walks you through basics such as basic stiches, hemming, fastenings and darning - things that are not at all touched upon in the more advanced books on sewing. However, the sections on advanced machine sewing techniques were not detailed enough, for these I would still go to the other guides 
 Recipes pepper Hidden Kitchens: Stories, Recipes, and More from NPR's The Kitchen Sisters, but Hidden Kitchens is more than just the chronicle of the beloved National Public Radio Morning Edition series. As part of the Hidden Kitchen project, two women called The Kitchen Sisters put forth an NPR hotline and asked listeners, "What food traditions are disappearing from your life? Who glues your community together through food? What should be captured and documented before it disappears or changes beyond recognition?" The response came like an avalanche. Hundreds of humorous, profound, wistful, and heart-rending true stories were submitted; the best of them are presented in Hidden Kitchens, along with recipes, color photographs, and illustrations. From food in the galleys of Great Lakes ships to a secret civil rights kitchen in Montgomery, Alabama, the stories Hidden Kitchens all have in common the zest to create great food, and through taste, help human beings connect with one another. Highly recommended. 
 I was moved by the way the fabric of faith was woven into each book chapter, as it should be entwined into each page of my life.  This book gave me a new perspective on my family and their enternal value.  Dale Salwak has the heart of a storyteller and the pen of a poet 
 well where to start,again rankin astuonds me with his talent.The plots  always twist and turn but never to the extreme of you losing the thread,  beatifully deep rich characters with a high sense of realism.

 I don't give five stars very often, but this book deserves it!  Without a doubt, it's the best Christian fiction I've ever read.  The plot is clever and the characters are well-developed.  The writing style is excellent.  Peretti's unique style sparkles, but never gets in the way of the story.  Not everyone will agree with Peretti's interpretation of spiritual warfare (it IS fiction, after all), but his portrayal of the behind-the-scenes battle between angels and demons and their interaction with humans comes across as very believable.  Whether you totally agree with Peretti's speculations or not, I believe the Lord has really used him to focus attention on the Bible's often-neglected teaching about spiritual warfare -- sometimes we Christians forget we're in a battle!  An epic adventure that entertains as well as edifies and encourages (a little alliteration, there), This Present Darkness is a must read. 
 With less science fiction or fantasy elements than is usual in a Circlet Press book, this small collection of short erotica is nontheless very entertaining and arousing.  Once more the stories cover several different  orientations providing almost anyone with something to enjoy 
 Ms. Burrell does an excellent job of providing an informative yet concise look at the complex business of rental property management.  This book is a must read for novice investors as it allows one to enter the business with eyes wide open - aware of pitfalls and precautions that can be taken to protect the investment.  Alternatively, there are so many forms, examples, techniques, and tricks for the experienced manager that it is a great read for them as well.  Truly a great resource for any RPMS library - or toolbox, as the case may be 
 I guess people in the 19th Century had alot of time on their hands to spend reading a long book that goes over the same material again and again.  I read this as a book on tape.   The book for me was alittle longish and dull so I doubt I would have been able to read it in its hardcopy form without giving up on it. However, thanks to books on tape, I was able to stick with the book until its end.  Yes, do read the book!   Apparently Balzac, poor fellow, was himself a victim to debts and even penury.   I read in the bio that he never made much money from his writing.  I was sorry to hear that.  In this book there are innumerable mentions about the financial plight of his characters----their debts,  going into debt, mortgages on houses that can't be paid, borrowing money that can't be repaid, the threat of debtors prison and arrest imminent.  So, if you think you have "financial problems" your "problems" will seem miniscule compared with the characters in this book!  Yes, this book is worth reading as long as you are patient and don't get bored too easily. I at first gave it 3 stars but then I felt sorry for Balzac so I raised it up to 4---I suppose a 3.5 would be more a more accurate guage of my opinion about this book.  Actually, it is well written.  Don't let me dissuade you from giving it a try.  You'll find alot in the book to enjoy and you will learn about what life was like in Paris during the first part of the 1800's.  The courtesans sounded interesting to me...but don't tell my wife!  :o)  Email Boland7214@aol.c 
 This book contains just about everything you'll ever need to know.  the author has done exhaustive research, and it pays off.  the descriptions are very clear for the most part, although the illustrations could stand some  reworking.  a really excellent book for beginners, but with lots of new  information for the more advanced, too.  a really highly recommended  manual 
 The documentary "The Yes Men" follows the exploits of a team of people who've made it their mission to provide "Identity Correction" to various corporate entities. The Yes Men originally started their activities on a website parodying Bush, and then they expanded their efforts, and for the purposes of this film, their main focus is the World Trade Organization.   To the Yes Men, Identity Correction means using satire and parody to present the truth and the ugliness behind the public facades which hide "leaders and corporations who put profits ahead of everything else." According to the Yes Men, the WTO's policies are presented as an inherently 'good thing' but the reality is exploitive and frequently devastating to smaller, less powerful countries. Taking the idea "what can't corporations get away with?" the Yes Men get themselves invited to various lectures and conferences and there make the most outrageous presentations focusing on just how their host corporations can exploit the workers. This is really hilarious stuff, and the Yes Men--literally and figuratively--certainly have giant b*lls.  The Yes Men's philosophy of Identity Correction reminds me of the activities of the Biotic Baking Brigade--although the Yes Men's activities obviously require a great deal of staging and acting. The film could have used some solid facts and figures about the WTO--its effects of Jamaica's economy for example (See "Life and Debt"). But as it is, "The Yes Men" concentrates on the funny side of their message. And while this makes for a vastly entertaining film, the documentary misses an opportunity to weave valuable information into the film. If the viewer is seeking information about the WTO, look elsewhere, but if you want to discover the Direct Action tactics of the Yes Men, then you'll be entertained--displacedhuman 
 It's 1904, 12 year old,Orphelia Bruce has always wanted to sing and play her piano at the World's Fair in St. Louis and she wants to meet the famous Madame Meritta. She lives in Calico Creek, Missouri, and her mother finds it sinful to sing "Sassy" music and that only church music is acceptable. Her mother favors her daughter Pearl, who lies all the time, and her father just smokes all day. One day after she is forbidden to perform in the talent show she runs away and finds herself in one of Madame Meritta's coaches! There she gets acquainted with the strange and scraggly Reuben, Othello, and the glorious Madame Meritta herself. Orphelia finds out that show business is not as glamorous as she thought it would be and finds out spooky things about her family's past 
 I'm normally not an indie rock fan, but I've always been a fan of the music on the show.  This soundtrack is awesome--it's eclectic and powerful and I honestly couldn't stop listening to it for over a week in the car

 Though not familiar with this revised edition, I use the Louis Segond translation when I read the Bible in French.  It is an edition that is both faithful to the original texts, and readable.  Now, I am aware that there has been some concern over the use of the feminine word 'parole' to refer to 'the Word' in the beginning of the Gospel according to John(L'ï¿½vangile selon Jean); allow me to make a quick explanation (coming from a French-speaker whose native tongue is English).  There are two words that can be translated 'word' in French.  One of these is 'mot,' which is masculine in gender, but means literally, one spoken or written word.  The other is the feminine 'parole,' which is closer to the Greek 'logos.'  This means that some verses would seem to be referring to Christ (the Word) as a 'she.'  However, this is only a problem in English.  In French, it is common for a man to refer to himself in the feminine, or in the plural, just as it is common for a woman to refer to herself in the masculine, or in the plural.  French nouns, unlike English, all have gender (there are no 'neuter' nouns).  When one refers to oneself, the gender of the personal pronoun is in accordance with the gender of the noun to which it refers, not to the speaker.  For example, I could say 'Ma femme,' meaning 'my wife.'  The personal pronoun 'ma' is feminine, yet it indicates that the word 'femme' is feminine, not that I am a woman.  Likewise, when the Word is referred to as 'la Parole,' it is not an indication of Christ's gender, but the gender of the word 'parole.'  
 The second book in the Mag Force 7 trilogy (hopefully more will be made!) Great space adventure with likeable characters 
 This CD has music that might seem a little cliche to the showtune genre if you haven't seen the musical.  There are some people though who absoulutely loooove that.  But after you actually see the energy in the tap dancing and  the choreography of the show, the music on the CD is able to vividly  repaint the images in your mind.  So if ya love showtunes or have seen the  musical, this CD is definitely a good buy for you

 My son got this for his birthday.  He LOVES it and uses it whenever the weather lets him.  After only 1 week of using it a plastic part broke on it. It still works, but not the exactly way it's supposed to.  
 Thanks to a co-worker, I have just discovered this series. I was spellbound with Outlander, rapt with Dragonfly/Amber and just got a copy of Voyager. I've always enjoyed historical fiction; and having lived in Scotland, at one time, was drawn to these books. I probably discovered Outlander long ago but imagine I put it down because it was written in the first person--I didn't used to read fiction written in the first person. Now, I can't get enough. I can 'hear' the Gaelic or Scottish accent as if I'm still standing in Falkirk where I lived in the early 70s. I can 'see' the Carfax Close in Edinburgh, various standing stones I encountered and remember trying to peek into windows around Callander House. Reading these books has brought back many happy memories! Thank you Diana Gabaldon AND my co-worker, Patricia 
 This book is an excellent resource for those in the design business.  Great details and sketches give information on how designs and special features of very famous places were achieved.  This book has great visuals of all those extras that make each space unique.  A must see

 Easy to read, very helpful, gives tips on what to say when someone is asking for your advice 
 This book is more than entertaining, the author provides insight and a tool to better understand ourself and others.  It was interesting to learn that in my office I am surrounded by 3's, 6's and 9's, there are six of us with offices next to each other 
 I've been a Joseph Campbell fan for years, and this book is a perfect one to give as a gift to someone who isn't quite up to reading his more scholorly works.  It's a guideline for life gleaned from his in-depth study of cultural myths from which he developed his own wonderful philsophy of life 
 I used this textbook for a Macroecon class in college and it has got to be one of the best textbooks I've ever used.  Not only is the textbook itself well written and easily explains complex theories, but it also comes with a DVD and online component.  The online DiscoverEcon site gives you access to self-quizzes and further examples to help study.  The DVD is basically lectures done in an easy to follow and entertaining (as entertaining as economics can be anyway) format.  I hope that my professor in my Microeconomics class uses the textbook from the same author 
 My sisters already had purchased this item so I got one so we could talk together.  I think it does a good job for the money and we have a lot of fun visiting on it.  
 Jack Vance is at the top of his form in _Emphyrio_. The novel tells the story of Ghyl, a fey youth who questions the solidified, authoritarian society in which he is growing up. It is in effect a socialist or capitalist dystopia (depending on how you define the terms), and Vance does a great job presenting the superiority of individualistic liberty vs. monopolistic rule by a class of exploiters in a non-didactic, dramatized form. The ending presents a surprise to the reader that has been well prepared. This is Vance at his best 
 Just so you know, I have not read the book. I had the book shipped directly to my mom. She found the book "inspirational and educational". She also liked that the book is a collection of discrete short passages so she is able to read one or two at a time.   I would recommend getting a paperback version rather than the hardcopy because (believe it or not) I asked two or three people and they prefer paperbacks when reading in bed. That way, when you are reading, the hard edges of the book won't dig into your tummy :-)  If you are reading this, I am guessing that someone close to you is going through a very tough time. If you know of other good books that might have helped them, please email me at atharkhan@email.com. 
 Louis Malle didn't make this film to exploit the sexuality of children. There is such a reactionary curse on this film that few people dare to actually view it. Compare it to Kids (1995),there are very few similarities. This is an objective view of a true story 1910's New Orleans. 12 year old Violet lives in a world of sexual currency, everything is acceptable and out front. She passes no judgement on the prostitutes and johns that parade across her mother's room. This is the only life she has known, what could be possibly wrong when everyone is smiling and there is food on the table. The camerawork captures the tragic lyrical situation. Very little ugliness appears, only once in the film when Violet loses her virginity. Bellocq, the photographer she marries, only does so to protect her from losing the innocence she still has. This film has been deemed child pornography but first and foremost it is an accurate biography of a specific place in time. Malle with his French sensibilty portrays the brothel as almost a sanctuary, the people laughing and without malice. Violet's life is tragic not just because she is overexposed to a sexual atmosphere but because the world around her will eventually paint her extended family as ugly and criminal. She has yet to realize this because she perceives them as her home. Pretty Baby offers a very innocent look at prostitution. Susan Sarandon,Brooke Shields,and Keith Carradine are very lovely with their doelike eyes. This is a romanticized world, a far cry from the hardcore reality that we perceive now. I think women would be more openminded to actually view the film as a period piece and not some abomination of morality.  
 This set contains many essential pre-romanticism texts that most college British literature classes cover.  It includes many valuable works, including the full text of Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf, The Canterbury Tales, excerpts from The Book of Margery Kempe, Utopia, Donne's Holy Sonnets, Astrophil & Stella, King Lear, Gulliver's Travels and much, much more.  The printing is beautiful and the binding is very high quality.  I bought this book for college and, as a teacher and grad student I have come back to it many times for material or just for enjoyable reading 
 I am thoroughly enjoying this authoritative collection of O'Connor's writings.  The writing speaks for itself as truly great and unique.  This particular book is very classy and well put together; an excellent choice for someone with a significant interest in O'Connor

 I've read this book a few times, and got our factory excited by it as well.  We read it 2 chapters a week as a group, with a volunteer facilitator reviewing the content of the chapters in a weekly session.  Suggest you start with this one and then read the Goal (Goldratt) and Lean Thinking (Womack).  A must read for those interested in Lean Manufacturing or Self-Directed Workteams.  Pro: -Shows the commitment of Toyota to their methods and philosophies -Provides building blocks upon which to apply lean tools or lean toolkit  -Philosophy is quite detailed for a few hundred pages, appears thorough and complete so if you want to, you can create a similar systems-based approach  Con: -Not a recipe for you to copy... no shortcuts or cutting corners here.  Neutral: -Not much detail on "tools" which is out of scope for the content of this book  Bottom line:  I think that this book is true to the philosophies of Toyota as I've directly observed from the 4 or 5 different senseis (former Toyota executives turned consultants).  I only recommend a few books, this is one of them

 There's something about the solo album that inspires dread: so often the solo effort is a horrible mistake: a mish-mash of pretension, grand-standing and (if you happened to be a member of The Who for example) 100% prime suckage. As such, I approach the new album from Pulp's front man with some trepidation.  As if that wasn't enough, I'm not even a Pulp purist: I was aware of them when they were signed to (The Great) Fire (of London) records, and while I adored some of their lyrical qualities ("Little girl with blue eyes/there's a hole in your heart/and one between your legs/guess which one they are going to fill"), I owned maybe a couple of their albums at most. I really only picked up on them with the release of "Different Class," with it's perfect blend of smart, sinful and sarcastic in a pop music masterpiece. Following D.C., I did go back and buy up the back catalogue, but still, some albums just didn't work for me. Too complex maybe? Too difficult? It's clear (and became more so on "This is Hardcore") that Pulp was not interested in being anyone else's idea of what a band should be.  But again, this brings to mind the question why make a solo album: it seems like the band makes a perfectly good vehicle. Hell, if a new band was called for, pulling a Mark E. Smith number and replacing the entire backing group would have worked.  So, like I said, trepidation.  I deliberately avoided pre-reviews, interviews, press releases--anything that I thought would possibly color my interpretation of the work--trying to find a moment of purity, a solid foundation.  The album opens slyly: the first track "The Loss Adjuster (Part One)" runs for 27 instrumental seconds--heavy, dirgeful piano. The theme is picked up by the real opener: "Don't Let Him Waste Your Time." It's almost impossible not to hear Jarvis's unique voice and think of Pulp. It's true he's not a great "pure" vocal talent, but he is instantly recognizable and well suited to his material. "Don't..." is a nice opener, although it's maybe a little too much of an album track. Lyrically, filthy. Musically, a few different instruments (horns of some type? synth?) from the usual lineup.  "Black Magic" takes more of a psycho-pop tone than the rockier opener. Sparse, almost lo-fi, basic... Again, some new instruments show up (tubular bells, Foetus style guitar). The vocal structure is once again simple, repetitive. I'd have cut the final 45 seconds or so, as the tail end is just played out a little too far to no real purpose. At this point, it's difficult to know what to expect next, there's no sign of a deliberate flow to the pieces. "Heavy Weather" opens with thunder storm sound effects, and migrates into another lo-fi almost-love-song before hitting it's pace and picking up tempo. This helix of fast to slow repeats; the lyric sticks true to the title (cold fronts, storms coming through, no cliche left unturned)--a little more juvenile poetry than usual, but not strictly bad or twee. I can see this being a great live track.  Titles alone point to a not very happy album--"I Will Kill Again," for example, doesn't sound like a great dance track. And it's not. It's almost a torch song, with Jarvis playing the part of either a serial killer or perhaps reaching for a less literal reading of relationships and their inevitable endings ... wishing for a world in which no-one dies, or if they do they die, to do so from boredom. Of the tracks thus far, this one is a standout in terms of lyric, pacing and fit to the voice. Ah, but it's a sad song and who isn't a sucker for one of those?  "Baby's Coming Back To Me" hints at maybe a happier note in name at least, and indeed carries forward much of the same longing and emotion as "I Will...". Another sparse instrumental, simple drum rhythm, some xylophone, some reed instrument (I'm not good at picking up what is what). Overall, the song reports as much on the down aspects of a return, making no progress, retreading old ground. Not so much with the clever in the lyric this time, and better for it.  Back to a more rock feel for "Fat Children," and back also to a more whimsical lyric, bemoaning the ugly aspects of parenthood, and a stream of consciousness rant that makes as much sense as most any pop record. Probably the lead single. Again, there's a portion in the middle third that is unnecessary and would have hit the editing floor had I been involved. But I wasn't, so blah.  If there's an underlying theme to "Why this is not a Pulp album" it would be that the musical arrangements are very much simple, almost background. Even on the rockier/poppier tunes, there's a slight muffling of music compared to voice. It's unusual, but effective. "From Auschwitz to Ipswich" is a brave title, and the theme of the song is bleak. For all that modern life has to offer, it's basically rubbish and we fill our time with pointless activities. Jarvis out-sads the Mozfather easily. The segue to the follow-up track "Disney Time" is obvious, and indeed many of the same concepts are explored in this lyric. Over the top string arrangements emphasis that perhaps some of this is tongue in cheek, but it's nicely vague on that point.  "Tonite" picks up lyrically from "Sorted for E's and Whiz" (Different Class) as a love song to drugs and sex and boredom. "Somebody falls in love; somebody falls from a windowsill." Wistful, ironic, derisive, and haunting all at once. A fine tune, good for the last dance of the evening if you are hoping to get your end away.  "Big Julie" opens with a rather pointless spoken word introduction, then develops into a precise character study. You can replace "Big Julie" with "Fat Jerry" and the song still works. Like so many of his observed subjects, Julie envisages a better, brighter future--albeit an impossible one.  "The Loss Adjuster (Part Two) ends the song cycle for the album proper, and opens space for the experimental "Quantum Theory"--which reads like nothing less than a Cocker summoning of Carl Sagan. Blending subtle guitar work, sparse echo, whispered background vocals, approaching an ethereal mood. Ending on an eternal moment of hope "Everything is going to be alright" at 4:40 in, you wonder what the next 30 minutes of the track will be: turns out to be the far too often used gimmick of silence, at least until the last 4:20 which kicks in the rejoinder "[ex-del] are still running the world"--the only really political song on the album, it's vitriol sung prettily to a jazzy background. It's a great end to the album (or it would be, if it wasn't for that perverse 25 minutes of nothing).  In summary: it's a fine work. It's short (in terms of number of tracks), and overall consistent. It does focus mainly on highlighting the vocal skills (and limitations) of Jarvis, and yes it is a love it or hate it voice. It's also clearly a progression from the later Pulp albums which had lost some cohesion and drive. Well worth a listen, breaking the mold of bad solo albums with style and panache. Now, to edit out that damn silence...  * * *  Update: I was going to post a link to Amazon so you could buy it and hear little samples, only to find out it's an import and will set you back almost $30.00. It's still a fine album, so if you do have spare cash to spend there's no reason not to. Also, the "gap" in the final track is to "hide" the previous myspace ditty "Rule the world"--while that makes sense, it's still just nasty and tacky and unnecessary. 
 I used to love this movie. This movie is such a great mixture of enormous plot holes, ultraviolence and phenomenally bad Schwarzenegggerjokes, that it is just pure fun to see all actors take things so serious! In the future criminals are being punished live on television during the Running Man game show by sadistic scum (one of Schwarzenegger's quotes during the movie) Of course the big former Austrian is also put on the show as a criminal contester and guess what happens? This truly is a classic! (SARR)

 If you've ever been to Germany and been introduced to someone whose title was Professor Doctor Doctor Doctor and you were required not to smile as you listened to the introduction, this is your book.  Academics in general take themselves too seriously, and Alexander McCall Smith draws on his years of experience in academia to lampoon the worst excesses.    The humor is rather broad and obvious, but it does hit the mark.  Those who aren't exposed to academics may wonder what all of the fuss is about.    These are a series of eight stories about Professor Doctor Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld (think hedgehog field) and his colleagues.  With enormous self-confidence, the three professors decide to learn tennis by reading a book in the Principles of Tennis.  Von Igelfeld launches his fellow student and future colleague into a dangerous form of sport with humorous and unexpected consequences in Duels, and How to Fight Them.  Early Irish Pornography shows the potential absurdity of studying just any old language if you are a philologist.  Italian Matters explores the bases of national prejudices.  Portuguese Irregular Verbs explores the immense over-investment that all authors have in their work.  Holy Man explores how the rational man meets the mystic and what he makes of the experience.  Dental Pain looks into professorial romantic ideas.  Death in Venice tickles one's fancy with references to Thomas Mann.    If you like the Botswana stories, these stories will probably not appeal as much.  There's bile and vague pity beneath the humor here rather than love for the characters 
  George E. Vaillant is well qualified to write this book. He is a psychiatrist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, a professor at Harvard Medical School, director of the Harvard Study of Adult Development, and a respected researcher. Harvard Medical School professors have been studying the basic elements of adult human development for more than five decades. Three separate cohorts of 824 individuals were selected as teenagers for different facts of mental and physical health and studied for the rest of their lives to observe the adult life cycle and to provide a theoretical framework for  understanding how older people become fulfilled or not.  Harvard men were studied. In 1940, men who went to Harvard were rich, privileged, white, born to American born grandparents, and expected to equal or exceed their natural ability.   In 1939, Sheldon Glueck obtained funding to do a prospective study of 500 youth sent to reform school and 500 matched school boys who had not been in any legal trouble   at age 14. His wife restudied the groups at ages 17, 25, and 32. The control nondeliquent group had the same social risk factors that helped doom the delinquents-had repeated two grades or more in school, had foreign born parents, lived in blighted neighborhoods, and were from families known to five or more social agencies and more than two-thirds were on welfare. Valinti inherited the study when the subjects were 40, and subjects continued to have physical examinations every five years. At age 60, all but 2 of the 456 subjects were known to be dead or alive.   For the Terman Women Sample, Terman tried to identify most of the brightest children in his three city area. He asked teachers to indentify the brightest in each class. He learned that the unattractive and shy children tended to be overlooked so that he only captured about 80 percent of the bright children. He used the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test to identify 1 percent of the California urban school children with IOs greater than 135 to 140 most of whom were born between 1908 and 1914. Four generations of investigators have followed the Terman men and women by questionnaires about every five years and by personal interviews in 1940 and 1950. The Terman women were not asked to provide regular physical exams. However, when compared to classmates, they had better nutrition, more humor, common sense, perseverance, leadership and popularity among their classmates. By age 80, they had half the mortality of white American women in their birth cohort.   In comparison, at age sixty-eight to seventy, the inner city men had the same physical decline as the Terman and Harvard cohorts at seventy-eight to eighty. The difference was attributed to less education, more obesity, and greater alcohol and cigarette abuse among the inner city cohort.    These cohorts seemed to demonstrate that it is social aptitude or emotional intelligence rather than brilliance or parental social class that leads to a well-adapted old age. Vaillant concluded that individual life style choices contribute a greater role than genetics, wealth, race, or other factors in determining how happy people are in late life. He found that " It is not the bad things that happen to us that doom us; it is the good people who happen to us at any age that facilitate enjoyable old age. Healing relationships are facilitated by a capacity for gratitude, for forgiveness.... A good marriage at age 50 predicted positive aging at 80. But surprisingly, low cholesterol levels at age 50 did not. Alcohol abuse -unrelated to unhappy childhood-consistently predicted unsuccessful aging, in part because alcoholism damaged future social supports. Learning to play and create after retirement and learning to gain younger friends as we lose older ones add more to life's enjoyment than retirement income. Objective good physical health was less important to successful aging than subjective good health.... It is all right to be ill as long as you do not feel sick" p. 13.   This research report can help us understand that we can do little to changer our genetic make-up, but we can change our habits so we avoid alcohol and smoking, eat a healthy diet, exercise to maintain a healthy weight, develop loving relationships, and continue to learn. These are important lessons for all of us wanting to age well, but it takes a sophisticated reader, knowledgable about research and willing to wade through research findings to read this research report. The book has 12 chapters, 11 appendices, notes, acknowledgments, and an index.  
 This is, I think the most mature and articulate statement of Open Theism yet written.  Clark Pinnock, the father of the movement responds to Open Theism's critics and provides a clear and persuasive case for his own perspective.  There is much to admire in Pinnock's work, perhaps most of all it's rehetorical power and passionate voice.  This book also, I think offers the most nuanced arguments for Open Theism and critiques of Classical Theism than any other book I have read.  Pinnock, in four chapers explores the biblical support for Open Theism, critiques Classical Theism's indeptedness to pagan philosophy, examines the philosophical coherence of Open Theism and explores it's practical implications.  There are certainly some problems with the book.  Pinnock does gloss over, or just not mention a number of Scriptures that are very much in tension with some of his claims.  Also the book does tend to be quite repetative at points.  I also found over half a dozen grammatical and spelling errors throughout the book.  However, there is also much to commend.  Pinnock forces Classical Theists to examine so much of the biblical material that they tend to sweep under the rug or just ignore.  Frankly, I was also quite compelled by Pinnock's arguments against compatiblism and determinism.  It is hard to see how human life and history is significant if it is all run according to a blueprint that even God is not free to deviate from.  Also, I think Pinnock is to be commended for grounding his understanding divine power in the cross and resurrection rather than pagan and medival conceptions of power as impersonal, brute force.  I do think, though that we must reform our understanding of God even more radically than Pinnock does.  By this I don't mean process theology or something like that.  Rather, we shouldn't talk of God limiting his power to make room for human freedom as Pinnock tends to do.  Rather, we should contend that God's power is fully manifested in giving freedom, suffering with creation, becoming incarnate, dying and being raised from the dead.  These are not things that limit God's power.  They are God's power in action!  Pinnock is also to be commended for grouding his view of God and relationality in the inter-trinitarian communal life of God.  This truth is, I am convinced, vitally important for the church today.  I do think, though that Pinnock, in stressing God's relationality and openness toward us fails to consider that God is also able to distance himself from us as well.  In the biblical narrative, this is often seen in response to the sins of God's people.  God is not only intimately realted to us, he is also indescribably other than us and is not within our control.  Rather, we come to realize that God, though infinitly faithful is also very surprising and dynamic, both in his being present and absent in relation to his people at times.  I think Open Theism helpfully stresses one side of this dialectic, but also feel that we must honor the other side as well, thus living in the tension that is life before a God we cannot control, but who is intimately committed to us as his people.  This book is certainly not the last word in this discussion, but it does take the discussion to a new level.  I hope that those on all sides of this issue will be able to read this, be challenged by it, and go on to serve God better because of it, regardless of where they come out on the issue.  Highly recommended 
 ...this edition contains both the 1604 and 1616 editions of Dr. Faustus.  In all honestly, though, I don't entirely buy the notion that the former should automatically take precedence over the latter.  It's entirely  possible that the additions made to it were in fact Marlowe's own ideas  that were merely added by others.  And in any case, I would have to say  that, as a whole, the 1616 version is more coherent, with a lot of the  threads left hanging in the 1604 cleared up.  More is done with the clowns,  and the character on whom Faustus inflicts horns goes from an anonymous  "knight" to an actual character.  The 1604 does have some things  to be said for it (the bit about Christ's blood streaming in the firmament  has been inexcusably edited out of the 1616, f'rinstance, and there's a  brief scene at the end with the scholars that seems superfluous), but as a  whole I'd go with it rather than the 1604.  If I was going to put on a  production of the play, I'd combine the two as I saw fit.  Okay then 
   I read this book here in Brazil.This book is a fiction, but it has a portrait of evangelical movement in USA, about 80 years ago.   In fact, I must tell you that, this novel didn't became outdated because, preachers and protestantism itself are equal from the times, when this book was writen.Or they are even worse.Elmer Gantry can be Jim Bakker,Swaggart,Billy Graham or any other famous preacher who lived after, this book was writen.    If USA's protestantism is the same, in Brazil, protestantism is far worse.In fact, in 1920 decade, pentecostalism in Brazil was a small cult.In last decades, pentecostalism rised and is now the most followed religion in Brazil.In fact, every Sunday, three times more pentecostalists go to their churches, than catholics."Brazil, the biggest catholic country in the world" is a past, who won't return.The sins of any famous evangelical preacher, here in Brazil, are so terrible, that Elmer Gantry's sins aren't nothing compared.     One timeless lesson of this book is, when Elmer Gantry (hypocrite, womanizer, liar, crook, etc.) rises, while at the same time, not bad preachers, goes to nothing.From Luther, until today, if you aren't a bad guy, then you won't have sucess in protestantism.     
 My 6 year old son absolutely loves this book.  He was so excited about the experiments that everyone we knew was told about the new experiment.  He understanding what he is doing with the experiments.  I would recommend this book and I have to his teacher at school 
 It's hard to imagine anyone would need a more powerful minivac, as it really does lift a bowling ball, so of course it figures to run hot and be noisey. Yes enough power to quickly clean up after sawing wood or drilling metal, car floorboards, cat litter, etc.; keeps the wife happy when I don't leave a mess.   You will need a upright or canister for carpets but this is perfect for a quick small job.   Bonus: gets into corners and edges perfectly!    As for cleaning/replacing the HEPA, my solution works: I don't bother with doing either! I just empthy the cup and shake the cloth filter, takes 15 seconds total. So what if the filter then doesn't keep the air completely free of dust, or it loses a little suction? I have mine a few years and even with a dirty filter it still lifts a bowling ball, more to the point it quickly cleans up 100% of any mess right through the dirty cloth (HEPA) filter.  Let the fastidious folks bother with washing / replacing it, I say (Brooklyn accent) don't worry about it).    
 Vivid descriptions of the battles in this war enliven this historical work and make it very enjoyable reading.  In addition, the author provides insightful information on the weapons and tactics of the period.  This is especially true for the Austrian army and Wawro fully explains why the Austrians were so successful against the Italians while failing so miserably against the Prussians.  The battle scenes are detailed and quite lively and unlike many other military works provide detail without confusion.  So often when writing about the maneuvers of divisions, authors frequently become so mired in detail that the reader is easily lost and has considerable difficulty determing what was going on where without undue effort. Here the maps ably assist understanding. Although the maps do not provide a scale, an unfortunate reality for most current historical works, this problem can be overcome by referring to more detailed auto maps.  As for referencing the written material to the maps I found no difficulty.   However, for the military simulation enthusiast you will not find beautifully outlined and detailed orders of battle for each side.  What you will find is adequate infomation in the text to simulate each battle as long as you know what the composition of say a Prussian division or an Austrian brigade.  More detailed information is available from other sources. I only hope that this is not the last work by Wawro for after reading this book I would glady purchase any of his works 
 Excellent movie! Great sound effects! Depth charges shook my room. If you want a good movie to show off your audio gear, this will do it 
 This book is a good intro to the "why" of ecological design.  It gives its informatiion in a non-technical way and explains the reasons we should approch design this way.  I recommend it for all those involved with  land and building design and development 
 This is a fascinating compilation of real life testimonials of help, hope and miracles, involving loving intervention from the angelic and goddess realm. I loved it 
 i really liked this game. Im 14 years old and im in the high school.... but when im bored i seem to play this game ALL THE TIME... i dont why...   I WOULD BUY IT IF I WERE YOU!!!...VERY FUN && CHALLENGING AT THE SAME TIME! 
 It took me three months to get Kim Waters' album, but I love it.  Steppin' Out, She's My Baby and Daydreaming are solid numbers, but I like the album's last three numbers, Happy Feeling, Good To Go and Sideways, which are all funky smooth jazz numbers. I have played tracks 8 to 10 the most. One surprise is the fabulous remake of Aretha Franklin's 70s hit Daydreaming, which Maysa sings so very well on.   At times he reminds me of Paul Taylor's sound, but has his own approach. His saxophone leads blend very well to the R&B-styled grooves that dominate the album.  This has a good chance to have several hits on smooth jazz radio formats. It would sound quite good on I-95 between Washington, DC and Baltimore, MD.  The smooth grooves would blend well with Maryland's urban landscapes. 
 I've used my Sitram cookware for more than a year with no problems, and customer service was great the one time I contacted them. Don't let one dissatisfied customer keep you from trying and buying this item 
 I mailed you, to your Co. in CA (yeah, I know you live in Boca...), an envelope with three SASE in it for autographed pics for me and two friends here in The Bronx. That was about 4 months ago. I'm hurt. When I was a little country girl who screamed and held her ears the 1st time I heard an El-Train, YOU'RE music got me through the hell of moving to what I considered a different country. Yeah, keep singin' those bluse, baby....I can play 'em, too. But, however, you SUCK at fan mail, and we are all mad, but we still play you on the juke. Guess you're too busy being a big shot to remember where you came from. Peace and Love Always(even tho'I'm mad and disappointed), Janet Louise Zavatt 
 I also loved this series. I read Sadar's Keep as a teenager and then happened to stumble on Beldans fire about 2 years later. I was ecstatic. The books were wonderfully written. The characters developed and the plot  unpredictable.I would suggest it to everyone 
 The first thing that totally grabbed me was the realization that the oh so compelling Earl of Clare was 60 years old in this book. Somehow you want your favorite characters to be ageless - He still seemed a compelling character and no, I know the book was not about his and Casandra this time but you want them to be blissfully happy! Well they certainly bred a couple of interesting children - and how the present manages to repete the past - that Adam would end up with Edward's daughter (who seems nothing like her father) and that Arabella would find love with the women's son most hated from the first book.  I too - because I loved this family so much could have had seperate books for both Adam and Arabella - however since the plot works so well and it all is so interesting and intriguing I will not fault Coulter's combining the stories.  You just have to love the way Adam and Rayna find one another - but most especially the love between Arabella and Kamal - wow that just sizzled!!!!! And his shame at the end because of his horrible mother was so understandable for a proud man.  And the Earl's little manipulation for his daughter - how unlike him to help things along!  What a great father! This was just a beautiful story - I loved every moment of it! 
 Clive Barker's introduction is as good as the stories themselves, stating in regards to the melding of horror and erotica that "In an age when characters in all manner of fiction have forsaken their blushes to fornicate, horror fiction clings to its underwear with a nunnish zeal."  Since Scared Stiff was first published in 1988, this was one of the influential books that led to the production of more erotica in horror, such as the Hot Blood series.  There are only seven tales in this collection, making it a wonderful traveling companion or vacation book.  Starting with `Dolls', we visit a quiet village and the witch's coven that conjures the devil during orgies, leading to `The Other Woman', a tale of an artist's obsession with his work bleeding over onto the canvas of his own life.  Next is `Liliths', probably my favorite story in the compilation.  A strange shop appears out of nowhere, and a man makes a purchase that changes his life.  A life sized doll that fills him with compulsive behavior.   `The Seductress' is a low-key suspense tale, of obsessive love and a mother's revenge.  `Stages' tells of us a deadly combination of $ex, drugs, and voyeurism.  `Loveman's Comeback' speaks of possession, and the lengths one will go to in order to break out of a bad relationship.  And finally, `Merry May' is about wandering into a strange town, and finding their odd celebration a little more than you can handle.  While in comparison to today's erotic horror, Scared Stiff is a bit tame for this blossoming genre, but Ramsey Campbell's early foray into this forbidden realm truly opened doors for those of us who enjoy peeking into the bloody rooms to find titillating delights within.  If you are really a fan of visceral lust run amok, then you should own a copy of Scared Stiff.  Enjoy! 
 My third Graham Greene read, after The Third Man and Ministry of Fear, took some conviction to sit down to:  I was convinced that my viewing the movie 10(ish) years ago would ruin the reading experience for me.  In fact, when I reached what I remembered to be the big "secret" of the movie (the "vow"), I was only halfway through the book.  Of course, this implies that the book is entirely plot-centric, which is not at all the case.  The book uses its plot admirably to reveal its characters' conflicting belief systems, which turn out to be at least as central to the story as the eponymous "affair".  A particularly compelling portion of the story--the portion which signals the transition from introspective romance to something greater--is revealed through the eyes of a character who thrives on contradictions.  Neither of the protagonists seem like individuals one would wish to know well, but their portraits are fascinating and exceedingly real.  The man's irrational jealousies and the woman's awareness of her own contradicticary nature struck the most compelling chord with me, making them more than just characters.  My only minor complaint would be that portions of the last quarter of the book lost steam, though even that was eventually rectified through perseverance 
                                           The Haunting of Alaizabel Cray  Wooding, Chris  Summary:  	Thaniel Fox, son of Jedriah Fox, London's great wych hunter, is a seventeen-year-old boy who also is a wych hunter. With his friend and mentor, Cathaline, Thaniel tracks down the horrifying creatures that lurk in the Old Quarter of London. This is where Thaniel, while on the hunt, finds a scared girl his age named Alaizabel Cray.  	Alaizabel is beautiful but an evil spirit that a secret brotherhood wants to free possesses her. Ms. Cray is a magnet that pulls evil to her and if the brotherhood has its way darkness will fall upon the entire world. Cathaline and Thaniel must discover the cause and drive back the foul creatures.  	This book is not for the faint hearted for it is full of dark suspense and a Gothic feel that is set in Victorian England with a chill that will steal away your heart and make you want to read more. It is not a bedtime story.  Recommendation:  	I think the people who will like this book are mystery and horror lovers as well as teenagers.  
 Short, concise, and to the point chapters. Great wealth of knowledge and trivia 
 I have read many coloured pencil books, but this is the only one I have bought or kept. I refer to it often for ideas on how to combine colours or figure out a problem. Some might say that it isn't broad enough, but you have to be willing to take the basic ideas and develop your own solutions as well :- 
 A well known publisher/editor once said, "the purpose of a newspaper is to make money."  In the case of the "Union-Register," the newspaper has been acquired by a large corporation that treats its chain of newspapers like it treats its chain of fast food restaurants.  The newspaper is now being managed by corporate suits whose attention is on the bottom line rather than the local news.  Jack Tagger, a staff writer on the paper, finds himself demoted to writing obits after irritating the corporation's chief executive.  Writing an obituary gives new direction to Tagger's career after the deceased, James Bradley Stomarti, is indentified as the musician Jimmy Stoma, well known by Tagger's generation.  Digging into Stoma's death raises questions.  Stoma's widow, Cleo Rio, does not seem unhappy about his sudden demise, and is using the death as PR for her own career.  Tagger links up with Stoma's sister and others to carry out his own investigation.  Things can be deadly as other people are attacked and/or killed, and homes are ransacked.  Someone is looking for something.  Cleo Rio claims Stoma was producing her new CD, but there is some mystery about just what Stoma was producing.  There is unpublished music involved, and a question about who owns what.  People are maneuvering for control if they can find the music.  Meanwhile, back at the newspaper, there is a separate power struggle.  Foreign corporations are trying to take control.  The newspaper's previous owner has a large block of corporate stock which is key to the issue.  Tagger finds himself in the middle of both power struggles and, in the meantime, is obsessed with finding out what happened to his own father.  This is one of those novels that the reader gets involved in, and it will keep you up late to get to the end.  Just when it looks like a black hat will walk away whole, there is a surprising twist in the tale 
 I got this CD as a gift when my daughter was born. She is now almost 7 years old and I am buying a new copy since we wore the old one out!  She still listens to it every night. I love to hear my daughter sing all the songs. I highly recommend this for baby gifts 
 One of the most fascinating behind-the-scenes stories of how the fate of World War II hung in the balance which was tipped ultimately by  seemingly inconsequential actions. A real page turner of little known facts..................................the reader will have a hard time setting it dow 
 ¿Por qué Hollywood recurre, tan a menudo, a actores británicos para los papeles de malvados? Pues, porque (sin desear ofender a nadie) son los mejores. Así lo demuestra nuestro querido Tim, con o sin peluca -así lo prefiero yo-. La mejor escena es el duelo final donde, además de ser malo, estás guapísimo. ¡Queremos verte más a menudo! Dejas huella 
 This book gives an excellent and easy to read look at writing your college application essay.   If you are just going to read a book and not do the exercises, this is a great choice - it doesn't have any exercises. Instead, the emphasis is on finding your own voice and telling your story. For example, he gives a list of the most overused, deadly topics and then shows how you can write a really good essay on one of the "forbidden" topics. He also includes a number of sample essays with comments from real college admissions officers - so you can see for yourself the difference between good, bad and mediocre 
 Metallica.  Slayer.  Megadeth.  Anthrax.  Sepultura.  These are some of the most immortal metal bands ever.  Period.  Mastodon arrived in this league with Leviathan and probably ascended to the heights of Kill 'Em All.  Opening track Blood and Thunder is one of the best metal songs I've ever heard and the rest of the album is just as good.  Plus, with the possible exceptions of Metallica and maybe, just maybe, Slayer or Megadeth, I don't think any metal band has ever attempted to fully reconcile its rage with its subject matter.  Leviathan does just that, combining the lyrical imagery, power, and themes of Moby Dick with the most accomplished metal being played today.    I just caught these guys live on September 6th and I have to say they blew the heavily hyped Converge out of the water.  The amazing guitar work by the tandem axemen can't be praised enough.  They mirror each other perfectly and yield when necessary, while the drummer and bassist/lyricist pummel the low section.  The singing was excellent, as well, with crowd participation at an all-time high for a speed-metal show.    If you like metal, and you don't own this album yet, what are you reading this review for?  Get your act together.  Get Leviathan 
 Like "Justine", written in a hauntingly sensual style, but far more readable.  Took me a much shorter time to read it.  There are so many memorable passages of beauty and wisdom in both, one could fill a small notebook - on love and the human condition, and the beauty of nature.  Durrell certainly had an alert and unusually articulate mind, writing both with poetry and precision.  Published in 1957, yet timeless, as all classics are.  I think it is supposed to take place before World War II.  "Balthazar" has far more excitement than "Justine", moves at a quicker pace.  Here we see all the same characters, yet all in a new light; we see farther and grasp what we see with new understanding.  We get fresh info about Pursewarden, Nissim, Narouz, Justine, Darley (the narrator), Melissa, Clea, Pombal, Amaril, Leila, Mountolive, and the outrageous comic scenes built around Scobie. Throughout the entire four volumes that comprise "The Alexandria Quartet", Durrell is constantly backfilling, a technique I particularly love, until at the last, all is revealed.  That same technique was also used by Sir Charles Percy Snow in his 11 volume series "Strangers and "Brothers", but perhaps to a lesser extant.  Durrell is the master here in letting us see only so much, no further, until the last volume.  A rave review  
 Although I don't work in the trades, I'm the kind of guy that spent his youth tearing apart engines and working on cars. Suffice it to say I know my way around mechanical things.   I live in Atlanta where all two story homes have a separate HVAC system for each floor.  You can imagine my wallet shock to find both my 22 year old HVAC units needed replacement with a median quote of $11,500.  My research on the internet provided information that I could buy the exact name brand equipment online for $3400.  That said, I had no idea how to install it or should I say I had no experience in installing HVAC.  That's when I learned about The Furnace Book.  Paul King walks you through the complete process of retrofitting your replacement units to your existing duct and vent system.  The pictures are excellent and the sheet metal advice is invaluable.  It's written in a step by step manner that laymen can understand. This book is an excellent resource where you are shown the secrets of the trade.  I know of no other book like it and would commend it to anyone wanting to understand the process of installing new HVAC equipment.  As you can see my savings on the project were $8100.  I would have to say The Furnace Book would be cheap at twice the price 
 I keep this book by the couch and periodically read a section (again) from it... it is like watching a John Wayne movie - you feel comfortable seeing it again.   As a former accountant and software guy, this book helps bring together the separate tasks you need to follow as a methodology to complete a sale.  I recommend it 
 My copy of Original Blessing is falling to pieces as it's been read so often - I bought it some time ago from a church jumble sale, and I can't believe anyone could throw it out! This is a beautiful and deeply spiritual book and Fox is one of my great heroes, with others like bishop Shelby Spong and here in the UK Richard Holloway. All are 'post modern Christians' and would that the mean spirited, literalist homophobics/mysogynists who claim to speak for Christians everywhere would listen to them. If you think that the Christian message is all about sin and sado-masochism suspend your disbelief and read Fox's alternative account which truly honours the Divine Creator. Matthew Fox is a holy person and a great prophet and this is one of his best books.    
 I'm going to give this book 5 stars, because I really like it--BUT-- like everything else I've read, I think it really glosses over a problem that I have, and no doubt others have.  My bird is just not warm.  I mean he doesn't need any humans for anything, so training him is going to take me YEARS.  He trys to bite my hands any time he sees them, even if I'm 2 feet away.  This book just gives lip service to this problem (and advises not to buy from a pet store- not always an option).  I just wish some of these experts would listen to their own advice (she admits over and over how individual each bird's personality is), and cover some of the worst personality problems. Having said that, I have no other complaints.  It's a good read, reinforcing many of the little things you eventually find out as a bird "owner".  I especially recommend this book for those who think they want a parrot.  Please read this front to back first.  It actually gets a lot of the impending headaches (and heartaches) out in the open.  So when problems (other than mine) do come up, you will be well-armed.  I learned how to towel a bird after 25 years, and the first time, my cockatiel turned into a little nursling.  I would never have thought it would work, but it went great, and now I can at least grooom his feathers and nails when needed. So if your on your fist avian adventure, get this now.  If your an old salt, you could find something useful, but I know you will like all the anecdotes, at the very least 
 I own the single books from Dini/Ross teamup. Great books. They capture the essence of each character to build upon it a very meaningful and clever tale. Nothing to add about the art: Ross is well known and always getting better and better, with panels as evocative as the prose. The hardcover edition is the perfect way to enjoy these masterpieces (even if a bit heavy to handle.....). But if you are looking for extra material (as the new edition of Mythology) you could be disappointed 
 Paley's purpose for writing this book consists of helping to open our minds to the insights of children.  She implies in her writing that we, as adults, can learn from children.  Paley wrote about events that took place in her classroom during her last year of teaching.  This book has many stories within itself.  The theme or topic revolves around the children and how they react to literature and each other.  This book is good that it opens us up to the world of children and how they think and feel.  A good portion of the book is Paley's thought and feelings about what is going on with the children.  It is good that we know her thoughts, but I would like to have read more about what the children were doing.  I think more details about how the other children reacted and behaved would have been nice, other than concentrating a good deal on Reeny.  Also when Paley writes about the stories she read to the class, I think she should have given a little bit more detail about the stories.  Some people, including myself, may not have read some or any of Leo Lionni's books.  Overall, it is a fun book to read 
 This book is an excellent resource for proof of the infallibility of scripture.  It is easy to understand and has a good subject, scripture, and author index for those wo have specific questions.   Morris'proofs have  withstood scrutiny and the test of time 
 I just don't get it...how does stuff like this get published? Because the "author" lives in a big city and runs into publishing types? He must be a charming guy, because i've read some junk this month, but _HalfLife_ takes the prize. Glad I found it in a Salvation Army booksale and didn't pay full price. Omigod. 
 Much like Sophie's Choice, this novel will no doubt haunt the reader for years to come.  Styron has an uncanny ability to render unlikeable characters in a human way that makes one nearly sympathize with them.  I take issue with the reviewers who criticize the digressions and flashbacks that buttress the story.  The two critical characters of Cass Kinsolving and Mason Flagg are fleshed-out by virtue of the digressions, making their extraordinary actions understandable and realistic.  The characters ultimately behave as they should, but not in an entirely predicatable fashion either.  What I appreciate about this novel is the way Styron intertwines the root mystery with a novel of ideas.  He meditates quite gracefully on suffering, evil, art, and existence without overwhelming the reader.  It's a page-turner, gorgeously written, yet demanding.  Highly recommended to those who enjoy the southern noir of Flannery O'Conner or the late-fifties malaise of Richard Yates 
 This CD is great. It has up-beat songs and easly listening. If you like Jack Johnson or the Red Hot Chili Peppers, you should definetly buy this CD! Dark Blue is one of the best songs. Their new tour with The Academy Is... will be great. I cant wait to go to one of their shows 
 I first became aware of this great book when I found an old copy in my Father's library around age 14. Though it was not exactly an "exciting" read for a boy of 14, I found some of the headings intriguing..."On Having a Stomach; On Having Strong Muscles; On Playful Curiosity; Celibacy A Freak of Civilization ( of course as a 14 year boy old I HAD to read that one!), Inhumanity of Western Dress... and many others.  Perhaps it was partly in response to this book, that I developed an interest in Chinese culture which has now spanned over 40 years.  This book gets the reader back to the very basics of human life--food, friendship, tea, smoking (a bit controversial nowadays), growing old. It is all about CHERISHING EACH PASSING MOMENT and learning to instill each moment of life with quality and to live it artfully.  I was so happy to find this book reprinted. It is not necessarily the kind of book to read all at once, but to pick up on a rainy day, and just savor a few pages--while drinking a fine cup of tea and awaiting a visit from a special friend.  It's one of thoe rare books that may well become a part of you and of each moment of your life.    
 I have read many Dean Koontz books and he continues to amaze me. Though not his best, it is a real page turner you don't want to miss. It involves Alex Hunter, an American investigator who goes to Japan and meets Joanna Rand, an American woman running a Japenese nightclub. He notices she strongly resembles a Senator's daughter who was never found. They then go on an epic journey to discover who or what Joanna Rand actually is. A must read for any Koontz fan or someone who likes government conspiracies 
 This cordless phone is working great so far.  I usually purchase Panasonic phones, but they only seem to last about a year, then I have to purchase a new one. This is the third phone I've bought in 3 years. So I'm trying the Vtech instead. It seems very similar in comparison. Hopefully, I will not have to purchase a new one anytime soon. The only thing I do not like is when I try to add a number into my Directory, there's no way to add the +1 to long distance numbers 
  THE MAN IN THE GRAY FLANNEL SUIT (1956) is writer/director Nunnally Johnson's ambitious film version of the popular 1953 best-seller by Sloan Wilson.  It is set in suburban Connecticut and Rockefeller Center, linked by trains full of commuters.   One of those commuters is Gregory Peck, who does advertising for one of the big television networks run by his boss, Fredric March.  Johnson is setting up contrasts here.  Peck is married to Jennifer Jones and has three kids; March is married to 1930's actress Ann Harding and has a daughter named Susie.  Both March and Jones seem unhappy at home, happier at work.  But Peck is haunted by his past, in the Army in the Pacific in 1945 after World War Two is over in Europe.  Peck has an affair with lovely Marisa Pavan, who gives birth to his child.  What Peck will do with that Italian child covers the last half hour of the movie.  I like the film a lot because it gives us the clothes and cars and job world of my early childhood in the suburbia of 1950's San Francisco.  And the cast is incredible, including Lee J. Cobb, Henry Daniell, Arthur O'Connell, Gene Lockhart, and Keenan Wynn.  The brilliant use of CinemaScope, almost all in long shot with characters standing or sitting at opposite ends of the wide screen, is by Charles G. Clarke.  A magnificently knowledgeable audio commentary has film scholar James Monaco comparing movie and book constantly, often talking about his own life during this early 1950's period, the cars his father owned and the hats worn, and the stunning use of CinemaScope for a movie that simply could not withstand pan and scan treatment.  Maybe that is why it is not shown that often on TV, wonders Monaco; the only network that would always run it letterboxed, Turner Classics, does not own this Fox movie.  Thank God for DVD.  THE MAN IN THE GRAY FLANNEL SUIT runs a long 153 minutes, but maintains interest throughout and was a pet project of producer Darryl F. Zanuck.  This is from an era when a high-powered Production Chief could dictate that a movie run long to do justice to a long novel.  Monaco keeps saying that Jones' wife character is much nicer in the book and does not harp all the time on the quality of life she and Peck have in Connecticut.  She seems only a bit too unpleasant on screen for me, and the house they move out of is quite beautiful to me also.  That is a director's choice-or maybe Zanuck's choice.  Monaco also mentions the kids watching TV a lot in a darkened living room as not being in the book.  This is contrasted against a television network office at Rockefeller Center that only has two TV monitors and not the logical three, something I never would have picked up on, like a man wearing the wrong hat or driving the wrong year model car.  It is a very illuminating audio commentary by a movie lover and knowledgeable reader for a very good movie.  (REVIEWED ON LETTERBOXED DVD.)

 I bought these shoes in pink, and they are lovely house shoes, to lounge around it. The marabou is very fluffy, and the overall look is old fashioned glamour. Fun and pretty 
 Found this at an overstock price (you don't want to know ;) and snapped it up for heavy duty work at the restaurant. It has performed flawlessly for the past 6 months despite heavy use and abuse. Dinner for four...sauteed with stock reduction in the pan? NO problem...finish 12oz. sirlions from flat top to oven...NO problem...rendering duck breasts, sauteing and finishing with delicate shrooms in demi....NO problem. Rockfish, softshell crabs, mussels in safron stock, snap peas, braised endive, CREPES...you name it, this pan can do...WHOOHOOO.  I scrub this one myself and then send it through my commercial dishwasher full of caustic detergent, sanitizer and drying agent...hundreds of times...still looks new. DO NOT try that at home as it voids your warranty.   I'ma givin' out 5 mojo*z for this tough guy!!

 I really enjoy this game, I think they could have done better, some of the driving chases just seem a bit silly.  I enjoy the more tactical work he is required to do.  However, I ran into a glitch and I went online and found there are others who had the same problem where you get totally stuck and cannot move forward at all.  I played 2 nights in a row thinking I did something wrong before I looked up a walkthrough online and found out it was just a glitch in the game.  One I followed the instuctions, I was finally able to move on so watch out for that.  It's right after you go up in a watch tower with a sniper rifle, then enter a wharehouse to protect Madsen which as soon as you enter there should be a lot of men coming in, my problem was only 1 guy or other people say no men at all, if that happens then you hit the glitch because a lot of men should come rushing in.  The instructions I followed are as follows:  Turn on your PS2 is turned off with game and memory card in, then load the game (it should be at 4:28. If its not, see NOTE below).  When the cut scene with Jack and Tony begins remove the memory card and the "Warning, memory card removed  Use save game option to manually save progress & re-enable autosave?"   Press X for OK and re-insert the memory card, then watch the cut scene.  The "Previously on 24" dialog box will appear, press X.  then play the game as usual.  If done correctly, many men will enter.  After you complete the mission, make sure you save it.   NOTE: If your memory card is at 4:41.  Go restart the mission and do a save during the cut scene. You will overwrite 4:41 and be back at 4:28.  It helped me and if it happens to you, believe me, you will be glad you read this because I sure was.  
 "Thin for Life" is the only book you'll ever need for a healthy lifestyle guidance. Compared to the other diet books on the market, this one offers the knowledge for a balanced daily food intake. Also it offers great inspiration from people who managed to keep their weight in reasonable parameters. Instead of keeping track of my diet in a daily journal, I use Richard Simmons "Food Mover", applying to it what I learned from "Thin for Life" 
 These binoculars are not a gadget but a real advance.  I am an engineer and was at first skeptical that the internal control system of the binoculars could really deliver an enhancement in seeing.  However, I was amazed by their resolution from the first try.  I view astronomical objects as well as animals.  My first trial was reading a number tag on a high voltage line 500 yds away.  Unstabilized I could see the yellow sign containing the number but could not resolve it with my eye; as soon as I pressed the stabilizer button the sign was easily readable!  As a second example, I noticed a buck deer dozing along a fence 300 yds away but the motion of the binoculars unstabilized did not allow me to count his points.  Press the button, seven on one side 6 on the other!  So even though the resolution of the binoculars does not change theoretically, the IS mechanism, increases your hand held seeing resolution by what I would say would be a factor 5.  This is in addition to the fact that the image does not jiggle but remains locked in view.  Works correspondingly well for viewing star clusters, nebulae and the moon.  No motion of the stars hand held 
 This book is the logically titled sequel to EW 101. The style is the same. Namely where very intricate and specialised maths and engineering is deprecated. What Adamy has done is reduce a problem down to the minimum physical model that conveys the essential information. This lets a reader, who might not be an engineer in the electronic warfare field, understand what the various measures and countermeasures are about.  To this ends, there are fascinating instances scattered throughout the text. One nice example concerns a target plane trying to evade a heat seeking missile. The plane releases a flare, that has more infrared energy than itself. The missile then follows the hotter signal and the plane escapes. One countermeasure is to have the missile's sensor measure and compare the energies at two wavelengths. With enough electronics, it can then discriminate between the flare and the cooler target plane, and track the latter. Of course, the engineering required to perform this is nontrivial and probably classified. But the basic physical picture is very simple.  Another useful feature of EW 102 is the appendix. This has answers to problems presented in EW 101. Plus to problems in EW 102. As far as I can ascertain, none of the problems require a computational device more complex than a calculator 
 A highly effective morality thriller during which a boring man, with a boring job, living in a boring little town, learns that excitement comes at a steep price. Frank Bigelow is a tax accountant feeling suffocated by his uninspiring circumstances and closed in by a long term relationship. Looking for a dose of escapism, he heads out to San Francisco for excitement and the opportunity to get laid by carefree young women. His quiet sober life and wholesome girlfriend are contrasted with wild drunken parties accompanied by Jazz. Not coincidentally, it is at a swinging jazz club that he accidentally drinks some poison tainted booze. The clincher? This poison is lethal and there is no known antidote. He has become a living dead man. In a city full of people he is isolated and alone, wishing for nothing more than his old boring life. A terrific film 
 Listened to the audio book. Frank Muller reads like no one else.   I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this book. It is a classic Grisham. 
 Who hasn't wanted to travel along with Robert Langdon as he explores the Da Vinci Code?  Even if you can't insert yourself into the novel, you can recreate the adventure on your next European vacation.    The editor has done a great job in pulling together disparate material and making it cohesive and coherent.  This book is the perfect companion to the novel, and it will help personalize the movie experience if you have the chance to visit Europe.  I found the Fodor's Guide to The Da Vinci Code extremely helpful on a recent trip to London, and I look forward to using it in Paris and other cities 
 This really works. You must put on a strap that functions as the transducer.  It has a small radio transmitter in it that sends your heart rate to the wristwatch.  Included is an adapter that allows you to mount the watch on your treadmill handle.  I like it a lot.  It works much better than the optical system that I had before.  It often would not work if there was a lot of light in the room.   You can easily adjust the strap.  It doesn't have to be very tight to get a good reading.  
 I love this book so much that I have bought three copies and continually give them away to friends to read and I end up buying another copy for myself!!  This is the book that sets the record straight about the proof supporting the fact that God exists, proofs that cannot be denied by even the most intelligent and hard headed skeptic.  This book should convince anyone of sound mind that God must exist.  Buy it, read it, then give it to a friend and tell them to do the same 
 This book is a fantastic introduction to the study of international relations and to the structure of international society.  It is divided into comfortably-sized chapters with cohesive, eloquent and  informative text.  If only every textbook was such a pleasure to read 
 I read the reviews and had to grin. Martha's vineyard has a groove,..a flow all it's own,..and it is what it is. If you don't get Martha's Vineyard,..then I can understand why alot of people don't get the book. I was bothered by the celebrity comments,..because on the island everyone mixes with everyone,...leather faced fisherman,..the town bar fixtures and awesome characters and yes even the celebrities. Good book for those who love the island, and get the mind set 
 This is such a wonderful, unique twist to the old story.  I've read this book five times since buying it yesterday and can't wait to read it to the second graders in my volunteer reading program.  The whimsical pictures of the animals totally absorbed in reading their books and thus refusing to be disturbed by a big , bad wolf are absolutely fantastic.  The wolf gets the message that these are "educated" animals, and he embarks on a great quest to learn to read.  The wolf's unfaltering determination to read is truly inspiring.  Don't miss the looks on the faces of the humans as they encounter (on the sidelines) the wolf throughout the story.  There are also subtle signs that learning to read is helping to refine the wolf's social graces (as he announces himself to the farm animals each time).  The story is great; the art is great.  Definitely #1 on my gift-giving lis 
 As a Yorkshire woman living in America, this book reminded me of the beauty of the varying Yorkshire landscapes. James Herriot's down to earth style alongside wonderful photographs transport you straight to the heart  of Yorkshire. Read this and you'll want to visit 
 That CD has Billy Preston's best hits.  I love nothing from nothing and outa space 
   	Richard Gray calls this edition "that rare thing, a landmark anthology,"[...] "a significant contribution to the rewriting of American literary history."  While he is absolutely correct, his words do not convey the excitement that simply browsing through this volume generates.  This anthology is a gem, full of well-edited pieces and excerpts that come together in the colorful kaleidoscope that seems to reflect the Literatures of Colonial America  more faithfully than any prior attempt at "politically correct" inclusiveness.  Indeed, the title itself is indicative of the scrupulous respect afforded these works irregardless of their origin; hierarchy is seemingly anathema to the editors, who have organized their material chronologically for the most part in order to give account of the vast experience and  varying reactions of all the peoples implicated: European "discoverers," settlers, natives as well as both willing and unwilling immigrants.  The editors, sensitive to the increasingly essential questions of gender, `race,' class, culture, language and nationality, have managed to bring together for the first time texts which jostle each other for primacy of perspective even as they complement and complete a far-reaching vision of this brave "New World."   Opening the book to any page is an invitation to re-read and re-envision what we thought we new of Early America.   	I am personally and particularly impressed with the knowledge and comprehensive understanding of the editors and with the care with which this anthology has been elaborated.   Each text is introduced effectively and succinctly with enough information to situate the reader before letting the voices of the writers take over.  The translations from Spanish and Portuguese by Prof. Castillo are excellent, and seem to faithfully relay not only the content but the flourish and form of their originals.  No instances here of that horrible enemy of good prose, "translationese."  This of itself is commendable and demonstrates Prof. Castillo's solid grounding in both the language and the cultures of the Iberian peninsula. 	I suppose that for the sake of scrupulousness one should have a personal "nit to pick," and mine hinge on two suggestions for the next reprint.  First, this anthology takes Oladauh Equiano at his word and propagates as historical "truth" the story of his early life; recent research has challenged that stance, alleging that Equiano was not born in Africa at all.  Perhaps future editions should simply acknowledge the debate, which in any case does not seriously affect the importance of Equiano's text as a literary response to his age.  Secondly, as so many wonderful texts from the Spanish-speaking world have been included, I think that it might also be useful to include Lucas Vazquez de Ayllon's influential reports and letters in the early 16th century, imploring the King of Spain to renew his funding by speaking of "La Nueva Andalucia" and intentionally misrepresenting the coordinates of his exploration of the east coast of North America to bolster his claims.  This misrepresentation, through the translation into English of his texts, subsequently influenced English settlers (including the Pilgrims) in their choice of destination.  It seems to me to be a wonderful example of the interrelatedness of the cultural, literary, and geographical co-incidences to which this volume so eloquently speaks. 	But these are certainly minor considerations.  The editing is excellent, the texts are stimulating and exciting, and the volume a worthy addition to the field, which will be useful not only in the classroom but in the personal library for consultation, or just plain good reading 
 If you ever wanted to know what Leon Russell was up to before he became a huge star, here is the disc.  Containing the entire second Asylum recordings with five recordings from the "Look Inside the Asylum  Choir" album (not on CD now or probably ever), "Asylum Choir  II" shows Leon at his eclectic best.  "Lady in Waiting,"  "Hello Little Friend," "Sweet Home Chicago" and  "Straight Brother" (actually a guilty pleasure are just great  tracks.  "Welcome to Hollywood" (from the "Look  Inside..." album) is another excellent track which shows Leon and  co-hort Marc Benno attempting to be studio wizards.  And while they never  really made it to Lennon-McCartney status, it's a fun ride all the same.   By the way, dig the "Intro to Rita..." banter with Leon and Rita  Coolidge. Heavy 
 I read this interesting work while researching "Sacred Blood."  It is heavy reading on a notoriously heavy subject, but is especially relevant in these troubled times we are currently experiencing around the world.  It makes an interesting case to explain, in the specific case of one town, "how could they let this happen?"  Just goes to reiterate that while times change, people don't 
 This is a classic comedy, but my wife and I had forgotten that it does contain a lot of bad language (and I don't mean German). For those that don't really care if the kids hear that kind of language, this review is pointless, but unless you have a "cuss-buster" (TV Guardian) I would suggest finding something more suitable. 
 Had some problems getting it working at first. However, tech support was very helpful. Don't use the default "auto" for channel. Pick a specific channel. Much better performance and range than my previous solution 
 I really enjoyed watching Jamie Fox play Ray Charles simply because he did such a great job being Ray Charles.  It totally felt like you were watching the life of Ray Charles.  The movie was cool because I learned so much I did not know.  I have listened to a little Ray Charles, as most people have.  I enjoy his innovative R & B and Gospel Sound.  One of the qualities the film promotes well, something I had known, is the excellent versatility and range of styles Charles could play.    I really was not aware how much of how much a junkie and drug abuser the singer really was.  The film really did a great job in capturing the severe faults of the artist as well as capturing the ways he overcame his obstacles.  All of the acting was superb, and Jamie Fox really really shines, showing his amazing talent.  So much of film is pure junk but I no doubt feel this feature adds a lot to the life of Charles and the potential for films.  The actress who played Charles wife and mother also did excellent jobs, as well as the fellow who played Quincy Jones.  Even more could have been added but I also understand the reasons for editing for time.  I liked the scene at the end with the Georgia State Legislators.  Julian Bond is a punk though, too bad he has to be such a political hack.  Anyways this is a quality film I enjoyed the deep portrayal of all of the singers faults and demons.  
 My daughter loved Cookie Monster, but I didn't like it as much. The eyes are too hard for a plush toy. Everytime she moves in bed when she is sleeping, Cookie Monster's eyes bangs on the wall. Other than that, he is really soft and cuddly 
 Along with "The Comedy of Errors," "Midsummer Night's Dream" remains one of my favorite Shakespeare comedies. Generally speaking, I don't like it when Shakespeare's plays are taken out of their time and place. But this is one case where in doing so, the beauty and dignity of the play was not marred in the least. The early 1900 Italian scenes and music seem to fit quite well. For those of you who haven't read the play, the story involves 3 subplots that Shakespeare intertwines quite well. The first is the 4 young lovers (Lysander, Demetrius, Helena, and Hermia.). Hermia's father wants her to marry Demetrius; Hermia loves Lysander; Helena loves Demetrius, but he is after Hermia. When Hermia and Lysander run away, we meet the 2nd plot. (Bottom and his actor friends.) We get to see them prepare a comedy that will be performed before the Duke Theseus.  There is one element of sorrow involving Bottom's unhappy marriage. In my opinion though, this fits rather well. (A little sadness seems to prevent a comedy from becoming a farce. And in Shakespeare's hilarious "Comedy of Errors," there was the one sad element of Egeon.) The 3rd subplot involves the rift between the fairy king Oberon, and his wife Titania. Titania has stolen an Indian boy, and Oberon wants him for his servant. (A faint resemblance to a custody case?) Well, Titania refuses to hand the child over, and Oberon plots revenge. He will cast a spell on his wife that will make her fall in love with whatever she sees when she wakes up. Oberon's servant Puck runs across the actors in the woods, and Bottom will play a part (unknowingly) in Oberon's revenge. Oberon also runs across the 4 young lovers. He pities the scorned Helena and decides to interfere. He will have Puck work a spell on Demetrius to make him love Helena. But of course, since this is a comedy, things will not exactly go according to plan! But despite the mishaps, Shakespeare manages to fix everything and prepare a happy ending. Rupert Everett (Oberon), Stanley Tucci (Puck), Michelle Pfiefer (Titania), and Kevin Kline (Bottom) play their parts with a beautifully convincing style. Director Michael Hoffman is not exactly Franco Zeffirelli, but he does an excellent job in scenery, music, and keeping the content of the play in tact. (Taking a classic and putting to screen is seldom easy!) The best thing I can say about this movie is that while it is funny, it is also done with beauty, style, and dignity. It may be that this movie shows that a comedy and a farce are NOT the same thing.    
 Recently I wrote a book about multinational management published in 1968. After finishing this book, I realized that the conflicts between multicultural and multinational difference are stands still under the similar managerial circumstance, though we are living in the digital-dominated world. So I studied this book compared with its' phenomenon as described in "International Management".   Keeping a flexible communication skill in multinational-cultural is the key factor to achieve meaningful outcome. For this, the open-minded, instructive and far-sighted personality required first. When they acknowledged difference not wrong each other, they can start to talk about what they want for negotiation, next proceed to persuade or yield a little. This means the more internationalized people there as a matchmaker, the more the company benefited from them.  Then how to get Mr. Right for global manager? They all born naturally? Or trained? Both are all right. Person who has got global brain with digital management skill (as Mr. Bill Gatz called) must appeal to adapt extreme change and more action to cope with international risky problem. They could continue to get or lose by trial and error and learned what's the best, step by step and case by case. There are no standard learning system to teach them.  That's not the lost rather than investment for human resources for each company ultimately.  If you are would-be-global manager or second-rate reginal manager or have a dream of international manager, read this book and write down and analyze what's your strong/weak point more carefully. Then take into action to the first-rate global manager. If anyone who is in a top-management read, they can set effective multinational goal to come and get. How about students or average person? Of course, they will be fine 
 People only buy EPs for two reasons. The first is to preview an album that's coming out. The second is for unreleased material. Now, since the album this is foretelling has already come, the only reason to buy it now is for the latter reason. This is in fact, why I bought it(getting it along with Rhapsody's "Dark Secret" ep, $13 for enough music to equal a full album)    The first song is "King of Fools," first single from Hellfire Club and I'd say about the fourth best song on that album, as well as this one. The edit's in this version run smoothly and this song is still as fun to listen to, but you'll probably just skip it if you already have Edguy's full legnth release.    Next is "New Age Messiah." 3rd best song on this album. It has a very nice rythem and, excluding the title track, is the catchiest song on the album. Very nice riffs going on.    Then it's "The Savage Union," 2nd best of the ep. Some fast riffing going on, this song is very close to "We Don't Need a Hero" from Hellfire Club, which is to say, a typical Edguy song. Nothing wrong with that, in my opinion.    Then comes the jewel of this album. "Holy Water" is actually one of the best ballad's I've heard that has come from the past 5 years. Not only are the vocals and playing simply amazing, but the orchestra finds itself in a perfect spot. Not too overpowering so it takes over everything else, but the ambiance it sets in raises the song so much that it would be completely different without it.    Finally, there's "Life and Times of a Bonus Track." It's a fun novelty track, but gets old after hearing it a few times. The straight piano and vocals from Tobi also get kind of boring after a minute. Definently the worst track from the album.    Still, this is possibly the greatest EP/single I've ever had the pleasure of listening to. Even if you're not an avid fan of Edguy, it's still something worth checking out 
 I used this book to pass the 70-219 exam with a great score and finish up my MCSE for Windows 2000. This book rightfully assumes you have already learned the material for and passed the 70-217 Active Directory Administration exam, and therefore will not waste your time on covering redundant material. A thorough expertise in dns is a must also. The study text is only about 330 pages - less than half of the other 70-219 books, but it is to the point and covers the material for the design exam very well. The second chapter gets too heavy into the business analysis end - almost like a graduate level business strategy class! Read it but don't worry about memorizing any of it, it did not prove that helpful to the exam. Just remember that business needs may override what might be the ideal or logical solution. The info in the last chapter about integrating Active Directory with Netware and Exchange was not covered on any of my four case studies either. What you need to know for the exam and is explained very clearly is how to determine the number and structure of  forests, domains/trees, organizational units, sites, dns namespace, and trusts based on the info in the case study. The number and placement of domain controllers, global catalogs, operations masters, and dns servers is also heavily covered. A brief overview of upgrading/migrating to Windows 2000 is covered and necessary for the exam. This is a very organized and logicaly thought out book with a chapter each devoted to forest, domain, organizational unit, and site configuration covering concepts on why you would choose a certain path (domains versus multiple forests or organizational units, etc). While the book does not contain an "example" exam case study, each chapter has excercises that are effective in helping you prepare. Read this book as many times as needed to understand the concepts presented for Active Directory Design and you will be very well prepared for the exam 
 An easy, entertaining read that gets people thinking about their life and their future.  Provides keys to moving through some of life's roadblocks.  Ideal for the College and Career set 
 I found this book easy to read and understand. It was exciting to follow the line of possessors of the Archimedes file, the events that brought the file to each in succession and the importance of each possessor in bringing  us closer to an understanding the structure of the universe. It was quite  informative about the attitudes and personalities of so many great  scientists 
 the cd is great the way they rap they showing the world that you don't need profanity to make a cd all you need is god and is word to guide you so they cd is grea 
 This book is by far the most colorful, beautiful to look at, and detailed of any we have found for the Night Before Christmas.  There is something new to look at every time we open it. My kids love it, and their teachers had a look at it and now they would like a copy. I highly recommend it. 
 My boys and I have had a smoothie every morning for breakfast for the past two weeks--we're hooked! I'm a type 1 diabetic, and find that a smoothie like this works perfectly for a great meal replacement. They keep me satisfied until the next meal, and most importantly, they really taste great. The carb counts are accurate and my blood sugar remains stable after having one. My kids aren't on a restricted carb diet, but they love the taste too! If you're already a low-carb dieter, you'll  most likely have all the ingredients in your pantry. Enjoy 
 "Bobbi Brown Beauty Evolution" is a guide to looking good and staying healthy from your 20s to your 70s and beyond. Six chapters cover each decade of your life, starting at age 20 and going on to beyond the age of 70. In each of these chapters, Bobbi explains what kind of make-up and cosmetics products you should use and why. After that, there's a chapter about staying fit and healthy. It includes information about the kind of nutrients you should be getting during each decade, too. Also inluded are tips on make-up and applying it, including how to find the right colors for you. My favorite part of the book were the chapters about the kinds of tools your would need to apply make-up. Plus, an entire chapter covered cleaning out your make-up drawer/cabinet/bag, with advice on what to keep and toss, and it also included a general timetable for make-up's life span. Many more topics were covered in this book, including caring for your skin, answers to beauty questions, quick fixes for beauty emergencies, beauty while you're pregnant, and much more. This book is an essential guide to beauty throughout your entire life 
 Hats off for Mr. Alan Menken for the breathtaking score for this motion picture.   Winner of 2 academy awards, this cartoon movie has excelled and reached heights a lot of other movies wanted to reach..  This soundtrack is kinda short but the music in it is just AWESOME! (and by the way, I added the music to my iPod with no problem 
 I was very happy to see an actual student of this author put up a review. It was about time! So many opinions by so many others, all with their own experiences (and this is good!) but none who knows him personally and who has worked under his guidance.  I also couldn't agree more with that reviewer, Mr. Itle, and his statements. I bought all of the authors (so far) three books, used them, and have gotten the results I was after. They just work. I can also see why some reviewers are so disgruntled with these books, because they simply tear up the mass of useless New Age faddism that doesn't work a hoot. Now I see the author has a web site so I went to it and found there is a FREE KABBALISTIC CALCULATOR there that I use daily for working his Kabbalistic Cycles book. It also has a "Magical Thoughts for the Week Column" which helped me understand his ceremonial magic book better than I did. But this present book, the Kabbalistic Handbook, has turned Darkness into Light for me. There were so many questions I had concerning "working the Tree" as it is called. So many books out there with so many "opinions." But from this handbook, I found out exactly how to access the Sephira through the Tarot, use their energy, do meditation that WORKS, and use his "Kabbalistic Analysis" to figure out and power magical rituals, that I feel I now have a good grounding in the principles that makes Magic work.  There are actually six of us who are studying and working together, all of us buying his books and studying them separately and then getting together once a week and discussing them (along with other books). It's always the same. The discussions and report of results received bring these meetings always back full circle back to his books. Our small group has made more progress in spiritual growth and worldly gains in the past year or so since his books started coming out than we did in the previous three years, limping along, struggling, trying to figure out "what to do next" because of some fad book that we "thought" would work. They didn't work though, just like the dozens of others before them that we tried that also didn't work.  Do I recommend his books? Absolutely! If you even look at the price of them, they're dirt cheap compared to so many others out there that do nothing but cause frustration, loss of time, and bring up doubt if Magic works at all. Well, it does work, but you have to have the RIGHT books to work from. I can tell you, that Dr. Lisiewski's books are among those very few that actually do work. It's about time this type of material came out. My compliments to the author and publisher. Oh. His website is 8thmatrixpress. But since Amazon forbids giving "URL" all I can say is type that in your browser field, add the www to the front of it and a com to the end and it will take you there.   If you want to get where you want to go in your worldly life by using Magic, then these books are definitely the way to go. All those here (and on some of the other reviews for his other books) with their armchair objections, suspicions, and doubt because his books cut up the New Age to pieces, should just continue to do as they are doing. Fail, and then blame it on some other explanation their glorious New Age is so full of. Speaking for me and my group, we couldn't be happier! 
 This book was my introduction to Barbara Johnson. Wow, am I ever gonna have to make up for lost time! She's great! I literally laughed until I cried. What a mind! What a sense of humor. I could relate to everything she  said. The Bible says that a merry heart doeth good like a medicine. Boy,  did I ever get a large dose! I'm buying some extra copies for my "over  50" friends! What better gift than the gift of laughter 
 Recommended by our Church group, belive it or not. Wonderful couples tool. Relaxing, caring and VERY loving 
 I loved a couple songs off of Live's first album, and was then completely blown away by Throwing Copper.  Unfortunately TC was SUCH a big success, that nowadays, I can't really listen to Selling The Drama, Lightning Crashes and All Over You, since the unrelenting radio-play pretty much ruined these songs for me.  But I still love jamming out to I Alone, Iris, Dam at Otter Creek and (the highlight of the album IMHO) White Discussion.  I remember hearing Lakini's Juice on the radio a few times, and Freaks too, but I never really got around to buying "Secret Samadhi".  Just yesterday I finally downloaded all the tracks and gave it a listen and am surprised at what a tremendous album it is.  I won't go into the song breakdown but I will agree with many of the previous reviewers that this is a DARK album.  But to me, that is simply picking up where White Discussion left off.  Personally, I like the fact that there are no REALLY radio-friendly tunes on this album.  And besides DARK can be good.  TOOL's album "Undertow" is one of the best albums ever and that thing is dark and creepy as hell.  I also agree that Live was not a "grunge" band per se.  They just sounded heavy at a time when sounding heavy meant you were lumped into a ridiculous label of being "grunge".  After all if you listen to Soungarden's "Louder than Love", Alice In Chain's "Sap", and Nirvana's "Nevermind", they are all very different.  And then are the Smashing Pumpkins "grunge?"  What about Bush?  What about Tool?  The whole "grunge" category is terribly simplistic.  I have always felt that some bands defy category.  Live is definitely one of them, and that's what makes them great.  As far as preachiness, I've never considered Ed's lyrics to be preachy.  They're obviously very personal to him (is there any better source) but I've never felt that any kindof message was being pushed on me.  Perhaps he's just urging the listener to think a little bit more (or in a different way) than usual.  So the long/short of it is, if you loved Throwing Copper because of the radio singles, you probably won't get "Secret Samadhi".  But if you dug the darker tunes like Iris, Dam or White Discussion (although that got pretty significant airplay too) then you should check out this album.  One other thing that appeals to me about Live personally, is that they somehow capture the essence of Southeast Pensylvania.  Maybe it's simply because I lived around Delaware/Philly when they were at their biggest, but their songs always remind me of the woods and the fields and the sticky summer nights.  Probably just because that's where I usually was when listening to them, but it's still pretty cool.  PS- I've also always felt that Ed has one of the most unique (and cool) voices in music.  The drummer is great too.  Go see them live 
 I believe that "Duck and Goose," released earlier this year, will one day enter the pantheon of classic children's picture books. It strikes just the right balance between humor and a gentle lesson about sharing and working together. Duck and Goose begin by squabbling over the soccer ball that they mistake for a large egg and end up dreamily making plans to raise their "baby" together. When a little bluebird blithely points out the obvious, Duck and Goose take their changed circumstances in stride. Duck and Goose's conversations will bring a chuckle even to the most jaded parent and the illustrations are lovely. Highly recommended by this children's lit snob. 
 A must have for anyone who writes or teaches writing or is learning writing. My 7 yr. old 2d grader loves this book but so do I as a writer and teacher. My son finds it easily understandable and it is written in such a way it is fun for him to use. As a result he is far ahead of most children his age in his writing skills.   What sets this book apart from other books or grammar is not only is it superbly organized but it has numerous examples which make the principles of grammar easily understood. That is one reason is is useful for a teacher in that it provides so many examples for use in the classroom.  The book begins with the theme of sentence buildng and the user learns how to build sentences. That is a valuable concept in both learning and teaching grammar.  I enthusiastically recommend it 
 I have not read the book, only the reviews.  In one excellent review here it is remarked that it is "unfortunate" that the author does not prove the Schoenflies theorem and the triangulability of surfaces.  later this same reviewer observes that the proof of the smooth Gauss Bonnet theorem in the book seems relatively hard.  I merely wish to point out that the author has made choices in the reader's interest both by what he includes and what he omits.  The two theorems named above which are not proved, could well take another entire book to prove.  They are far harder than the smooth Gauss Bonnet theorem.  I have seen entire books devoted to proving triangulability, and Schoenflies theorem was the subject of weeks of tedious work in a topology course I took as a student.  I still dislike even hearing of this result.  So if these omissions are the reviewer's only criticisms of the book, they should rightly be considered pluses.  Hence I also give the book at least 4 stars, by logical deduction 
 As the grandmother of a high functioning autistic child, I've learned some insight into how every day events affect my grandson.  I'm anxious to read more of Temple's dealing with autism in her everyday life 
 With the multitude of books written regarding the sport of baseball, Steven Travers writes with a unique insight into not only the sport, but the day to day lives of Bonds and his peers.  As a former professional baseball player, Travers touches on the subject matter with a unique insight and perspective.  Additionally, Travers attended and graduated from USC during the time Bonds played at Arizona State (Pac-10).  As such, Travers is not only a writer, but a fan.  Travers not only documents Bond's achievement of becoming baseball's all-time single season homerun champion, but he touches on Bond's trials and tribulations with his peers and the media.  Ultimately, the reader soon realizes that Travers was able to do what many has tried and failed at; that is, he was able to garner the respect and support of Bonds in the ability to tell his amazing story to the whole world.  As a former Pac-10 pitcher at USC who battled Bonds on many occasions, I found Traver's insight very refreshing and commendable.  I found the book a very easy read that kept me entertained throughout.    '      
 After "Parade", Prince decided he needed to be by himself again and so he said "Peace" to the Revolution. Originally he wanted to release a 3 LP album called "Crystal Ball". Warner Brothers were definitely not down with that so Prince had to trim it down to two LP's. The end result was "Sign O' The Times." Released in 1987 this album was hailed almost immediately as a landmark record. This is the way a double-album is supposed to be made and in my opinion it is the last great double album of original material to be released in music. (Yes, I know about "All Eyez On Me and "Life After Death" but there is just one problem with Hip-Hop double records....there is no change in the music. Not that they aren't good records). Within a "Rock" context an artist can play different musical styles. That to me is why Hip-Hop double albums don't work. "Sign O' The Times" works and brilliantly so.  This record is the cousin of "The Beatles" (white album), "Electric Ladyland", "Exile on Main Street, "Physical Graffiti", "Songs in the Key of Life" and "London Calling". These records are all great because the reach exceeds the grasp....They go over and beyond and Prince did the same thing amazingly well.  This man in case you did not know can write a song. Sometimes it seems too easy for him. To me, this is Prince's version of "What's Going On" or "There's A Riot Going On". (Marvin Gaye and Sly and The Family Stone respectively). In the title track Prince covers AIDS, Heroine, Crack, gangs, Hurricanes, The Challenger Explosion, people dying....He could of wrote 7 songs on those topics alone!! But it makes you think about the world we live in. (At least in 1987)  But for as bleak as the song is the amazing thing about a double-record is that a mood can change in a blink of an eye and that's what Prince did with "Play in the Sunshine". Upbeat, fun, this is Prince showing there is a light at the end of the tunnel. (To use an overblown expression). The middle breakdown of this song is just sick.....Prince is on drums, guitar, keys, bass and xylophone and has a Frank Zappa esque breakdown before the second solo. (while talking to himself!!) He's just showing you why he's the man on this track. And that's just the second song!!  Needless to say the man covers a ton of ground throughout the two discs...there's ballads "The Ballad of Dorothy Parker", "Slow Love", and "Adore." "Adore" is a simply beautiful song sang in his wonderful falsetto and is to me his greatest R&B ballad. (Purple Rain of course being his greatest Rock ballad) Of course Funk- "It", "It's Gonna Be a Beautiful Night" (A live Revolution track), "Housequake" and "If I Was Your Girlfriend" The latter being one of his strangest songs but it works somehow with a great bassline. Rock- "The Cross", "U Got The Look", "I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man". R&B-"Forever In My Life", "Strange Relationship". Pop- "Starfish and Coffee", "Play in the Sunshine". The singles were the title track, "If I Was Your Girlfriend, "U Got the Look" and "I Could Never Take The Place of Your Man."  Yes, I know this review is messy but that's the nature of the record....Prince held nothing back and showed all his cards. To me, this is his greatest album. Even more so than "Purple Rain", only because of the sheer diversity in the music. "Purple Rain" changed popular music and is more culturally significant but artistically speaking Prince never got better than this album. With his Linn drum machine in hand you hear the rhythm section, the vocal group, the rock band all come out in this album. One critic said this album is the sound of the late 80's and I completely agree. "Sign O' The Times"- One of the defining albums in pop music history.    
 I have tried all four Fox River Rice flavors and this is my favorite.  While cooking the rice, the aroma of the seasoning filled my kitchen!  This flavor also has a little bite from the pepper.  I have served it with chicken and steak!  Great product 
 I just traveled from Minneapolis to Los Angeles with my favorite four legged girl at my side.  We had a fantastic time the whole way because of this book.  It's easy to use, with great places to stay and tips on traveling.  I wouldn't do a road trip without it 
 This book is a keeper. Borysenko gently holds a mirror up for us to peek into our essence and see through our masks. We are a kaleidoscope of feelings, a symphony of thoughts drumming our consciousness, and much, much more. Joy comes with the observer, with insight into our humanity, with unraveling the heartless assumptions we have made about ourselves, and with letting go of the shame we carry.  An articulate, important book 
 Taruffi's book is still the best beginner's book on motor racing despite its being decades old! As a former professional racing driver I can tell you that Taruffi presents the concepts a racer needs to master before getting into a car ... in fact, many driving schools use this book as a primary teaching text. Taruffi got it exactly right ... anyone who wants to race, or just do a better job of navigating the local twisty roads, should get this book and savor i 
 This is the best CD I have ever listened to! I highly recommend i 
 As a pharmacy student, I found the Washington Manual to be the best pocket guide for looking up guidelines and treatment options, as well as interaction charts and pregnancy categories.  This is a well written book that covers most of the major cronic health conditions and treatment.  This book does not waste time and space talking about every detail of each disease state, but rather focuses on the causes, measurements and treatments.  My only criticism is that this latest edition is dated 2004 and in medical therapeutics, is considered old 
 I purchased my Eton here on Amazon for $99 and received mine several weeks ago with great anticipation. The wait was worth it, since the digital tuning and very good reception make the radio well worth the price paid. I own a large collection of shortwave radios and feel that this radio competes well with some of my classic 70s/80s era receivers which are extremely selective and cost more than the Eton/Grundig hardware.  The only minor dig I have is the cheap nature of the tuning knob and the desire for a venier tuning control. I can fudge the tuning with a bit of a fine touch, but it does take some attention, especially with some stations that drift in and out. For casual listening, this radio is extremely stable and very good for field use and trips. I fired mine up out of the box and was immediately impressed with the solid feel and large high-quality antenna. The leather grip and heavy-duty feel more than compensate for my tuning knob complaint and I feel that this unit competes well with my smaller Grundig radio that sees active use when camping and hiking.  I am uncertain if the AM band is tuned using a ferrite internal antenna with this model and will be testing the unit with an external antenna to see if DXing AM stations is possible with this model... It probably is a standard ferrite antenna but it sure would be nice to find I can extend the function of the S350 for this pleasant hobby of DXing remote AM stations.  One other nice modification would be for Eton to evolve the S350DL to support a simple circuit for memory of stations. It would be a logical thing to do and would be worth a few extra dollars to have some more intelligence built into the rig.  Overall, for the $99 I spent, a very good deal and a radio I'll own for a very very long time. If this is your first Shortwave radio, it is a good purchase and a good introduction to the hobby 
 I love this cookbook.  The ingredients are simple and the instruction are easy to follow.  
 It's rare that you come across a cookbook that you would make every recipe. It's even more rare when you come across a cookbook where every single recipe you've tried is a winner. This is a no-fail, delicious cookbook, with easy recipes that are perfectly explained. As a bonus, the author includes general cooking pointers that are extremely useful for any recipe. I have yet to come across a disappointing recipe and look forward to continue cooking my way through this book 
 I recently read this book while riding on the Boston T.  I attracted quite alot of attention and often had passangers ask me about the book or offer criticism about it being a fabrication.  The notion that Dershowitz plagarized or fabricated this book truly is ridiculous and anyone with sense should recognize that this is just an attempt to discredit an author who has taken an unpopular side on a hot button issue, namely Israel.  There's nothing worse these days than being a supporter of Israel , given that it is much more fashionable to support Palestinians and terrorism...errr I'm sorry, freedom fighters (just ask Hollywood).  That being said, if you already have your mind made up that Israel is evil I don't recommend this book, you won't make it past page 1.  Dershowitz isn't hiding his support for Israel, after all the book is called a Case for Israel!  He very clearly and articulately takes on almost every single lie and challenge that Israel has faced and provides the reader with a systematic and well thought out response.  I applaud Dershowitz for having the courage to write this book, when it would be a much more popular and trendy move for him to attack Israel. That being said, this book most likely will not have the impact Dershowitz was hoping for. Discussing Israel leads to such ignorant and rageful responses from people that have there minds made up.  These people, the one's who truly need to read ths book, unfortunately never will. 
 This is a great book looking at the debate between Calvinism and Arminianism. It takes you back when this controversy started in the 5th Century. It goes through all the major players in this controversy like Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Edwards, Finney, and Lewis Sperry Chafer ( Founder of Dallas Theogical Seminary). This book is great and Luther and Edwards do a greatjob in defending what is known today as Calvinism. If you want to know how this started and how this effects the church today. Read this book.  great job R.C. Sprou 
 This is a highly original and unpredictable suspense novel, totally unlike anything I'd read before.  Let's start with the premise: the protagonist has a peculiar hobby -- he follows people as they drive home.  The plot flows very smoothly from there and drifts into an older murder in which the protagonist's family was intimately involved.  Just excellent -- and it's his first book 
 I am the child of two wonderful Lesbian moms, and I was thrilled to find this book! Finally I can read about people who grew-up like I did and went through similar experiences. This book is informative and real. I love the fact that she paints the picture of the gay family as being just like everyone, sometimes happy, sometimes disfunctional, but never inherently bad for being queer. The sections where she touches on the pressure that children of gay families have to live with really hit home with me. Between living with homophobia from childhood, keeping our families in the closet, calling our step-parents "roomates", and fearing for our own safety and our rights as a family unit, this book covers all the bases. Another topic that I had always felt but never had the words to describe she goes over in the last two chapters of the book. Growing up in the queer community and then being rejected by that community when we grow older and happen to be in a straight relationship is hard, and I have never ever heard anyone else talk about it before. Not to mention the guilt we feel if we ourselves happen to be queer as well (because then the world will think our parents *made* us queer, oh no!). Overall, an excellent informative read for anyone. I love it!   
 Many readers appear to seek a scientific work here, a scientific theory with solid evidence to back it up. This approach is too tight. The book is more fun and more useful as an elaboration beyond the provable of titillating facts from many disciplines. When all is said, the information from the various sciences is not just about engineering, but about our view of ourselves and where we fit into the universe. This book helped me reflect upon these matters, and brought to my attention information that had slipped by unnoticed 
 It is mainly of a boy growing up on a farm and all of the hardships he encounters along the way of growing up. Aunt Lou, who has played the part of his mother ever since his parents death, is also growing up. I think anyone is interested in reading a wonderful, family related book this is the one 
 While teaching an 8 year old girl to crochet, I found she was left-handed and that I would need a special book for her.  I found the book "Learn To Crochet In Just One Day/Left Hand" by Jean Leinhauser at Amazon.com.  This is the perfect book for a left handed child to learn crochet and she is very pleased with it.  Thank You 
 I thoroughly enjoyed the many comments by people great and small on their remembrances of November 22, 1963. This well-written narrative of the last days of JFK also provided some unusual comments and insights from friends of JFK from Robert McNamara to Jerry Lewis that I had not read before, as well as the the feelings of shock and despair that prevailed with ordinary people on hearing the horrific news of the assasination. This book has certainly supplemented my information on this well documented tragedy 
 One of the joys of reading fiction is in the people you meet on the way. The truly great books have you almost grieving for the characters to whom you must say goodbye as you close the book. So it is with The Gold Bug Variations - I miss Ressler too.  You'll read the prose that approaches poetry, the virtuosity, the contrapuntal style (not contrapunctal, as one reviewer put it), and the breadth of subject material. All of these delight and dazzle, but with Ressler, Powers reaches the heart 
 My son got this book for his 2nd birthday and he really likes it.  When I read it I really ham it up and he laughs out loud every time.  It's very cute and a pretty quick read (for those with shorter attention spans).  I would definitely recommend this book 
 This cd is absolutely wonderful! Anybody who says otherwise is out of their mind, there's not a song on this cd that I don't like. From the opening note of "It Don't Matter" to the beautiful ending song "Daddy Was A Navy Man" it is all together one of the greatest cds I have ever purchased. Full of melody and heart this cd is a MUST have! For lyrics and more information on Kevin Denney be sure to check out [url 
 It Came From Outer Space is a good movie to watch.  I like the story and the scenes in the desert.  Richard Carlson, Barbara Rush and Charles Drake did an excellent job.  I liked the story.   
 I would give five stars to the first 5 or so chapters without question. Merkel provides a very inspiring background to his topic and some great examples. The thing I didn't like about the book was that once you get into the more technical aspects, it loses its energizing quality a bit and gets slightly confusing. I would have enjoyed the book better if the beginning was expanded to provide more examples and maybe the rest of it was offered as a seperate workbook. However, even if you read only the beginning, this is a great book to get you started on living more sustainabl 
 Having been asked to spend a few weeks at a remote Naval base in the former “German Democratic Republic”, I had plenty of time on my hands to read Walter Scott’s “Heart of Midlothian” in the Oxford World’s Classics edition (with notes, 580 pages), something that whiled away the time more than satisfactorily, this novel being perhaps the best that Scott ever wrote. In his previous Waverley novel, “Old Mortality”, he had described the unruly, extreme tendencies of Covenanter Calvinism. In this book, he shows us the other side of the strict Biblical piety he had got to know during his own childhood. The novel is based on two true stories, the Porteous riots in Edinburgh, and the heroics of one Helen Walker, a simple Scots lass who walked to London to save her sister from an unjustly imposed death penalty for child murder. Scott’s way of combining these two stories, making the leader of the riot to be the father of the child that had disappeared, is neither historical nor particularly convincing, and the fate of the child is, indeed, a horrible one. But for me, the most interesting aspect of the book was the description of the Christianity practised by Lowland Scots at the beginning of the 18th century. Davie Deans, the father of Scott’s heroine, is something of a Cameronian or strict covenanter, and it is, perhaps, his very strictness which drives his young daughter Effie to the worldly pursuits that he so much abhorrs. But Davie Deans is an honest soul, and despite his wordy arguments with his neighbours, emerges as a very sympathetic figure, who, towards the end of the book, reaches something of a compromise to enable himself and his elder daughter to live in fairly comfortable circumstances; this, surely, is a picture of how Scott sees the development of theological Calvinism, forced to come to terms with the political and social realities of a Scotland dominated by “prelatist” English interests. Jeannie Deans, Scott’s rather romanticized version of Helen Walker, is an equally strict believer, but her faith expresses itself not in words but in actions, and this is what makes her both a charming heroine and a symbol of what, according to Scott, is best in Christianity and Calvinism.  As for the rest of the book, it is the descriptions of the Porteous riots and the storming of the Edinburgh prison, the “Heart of Midlothian”, at the beginning which make the greatest impression, followed perhaps by the trial scenes and then the interviews in London with the Duke of Argyll and with Queen Caroline, wife of George II. The last part of the book, which is due entirely to Scott’s imagination and has no basis in reality, is more disappointing, as though Scott thought he could not publish a novel without at least some scenes in the Highlands, scenes which here do not ring absolutely true.  Reading Scott is never easy, but the World’s Classics edition makes a brave attempt at facilitating the procedure with copious explanatory notes, a historical overview and a glossary which, while not containing every difficult word, is comprehensive enough to help the reader through the intricacies of Scottish legal Latin and Lowland dialect. 
 Some of the other reviews here have cited H.G. Wells as a key inspiration for this book, but personally I found strong echoes of some of Robert Heinlein's longer works, which are also often cast as family sagas (the Long and Farnham families for example).  The difference here is that whereas Heinlein's heroes would probably have sprung into blazing action against the Entities, Silverberg's Carmichael clan are smart enough, while itching for vengeance, to recognise that resistance without a better understanding of their enemy would be futile.  However, how do you understand an alien so advanced and inhuman that it regards you as little better than we regard a mosquito?  Does an ant understand why we destroy its nest in our garden?  Does a sheepdog understand why we want the sheep rounded up?  Does a donkey know what load it is carrying, and why?  This is the kind of gap Silverberg paints.  Those who complain that the aliens' motivation is impenetrable, or that they could easily communicate with us, are missing the point.  How, Silverberg is asking, do you keep the dream of freedom alive over many decades when nothing can be done to achieve it?  PS After writing this original review, I realised that the name of several of the main characters, Anson, is Robert A. Heinlein's middle name.  This reinforces my belief that the book is inspired by Heinlein, indeed a sort of tribute to his work 
 I absolutely loved this book! I loved the premise of the short stories by fabulous authors. "Girls' Night Out" introduced me to so many new "chick-lit" authors. After reading the book I had to run out and get "Girls' Night In."  
 I bought Can't Buy Me Love (the authors first book) one day when I was browsing, looking for something different and fun to read, and I enjoyed every minute of it. So I didn't think twice when Uncle Max came out. I shelled out the money for the hardcover--and I wasn't disappointed. It was funny, poignant and even heartbreaking in places for what Uncle Max, Dillon and even Dillon's mother went through. At this rate Chris Kenry is going to be one of the few authors I actually will keep buying (even at -groan- hardcover prices). I'm looking forward to the next 
 I can not praise this book enough. It is excellent through and through. I know this is a book that is commonly read in high school. Since I did not read when I was young I deprived my self of some great reading. The begining I thought was slow, until the story hits the road, then I start to really feel their plight. My father had worked in real life in a apple cannery in California for a short time, he always said the "Okies" were some of the nicest most generous people you would ever want to meet. It is certainly ironic to read a book about oppression and discrimination by white people and to see that it is the same race of people who treat them as animals. That tells me that racism is much deeper than the color of your skin. If everybody read this, perhaps people would be more tolerent and compasionate, I know this is how the book made me feel. The end is tragic but so were the lives of many of these real Americans who were displaced by the Dustbowl. 
 I have been a KB fan ever since "Thug Mentality". I always liked Bone but never had any cd's until I bought that album. After that album, and still, I think KB is the best rapper of all time. Gemini: Good vs. Evil is a good CD overall, just not as many songs, and not as many good songs as I would have liked. Favorite tracks:    1.)Put it on Ya'll - Very aggressive track, Krayzie at his best (Hard, and Dark flows, and beat). I only wish the song was longer. Wish good too. 2.)Getchu Twistid - For me this song is perfect. I really like Krayzie on Lil' Jon's CD "Dont Give A F***". So for Krayzie to hook up with the King of Crunk on this track its definately bangin. I wish there were more songs with this kind of energy. 3.)Thats That Bone - Good beat, good song. Krayzie is only limited to how good the beat is. This song is good, but not great, Krayzie and Wish bring the heat on this one. 4.)Nuthin But Music - Very good song, Krayzie shows love for all the rap artists before him, showing a lot of respect. Tells us how it was when he was less fortunate, and all he had was music to keep him going. 5.)All I'm Hearing - Love this song, just cause it sums up everything wrong with rap now. Too many clones out there, and rappers lying about their lives just to portray an image or sound that is popular. 6.)Mangled - Short song with no chorus. Only a true KB fan would appreciate this song. Satisfies the straight killa, displays KB's skills once again.  7.)Murda Muzik - Krayzie showing how many ways he can flow with one simple concept. One more song that you will like if you really like harmonizing and good flows about "murda muzik".  The rest of the songs are all good, just not really songs I still listen to 6 months later.  Krayzie is the best rapper of all time, so go get this and all his other albums. Krayzie is the realest, and a legend in hip-hop. No other rapper can touch him.  
 When this is playing in the backround, people don't really stop what theyre doing to listen to it, but it does bring everyone's spirits up. It's a very jazzy funky collection of 50s-70s sounding lounge music from the very modern, to the cheesy burt bacharach-ish last track. Most of it is very enjoyable, but a few just make me laugh and hit the 'next' button, such as Stereo Action Unlimited's 'Hi Fi trumpet'. Overall a very nice cd and a collection of songs and styles I have yet to find anywhere else 
 I'm 14 and I still love this book. Eleanor Estes is a fantastic writer and this is one of my favourites. I highly reccomend this book for ANY age-it has something for everyone 
 The  book has a big list of things you can see with only a pair of binoculars. So I gave the nerds both binoculars and a telescope.  Very good book 
 I've liked every book I've read by Flynn.  This was superb 
 If you are the type of person who doesn't prefer non-informational quirks and innovative spins used in the presentation of hard scienfitic facts, then this book isn't for you.  However, if you happen to find learning more entertaining and engaging when it includes a little bit of humor, imagination and creativity in its descriptions of what otherwise would be pretty dry material, then I would definitely suggest this book.  Some people may find the kind of format it uses to be inappropriate or distracting, depending on their attitude towards learning in general, but I personally found it to be so witty and vividly personable compared to most textbooks that I almost felt like I was reading for recreation again (which I haven't done really to any extent since I enrolled in medical school and have had my head buried in books out of obligation).    On the whole, however, this book should be used only as a supplement to a conventional neurology text in order to gain a better conceptual understanding of neurology and a basic overview of the organization of its components and how they interact, because it actual content is abbreviated to the point where specific details that I will be required to know for exams are excluded.  
 Heinlein was one of the best, and you would be missing out if you passed up the chance to read this, one of his many masterpieces.  This story can still hold its own (despite being printed in 1957) against others in the genre- again, Heinlein was a master story-teller.   Enough people have given the summary of the book, but Heinlein wrote beyond the surface.  The story is of an actor who truly discovers a greatness within himself that he at first only pretended to own.  It's a story of humanity- in the politics the actor must represent- that humanity must not be doomed to repeat the same mistakes of seeing itself superior to other races, but instead try to learn to live in harmony.  Like any good story it takes believeable characters and puts them in seemingly real situations in fantasy worlds, and tells us how we could only hope to act were we in such a predicament. I'm lucky enough to own a first edition in great shape.  I happened across it at a yard sale and had to pick it up.  To me it was a "new" Heinlein novel as I hadn't heard of it.  It's a light read, and although short, it's deep and fun.  The plot loosely reminded me of a certain movie about an actor who impersonates the president...  Of course this book was written LONG before that, and is much better.  Read this book because it was written by Heinlein.  Love it because it was well written. 
 Great book!  Very explanatory. The Divine Matrix is a field of energy.  It is our world and everything in our world. We are part of it too.  The book talks about the process of getting what you truly want and "how to do it".  Recaps the 20 important things to remember at the end, after explaining each of the 20 in depth, in its chapter spot.  Some of the things explained are that you must put out there the thought of what you want (your consciousness creates), include emotion in the thought, and it is imperative that you see yourself as already being there/having the item/situation.  That last one is a deal-breaker.  (I've personally found it very helpful, when you are visualizing what you want, to include all of your 5 senses in the visualization process, too--or as many of the 5 senses as possible.  See it.  Feel it.  Smell it, etc. That also enhances the "emotion" factor they speak of in the book.)  The book goes into in-depth explanations on quantum theory and scientific-based explanations throughout the book that will amaze you. Good material.  If you REALLY want to change your life, and are willing to do some radical belief-changing (at least for most people), and some attitude-changing, this book provides great information and the process.    Assuming you are not already there, you must begin changing from the inside out.  You must begin to let go of negative emotions (fear, anger, jealousy), so that you can tune in to the correct vibrations.  Hint:  This really is a prerequisite.  Start anywhere you can in self improvement, but you gotta get rid of negative vibes.) (If you hang on to the negative vibes, they will interfere with your ability to manifest what you truly want.  You will, instead, manifest what you do NOT want.  An great example is fear.  You are afraid the car will break down.  You keep thinking "I hope the car does not break down.  Guess what.  It does because you kept thinking about it.  Even though you said "not".  The universe does not understand the "not" part. And, while you were thinking "not," that fear put a lot of emotion in the thinking process.  When I think back about some of the things that happened in past years after my fears put all that energy into them--coincidence?  Nah! Way too many times.  The more emotion, the quicker they come to pass.  Be careful where you put your thoughts.  Remember the old saying "Be careful what you wish for") Anyway, read the book.  You won't go wrong.  This is life-changing material.  There is a lot of similar stuff out there right now, covering this very hot topic, and for good reason.  There are more opportunities today than ever before to raise your awareness. People are beginning to put their beliefs into print and are also able to provide some scientific evidence of things previously thought to be lies/B.S./a joke/impossible, etc.   Different books out there talk about "mirroring," how people will "mirror" your behaviors/fears/uncertainties, etc. back to you, as a lesson for you to see.  Toward the end of the book, it includes a more in-depth explanation about mirroring, explaining 5 types of mirroring.  "Reflections of the Moment" is the normal mirroring, reflecting back what you think.  But the second type of mirroring is "Reflections of what we judge in the moment".  This was the first time I read of mirroring the way we judge and it was a big "aha" moment for me.  I believed I was pretty free of judging others, but there were 2 people who I still had issues with.  I could not figure out why.  I was not EVER like they acted.  Then I realized, I was unconsciously still "judging" their behaviors.  That lesson, alone, was worth the price of this book for me!  Now I can resolve these issues and be "free" of these feelings once and for all.   I also highly recommend motivational materials by Dr. Wayne Dyer. I also recommend getting away from the television (too much negativity) and finding yourself some really peaceful music, whatever artist(s) resonates best with you. If you're into Angels, check out Doreen Virtue.  If you are looking for communicating with Spirit Guides or Animals, or Aura Reading, or interpreting messages from nature and/or animals, try Ted Andrews.  Ted also has a Kaballah book which I have only skimmed through so far, but he puts out excellent books which are very informative.  Peace and love to you in your quest for knowledge 
 Aside from setting a benchmark for other franchises (perhaps most notably 007) to follow, Batman Begins is a remarkably ambitious and mostly successful attempt to bring some real substance to the comic book genre beyond mere mood. It has a sense of the epic to it, as well as an awareness of the escalation of moral quandaries that come with taking the law into your own hands that haven't been seen in a big-budget summer picture since Clear and Present Danger. It's not just a case of a superhero fighting a supervillain either: the various mobsters, evil geniuses and crooked businessmen are all part of a much larger corruption that ensures that even a semblance of moral balance cannot be restored by the end credits as per other superhero flicks. Christopher Nolan even manages to get strong performances from actors who had long ago drifted into ham and volume like Gary Oldman and Rutger Hauer. It also has a few problems, not least the lack of depth in the photography or Nolan's deficiencies as an action director (not Michael Bay bad, but not particularly good either), but they're outweighed by the pluses.  The 2-disc set boasts an impressive array of extras (including numerous Easter Eggs), although the lovingly crafted comicbook art menu pages can get a little annoying to work your way through at times and it's a shame that only the brief teaser trailer has been included 
 Legend John Scofeild playing with Medeski, Martin and Wood? Whats not too like? I guess the argument about it being a bit repetitive from track-to-track and leaning too [...] the sharp nine is valid. But so what? If you're in the mood for some guitar driven jazz/funk this will suit you just fine. As for calling the tracks on this album "throw aways" and then comparing them to "Kind of Blue" (one of the most prolific albums in jazz history) -- that is sheer [...].  
 Its probably a good thing I wasn't drinking anything as I read this book, because I would have frequently sprayed the pages with my beverage if I had! Dave Barry takes aim at the trials and tribulations of home ownership, and hits the mark as accurately as he does any of his targets. This is funny stuff, best appreciated by those of us who have actually been there and done that. I had to read a number of passages to my wife, but her favorite was the bit about finding a pediatric group after moving. There is one piece of advice in here that I might actually follow when we finally are ready to move again: "Set fire to your household goods...and just walk away." 
 I purchased this product a few years ago & I have replaced the batteries a # of times, it has been dropped numerous times.  The screen was so bad you could hardly read it. The local store I purchased it at has not had it again so I could replace it.  I finally got online just to see if I could find a game comprable to this one and low and behold I found the same one!  Thanks so much having it for me to find 
 Comparisons with other sister groups of the forties are often made, but are meaningless. They may have been influenced by the Andrews, the Boswells, the Dinnings or the Kings, or any number of other sister acts, but their style was very much their own.   The McGuires tackled a diverse range of material, from upbeat swinging song to tender love songs, and from jazz to country songs, yet all done in their trademark style, which was in some ways typical easy listening fifties pop, yet they didn't sound too much like anybody else. Despite the diverse sources of their songs, they all blend together very well.   Their two big #1 hits, Sincerely and Sugar time, are of course included, along with all the other hits that matter. This is a highly entertaining collection of music by three sisters who continued to have hits even after Elvis changed the face of popular music, and gives far more variety than any hits collection 
 This album is really great. Could have done with a bit more melody in some parts, definately has some STRAPPING YOUNG LAD elements mixed in. Swedish metal in general just rules and this is no exception, although not really a contender for my best album of the year. The instrumentals and their titles also come accross as slightly lame. Fav trancks: Secondary Effects, Fading Dimensions and Godforsaken Universe. If your not into DARKANE yet, I suggest purchasing EXPANDING SENSES before this album. Enjoy.. 
 This volume is a good addition to the Biblical expositor's reference library. But the first step is to become familiar with the Bible by actually having spent time reading and studying it. Many questions become answered once you understand the entire Bible in context. Then reference books such as this become useful in understanding cultural references, difficulties in the English translations of the original autographs, etc 
 A wonderful series!  I loved every minute!  Great read for women of any age 
 I'd have to say that this is Shatner's second best music CD, the best being Has Been.   I'd recommend this to any Shatner fan 
 A few reviews gave this book a one rating. Throw their reviews out since most reviewers gave this book a 5 star rating.  This is a classic book to be read by the young, and older folk, especially the former who may never have heard of a guy named Hitler.  I guess you can never satisfy everyone, and some people live to be different from the vast majority. They can say that they trashed Mr. Wouk or Hemingway or Faulkner...on-and-on. It puts them in the spotlight for a nanosecond, and gets people like me angry enough to write about their silly reviews in such forums 
 I think that Col. Hunt has written a superb book of the challenges facing the US regarding the terrorist threats to us all.  He writes in a very deliberate and to the point style that I find refreshing 
 Hundert is a dialectical thinker, always looking for ways to synthesize the many "thesis" and "antithesis" found both within and between the fields that he carefully adresses. This is his main strenght. How can the study of Kant and Hegel enrich our understanding of 20th century developmental psychology and psychoanalysis, or how does the late neuroscience inform us about the same problems philosophers have been struggling with for ages - the difference between perception and cognition, relations of memory and self-consciousness...? In his Synthetic Analysis, Hundert follows carefully these different threads of thought from the beginning of modern philosophy (Descartes) through Kant, Hegel, existential psychiatrists (Jaspers, Minkowski), Piaget and many others up to our days of rapidly developing neuroscience (Hubel & Wiesel, Fodor, Edelman), offering an instructive and constructive intercritique of each to the benefit of others, tying up seemingly remote areas of investigation without getting too lost or complicated on the way. Don't get me wrong, its not always a joyride unless you have an equally profound and balanced understanding in the fields he discusses. I had some struggling with philosophy and the last chapter of neuroscience, being previously informed primarily in psychology myself. But it was more than worth it, and I feel much better "equipped" to face the complexities of each of these disciplines. Easily one of the best scholarly works I've read! 
 #1 HALOS AND HORNS- This Is A Very Nice Song good harmonies and instramintation 4.3/5 #2 SUGAR HILL- Now this song is fun with banjos and harmonicas with funny lines like "Down in the mill pond swimming naked showing more than we should have showed" Then Halfway Through The Song Things Elevate And Has A Choir In The Background Wich Sounds Beautiful Then At The End The Song Speeds Up Pretty Fast Then Ends "Up On Sugar Hill" 5/5 #3 NOT FOR ME-This Is As Slow As It Gets although The Sound Clips Make It Sound Kind Of Boring but if you listen to the whole song it would probly change your mind about this song. It is very beautiful and calm, it might not be your favorite but I LIKE IT 5/5 #4 HELLO GOD- This is the song that did the best on the charts, It Was not a Hit but it made it up to #60 on the country charts Dolly Also made a music video for it from the CMA Awards in 2002. Anyways The Song Starts Out Kind Of Quiet in The First Part Then Comes The Choir and More music. So If You Like Dollys More Recent CD FOR GOD AND COUNTRY You Would Like This One Like I Do 5/5 #5 IF -I Dont Have Much To Say About This Song, Dolly Could Have Exchanged this song for another one but its good I like the mandolin and banjo solos the most 3.6/5 #6 SHATTERD IMAGE- This Song Originaly appered on dollys ALL I CAN DO album back in 1970 or something and the updated version sounds better than ever with a new verse (The Old Version Had 3 Verse's and this one has 4 Verse's)4.3/5 #7 THESE OLD BONES- This song is very uniqe some people will like it some wont but when I listend to the song for then first time I was very suprised the other voice on here that dose not really sound like dolly. the sound clips only tell half the story because dolly plays an old mountain woman on the chours and on a few verses. And Dolly's real voice on the rest of the verses, and on the final chorus dolly sings with her normal voice and her old mountain woman voice together, I guess you can say she dose a duet with herself. The Song is about 6 mins long and the lyrics in the booklet take up 2 pages. one her most creative songs 4.9/5 #8 WHAT A HEARTACHE- This is the third time dolly has recorded this song. It was on her rinstone album (soundtrack from the movie) Currently Unavalible, Then the next version on EAGLE WHEN SHE FLIES Album (Still Avalible in the ocasional music store)Is The Best Version, Now Its on HALOS AND HORNS and I think Dolly puts too much emotion in it And The Backgroung music sounds not very profeshional. 2.8/5 #9 IM GONE- Dolly is going to leave you with a whole bunch of stuff and you'll have alot of explaining to do (You Will Understand What I Mean If You Hear The Whole Song). Dolly Has Made A Music Video For This Song and although it did not make it on to the charts the music video is quite funny it feartures dolly being attacked by an alien and UFO's. If You Think The Song Sounds boring in the sound clip you will be happy to know that the song gets better as it goes on. 5/5 #10 RAVEN DOVE-Dolly Parton said that she wrote this song at about 2:00 am in the morning, Strange Huh?.This song is another song about peace and love However Her Voice sounds strained around the end of the song but if you take that out you have a beautiful song 3.7/5 #11 DAGGER THROUGH THE HEART-This Song Is Full Bluegrass No Choirs, No Drums, And No Electric Instraments. I think dollys voice is best on this song Same with the background singers. This was the first single on the album and the first music video on the album 5/5 #12 IF ONLY-I Think this is the most sad song on the album but so beautiful and great at the same time. 5/5 #13 JOHN DANEIL-A GREAT SONG 5/5 #14 STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN- I Think This is the best cover of someone elses song in years I love it! The Sound Clips make it sound very slow and not exciting, DONT BE FOOLED LIKE I WAS!!! Because the part you were listening to was the very begining of the song. Later on the song picks up a bit when dolly sings "OH! MAKES ME WONDER" Then comes the really nice harmonies then the drums come in and it sounds more uplifting. Dont forget the banjo solos then the song speeds up and the choir comes in and it sounds perfect! But then the magic ends when the song ends "And She's Buying A Stairway to Heaven" 5/5 ALL THE WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Overall this is a great album, its just a notch behind little sparrow and the grass is blue. And All Of The Songs Were Writen By Dolly Exept For Stairway To Heaven And If. At april 2003 Halos And Horns has sold over 230,000 copies not far from Little sparrow wich sold 270,000 copies so far. The Grass Is Blue Sold about 210,000 Copies or more.  If you choose or not choose to by this Great Album I Also Recommend LITTLE SPARROW (Avalible) THE GRASS IS BLUE (Avalible) and HUNGARY AGAIN (Used CD's may be Avalible) These Four CD's Are Dollys Best Work Yet!!!  Dolly Also Has 2 More Albums Out. One Is FOR GOD AND COUNTRY wich features Country and some bluegrass music. And the other CD is LIVE AND WELL    
 This is my first introduction to Gary Soto, and I must say that I enjoyed it.  Most notable about these books is that they just follow the lives of the various characters in their stories who just happen to be Latino. Except for the glossary at the end of the book, this book was not written to "introduce" us gringo's to another culture.  Rather, it's a book about boys and girls who have the same dreams and aspirations that are universal. These characters do not set out to change the world, but rather just get by day by day in the little space of earth that they inhabit. Very well done, perhaps written a bit simply at times, but for the most part, these stories are enjoyable 
 Suburban Sweatshops is a captivating, honest and well-written examination of the workplace abuses, struggles and hard realities facing so many working men and women in the United States--and the efforts of community organizers and advocates to create a space where workers can unite to improve their conditions and change the balances of power.  Gordon details the valuable lessons learned through her unique and pioneering experience founding the Workplace Project, and examines the challenges and obstacles facing the growing workers' rights and immigrant rights movement.  As an organizer working in the trenches of immigrant and workers' rights in Texas, I can say that Gordon's book is as real as it gets!  The book hits all of the key themes and points, and will no doubt be seen as a groundbreaking insight into many of the challenges and issues that will face our society for many years to come.  This is a must read 
 I loved this book.  Ms. Feehan can write the best material that pulls you right into the story.  It was great to see and hear from all the old characters again.  The only thing I did not like was the story ended and I have to wait for the next one due later this year.  I highly recommend to anyone Ms. Feehan and the Dark series 
 I am a fan of Pipes' style and blatant honesty regarding Islam, which happens to be his area of scholarship and research.  One's scholarly education often provides depth to other areas of interest, and his studies of the Middle East aid him in the world of Conspiracy in no small way.  I have only read a single chapter of this book online, and I am already sold.  I do hope however that it will contain a better analyzation of conspiracy rather than a presentation of historical views.    As a christian, I am very familiar with the realm of conspiracy; since biblical interpretation is wrought with it.   The essence of incorrect interpretation is eisegesis, which reads into the text that which was not the original intent of the author.  One common area of this is eschatology: the study of the end-times; where people come up with rather strange end-time theories by making all of the prophecies of the past directly relevant to us today, rather than being historical events.  Things such as reading Babylon as the Soviet Union, United Nations, or modern day Iraq.   Somebody not being familiar with biblical interpretation might have a harder time coming to terms with the fallacies of conspiracy, even though it is equally prevailant in the secular and political realm.  A few I can note off hand is Bush's alleged war against Islam, Jewish involvement in 9/11, Senator Wellstone's plane-crash being a political assassignation etc.  In order for us to become conspiracy-free, it is necessary for us to live life objectively, and let boring events and subjects be boring; void of any ulterior motives or special-agendas.  I hope Mr. Pipes book better aids people in the quest for serious criticism 
 This was an excellent read. This book definitely had me on an emotional roller coaster. It made me laugh, cry, feel up and down as Jada went through her trials and tribulations of life.  This book was very well written. I feel the book told two great love stories between four people.  I rated the book a four instead of a five because I wanted a little more at the end (my personal preference). I don't want to give it away so I won't comment.   But, overall I loved it!!!! All 497 pages were worth reading. 
 Rembrandt is probably the most famous artist of all time. And this book, celebrating the 400 years since his birth is at once a tribute to the man and his life, and his work.   A great deal of information is available about Rembrandt. There are some five hundred documents covering various aspects of his life. But there are still many conflicts. We are not sure just when he was born, docoments say 1605, 1606 and 1607. We are not sure how many paintings he produced - of the 400 or so usually attributed to him, at least 150 are in doubt. Likewise the number of etchings - about 285 -- and drawings maybe half of the 1575 suspected.   In this book the author presents the story of his life, as can be best determined intermixed with the story of his art. The author is considered to be one of the leading Rembrandt experts and the views presented here are well reasoned and as close to being definite as possible 
 The soundtrack To Frida is filled with the same energy and spirit that drives both the film and artist. Perfect to start the day and welcome the night with. Full of wishes and spice and life, indeed. 
 This has to be the best Eve Dallas book to date!!!!  Ms. Robb not only gets 5 stars for creativity, but for scientific accuracy.  What could have been a completely far fetched story was made chillingly believable by Ms. Robb's skill.  I also appreciated her ability to explain complex medical and scientific information in a way that was easy to understand.  A must read 
 BOUGHT IT AS A "TOY". WAS SUPRISED AT THE QUALITY OF TE PICTURE.WE HAVE MOST STATIONS FROM 5-35 MILES. DOES WELL ON 5-20 BUT CAN SEE ALL. ESPECIALLY OK FOR PRICE. STUPIDLY I DID NOT GET THE AC ADAPTER BUT WILL TRY TO NOW 
 What I like most about this book is its simplicity. In a brief and simple explanation, Dr. Feldman was able to elaborate the emotional concepts necessary in the field of business and leadership.    Despite its brevity, this book has provided some basic and practical strategies to develop the core skills such as knowing yourself and maintaining control and the high-order skills such as taking responsibility and embracing a vision.   For instance, Dr. Feldman recommends "PaRC Formula" and "Focused listening" to develop the core skills while he suggests "Vision Linking" and "Choice Building" to develop the high-order skills.  Overall, the book's simplicity is its strength 
 If you don't want to have any of your views challenged or at least put in question, then don't read this book. You can learn from this book: it tells you about a different world, which is probably not your own. If you just want someone to tell you about the world you already know, then there are many many other books around that do that. This book takes you on a journey of discovery around the earth, showing you what it looks like, how it feels, when the third world comes first, not last. It will be different, it may make you feel uncomfortable, you may feel that it is turning your world upside down, but its an amazing, positive and heartening experience you will never forget 
 This music is so good it makes you stop what you're doing so you can start playing air guitar and sing!  Johnny Rivers' music is not what you need to play when multitasking.  You'll never get your work done.  Start here as an introduction to his recordings, and then start collecting the original albums.  Rivers is one of the few artists whose 'filler' material was just as good as the 'hits. 
 I was glued to this book. This book must be taught as a textbook to political scientists and US diplomats. This book also documents 30 years of Iranian and US history, which is not talked about or taught in both USA and  Iran. 1940's to 1970's events in Iran are explained with amazing clarity 
  I Just heard this cd for the first time, actually this is the first time i heard any of Missy Elliott's songs, except for Get Ur Freak On. I Really like this cd. she has good songs on this disc like, Pass That Dutch, I'm Really Hot, Don't Be Cruel, Let It Bump, Let Me Fix My Weave & Spelling Bee.  If You Liked This Cd Check Out Underconstruction, Also By Missy Elliott & All Of Her Other CDs 
 There's a possible reason, "Marky Mark", for why these two teach at their respective colleges. It's all about the bias of the American elite towards everything zionist. And the power of the AIPAC lobby. Check it out. But maybe Mr. Finkelstein likes teaching at a small community college. I probably would. Anyway, he's a great scholar, speaker and writer. And a man for all people 
 The weekly program "Booknotes" is the flagship of the C-SPAN cable television network's book programming and has been popular viewing for over 15 years: its interviews have been the basis for three best-selling books already. Here CEO and host Brian Lamb provides a new and enthusiastically recommended collection of nearly eighty interviews with contemporary nonfiction writers in Booknotes: On American Character, exploring the politics and modern issues shaping the nation 
 Crooks and conspiracies, Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens is a tale about a young boy, Oliver Twist, that must face these struggles. Orphaned from birth, Oliver is left to the mercies of a workhouse run by coldhearted people who seek gain only for themselves. Constantly mistreated, Oliver runs away to London where friendless and without money, he is ensnared by Fagin, a thief who trains little boys to steal for him. Even when Oliver, betrayed by Fagin's boys, gets a chance meeting with Mr. Brownlow, a kind, rich gentleman, Fagin goes through great lengths to recapture Oliver. As Oliver continues to be surrounded by the corrupt environment that Fagin is a part of, it seems Fagin wants to keep Oliver for reasons not so simple as turning Oliver into a hardened thief. What will happen to Oliver? Read to find out in this story where Oliver struggles to win over evil with good, kindly influence encouraging him on when he met Mr. Brownlow and other kindly characters during his troubled times in London. Filled with adventures and hidden motives, Dickens portrays it all along with class differences in the 18th century with good humor and satire. Oliver Twist is a definite good read 
 A mama and baby seagull follow a single "drop that goes plop" on an adventure through the water cycle. To the sharp-eyed reader, the same drop of water can be discovered on each page. The didactic story provides a practical model of the water cycle from a bird's-eye view. Cartoon-styled illustrations are arranged in a double page spread, with colors that seem to soothe the soul and add a light hearted element to the story. The rich, yet simple text flows through the cycle amid the water. This captivating first look at the water cycle through a remarkable journey of a drop of water is sure to provide an intriguing experience to children of many ages 
 This is a wonderful book to use with late middle school or early high school classes.  The book is a bit dated and might need a little bit of teacher explanation about the "old days" of the 1960's but John, Lorraine and their friends are timeless and so is Mr. Pignati.  I love the way Zindel alternates the chapters between John and Lorraine's voices.   It supplies a great way to teach kids about point of view and characterization.  And I'll never forget the story Mr. Pignati teaches John and Lorraine about the woman, her husband, her lover, a boatman and an assassin.  That little fable makes for great discussions (and a personality test of sorts) that kids often take home to their families and share with friends 
 Okay, I'm not a country fan.  However, I listened to this CD, and I was stunned!  I didn't think that country music could possibly sound so wonderful and flawless.  Their taste of old-time country and danceable beats give their tracks that unique flavor.  Even if you're anti-country, I'd recommend giving "Home" a try.  You may not become a bigger country fan(genre-wise), but you won't be disappointed 
 Mr. Perahia takes a winding curve back into romantic era piano works in this marvelous and lovely recording of songs that are hummable, but are much more.  His three immediately previous discs of Bach and Scarlatti were  divine, but it is a delight to hear him playing Mendelssohn and Schubert  again, two composers he has recorded before.  Beautiful technique with so  much heart and soul 
 In August or September of 1963 I received a call from my high school music teacher.  They were looking for a small audience to act as acoustic padding to soak up some of the reverberation of the Salt Lake Tabernacle.  Get down there quick, he said, Bernstein's recording with the Choir.  I went and sat through the first of two sessions for this recording.  It was fascinating.  Bernstein came out and greeted us remarking that he always remembered his concert in the Tabernacle because "it was the loudest applause he had ever heard" (the Tabernacle itself lending to that amplification).  He launched right into "Joy to the World" making adjustments to the freshly finished arrangement.  All the arrangers were present.  The ink wasn't dry on their manuscripts.  The NYP would sight read through them a couple of times, Bernstein would adjust, and they'd do a take or two.  The Choir had been preparing for many weeks.  The sessions weren't entirely smooth.  Bernstein was an entirely different personality than their long experience with Ormandy had been.  Bernstein demanded precision.  He usually got it by the final take.  The album was released in less then two months.  Eventually it "went gold" -- unusual for 'classical' albums of the time.  I started playing it in October, 1963.  There hasn't been a Christmas since that these wonderful arrangements and the memories of that summer haven't graced our family's celebration.  It's advent on CD was late but most welcome 
 My six year old nephew loved this book. He apparently was so upset when it was inadvertently left at the airport that I had to buy another 
 Use of the mystery tale genre illuminates this dark historical period.  I will give a thumbnail sketch of some of the events in the story.  The narrator, Bernhard Gunther, a private detective, is 38 years old.  A friend, Dagmarr, appears at the beginning and the end of the story.  In her initial appearance she is to marry Johannes, a sports flyer.  The term sports flyer is a cover for the rearmament taking place in Germany.    Bernhard is approached by a lawyer and he distrusts lawyers.  Hermann Six, one of the major Ruhr industrialists, has suffered a loss.  His daughter has been murdered.  Grete Six married Paul Pfarr in 1930.  Three nights before the interview with Bernhard the couple died in a fire at their house.  Prior to the fire the safe had been ransacked.  There were jewels in the safe.  Six wants Bernhard Gunther to recover them.    Pfarr had been an SS man.  Bernhard finds out that Goering might buy hot jewelry since he has a passion for owning expensive things.  Everybody in Germany was somebody different before March 1933.  In Berlin Gestapo headquarters used to be an art school.  Bernhard calls a crime reporter friend, seeking some background on the couple.  Before becoming a private investigator Bernhard had worked for Kripo, a police agency.    A March Violet is someone who became a Nazi to go along and get along.  In the Weimar years Berlin had seemed like one of the most exciting cities in the world.  Bernhard explains that policing like autobahn construction and informing is one of the new German growth industries.  Corruption in one form or another is a feature of life under National Socialism.  Bernhard pays the pathologist for information about the manner of death of the murder victims.  The pathologist says he is being forcibly retired because he is not political.    Rings were institutions of organized crime in Germany.  Gunther learns from an informant that the safe cracker in the case is a member of a ring.  The informant is afraid to give him information.  Banned writers are back in the shops because of the Olympiad.  Bernhard Gunther learns that Kurt Mutschmann may have opened the safe.  Gunther is picked up and brought to see Goering who tells Gunther he can lend him RED HARVEST by Dashiell Hammett.  Gunther is asked to find Gerhard Von Greis, someone who functioned as a purchasing agent for Goering and who has been missing for a week.  Bernhard Gunther learns from a ring leader that a killer has followed him and his assistant, a former newspaper reporter, Inge, to a cafe.    It turns out that Bernhard is actually investigating two crimes since the safe had contained jewels and papers.  The deceased son-in-law possessed papers showing that Hermann Six had ties to organized crime.  Gunther discovers that Six's daughter was not killed in the fire.  Then he is in the hands of the Gestapo since Heydrich wants him to go to Dachau to trace down the papers in the control of Kurt Mutschmann.  Interestingly Kurt decided that hiding in Dachau would be a good idea and so he had done something in order to be arrested.  Bernhard finds Kurt dying in the infirmary of the camp.  Because Bernhard was kind to him, he tells him where to find the papers.  In the end Bernhard Gunther concludes that he has gotten used to living in a world out of joint.             
 This book was so interesting I was unable to put it down. It was as if I was reading a novel. Before reading the book I was unaware of the degree to which pictorial composition was left out of earlier accounts of art. Particularly fascinating is  Puttfarken' s discussion of the development of composition and how this impacted paintings in general (ie their size, location, perspective, the relationship between ground and figures, how the image and frame work together, etc). The book, which looks at both Northern and Italian art, is a must read for anyone who longs for more art historical discussions that combine context with formal elements.  
    I bought The Thief 7 years ago, and The Queen of Attolia 6 years ago, and they still rank among some of my favorite reads.          This is one of those books that you can read over and over again and discover new things every time. Turner's writing is sure and vivid, and although some parts may seem slower than others, all of the different threads tie together in the end.     To those who read The Thief and enjoyed it, a slight warning: This book is darker, and slightly less humorous, but it is perfect for slightly older readers.      I highly reccomend this book, and for those who've read it, the sequel The King is coming out in 2006. :- 
 I gave a DIP class last semester using this book. I found it provided the easiest way to make students acquainted with DIP. Before using this book, I tried Visual C++ for implementation. However, both of us (i.e., students and me) couldn't be satisfied, I guess. Now the implementation is easier than ever, and I can explain more about DIP itself to students 
 Castle. The word's meaning is amazing. And David Macaulay has done it again! His book, Castle, shows how a castle is built in the Middle Ages. His illustrations show the castle (and the town around it) is built. Mortar and stone by stone, a castle is built. In the time this castle's construction is commencing, there is a war going on, and then it's under attack when it's finished. David shows how the castle withstands a siege from the Welsh prince and his army. This book's drawings are amazing! The book is quite detailed and well described. The book is the Eighth Wonder of the World says I, its one of the best books I've ever read! This book is for knights in shining armour! - February, 2007 
 I love the Bratz twiins collections the are soooooooooo cool I love Phoebe But I DONT like Roxxi as much though cuz she has wierd black brads in her hair, and also why does'nt toysrus have Tess and Nona I got them from Walmart  wich is pretty far from my house !Toysrus is soooooooo close and there realy expensive but I think you realy buy Roxxi and Phoebe. 
 If you have found this book then you NEED it! I have always been interested in personality types but when my shild turned 5 I was desperate to 'figure' her out. After reading 'Strong-WIlled Child' I was even more lost. Everything in that book did NOT work (any more with her than it did with me when MY parents tried it on ME!). It was about page 3 of this book that the light bulb turned on and I realized I WAS A DREAMER! As is my daughter. This is the most applicable book on personalities I have ever read! 
 All through the beginning of this series I can understand low ratings or reviews and I'm talking about around 4 stars. To me only a few of the episodes in Fullmetal Alchemist didn't live up to the other episodes, somewhere in mid series but that's it, and they weren't bad they just weren't as good as the others. When I tell you that the episodes towards the end are genius I'm not playin around. The episodes that end Fullmetal are absolutley sure to make this show a complete classic work of art if the beginning and middle already didn't. It's captivating, breathtaking, and will at all cost do anything to make these upcoming DVD releases exciting and unpredictable for it's fans.   In 11 there is meetings for everyone, Kimbley and Scar meet up in Lior, Ed is suppose to meet up with Al in Lior also. Just because you have plans to do one thing doesn't mean they won't change. The brothers are unexpectedly confronted by a couple of deadly sins named Wrath and Sloth who clames she is Juliet Douglas but her vague memory tells her different and her sharp looks remind the Elric brothers of someone close and I mean very close to them. Not only do the brothers have to meet up with one piece of their past they're confronted by another and both pieces seems as equally huge. If your wondering about the front cover and why Al looks like that you'll find out how he got those cool tattoos all over his body, he went to Scar's parlor to get them done. The Elric's bros. Find everything they were looking for and more in this volume but is it a beautiful find or a terribly ugly one.   DVD contains, episodes 41-44: 41- Holy Mother, 42- His Name is Unknown, 43-The Stray Dog, 44- Hohenheim of Light.  DVD Features:  Production Art, Image Gallery, Character Profiles, Textless Songs 
 Lieutenant Vorkosigan/Admiral Naismith or as we more commonly think of him, Miles, arrives with his Dendarii Mercenary fleet at Earth, thinking he can combine some ship refitting with some personal site seeing.  Little does he realize that between Cetagandan interest and rebel Komarran intrigue, rest and relaxation is the last thing that will be on his itinerary.  Fortunately for Miles he has sharp wits to rely on, though in this case, he may have his sharp wits to contend with too!  Perhaps its just me, but this Miles adventure, though still well told and fun, came across as almost a parody of itself.  Maybe the author decided to poke some fun at her own adventurer, but where as in the past she mixed serious issues with Miles' insanity, here the family vs. cause conflict(s) seem under-realized and the story in general felt more cliché or rote. 
 This hood does a more than adequate job at controlling flare on the EF 100mm f/2. Additionally, the hood can provide protection to those who 1) do not adorne their lenses with UV/SKY filters, or 2) do so adorne them! The lens is already a capable performer; it is moreso with the hood. The price is a bit steep, but that does not effect its performance. Thus, my rating stands 
 i loved this book it makes a real change to see the full figured woman get her man be warned the sex scenes are  racy the story starts with a bachelor auction in which our heroin buys a date with  her hunk  and the fun begins if you enjoy this book you will love Take Me by Bella Andre i di 
 This book preaches very good concepts that are good guidelines to follow if you plan on conducting a multi-developer PHP project.  It touches on many things such as coding standards, revision control with cvs, seperation of business and display logic using a template engine (smarty used as example), a brief discussion on object-oriented methodologies, and other useful development areas.  He cites many "futher readings" in context which I found extremely helpful.  All the examples in the book are very easy to understand and somewhat pertain to "real-world" situations (I found this a big plus since I don't like real abstract examples).   I have two complaints with the book (these are not THAT important and you should not buy this book just because of these two reasons.  The book is VERY good for most PHP developers).  1 - I don't consider this that "advanced" of a book.  I have been using this type of stuff for years now at my current work place -- although this would advanced for most "non-enterprise" developers (where teams are more than 5 or so).  2 - The lack of coding standard being used in the examples (something that he preaches about in one of the first chapters).  Other than those two complaints, this is great book for PHP developers looking to do stuff in a more "enterprise" way 
 I recommend the whole Story of Civilization set.  I've got all eleven.  Durant is a brilliant writer and macrohistorian.  His approach delves deep into the era with more than just a mere political or social history. I bought the set after my history professor recommended it some time ago.  He covers Western Civilization and European history with an in-depth clarity that no historian of the 20th century can match.  If you like history, don't pass on Will Durant 
  Ah, The Blues Brother! A Cult Classic that tops the list! Our son owns a much viewed (and enjoyed) VHS tape of the Blues Brothers. One we have borrowed many times. When we saw this DVD and noted that it was a Collector's Edition, we knew we had to add it to our own DVD collection. Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi were destined to star in this movie. Jake and Elwood are an 'Unholy Pair' on a 'Mission From God'. There will never be anyone like the Blues Brothers, again. Too cool for words! They speak in Jack Webb/Henry Morgan 'Dragnet' style, clipped and dour. They want 'action' and along the way they not only get it, they give it! You'll be in for one toe tappin', finger snappin', racin', chasin', shoot 'em up, bang 'em up, hell's a poppin' time! Enjoy the ride! ~ Mrs. B 
 I lived in Nicaragua Central America and the hand pumps here cost US$ 75.00 This one is a dual electric pump and was a relief for our new born baby 
 This is one of Dean Evenson's best albums.  If you want to play music while performing energy work, meditation, or just to relax...this music will help.  I recommend this CD highly, I listen to it a lot.  The flute will just take you away.  But of course, how can you go wrong with any of Dean's music?  Happy Healing 
 a suicide and the love that precludes, defines, and concludes the life of a man.  it's hard to describe a book of this magnitude, as it's likely that everyone who reads it will release different thoughts and emotions.  definitely a human novel 
 I get into archeology, especially in Egypt, so I enjoyed this book and "River God" immensely.  Wilbur Smith is an excellent writer who makes you believe the characters really lived at one point in history 
 One of our favorite songs is now a pop-up book!  This is a colorful and very busy book.  It's great fun, but difficult for quick little fingers to maneuver without damaging the tabs.  I will put this book away till he's 4 years old and try again then 
 First off, i'm of the opinion that "Different Class" is easily in the top 10 Britpop albums of the 1990's, if not in the top 2 or 3 (and i could make a case that it's one of the top 10 rock albums of the decade), so if you haven't heard it, you really owe it to yourself to hear it (NOTE: Different Class, as an album, is unquestionably a five-star classic; see below why i rate this edition as 4 stars).  Very tuneful, with biting commentary, 'humour' and sarcasm on lust, youthful foolishness, class warfare and capturing the zeitgeist of what was going on in the UK around the mid-90's - it's very much of its time, yet I suspect will ultimately be considered timeless.  Virtually all of the tracks are pure ear candy - this album really holds up thruout.  This edition is beautifully presented -nice thick glossy digipak packaging with Universal's usual clear slipcase; generous booklet and comments, and great sound.  If you've read this far, you'll probably want to pop for this in order to get the extras disc - demo's, b-sides, live cuts.  They're nice, but i don't know if i'd call them indispensible - i rated it 4 stars because of the cost involved to get the extras.  if you have an inkling you'll like this album, and can afford it, this is a good edition to get if you can score one for under like $25; otherwise, for most, the 1-cd will suffice and is heartily recommended.  But if you're really into Pulp, i'd imagine you'll want this edition. 
 I am sharing this with elementary age children that I am counseling for social-emotional issues--they all, from age 7-age 11--resonate with this, even if they're familiar with it already, and all delight with the interactive feeling page at the end!  The main character in the story is easy for girls especially to identify with 
 Stephen Law, whose reputation in philosophy, especially in England, is enormous, has given us a short, interesting, intelligent book about the major questions of our time and all time: Does God exist? Can a machine think? What is knowledge? Perhaps the most useful chapter is How to Spot Eight Everyday Reasoning Errors. That chapter alone is worth the price of the book. It's good that you will profit from this type of serious reading and it's too bad some high placed officials in the American government won't profit from this kind of serious reading. Of course, the book is meant to stimulate thinking and not give answers. So some things seem overstated and some things are made more controversial than need be, such as why we have no moral right to eat meat. That claim bases itself on the idea that we can remain healthy just eatting vegetables. That is not possible without vitamin supplements. Furthermore, claiming that eatting plants is more moral that eatting animals because animals are a higher form of life is questionable. The encoding DNA for a pine tree for instance is (last time I checked) 40 fold more than for a human. Therefore, a pine tree is a much, much more complicated form of life than a human. A carrot has at least triple the encoding DNA of any animal, a reflection of its more complicated life style. That plants communicate with each other is now known from research done by NASA and the sex lives of plants and their adaptive powers are truly amazing. On strictly moral grounds, I would argue that eatting meat makes more more sense than eatting plants as animals are a lower form of life than plants. One thing is for sure, whether you like it or not, you must eat to live, a fact not discussed by Law. How come we have to eat to live? Some Jains decide that they have no moral right to eat anything. Within a few months, they die. That is the Jain moral choice. But what's so moral about killing yourself 
     EXCELLENT MAGAZINE, FULL OF FACTS ABOUT THE MOVIE.  THNAKS FOR THE PROMPT DELIVERY AND SERVICES YOU PROVIDED 
 Okay, I'll admit it.  I didn't think I'd like this album.  I have listened to it more than thirty times in a 2 month period.  Sad?  Maybe.  But this show is intriguing and smart...certainly worth more than one listening to. It is different because it doesn't baby-step the audience through the stories, and the stories (I believe there are 3) are rather unrelated.  Nonetheless, it comes across as beautiful and new rather than pretentious and artsy.   And I have to mention that the cast is OUTSTANDING.  Each one of them molds their talent into their characters in such a way that you can't imagine anyone else in those roles.  It's the kind of show that not only gives the audience the benefit of the doubt, but also offers so much variety that there's something for everyone.  If you don't particularly like the constant Japanese-infused strands of theme, you might like the jazzy swing of R.Shomon, or the spiritual emotion of Gloryday.   I personally love the whole shabang.  This album has made me a Lachuisa convert 
 Rascal Flatts' fourth album ME AND MY GANG finds the country trio moving more towards a pop/AC sound. Throughout each album they have moved closer to this sound, but on this album there is a much more polished sound. This isn't a bad thing! The harmonies are still beautiful and intact, and the songs are great. The first single was the very moving song "What Hurts the Most", a song about loss. Definately a highlight in their career, at least for me. The title track was a hit as well, not a favorite but it's pretty good. "My Wish" is their latest hit and it's another moving ballad. In fact, the ballads are what carry this album. My favorite is the moving ballad "Words I Couldn't Say", which would be a hit if released. "Cool Thing" is another great song. Other highlights include "I Feel Bad", "He Ain't The Leavin Kind", and many others 
 I received this book on time. It was Packaged well and in good condition. It was also one of the most fascinating books I have read. I highly recommend the bookseller and the book 
 This book is just amazing. The artwork really captures the spirit of DOG  This book would appeal to both adults and children, and would make a fantastic gift for anyone who loves dogs.  You will feel a real emotional connection with Buddy. There are some authors and artists who can just reach out from the pages and touch your heart, and here you will find that.  I am purchasing multiple copies to donate to libraries, schools, et 
 This book brought tears to my eyes the first time I read it.  It is warm and comforting.  A wonderful message for children that their mama will always be there no matter what.. 
 As a 20-something, native Angeleno living elsewhere, I absolutely loved curling up with this book - everything typically LA/Hollywood is in here - it was like I was back on La Cienega, stuck in traffic, and people watching from the haven of my Jetta. The truths in here are undeniable - messy relationships publicized on the covers of tabloids, young children blindsided by the confusion of divorce, and at-all-costs publicity stunts. Readers looking for a good vacation book and who are familiar with the LA celebrity scene should be very happy with "The Starter Wife." It's the closest I could get to buying a plane ticket to LAX and walking around Malibu in Uggs. 
 Not too much excitement, just a couple of sweet acoustic John Mayer songs; but if you love John Mayer, you need this ep 
 I read this book during my Junior year of high school and was in awe of it.  I feel that this story is good reading for anyone who has concerns about the power computers wield in out lives and for anyone who fears the  power they may someday have.  I found that it touched upon many aspects of  upcoming technology and the possible effects this technology may have on  us.  I also must say that the last line is the best I have ever read.  I  won't ruin it for you, read it for yourself 
 Stories which are on paper do not have the magical effect. The book gives a deep insight what the art of storytelling is 
 It's been some time since I last visited Artemis Fowl in The Arctic Incident, but there wasn't a single missed beat going into The Eternity Code. When boy genius Artemis cobbles together a supercomputer stolen from the magical People beneath the Earth, his latest scheme goes awry and he's forced to call on Holly Short and Mulch Diggums both to save someone important to him and to stop the technology from bringing the ruthless Jon Spiro to power across the globe.   Colfer has shown remarkable adaptivity and character development in this series. Artemis isn't nearly the evil mastermind he was in the first book, but he's still got a nasty streak embedded in his genius that makes even a softer Artemis a please to read. More so than the first two novels in this series, this is a classic heist story, basically showing the planning and execution of a grand scheme. We even see one last scheme planned at the end, but don't see the execution -- making it even more enticing to run out and get book four. The Eternity Code doesn't exactly end on a cliffhanger, but there's a big question mark hanging there that must have been infuriating for those who read this book when it was first released, waiting for volume four.   The book is a lot of fun and well worth the read. It won't be so long before I read the next two books in this series. 
 I am a novice knitter and I love this book!  As a beginner, I wouldn't have thought of some of the yarn combintations suggested in the patterns, but they are wonderful.  True, the patterns are very basic (great for this beginner), it's the yarn selections that make these styles so interesting 
 After reading this book I realized she became one at the Actor's Studio in NYC. The same studio that made Brando and her Rebel costar James Dean. After Dean died Nat studied there. She made a film for Elia Kazan (Brando and Dean's old director) and became more of a method actress. I hate the part of this book that compliments her also costar Warren Beatty on his looks. Natalie and other women's are what matter most in life 
 I recommend this book to anyone that hasn't read Alice Miller. I think this is her best, most accessible, most on target books to date. She writes from personal experience not just theory and her 'training" and it is compelling 
 THe most accessible of all Gabriel's work, with tunes that move your feet body and soul.  And you know you really liked the dancing chickens in the video 
 I enjoyed reading this and was a nice way to return to the ST Voyager universe!good story and enjoyed finding out more about the many characters I came to enjoy on Voyager 
 On the whole I found this book to be a stimulating and refreshing contrast to the other books I have read on this subject that take the form of screeds either in opposition or defense (treating this phenomenon as either an aberration/perversion or as a God-given and righteous march toward Paradise).   The First three parts of the book which details the ideas and development of the Conservative Movement are well worth the price of the book, it describes with an admirable level-headedness and dispassion (as well as a healthy dose of humorous anecdotes) the strenghts and weaknesses of the movement's ideas and the internal conflicts that might threaten its cohesion in the future. The Book tries (successfully in my opinion) not to be a work of advocacy for the ideas or people it presents but rather just give people a clearer idea of why the American political culture is so different from most of the rest of the industrialized world. I felt that in spite of the fact that I still think many of the ideas of the American Conservative Movement are bad ones I have a new appreciation and understanding of where they come from and their internal logic.   The last Part of the book is mainly a comparison of America with the rest, and didn't quite live up to the standard of the first three parts. Here the Neo-Liberal/Thatcherite editorial line of The Economist came shining through more than once with a few puzzlingly biased and misleading statements(social mobility, productivity etc.). This is not really a big problem, and doesn't take very much away from the book as a whole (I am sure it is not intentional), as a moderate knowledge of economics and some familiarity the magazine makes these things easy to spot. I just mean that if you want a comparative work on politics or economics in the US and Europe there are better alternatives 
 In this tale, we have the classic spoiled brat who has the good fortune to discover that food and friends have to be earned. The slowness of his education is important, for it really does take grinding misery to blast an over-inflated ego. And yet, the reward is entry into the human race 
 Works fine, easy setup for Windows using its drivers to handle network printing. I'm printing to a Samsung laser using LPR mode (supported by this printserver) from my unix box and CUPS, and from OS/X.  Perfect 
 Sensitive performances of Granados and Albeniz pieces, absolutely flawless and balanced melodies and harmonies. Same for Villa Lobos Etudes: plays as if they were the easiest pieces ever written. Very well recorded, as well 
 After reading this book, I realized that this is the book I wish I had  read earlier in my life. My understanding of my culture and society would  have been accelerated. With this book Professor Cornford has succeded in  delineate major features of the evolution of Western thinking with  impeccable scholarship and with great eloquence. His prose are exquisite,  perfectly suited for his thinking on complex ideas. A reader of this book  will obtain a new and illuminating perspective of the role of the thinking  of Socrates, Plato and certain other Greek philosophers in modern life 
 The hammock is a great choice if you like sharing it with you significant other or by yourself.  It's very sturdy and comfortable, even with two adults.  The quality of hammock is good and worth the price, especially compared to other models we looked at 
 A good reference book and easy reading.  Most information very helpful 
 I have read all of Dave Peltzer books, it was wonderful to read his brother Richards account of the abuse Dave suffered and how he came to replace Dave in his mother's Eyes. I do wish he would have not left us hanging at the end of the novel though, I was left with more questions about his life once they moved then I might have been if he would have covered things up to the point of his marriage. I hope that he will write another book enlightening us on life once they moved to Utah. I highly recommend this book to everyone who has read Dave Peltzers books, if you haven't read them first so you understand this book to the fullest that the author wants you to. 
 This CD has 12 tracks on it with the first song that Hilary Duff sings "I Can't Wait." If you like pop and rock this CD is for you. This CD has more pop so if you really like pop music this is for you. Also if you have heard the Lizzie McGuire Movie soundtrack and have liked it you would probably like this CD as well. The last track has the theme song to Lizzie McGuire TV show. If you like music like from Brittany Spears, or Jessica Simpsons or Play or N'Sync or Backstreet Boys you would probably like this CD 
 This surprisingly well done movie shows us a man with ambition in the wild continent of Africa. It makes us appreciate that we are living in a civilized society and leading a happy life. The great thing about this movie is that it contains some very beautiful, spectacular sceneries which match very well with the characters, who are also in some great pursuits. It makes our ordinary everyday conflicts seem so petty. Unlike many other cartoonish "adventure" type movies such as Indiana Jones which is fake and therefore only gives us short-term entertainment, this movie feels very realistic and therefore is very moving. 
 I have read every serious book on handicapping I can find, and most of them end up gathering dust on the bookshelf after one or two readings - but not this one.  This book is about money management and mathmatical probabilities of horseracing and for most horse players - that's where their game needs improvement.  Afterall, if you handicap it right, and bet it wrong, the return will still be zero.  Buy the book and then follow the advice - especially for Pick 3's, which is terrific

 The author has collected recipes from homemakers and  reticent restaurant owner and  brings them to us  in a complete, intelligent and well written presentation.  For those of us that had the pleasure of eating regional Spanish cuisine, this book is a treat that fills us with nostalgia and the urge to try one recipe after another.  A refreshing and important addition to the library of any serious co 
 Once again, Rosemary Sutcliff has written an outstanding work of fiction! Enticing, suspensful, and all-around wonderful, Outcast is the best book I have read in a long time. Outcast is the story of a young boy named Beric, who is raised in the village of a celtic tribe living in Britain at the  time of the Roman Conquest. However, Beric is actually a Roman child, whose  parents died in a shipwreck and who was rescued by a kind-hearted Celt and  then adopted. But when the village has a series of bad turns, the local  druid manages to convince the chief that Beric is the cause of all the  trouble. Exiled from the only life he has known, Beric must learn to  survive in the harsh Roman world that is so different from his own. And  things take a turn for the worse when Beric falls into the hands of a slave  trader! Outcast is a refreshing historical novel that gives startling  insight into the ancient cultures of Britain. This one is definately a  keeper 
 I am so glad this book is still around! I had forgotten what a great, useful, overview of basic typographic principles this "little gem" is.  I teach a Graphic Design class for non-Graphic Design majors in an art college. I was stunned to see most of the students putting two spaces after periods in a book they were making in my class. I explained why this was uneccessary (and in fact wrong) with most typefaces available on the computer, and they said they had all learned this in computer classes in the various high schools they had attended.  I unearthed my copy of this book (from 1990!) and brought it in the next week. Some students went to Amazon right away and bought it. Their work improved markedly.  I will make this a required text for the class next year, and advise anyone looking to learn the basics of good, typographic layout to purchase this wonderful little book 
 I am an old time Doris Day fan who is thrilled by the release of these two albums on CD. I have the original albums which where played every night on a record player in the nurses dorm in 1964. We where all captivated by that dreamy voice of Doris Day, who swept us away with things like Dansero and Slightly Out of Tune. How great to be able to listen to it  again. Like finding an old friend. If you are a Doris Day fan this cd is a must 
 An excellent book for every manager seeking an approach to managing conflict.  The book is written with the understanding that one can't always resolve conflict.  However, a five step process is given which allows for  it's successful managing.  Through Assessment, Acknowledgement, Attitude,  Action and Analysis (5A's) the reader will form a firm base to anticipate  and management conflict.  The chapters on gender differences,  cross-cultural awareness and how writing styles cause conflict are very  timely 
 I am new to opera. The only opera I have seen has been on DVD (The Met's complete Der Ring des Nibelungen, Bayreuth's centenary productions of Das Rheingold and Die Walkure, and the Salzburger Festspiele's production of Turandot), but this production of Turandot had me enthralled. After a hideous production from the Salzburger Festpiele, the only reason I purchased this was to hear Placido Domingo's "Nessun dorma", and also to see a comparative production before I dismissed the opera.   Although I am a newcomer, I would say that this has to be opera at it's best, because I can't imagine anything much more entertaining.  The sets were amazing. The singing was amazing. I would have to give the acting a four of five stars, but it really didn't detract from the production since the singing was so expressive. This was a very special viewing for me, not only because it was great in it's own right, but because it made me appreciate what I  had previous thought was a boring opera because of the other production I had viewed.   It turns out Ping, Pang, and Pong do not have to be annoying and negligable. In this production they are funny and well rounded - some of the best acting in this production.   I felt that the chorus in the previous production was obnoxious and poorly coreographed (sp?), but here they shine and contribute to many of the opera's most dramatic and touching moments.   While I still think the story develops too quickly at the opening of Act I, which, in the first production I had seen made Liu's suicide seem trite and superficial, here, her strong performance throughout the opera makes her eventual death truly devestating (I also felt her final curtain call was humble, tasteful, and I was really moved by it - she also seemed truly moved by the audiences enthusiasm).   Before, I thought Turandot was a static character, and her turn around at the end of the opera on the previous DVD seemed like a crowd pleaser and uninspired. In this Met production, I felt Eva Marton's Turandot was well performed, well considered, and well rounded. The acting was shakey at parts, but her voice really was magnificent. Masterful.  Of course, Domingo's Calaf was wonderful. The "Nessun dorma" I purchased this DVD for was wonderful, but if I were to find another production of this opera on DVD, I would bet everything that I will never hear a better Calaf. Placido Domingo truly is a star. In his tenor I hear infinite depths. Really, really, really, really wonderful.  So...it it's not clear already...please buy this DVD. It has inspired a true interest in opera for me, and from now on, I feel I will judge the quality of any opera I see by whether or not it stirs my emotions the way viewing this DVD has 
 I couldn't put this book down when i started reading it...the trials and tribulations of Gogol and I never wanted them to end...a moving book..Jhumpa Lahiri really knows how to get it right ! 
  With more than 150 recipes, more than 1100 photographs, and about 250 different cooking techniques explained in detail, this book is the most impressive practical guide I have ever read.   Each technique is explained in detail, emphasizing on how it affects the flavor of the finished dish. knowing how to use a technique implies efficiency, but knowing why you have to choose one technique over another one to prepare a dish implies mastership.  The book has a practical approach, with cross-reference through the text to related topics and techniques. Here I found not only recipes and techniques, but also an extensive glossary of term that I have used many times.  This book will change the way you look at cooking forever. 
 This was a pretty good book about how Claudia dealt with reality and trying to get all her friends to mingle. She did it pretty successfully, but she almost got into big trouble, due to a few mistakes. I won't reveal them here; read it and see!  All in all - a pretty good read, although this book could be longer.. 
 I was so excited to hear that David Salo, one of the linguists who worked on the Elvish for the Lord of the Rings films, was publishing a book on Sindarin grammar. Since Tolkein never wrote such a thing, it had to be reconstructed, and many attempts to do so exist on the web, with varying degrees of accuracy.  I will not say that this is definitive, because no such thing can exist. But it is useful to have so much information in one place, well organised. My favorite part is the Appendices. These include glossaries of English and Sindarin, a list of Sindarin roots (very nifty!), a glossary of names and what they mean (if you insist on giving your child a Tolkein name, please read it first!) and, best of all, a compilation of extant texts in Sindarin, always the first place you should look for grammar and ideas. I also enjoyed the section on sentence construction. There is no index, though, which is a bit of a bummer, but the table of contents is fairly well organised.  While Mr. Salo does appreciate that people write their own texts in Sindarin, this book is not for beginners, because it is a reference grammar. There are no lessons or exercises, so it should not be the first place you go to teach yourself unless you are really dedicated or have some familiarity with dead and/or fictional languages, the kind most likely to be learned from a book. For others, especially those interested in the languages as heard in the movies, I recommend a stop by Gwaith-i-Phethdain, over at http://www.elvish.org.  For anyone who knows something about this Elvish tongue and wishes to see a comprehensive grammar, this is it. It isn't perfect, and there is plenty to squabble over, but it is a very important start 
 Bob Dylan and Daniel Lanois work better together, it seems to me, then many of the other people Dylan has worked with. I certainly like the sound of this record better than the stuff Dylan did with Tom Petty, though I like that stuff too. I actually like this record as much as I like "Blood on the Tracks" and often have both of them in my CD changer at the same time (which by the way I never set at random play with a Bob Dylan record, because Dylan records were meant to be played in their entirety, the way Dylan presented them). For me, this record fits nicely between "Tracks" and "Time out of Mind." Sure he did some great stuff in between, but it's these personal songs like "What Good Am I?" that I like so much and, of course, the way Bob Dylan tells a story. There is nobody better 
 This remastering of Callas' first complete recording of an opera for EMI is a jewel beyond price. Instead of launching her career as Tosca or Violetta Callas chose a part she had made operatic history with. In 1949 she was singing Wagner's Brünnhilde (To high acclaim) and was considered a dramatic soprano when a soprano fell ill and Tullio Serafin, this greatest of all conductors, begged her to study the highly florid part of Elvira. Maria, trusting her mentor, accepted and while singing Brünnhilde rehearsed Elvira (!) and then sang both Brünnhilde and Elvira in the same week leaving critics spellbound, running out of superlatives and their expectations for upcoming performances running high. It's like letting Beverly Sills sing Brünnhilde and Birgit Nilsson sing Elvira. But Callas, this true prima donna assoluta, did it. When Callas recorded the part of Elvira in the studio her approach to the role was gentler, even more fragile and yet of the darkest, most intense colours. This Elvira's "Qui la voce suave" isn't just beautiful easy listening but a masterpiece of inflections, phrasing and details. The fascinating scales and the white-hot E-flat in the end will leave you spellbound for sure. Now what about the rest of the cast? I absolutely love di Stefano as Arturo. True, he was never a tenor to spill high Cs like Lauri Volpi, Kraus or Gedda but his sunny tone, flawless legato, intense phrasing and full voice definitely are big +++++++ on his behalf. Sure, Edgardo was written for Rubini but I absolutely love di Stefano's way of singing this taxing role, he's the most vivid, passionate Arturo on disc. Rossi-Lemeni is in topform as well, as he was every time he was partnering Callas (Another example would be the Anna Bolena they did together). Panerei sings a glorious Riccardo, maybe his greatest effort on disc. Serafin conducts with the experience of a true maestro di belcanto, absolutely magnificent. This is, by far, my favourite recording of "I Puritani". It's being in excellent sound and incredibly cast made it a legend and this remastering at such a price is a steal! Don't miss this wondrous performance 
 First of all, I know this is not an autobiography based completely on facts...........I DON"T CARE!!  This is his interpretation of his life's events and so he dramatizes them, presents them in a way that is more memorable..........the point is that the story is excellent!!!! My Friend Leonard picks up where A Million Little Pieces left off.  James is released and goes off to find his girlfriend and things are not happily ever after.  He copes with his addictions, with loss and with his inability to move forward.  He faces challenge after challenge and just when you think he is on the verge of collapse, he pulls through.  Leonard enters his life and offers him an opportunity to better his circumstances and although he is not quite comfortable with it, he decides to take another chance on the unknown.  This is a compelling story that has an open and honest quality to it.  This is not to say that the author purposely misleads anyone, what he does do is to take his life experiences and adapt them enough to keep you riveted to his story. It is a tremendous tale of dealing with the harsh realities of addiction, personal relationships and the multitude of choices that are laid before people on a daily basis. It is a story of consequences and responsibility and it is a story about finding faith in the future and hope in the present.  I think that this author has faced a lot of criticism that he attempted to fend off in a manner that came back to smack him, in the same vein, he faced the criticism and dealt with it after the first book and deserves the recognition of being a talented and gifted writer 
 I have been using the triax C5 for about a year and a half and had no problems whatsoever. Using it at least 4 times a week for Tae-Bo and mountain biking. excellent price/quality 
 In a word, excellent.  A wonderful explanation of mind-body dynamics and the placebo effect.  Some excellent hypnotic and mind-body healing techniques.  Dr. Rossi is a true expert in his field.  He fully justifies  that reputation with this book 
 This book offers true, informative facts about Italy and the Italian lifestyle in an easy to read format.  It's a great read for anyone planning a trip to Italy or for anyone simply interested in this magnificent  country 
 This book was simply wonderful and a must read.    I was amazed at the presentation of the story and the way Harper Lee draws you in.  The narrator is an 8 year old girl named Scout who is both innocent about the world and its social norms; while at the same time curious enough to be engaged and question "why does it have to be this way?"   It is from Scout's perspective that you are able to see the silliness and real injustice that we (adults) create by continually abiding by these destructive social norms that we consider "the way it has to be".    On the surface, many readers will read this book and say that it is about "race relations".  But upon taking a deeper examination into the book, you will find that "race" is just the example used in order to convey an even bigger message on the importance of being both open minded and aware of oneself and the world around you.  Harper Lee, through the innocent eyes of Scout, challenges us to think outside the box, to accept people for who they are, to be open-minded, to challenge social norms and to start thinking for oneself.    I have rarely identified with or have been more inspired by a fictional character as I have with Atticus.  He embodies every characteristic I wish to have from having compassion and love for everyone (even when it is undeserved), to his ability to critically think through issues, to his capacity of fairness, open-mindedness, and knack for remaining calm and peaceful in times of hostility and high stress.  What an amazing character.  To Kill a Mockingbird is not just revolutionary in its day for implying that blacks should be equal to whites; but is revolutionary even now because the underlying themes and messages it states still need heard and practiced today.  This book will impact you and challenge you, and should make you a better person.   
 This is a great idea for a product! For those of you who don't wash your hair every day, this is a great way to keep it looking and smelling fresh on days you don't wash it. I used this after 5 days without washing, and while it might have worked better within 3 or 4 days, it still freshened my hair and made it beautiful! Well done 
 This is a high-quality dvd and includes attractive models demonstrating different positions from the male superior positions to the rear-entry positions. There are 27 different positions that are illustrated. Some of them are common positions but there are a lot of them that are good for adding variety If you are looking for a sex position DVD to add spice to your life, look no further 
 In this series, each story is as interesting as the last.  Eve and Roarke's relationship progressively develops but they still maintain their individuality which is quite humorous at times and never boring.  What really made this story of conspiracy in the medical/political world of hotshots work for me is the supporting cast of characters - Roarke, Feeney, Peabody, McNabb, Louise, Mira, Mavis, Whitney, Tibble - they all work together to make Eve Dallas a believable and heartwarming heroine and achieve the effect of a fascinating supporting cast to the storyline.  The mystery involved in this story is based on a shady character with superior surgical skills playing God with people's lives, including Eve's!   I particularly found Feeney's father figure role interesting and would love to see that developed further in future storylines. Thank you, Nora, for the great stories; you never seem to run out of ideas.  Keep up the great work!  I am waiting for a movie (or TV series) to come out based on Eve Dallas and company.  
 Whining, 30's something, music obsessed, English guy can't get it together.  He searches in all the wrong places to blame everything in his life on someone else.  His character is so well written, he becomes annoying and there is a real need to hang in there with him to find out if he ever figures himself out.  Self centered, going nowhere, taking advantage of others seems to be his lot in life. Interesting presentation of how some men view the world, waste their lives, and those who are drawn to them. 
 Debates about genetic engineering often revolve around what makes human beings 'human' or 'transhuman', and DESIGNER EVOLUTION: A TRANSHUMANIST MANIFESTO is bound to be at the heart of future debates, with its focus on the emerging new philosophy of Transhumanist doctrine, which supports the attempt to change the human body to eliminate disease, death, and even expand the mind beyond current boundaries. Young calls for a rejection of superstition in favor of a renewed faith in human progress through rational scientific progress.  Diane C. Donovan, Editor California Bookwatch  
 Luhrmann's flamboyant musical 'Moulin Rouge' is a combination of Camille, La Bohème and Showgirls... The film swings easily between present and past, among so many wildly different moods: farce, tragedy, romance, satire, comedy and rock and roll...  'Moulin Rouge' is an assault on the senses, a non stop visual explosion, an exotic trip, and a love story that is sure to touch your heart... It is a gloriously cinematic spectacle with opulent imagery directed with an eye for rich color, especially the color of rouge... It is also a breathtaking and poignant piece of cinema, a disco of dreams, a crazy and daring show, a vibrant screen fantasy, a "Bohemian Revolution," a magical movie for those who love romance, pop music and old musical movies...  Nicole Kidman gives the film its soul... She is the "sparkling diamond" of the show, the toast of Paris, the city's top courtesan... She melts her characterization with a sizzling, yet tender, performance... She is undeniably sexy, a beautiful singer, a flashy dancer whose heart sings whenever she sees Christian... In many ways, she is drawn as the ultimate sex goddess, as enigmatic as Greta Garbo, and her glamor masks her pain as well as her happiness... Kidman gives the film its central erotic charge, and its romantic thrills... She sways on a flying trapeze belting out Marilyn Monroe's "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend," and Madonna's "Material Girl."  Ewan McGregor achieves a nice mix of optimism and desperation, emphasizing the sincerity of the love-struck poet-hero... Christian is a young idealist who moves to the bohemian section of Paris during the 'summer of love' of 1899... He is hired to write a show about 'truth, beauty, freedom and, most of all, love.' Christian battles for the body and soul of the ravishing Satine... His fundamental believe is 'the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and to be loved in return...  John Leguizamo is vulnerable and sweet as Henri de Toulouse Lautrec needing a good writer to come up with story and lyrics for his new show called "Spectacular Spectacular."  Jim Broadbent is wonderfully comic as the ringmaster Harold Zidler... He is a jovial impresario who peddles the charms of a successful Satine to a mesmerized public... He is the owner of the infamous nightclub who has promised Satine to the evil Duke of Monroth... He has his eye on her too...   Richard Roxburgh is odious as the jealous benefactor obsessed with Satine to the point of murder... He is stunningly arrogant wanting the gorgeous can-can chanteuse in an "exclusive contract."  Luhrmann combines 1900 Can Can burlesque with modern musical poetry, exploiting Kidman's grace and beauty and overwhelming the audience with frenetic dance numbers delivered in operatic-style... Like Orson Welles, Luhrmann loves the technical magic of movies... When a red curtain opens, an orchestra conductor emerges to direct the unmistakable '20th Century Fox' theme opening, we immediately realize we're in for something really magical: A spectacular costume revue, an eye-catching fin de siècle exuberance, an inspiring rebirth of the movie musical...

 This is one of the better verse by verse commentaries on Revelation. It is very readable making it suitable for the layman and there is sufficient information to make it a good introduction for the student. He assumes the traditional late date and uses a mixture of the preterist and futurist  interpretation in which the beast is both Rome and the eschatological  Antichrist. He sees Revelation as a prophecy about the destiny of the  church, the 144,000 being the church, although he sees the two witnesses as  two eschatological prophets rather than the church. There is little or no  Greek and footnotes are kept to a minimum.  Note: Among 7 recent scholarly commentaries on Revelation Ladd is the 14th most cited author. 
 After almost 3 years since his debut, and with a lot more hype and budget, Bad Azz returns with an album not up to par with his debut, but still worthy of 4 stars.  For starters it has too many guests (only 2 songs have no one else on them).  Of the 17 songs, guests rap on 10 and do hooks on at least 5 so you don't get as much of one of the best kept secrets of the west as I'd have liked.  It has 1 almost classic song, 3 that I skip, 4 are ok, and the others are good but only 1 or 2 of them is great.  Production is pretty good but lacks on a few tracks, surprisingly cause he has some of the better known producers from the west coast on here.  Jelly Roll does 6 songs, Battlecat does 5, Blaqthoven does 2, LT Hutton, Lil Beau, DJ Don, & Big Hollis all do 1.  The middle of the album slacks off a lot.  A good album to have for his fans and a good west coast album as well, jus tnot his best.  #2 - 8 #3 - 9.5 (great beat -- my favorite on here) #4 - 8.5 (f/ kokane) #5 - 7.5 (f/ Ice Cube) #7 - 9 (f/ Val Young) #8 - 6 (f/ SnooP Dogg) #9 - 7 (f/ Lil Tip, LiL Beau, Nicole Harris -- goo dbeat) #10 - 7.5 (f/ LaToiya Williams & Doggy's Angels) #11 - 6 (f/ Butch Cassidy, Ras Kass, Sylk E Fine) #12 - 8 (f/ Snoop & Kurupt) #13 - 6 (f/ RBX & Kokane) #14 - 7.5 (f/ Snoop, Goldie Loc, Suga Free, Kokane) #15 - 9 (f/ Daz Dillinger & Blaqthoven) #16 - 8 (f/ Jelly Roll) #17 - 8 (f/ Snoop, Kokane, Lil Half Dead -- also on Snoop's "Tha Last Meal") #19 - 8.5 (f/ Jelly Roll & Blaqthoven) #20 - 8 (deeper song -- f/ Salim Grant)  Jamar Stamps --- b. around 1974 --- Long Beach, CA Check all my review 
 Steve Perry's first solo effot,1984's "Street Talk",is softer and more pop-oriented than the albums with Journey,but there's still that distinctive soulful vocal and musical quality that is pure Steve Perry-enough to produce 4 Top 40 singles-the Top 10 "Oh Sherrie",plus "Foolish Heart,"She's Mine" and "Strung Out".Other highlights include the 60s soul homage "I Believe",the ballad "Go Away",and the moving tribute to fallen 60s rock and soul icons "Captured By The Moment".The 2006 edition has excellent remastered sound(by Dave Donnelly)that is vastly superior to previous CD editions,3 interesting unreleased bonus tracks with his pre-Journey band Alein Project in the 70's("My My My My","Harmony","Makes No Difference"),the B-side to "Oh Sherrie"("Don't Tell Me Why You're Leaving")and a song from the "USA For Africa" album("If Only For The Moment,Girl).If you're a fan of Journey or 80's pop-rock,then this is right up your alley. 
 The most complete English-language edition of Benjamin's letters reveals the German author dealing with characteristic and unrelenting vigour and insight in a wide range of issues from Jewishness and Zionism to European literature, book-collecting and, of course, letter-writing. Yet, with the beginning of each of the 332 letters included in the volume, the reader is brought a little closer to Benjamin's tragic suicide, as he attempts to escape the consequences of the second world wa 
 The nose clipper is wonderful.  I highly recommend it to others.  It works well, is a small, convenient size and the price was more than reasonable 
 For the last ten years I have performed and studied long form improvisational comedy in different theaters in New york City and do so despite having no desire or aspiration to be a professional performer  a) because i love it and  b) because i have found it from the first day to be a wisdom tradition in its own right. I find it one of the most vital, delightful and challenging spiritual practices I have and have written on the subject myself - The 10 Commandments as Rules of Improvisation was a short piece a wrote a few years ago.  Anyway, Improv Wisdom is just great. While many of the insights and the revelations aren't new to me... some are.The book is a real charmer and very practical and as an improvisor I connected to what she meant. Madson's views are broad and take some of the "rules" of improv and good scenework and extend them into the world of experience and away from the small stage.  My own perosanl wish is that she drew a bit more deeply on the variety of long form improv wealth from Chicago - Del Close, Charna Halpern, Mick Napier, Joe Bill, Armando Diaz and improv's   resident mystic Ali Farahnakian et al...because I think that the more explicit approach of long form improv serve the points of the book even more fully than TheaterSports does.  I guess I can sum it up with a recollection of how true this book is - My first improv teacher ever (this was in 1996) was Amy Poehler (now on SNL) at Solo Arts Stage in Chelsea. She said to us, with as much conviction as I have heard anyone say anything:  "The stage is my church and long form improvisational comedy is my religion and I want to practice it at every moment in my life. When I have felt most myself and most alive is when I have been living this way. Now, rock out with your cocks out." And she laughed.  Truer words were never spoken and Amy shows why this book is so applicable to everyone. It is fresh, open and available to meet you where you are, like any good scene partner 
 I fell head over heels in love with Mike Gayle's sophomore release MR. COMMITMENT, so when I stumbled across MY LEGENDARY GIRLFRIEND - which happens to be his first book, I had to read it! I was not disappointed!   As usual Gayle takes his time when telling a story. There are many parts of the book that will have you screaming "hurry up!", but his well thought out characters and plot is what makes this book a hit!  Will is the ill at ease, sarcastic protagonist in this delightful novel. It's been three years and he still hasn't gotten over the day his ex-girlfriend Aggi dumped him - on his 23rd birthday -- without rhyme or reason.   There hasn't been a woman since who has come and knocked ol' Aggi down from that tremendously high pedestal Will has put her on. He obsesses over her day and night, and beats himself up trying to figure out what he could've done differently. He just cannot get her out of his system. That is until he gets a phone call from the girl who lived in his flat prior to him moving in. Could this stranger be the one who helps Will come to grips on the true meaning of love?   In just one weekend, he learns what usually takes a lifetime for some. Maybe there is someone out there that can measure up to his "legendary girlfriend".    
 I first heard Diane Ackerman talking about this book on an NPR talkshow.  I was so impressed that I went out and bought a copy that day.  I was not disappointed.  Ackerman's human, non-academic yet poetic style is immediately accessible and almost hynotic at times.  Coupled with an interesting, universal subject matter, it makes this a book worth reading and reading again.  Closing this book is, in many ways, like closing the door on a love affair: you wish it wouldn't end, but you have fond memories.  The plus with this book is that you can do it all over again, and again, and again 
 This is could be Cam's best effort. I'd have to say that this, Come Home With Me, and Killa Season are his best albums. The production on this album was TIGHT and the lyrics were dope. Purple Haze does not disappoint and this is well worth the money. You will like this especially if you like Dipset or have been following Cam'ron his whole career. Every song on here is either HOT or GOOD and none of the songs are wack. Go pick this one up now!  TOP TRACKS Intro More Gangsta Music Leave Me Alone Part 2 Down and Out Family Ties  
 This book delivers the goods. It doesn't waste time telling you how dangerous things are.. It gives a straight-forward account of what to expect so you can make informed decisions about what trails to ride. But... best of all.. it's fun to read. Trails like "Prostitute Behind the Rocks.. aka... a nice butte." show that this guy not only lives and breathes biking.. but he also is extremely literate. A biker sence of humor cranks through each description. A must buy even if you aren't going to Moab. Sit back. Take a swig of your favorite Eddie McStiff's brew and read Mountain Biking Moab 
 This tape came included with the Body System 1...so far so good...is not quite as challenging as the older Firm videos...is a good workout when I dont feel like challenging myself...but for a good sweat I still stick to Susan Harris Vols 1 and 4...and the Tought Aerobic Mix...you see I come from the Old School..when the Fanny Lifter was made of wood...  I must said though I love the Firm....however, I also discovered that Anna Benson has a new line call PrimeFit...I may check out those videos too since I dont seem to catch up with "The Firm" accesories.... now there is a new Fanny Lifter....I wont be buying that 
 I liked this book. I would have liked more drama. And things just seemed to go too easy for them 
 Like Nick Hornby, Perrotta does a great job getting inside the 30-ish male mind. The situations characters get into seem a bit extreme, but I guess it's easier to make a point that way. An easy read--but gives you a lot to think about. Can't ask for much more than that. Plus lots of tunes 
 I'm pregnant for the first time and I bought this book a few weeks ago. I find myself picking it up again and again. It is VERY informative and straight-forward. It includes pretty much any topic/answer that you could possibly think of. I admit that a few things in it were unnecessarily paranoid, but I really enjoy the month-by-month descriptions of changes. In fact, reading that things like cramping are normal put me at EASE rather than worried me. The diet sections list many things that I already eat pretty much every day, so I don't think it's out of line. You just have to remember that not every woman is the same and no two pregnancies are exactly alike. And that just because the book says to steer clear of sugar doesn't mean that one brownie or soda is going to kill the baby. Personally, I went off caffeine as soon as I tested positive, and put a leash on my sweet-teeth.   This book is not a bible by any means, but I've enjoyed and will continue to enjoy referring to it. As for the sections about serious possible problems of pregnancy, I think their info. is extremely useful to know and is not just trying to scare you. It's just trying to be informative of every possible situation 
 These socks are long enough to go up to your knee.  Warm, comfortable and wearing well.  I will buy more 
 I saw the movie, liked it (hard to believe), so I read the book. Quite a bit different than the movie but not in a necessarily bad way. I wish the movie would have followed the book more in the area of Elliot but then again I wish the book would have put more Sin Russell in. The book definitely does not attempt to have all the twists as the movie does in a painstaking way.  Overall, I probably wouldn't recommend this book unless you really liked the movie. It is fast fast reading though so maybe if you want to read something mindless, this might be for you 
 Another hit from FamilyFun!!  If you've ever been stumped for birthday party ideas, this is one kick-butt book.  I used it last year for my son's 13th party and let's just say his party ROCKED!!!  All the kids had a BLAST!! 
 I have got to say that this album has brought me back during my high school days. I grew up listening to him and other artist such as Keith Sweat. I remember attending to his concert in Radio City Music Hall performing with Salt-N-Pepper right after prom night.   Kelly does almost everything by himself. The production, songwriting, and mix's, etc.... and he's brilliant as a multi-instrumentalist.   Every fan of R&B and soul will love this smooth laid-back music. I mean who can forget classics like "Your Body's Callin'" and "Bump N' Grind". Songs that just make your head bounce. Don't forget The Best R&B-Song of 1993 "Sex Me", for its seductive, made-for-lovers-in-bed sound. Other very good low-tempo songs are "It Seems like You're Ready", "For You" "12 PLAY" and "Sadie". It was with the album "12 PLAY" that he acknowledged his real music and showed the world his enormous talent.    Overall "12 Play" is a very good album and although released in 1993, it can stand up to anything on the R&B market now. This is a very sexy album great for all kinds of lovers. I definitely recommend this to all Kelly fans. 
 I have been using this starter kit for almost a month and I am beginning to see results. My experience with this product has been that my skin definitely got worse before it got better. For the first few weeks, my skin seemed to explode with more acne than usual... however, last week it started to clear up rapidly. I'm still having blemishes pop up daily, but they disappear within a few days, and overall my skin is much smoother and my (many, many) scars are less visible. I have struggled with moderate to severe acne for 6 years and have tried more products and treatments than I care to remember, and decided to try Murad after it was suggested to me (I'd never heard of it before). It certainly is no "miracle" product where you see results instantly (especially if you have a moderate to severe acne problem), but I just re-ordered the starter kit and am hoping the results will continue to improve. This product is definitely worth a shot 
 The introduction & the first chapter of this book stress the importance of the digital photographer organizing the digital workflow, and I agree it is important, the repetative nature of the text, however, ran the subject into the ground. Having stated that, I would like to stress that the valuable content and informative nature of the subsequent chapters more than make up for the opening's redundancy. I am afraid that someone skimming through first part of this book may dismiss it and miss out on the valuable information regarding working with Adobe Photoshop CS, and of course, organizing the digital workflow. 
 Why I am qualified to review this book: I used to be ranked #25 on the top 100 list for my age. I won third in the N. CA jr. High champs, 3rd at a LA Masters. I have had the honor of working with FM Banawa, from the Philippines, who is now rated 2307 according to January FIDE rating supplement. I have also work with other strong players, with ratings over 2400 USCF. So, I am no stranger to books, especially attacking books, the other book that I thought was really really good was Attack with Tal.  Most Attacking books are showing examples of the position and what happens (in reference to Larry Christiansen's Rocking the Ramparts and Storming the Barricades).  This book Rocks the Ramparts and Storms the Barricades even better then LarryC did (in reference to Larry Christiansen's 2 books, one for Gambit Publishers, the other for Batsford Publishers)!  A very impressive book.  Jan Timman starts annalyzing from move 1, and tells us up front what happens.  He looks over the games of GMs Anatoly Karpov (Boa Constrictor), Jan Timman (Iniatiative), Garry Kasparov (Demolitions), Nigel Short (Elegance), Ivan Sokolov (Target Practice), Vasily Ivanchuk (Origional and Depth), Viswanathan Anand (Efficiency), Alexey Shirov (Creative) Vessilin Topalov (Wild Adventures), Judit Polgar (Agression), and Andrey Volokitin (dogged determination).  He then goes over a brief summary of the players, then shows us some of their games, why he gave them their names.  Anatoly Karpov - because he sacrifices an exchange to keep the enemy king in the center, and then just attacks them, and transposes into a won endgame, which is a very efficient and effective style. Jan Timman - Because Jan Timman seems to grab the Initiative in the middle game, and then launch a interesting and also beautiful attack.   Garry Kasparov - Well as we all know, GM Kasparov is brilliant.  He just destroys everyone.  He is very strong, and is by far the best player in the world.  Kasparov just attacks! Nigel Short - Short is very strong at attacking chess.  He has a nice elegant flow to his chess, and that is why Timman labeled him "Attractive Ellegance".  All of the games that he played here are very nice, and extremely good quality. Ivan Sokolov - Sokolov is a strong GM, who is well known for his positional understanding.  Sometimes, he wakes up and decides that it is a day where he will go after his opponent's king.  When that happens, he almost never misses his target, and Timman proves it through examples. Vasily Ivanchuk - Vasily "chuky" Ivanchuk has been a top GM for years, and was thought to be the next work champion in the early 1990s.  He is very strong positional player, yet he is also vrey strong in attacking chess.  He is just plain 100% Original in his ideas. Vishy Anand - We all know Anand is one of the best players in the world, if not the best.  He is always very efficient, with a deep positional understanding, yet he also knows how to attack, and is very good at attacking chess. Alexey Shirov - The 2006 Tal, Alexey Shirov is a brilliant GM, and has been a member of the world elite for years.  His creativity propelled him there.  He has had some nice wins over all of the top GMs in the world, and is known for his razor sharpk, creative style. Vesselin Topalov - He is always well prepared, and his opening preparation is based on that he can get a good position where he has a chance to launch an attack on the enemy king. He takes lots of risks, and is also ex-world champion because he lost 5-6 in classical and 2.5 - 1.5 in rapid chess to Vladimir Kramnik.  Judit Polgar - She has been known for years to be a very strong attacking player.  Timman shows us this through examples again. Andrey Volokitin - Volokitin is a very strong players, who was once ranked #25 in the world.  In GM Timman's opinion, his play and style reminds him of Vlemovich when he was younger (Vlemovich is the guy who invented the Bc4 Qe2 0-0-0 system against the classical Sicilian)  a player with a head of crazy ideas.  Next, he showed through 33 more examples common tactical themes in chess, a "quiet move", which is really just a knock out move, that limits the enemy king's mobility, and its just game over.  He gives numerous other examples of other common themes.  It was very interesting.  Timman proved to me that this is a good book, and I will be buying another Jan Timman book.  He is very good writer, and player.  He shows us how to build an attack step by step.  I recommend this book to all, strong attackers and not so strong attackers, Patzers (club players) to GMs, this book can improve your chess a tremendous amount!  I, as a very strong attacker, really enjoyed the book, and learned a lot.  It is to mention that I didn't even need a board to go over the games, there were enough diagrams, for me, so that I could take a little checkpoint every now and then, and know exactly what was going on.  Jan Timman, an ex-member of the world elite, and still a very strong player, he is the man!  He is one of the most qualified people in this world to be writing a book about attacking chess.  He is very good with the Initiative, and very good when needed to attack

 Blackwater is the first album Altan recorded after Frankie Kennedy's death; surprisingly, it is also one of their finest. If you are not familiar with Altan but are a fan of traditional - and instrumental - celtic music, and/or you are looking for good Irish fiddlers, this album will make a wonderful introduction to a wonderful band. There is something strangely PERFECT about this album, and although the instrumental pieces don't perhaps have all the energy and enthusiasm of those of their previous album, Island Angel, they are, nevertheless, some of the best that Altan has recorded.  Ní Mhaonaigh's singing is the aspect of Altan that most divides opinions, some fans of Altan being fans precisely because of it, others calling her voice shrill and her technique amateurish. Personally I belong to neither group, finding the instrumental pieces Altan's strongest point but considering Ní Maonaigh's voice, although often girlish and technically far from perfect, also quite pretty and, more importantly, suitable for the songs that she performs. In Blackwater her voice is certainly at its best; not merely pretty but with great character and expression.  What I, personally, sometimes find disturbing about Altan's songs is that it is in them, rather than the instrumental pieces, that Altan has experimented with arrangements and styles that are less traditional or more "pop" than their instrumental music. That having been said, I must point out that this album includes some of Altan's finest songs, and not least because of some great instrumental arrangements such as those of "Stor, A Stor, A Ghra" and track 9 (better I don't even try to spell the title of that one!). "Molly Na Cuach Ni Chuilleanain" (...or something to that effect!) with its synthesizer sounds is an example of those less traditional arrangements that I mentioned above; nevertheless, I can't deny that the result is fresh and pretty, and that the tune is one of the most "catchy" Altan songs. As for "Blackwaterside", this must be one of the most beautiful songs that Altan has ever recorded - and, as is pointed out in the album cover, exceptional in that it is written from a female point of view:  "But there's not a girl in this whole wide world As easily lead as I. And when fishes can fly And the seas run dry, It is then that you'll marry I. 
 As far as films go...almost the best movie I have ever seen...well, I am 18, but I suspect it doesn't get any better than this.     The script, filming, acting etc. are good; but what makes the movie is the content. The only movie I have seen that manages to portray romantic/married love without being maudlin or stupid. The relationship between More and his wife blows me away, especially in the last scene when he is talking about custard and she's screaming and he calls her a lion. It's not a typical movie characterization/etc. I couldn't believe it was a movie.      Also, it raises the issue of 'one's conscience' and the whole issue of Right/Wrong and to compromise or not to compromise. The movie isn't a pat idealistic 'sass the king and do your thing, be brave'. Rather, all manners of men are shown in contrast; from driveling Rich to fiery nonconformist Will Roper, and all manners of men in between.      Thomas More doesn't fit either catagory. He's a politician: not a Scottish Covenanter. And neither is the moral "Just follow your conscience and defy authority"...at the beginning of the movie we see Thomas More speak disparagingly of Martin Luther in favor of the 'corrupt' Authorities of the Roman Catholic Church.      Thomas More, by his principles, 'forced' King Henry to execute him...instead of just assenting to the oath and muttering through his teeth like everyone else.       And the movie does the same. It doesn't just let us conclude that 'it is right for everyone to follow their consciences'. Thomas More does not simply champion "Freedom of Conscience". Like Henry the VIII we are 'forced' to make our own decision about Thomas More...     Was he some unbending, deaf to rationalizations, uncompromising to the death fanatic; on par with jihadists who detonate in Israel?     Or is there really a Truth out there, while all of us are busy swearing the "Succession Oath" of our times, and shaking our heads at misguided fanatics... and live successfuly, and die in our beds?  It makes me wonder 
 I just bought this book last week for a bedtime story book for my 7-year old.  He has requested it again every night since.  The pictures have really caught his imagination.  They are nice and detailed but a bit  repetitive for me.  But my boy loves them and that's what matters.  I wish  I could buy more books that make this big an impression 
 In September of 2003, Steve Miller released his fifth US compilation entitled Young Hearts: Complete Greatest Hits. Steve Miller for 35 plus years has created alot of classic rock and roll gems, album favorites and hit singles.  For years, Capitol Records wanted Steve to release a re-issue of his classic 1978 greatest hits album Greatest Hits 1974-78 but he was not easily persuaded until 2003 when he decided to put out Young Hearts.  This compilation is the only one disc compilation, not counting the 1994 3-CD box set(also known as The Pegasus box set), to cover every era of Steve Miller's career from 1968-2003. The only albums not covered in this collection are 1968's Children of the Future, 1970's Your Saving Grace and Number 5 albums, 1971's Rock Love, 1972's Recall the Beginning, 1981's Circle of Love(although the album's epic Macho City appears as a bonus track on the European editions of the album on a second disc) and 1988's Born 2 B Blue. There are only three tracks from the 1968-72 versions of The Steve Miller Band. The 1969 album Sailor is represented by Living in the USA which was Steve's first big FM rock radio hit. The song would be a concert staple. Gangster of Love is missing but c'est la vie. 1969's Brave New World is represented by the classic Space Cowboy, which was a classic rocker with some tasty lead work from Miller, and the classic collaboration with Beatle Paul McCartney called My Dark Hour which is a great song. In fact, the riff at the beginning would be resurrected for the song Fly Like an Eagle years later. We then fast forward to 1973's Gold selling album The Joker which is represented by the #1 charting classic title cut(which is here in the original album version and not the single edit featured on Greatest Hits 1974-78) and the classic Shu Ba Da Du Ma Ma Ma Ma. 1976's #2 charting 4 million plus selling album Fly Like an Eagle is represented by the album's title cut(a #2 hit in early 1977 and is here in almost its full album version but with Space Intro that precedes the song), the spacey Wild Mountain Honey, the rocking Serenade, the bluesy Dance Dance Dance, the Top 10 rocker Take the Money and Run and the album's biggest hit Rock'n Me(which hit #1 in 1976 and was written around the time Steve Miller opened for Pink Floyd at Knebworth in 1975 in front of 150,000 people and upstaged the Floyd). 1977's Book of Dreams is represented by the album's Top 10 hit Jet Airliner(which is here in its original album version and with the Threshold intro), the Top 20 hit Swingtown(also here in its album version), the Top 20 hit rocker Jungle Love and the album track The Stake(which is slightly edited). Winter Time(which was on GH 1974-78) is missing but appears on the European edition of Young Hearts which was a 2-disc set and True Fine Love(which was on GH 1974-78 as well) is also missing. 1982's Top 5 Platinum selling Abracadabra is represented by the #1 charting title cut(here in its single edit) and was Steve's last pop hit but what a track. 1984's dud Italian X-Rays is represented by Who Do You Love which was one of the album's few highlights. 1986's Living in the 20th Century is represented by the #1 rock radio and MTV video smash I Want to Make the World Turn Around and I believe this is the video edit on here as the album version was different. The track features Miller singing in a low octave and playing killer guitar solos and includes on tenor saxophone Kenny G(yes, the Kenny G who is the "king of schlock"  and someone you least expected to hear on a rock record) on and does surprisingly good tenor sax solos instead of using the annoying soprano sax which he is famous for. 1993's Wide River is represented by the album's title cut(which was a rock radio hit in 1993) and Cry Cry Cry. This is a great Steve Miller starter kit for those who want to discover him and then buy his catalog after. Despite not charting high(as music was heisted by trashy pop hillbilly harlots, cavedwelling nu-metal dudes and thug rappers/whites who wanted to be boyz in the hood in 2003) but sales don't mean squat! Recommended 
 I don't really listen to country music but Lonestar is one of the bands or country artists that I will listen too. They're very easy to listen too they aren't full of that twang when they sing and I enjoy most of their songs. Let's Be Us Again is the best song on the CD because during that time I had just gotten out of a long relationship and that song spoke to me even though we will never be together again it's worth listening too. Cause that song gives you hope that someday maybe you could be together again. I do also enjoy Lonestar over Rascall Flatts because well his voice sounds way better and not as high as the lead singer of Rascall Flatts. 
 Douglas Brinkley is a very good historian, who has been able to portray historical facts with an excellent sense of human feelings and characters who actually lived the events.  This book is no exception.  I enjoyed it very much and while I lived during the time and had a vague idea of the activities, I did not know of the historical significance of the events. 
 This Bible is a wonderful version that has been very helpful in my Bible Study class.  The leather is soft and sturdy.  I love the index tabs!  The footnotes are relevant and thought provoking.  I have serveral other Bibles but this is my first NLT version.  I really enjoy how easy this version is to read.  
 The film The Jury was well worth the time that it took me to watch from beginning to end.  I appreciated Gerard Butler's portrayal of the Phantom in Phantom of the Opera, so I was interested in another film in which this young actor had a starring role.  I was not disappointed at any time during the movie with any of the portrayals.  The viewer is drawn into the lives of these jurors as the plot unfolds; their personal plights often overshadow the main idea of the movie, the jury trial of a young Sikh boy who is accused of murder.  I seldom watch a movie more than once, but I do plan to rediscover the characters that made this movie so intriguing and so worth the viewing time 
 easier to understand than shakespeare, although slightly different, good purchase, book in great condition, great experienc 
 I just finished the book.  Not as good as "The Pact," but interesting nonetheless.  A bit unrealistic but though provoking...I certainly recommend it 
 The battle for Germany and Berlin was possibly the defining moment in the military and political shape of Europe for perhaps 50 years, yet most American's knowledge probably stops at Hitler, Eva Braun and the Bunker.  Armageddon brings to light both the human tales with excellent exerpts from German, Russian, Polish, British, Canadian, and American combatants and civilians, with the political and moral dymanic at work between all of the parties.  The battles of Silesia, the Hurtgen Forest, and East Prussia are rarely known, but the tales behind them are worthy of those from D-Day, Stalingrad, Iwo Jima and Guadalcanal.  Hopefully this book will bring them to light 
 If you are writing your own vows, or trying to come up with a toast, or need a reading for the ceremony...or just feel like telling your significant other how much you love him/her, this book is for you:  tons and tons of sample vows, everything from poetry excerpts to "cookie cutter" vows where all you have to do is fill in the blank with the right name.  It has vows for every occasion, quotes and sayings about love and marriage, and a whole lot more.  This book is a great buy and should be passed on to friends 
 Concise, clear, well-developed, and engrossing entries show Bryan A. Garner employs the annotations he presents in The Oxford Dictionary of American Usage and Style. Not only is this abridged version of Garner's Modern American Usage fun and interesting to read (and shorter than the original, obviously), it covers the fundamental (all 360 pages worth) details of American English that anyone truly serious about the language should pay attention to.  Garner writes in the preface, "Although there are good, clarifying forces at work on the language, there are also bad, obscuring forces. And these bad forces tend to work most perniciously on people who are heedless of their language. It's hard to know such a thing, but this segment of society may well be on the rise. "This book could never reach those people."   This dictionary makes one aware of those bad, obscuring forces and their effects. But it also effectively explains those misconceptions, misused forms, mispronunciations, needless variants, useless words, and, in many cases, how the "mistakes" evolved. Garner also gives longer essay entries confronting usage and style questions based on topic rather than word.  The over 2,000 quotations from publications (usually newspapers and books), serving as both good and bad examples, paint the objects of Garner's entries into a vibrant mural embodying effective American English. This visualization, combined with Garner's strewn-about humor, takes dry topics and makes them flow more easily for the average reader.  I find myself constantly going back and looking up things in this dictionary, because while few are going to remember everything in it, there's at least the chance of remembering there is a question on the word or subject. If you want answers, keeping The Oxford Dictionary of American Usage and Style handy will likely help you find what you're looking for. (And yes, "Perfectly natural-sounding sentences end with prepositions, particularly when a verb with a preposition-particle appears at the end." 
 I have been looking for The story of the Stone for years. Mr. Hughart,  please do not leave us like this! Your stories are wonderful, your  characters, unforgivable, your world, amazing! I have read all your stories  and am waiting anxiously for the next one 
 Well not being much of a history buff, I read this just the same and learned a great deal about Roosevelt. His actions led to many break throughs which are still being highly used by goverment departments today. I found the book went into more than just the spy games, but also into who hates who. I would say its like a soap opera but with a  historic twist. I strongly feel that the book is well worth the read 
 Smaller compared to his other works, the book is about HONGKONG and its TAI-PAN (supreme leader). Time is around 1840, British have just got the island from China. Now they want to make it a trading hub with China and external world. Chineeses want opium from the non-china traders inreturn for tea and silver.  The story is about the initial settlers on the island, their struggle to make it civilized, competition within the traders and the Chinese who are difficult trade/ communicate with 5000 years old of civilization.  This one is similar in most ways to SHOGUN. Former has background in Japan and TAI-PAN is in HONG-KONG/CHINA. Toranaga of SHOGUN is Dirk Struan of TAI-PAN with a similar plot. There is a chance that you may like TAI-PAN if you have read SHOGUN. My suggestion is to read these books with a time gap just to avoid the  deja vu feeling.  What I liked about Clavell is his sincerity to the people of China, unlike some of the western JAMES-BOND kind of protagonists who go to the orients and people start bowing them.  Also the ending is better than that of SHOGUN. Last few chapters are very fast moving. I liked the GOD-FATHER kind of ending.  Clavell is best at non black and white characters. And he is loyal to his characters (Unlike Michener whose characters last single chapters and vanish to oblivion with out much significance). The book is character driven and you will love the characters long after the book is finished. I read the last few chapters at great length just because I knew that I am going to miss them once I finish the book.  There are some loose ends I think Mr. Clavell will address them in NOBLE HOUSE, sequel of TAI-PAN.  I also recommend SHOGUN by the same author and books by JAMES MICHENER and EDWARD RUTHERFORD for any one who liked TAI-PAN. Even though other 2 authors write semi-historic novels than character driven plots as by Mr. Clavell. 
 Wind Energy Products are available for : lighting, water pumping, refrigerating, communication... This book is a necessary reading for all persons wishing to give the alternative energies a chance. Complete with  many addresses and inside knowledge. A must for the alternative energy  enthusiast.. 
 This is undeniably the boss' best album to date. While not as hollow and rough as Nebraska, Tom Joad is a more polished album, closer in sound to his new Devil's and Dust. Yet it manages to outdo that album as well by avoiding some of the pop aspects that cause it to lose some of the chilling qualities. If you are a music lover, and you want to put on a record and actually listen to the music, the lyrics, and appreciate some genuine American art, then this is the album for you. If you want to dance to music without having a clue about what the songs mean I reccomend Born in the USA 
 I have read all of Van Gulik's murder mysteries and this is has to be my favorite. The characters are intriguing and some sinister. The end is satisfying and bittersweet, challenging integrity vs justice. I would,  however, recommend you read the others first (chronological is good,  Chinese Gold Murders is first) to get to know the main characters although  this book can stand on on its own 
 These are a collection of marvelous essays Marjorie Perloff has edited. The scope of Cage is seemingly immense, the implications of his work has touched varigated corners and crevices,abandoned places: the music world,  the world of poetry,conceptual art, performance art, mushroom  enthusiasts,opera, and other synergistic art forms we have no label for  yet. Perloff herself chooses the influence of Duchamp to discuss, the ends  of things of the Western canon was a frightening yet fascinating point in  the last century. And Cage always had done everything,like Duchamp with an  element of the lighthearted at work. There are analysis here as well as  seasoned music essayist Jann Pasler's discussion on Cage's  "Composition in Retrospect" a 1981 mesostic text. Pasler helps  explain what this figuritivly complex yet disarmingly word play composition  means. Cage wrote many of his most important works in this structural form.  And his own "Overpopulation and Art" is included here, asa a  guiding means of response to these participants. This is as close as Cage  gets to social and political/environmental reflection, you will not  recognize Cage here.  Herbert Lindenberger is a well known writer in the  cloistered world of Opera and he admirably reflects on Cage's one and only  Opera "Europeras" and the Aesthics that may emit itself from that  varigated and multidimensional work. Although aesthtics in its  traditionally bound demeanor was always and remained a by-product of the  Cage edifice, here in this opera he lets other impart their aesthtic  desires by allowing singers to choose their own arias to perform. Also Cage  scholar Joan Retallack(who has also an impressive series of interviews with  Cage) speaks here on "Poetics of a Complex Realism", and this  refers to the American dimension of Cage, a topic seldom discussed. This  refers to the Trancendentalists tradition of social rebellion although  quite passive in retrospect. Writers like Thoreau were important to Cage.  Cage activism points in mysterious and undramatic ways. The making of  meaning through performance and collaboration was what Cage had valued and  he contributed that legacy to the last century. Artifacts of art need  continuous nurturing,scholarly explication, regular performance and tried  and tested aesthetic canons to be attenuated. Rather within this insecure  world, Cage's hope was to nurture a tradition of performers,of  communicators equipped with a conceptual fredom of expressive means through  a varied and interdisciplinary world which didn't seem to depend on any one  particular discipline or technique, as the rigours of composition or,  playing the violin, or writing symmetrical verse 
 You will find the writing very accessible; Suzanne did a great job of paring down to essentials so that clear, consise meanings emerge.  You'll be pleased with the depth and accuracy of self-information you glean in a surprisingly short session.  Many combinations are presented including numerological ties to astrology, relationship patterns, occurrences of doubles, many famous folks' numbers, and much more.  Space is allowed throughout for your own notes and / or family analysis.  The book is straight forward, and useful for anyone interested in numerology regardless of previous experience 
 Dave Amram passionately evokes in his newest book the rhythms and poetic vibes of his life all the while casting to the four winds the much misaligned "beatnik myth" that plagued Jack Kerouac's life and stigmatized his art.  Through Amram's sound recollections, Kerouac's legacy as an artist resounds with the exclusive atmosphere that is also conducive, even to this day, to the heart and soul of Amram's classical compositions and world-wide performances.  It is a testament written from a contemporary of Kerouac's that celebrates the efforts of those fascinating artists of the post-WWII years consisting of Jack Kerouac, Gregory Corso, Allen Ginsberg, Robert Frank, Philip Lamantia and Dody Muller (as well as a host of others).  We are there at the first jazz/poetry reading in NYC in 1956, the filming of Pull My Daisy in 1959, the last years of Jack Kerouac's life in the late 1960s until the posthumous aftermath that gradually began to realize the literary merit of Kerouac's art that today firmly places him within the canon of American Literature along side Hemingway, Poe, Melville and Twain.  Kerouac is not so much eulogized in this memoir as he is  painted humanly as the soulful cat he was celebrating life the best way he knew how, in his books.  Despite telling Amram in July 1968 that "fame is a drag to anybody who wants new work done", Kerouac intuitively sensed the longevity of his life's work would outlast his own years dogged by the fame he no longer wanted.  The same can be said for David Amram whose own art is vital to the understanding and appreciation of post-WWII American culture in symphonic, jazz, global and folk music.  Pick up this book today for a breath of fresh Kerouacian air . . .  
 This book is riveting.  I'd never heard of Po Bronson and knew little about the Silicon Valley .com era when I picked it up. Bronson's ability to build portrait after portrait of the individuals behind the .com era make this a page-turner. In the end, I'm not sure there's any other way to tell this story, but as the sum of its parts 
 Now this was the best movie of all time. Robi Rosa is the sexiest you could ever see in your life. I think the best song on the soundtrack would have to be Under My Skin. Oh my goodness. When I found out that was him singing it blew my mind. I was like he is fine and he can sing. So I give the movie and the soundtrack 5 stars 
 On Saturday 15 February 2003 Henry Perowne, a middle-aged London neurosurgeon and dedicated husband and father, wakes up in the middle of the night and, while standing for the window, sees a flaming plane on its decent into Heathrow. He cannot sleep anymore and sits downstairs with his blues-guitarist son Theo to wait for the news. It turns out that the plane made a safe landing. When he finally goes to bed again he makes love to his wife, falls asleep and wakes up while outside the preparations for the protest march against the Iraqi war are ongoing. He takes his car to the squash club, but on the way there gets hit by a car with 3 young thugs in it. The leader of the three, Baxter, wants to beat him up, but when Henry mentions the signs of Huntington's disease that he has clearly seen in the guy he backs off. The rest of the day goes by relatively ordinarily: he plays squash, goes shopping, visits his demented mother and goes to a rehearsal from his son's blues band. All the while we see the world through the eyes of a reductionist neurosurgeon, explaining events from the perspective of brain functions.  But they haven't seen the last of Baxter. During a nice Saturday evening get together with his wife, children (his daughter Daisy is in for a visit from Paris to show the proofs of her first book with poems) and grumpy, alcoholic father-in-law-cum poet, Baxter and one of his friends show up again. The evening takes a number of unexpected turns, not in the least because of Baxter's mood swings which are caused by the Huntington's disease. In the end Henry shows that he is a true doctor who lives up to the oath of Hippocrates even in the most difficult of circumstances.  A great book. Henry is in a sense a very ordinary man, even though better off than most people, but he fully realizes this. I can imagine that some people may get bored or irritated by Henry's way of reasoning, but I thought it was amazing that the author (not a neurosurgeon himself) could dive so convincingly into the mind of somebody who has it all and then threatens to lose it 
 Another entry in the great Nathan Heller series from Collins.  Everything you ever wanted to know about the Lindbergh kidnapping told in a tight story that is rich with real people of the time.  This book discusses many of the theories behind one of the most infamous events of the 1930's.  Get to know the scamsters who sought to profit from the kidnapping.  All in all this is a rich well told tale that brings its own ideas forth.  If you ever watched  The Untouchables, and by the way Elliot Ness is in there, you will love this book 
 The version I bought has a different book title, which is name  'Hugh McManners Outdoor Survival Guide'. I found the  book title is misleading, since the content of the book is not much about 'survival'.  The recent book title is much better.  This is not a manual,I recommend it to all wilderness training beginner 
 The book held my attention and kept me absorbed until the end.  No, Pat Robertson's no C.S. Lewis or Franklin Peretti, but then, no one else is either. Out of consideration for the readers, he managed to accomplish the same goal of fictionalizing the Book of Revelations from an everyman perspective in one volume as opposed to 12 or 13 volumes unlike the LaHaye/Jenkins team.  If he writes more fiction, I might read it 
                                                    By: Lyle Youmara                  	Well, well so you want to know about the Boxcar Children book by Gertrude Chandler Warner. So let's start. Well there are four kids that do not live with their parents like most other kids who have a mom and a dad. So they live with an old man who owns a bakery. He is the meanest man in the world. They also really don't like the man, and they are scared of him. The owner doesn't allow them to do any thing, like go out and play. They don't even get to play with each other. So one night they ran away from the old man and went into the woods so no one can find them.  While they were on their own they found a very old box car which was just left there. So they decided to stay there. Now they have to get their own food.   There are the four kids living in a rusty old boxcar from a train but it just left there. There are woods all around them. There is a little town by them where they go to get food and to earn money. It is in the summer where it is pretty warm but is not too hot. There is a pond which they bathe in.  And they wash their clothes in it. After a little while they start to really like it and they never want to leave. 	 The kids are very brave. And they trust one another and themselves. But they are a little scared because they are on their own and they have no parents to help them. Even the oldest brother is scared and he is 14 years old. But all of them are very hard workers. They cut grass for the peoplein the town to get money to get food. 	 The kids are on their own and they have to stay together. They also have to fight all other odds, like wild animals and human beings, so they aren't found. They have to get their own food, they have to eat rotten food, and they never have fun. All they do is work, work, work.  	 Well you don't know if they will be found. Or maybe they will go back to the bakery. Or will the kids not make it though this warm summer? Or will they find someone in their family? Or will they get adopted? Well you never know unless you read the book?????????????????????  	 
 I enjoyed this movie very much.  I thought it was well acted and haunting.  It is not a happy story, but it is powerful.  A tragic love story indeed, and a fine adaptation of a classic novel 
 Eudora Welty's second book, "The Robber Bridegroom," is an inspired synthesis of traditional American and European folktale recast in the deep south at the start of the 19th century. That this book handles such a challenge without sounding strained, pretentious, or self conscious is remarkable; that the prose is at once lush and fueled by a fast-paced narrative is even better. As with her other fiction, Welty's humor here never condescends, though it often exposes a darker, more violent reality than readers of "A Curtain of Green" might expect. The story is rife with familial betrayals, incidents of physical and sexual violence, and overt expressions of racism among the early settlers. Miraculously, these issues never burden the pace and joy of the narrative. Like Voltaire's "Candide," Welty's "The Robber Bridegroom" is a gentle satire that touches upon the more disturbing aspects of humanity while celebrating the same characters it satirizes. A one-of-a-kind book, and a must read for serious readers of American literature and world mythology 
 This is my first time to read a book by an Argentinean novelist.  The story  is very interesting and it is almost incredible that the book with gimmick of such novelty was written more than a half century ago.  You  would not find it old-fashioned even today. Recommendable not only for  sci-fi fans but also for readers who want to seek the meaning of  "living real."   The story is so short that you can read it  within 4 hours or so 
 As a parent, I recommend this book to all parents and teachers who want to see their children excel in all areas of development. The author, kindergarten teacher Peggy Campbell-Rush, offers a wealth of information on tried and proven techniques in her new book, I Teach Kindergarten.  This book is a clear, concise and entertaining "how to" book.  It takes you step by step through the process of developing a child's emotional, cognitive, physical and social skills and into the assessment of the child's progress.  It delves into the topics of developmental and academic expectations and creating the classroom environment, complete with detailed descriptions of a variety of learning centers.  It includes user friendly assessment forms and clear examples of their use.   The book is full of illustrations, samples, and diagrams and has informative questions and answers sections for each chapter.  Chapters on classroom management techniques, communicating with parents and helpful tidbits on the subjects of teaching with themes, preparing for substitute teachers and how to help struggling learners, make this a great reference book, loaded with good information for both parents and teachers alike 
 No one should read this book thinking it's part of the Botswana books.  I also recommend that you read Portuguese Irregular Verbs first.  Without that background, the humor here won't work as well.  Professor Doctor Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld (as in "hedge hog field") is a very self-important expert on Portuguese irregular verbs at the Institute of Romance Philology at Regensburg, Germany.  We learned in the prior book that he's also a bit insecure about his position within this field.  At the end of that book, we discovered that he also harbors a disdain for dachshunds ("sausage dogs") as being insufficiently noble (he is a "von" after all).  This dislike only reinforces his low opinion of his colleague, Unterholzer, who owns such a creature.    As this book opens, the good professor finds himself feeling out of sorts because his colleague and friend, Professor Doctor Doctor Florianus Prinzel, will be making a lecture in the United States before von Igelfeld.  Such a blow to his pride is unsupportable, and our professor takes some short cuts to regain precedence in this arena.  That decision leads to some unexpected opportunities to meet new people that may leave you laughing aloud as I was did when I read the first story.    The second story builds on that humor nicely as the professor receives his American host for a visit to Regensburg.  There is a slapstick sequence in this story that had me howling on the floor.  The humor levels of the final three stories are lower and take more time to develop, but they are excellent character studies about how someone who has a superiority complex deals with the mundane bumps in the road.    In On the Couch, our professor deals with a feud between Unterholzer and him . . . while trying to maintain his commitment to truth.    The Bones of Father Christmas is a lengthy story with a delayed punch line that takes the professor back to Italy for an extended visit that puts him in the middle of a Christian controversy that has an unexpected conclusion.  The Perfect Imperfect explores how philology becomes a popular subject aboard a cruise ship when our professor takes over.  Don't take these stories too literally.  They are very exaggerated . . . almost like cartoons in their humor.  If you don't like such broad humor, avoid this book . . . especially if you are a dachshund lover.  I could see this book, however, being made into a pretty hilarious movie starring Steve Martin.     
 As someone currently serving at a US Embassy in Asia, I found this book as an excellent (and highly accurate) appraisal of contemporary ground truth.  Despite an earlier reviewer's obvious political bias, the problems outlined in the book, and that still persist today, have operated independently from the vagaries of the political choices of the US population for well over half a century.  This book helped me with a framework (albeit fictional) to examine my own training, continuing education and behavior vis-a-vis the culture I am now participating in.  Am I in fact an active participant or simply a passive observer?  This book is a quick and thought provoking piece and should be required reading for all US personnel assigned to an overseas capacity 
 I as at first apprehensive - Superman is the best superhero in my humble opinion there has always been something mysterious about Batman. However, this dichotomy of honest against secretive worked out to the films advantage, the clashing techniques of the two makes interesting viewing. The love triangle is also gripping viewing as the two vie for Ms Lane's affection. Clark inwardly fights with himself as Bruce finds out his big secret and his squirming at Bruce's open flirting is very funny.  In it for the action? Then there's plenty here as well - action sequences seamlessly flow into the dialogue and love affair, while the detective work leaves you puzzling away. It had everything so buy it 
 The world lost a real gem of a writer when Stan Berenstain passed on November 29.  Together, Berenstain and his wife, Jan, and eventually their two sons, created books featuring lovable but flawed characters who tackle just about every real issue that faces families.    Going to the dentist is something that most kids (and adults!) fear.  And why not?  It's invasive, uncomfortable, and sometimes painful to have someone poking around in your mouth with metal objects.  However, it's necessary, and having a healthy attitude about it will promote lifelong oral health.  This book is a great place to start if you're looking to help alleviate your child's fear about going to the dentist.  It'll help open up a dialogue about your kid's fears and help you to explain why the dentist is so important.  Wonderful 
 This is a classic that is as great today as it was the day it was released 40 yrs. ago. They don't make them like this anymore and that is a shame! A great cast of actors combined with a great script and soundtrack make this a edge of your seat thriller from start to finish! "Wait Until Dark" means just that! View this gem in the evening for premium enjoyment! Shut off the phone & turn up the surround sound! All you need now is popcorn & someone to grab hold of! Enjoy! Caligula24 
 This book covers important type setting principles that are key in creating professional looking typography. Do you capitalize a.m. or p.m.? Where do you put a comma when there are quotations? How do you handle fractions - and more. Highly recommend as a staple for any design studio 
 Elaine St. James has come a long way since her days as a real estate investor. One day she realized her life was too busy and complicated. By cutting back on work and eliminating physical and mental clutter, she was able to focus on what mattered most in her life. Living the Simple Life features feedback from readers of the author's previous works. My favorite comes from David, a 42 year-old teacher who now can fit all his possessions into eight boxes. He works as a private rich-kid tutor two hours a day, four days a week. In all his free time he does volunteer work with underprivileged kids. Living the Simple Life is written on level ground with information regular folks can apply to their lives.  Not only is Living the Simple Life an ideal asset to your personal library, it also makes an easy and helpful gift. Pair it up with any of the book in Elaine St. James series for a revolutionary and refreshing life change 
 John Harris comes across as someone who has liberal leanings -- gee, he works for the Washington Post so that is a pretty good hint -- and his approach to this book was fairly obvious.  He wanted to write a book on how the Clinton "Revolution" changed Washington, the government, and politics as we know it.  He wanted to write such a book but in the end he came up short, way short.  There were just too many glaring holes in the Clinton mystique that any objective author -- and I think Mr. Harris was trying to be objective -- could not ignore.  Perhaps he hoped Bill Clinton would be the liberal Democrats version of a Ronald Reagan.  If so he was disappointed.  I agree with Brit Hume's summation that "John Harris reaches a generally favorable verdict on Bill Clinton, but there is no lack of evidence that could lead to a different conclusion".  "The Survivor" is definitely a readable book that tries to balance out the negatives and positives of the Clinton Administration.  However I thought the book glossed over some of the pivotal points of those eight years.  He writes little about such high profile events as the assault on the David Koresh compound in Waco in 1993 and the follow on Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the Republican landslide in 1994, the government shutdowns in late 1995 and early 1996, and the 1996 election campaign.  Harris recognized the failings of Bill Clinton and his Administration.  The trials and tribulations over Whitewater, Travelgate, and other improprieties all gave the perception of corruption.  His actions in trying to dismiss the Paula Jones controversy that mushroomed into the Monica Lewinsky controversy gave the perception of someone who was a liar.  But I think Harris gives the Clintons too much of a benefit of a doubt.  Harris's summation of Clinton's perceived corruption was perhaps best phrased on page 408 where he writes about the President's troubled relationship with FBI Direct Louis Freeh -- whom Harris felt should have been fired -- "Freeh's suspicions to the contrary, Clinton was not a corrupt public servant.  But on matters ranging from Whitewater to fund-raising to Monica Lewinsky, he had followed a pattern of limited disclosure, evasive or false public explanations, and shabby personal contact that made suspicion far from unreasonable."  And the definition of is "is"...?  Overall this is a good book that I debated over giving four or five stars.  Clinton defenders may find this book a betrayal of the former President while Clinton detractors may find this book a glossing over of a potentially fatally flawed presidency.  However I decided not to penalize him because he slanted his conclusions differently from how I think the conclusions should have been.  This is an overall good book and the reader can draw their own conclusions.  His book displayed the Clinton Administration -- warts and all.  John Harris would not demonize the Clintons nor could he deify the Clintons 
 Perhaps the best way to think of this movie is as a Chinese equivalent of a James Bond movie, (it even has the James Bond theme in one scene).  The basic plot of the movie is when one of the country's greatest swordsmen, Yip Cool Sung, challenges another, Simon Blow Snow, to a  Duel on the roof of the forbidden city on the 15th day of the first month (Chinese new year).  The Benevolent Emperor permits the duel saying "Many would be disappointed if I forbade it."  However as the palace can only accomodate 8 additional spectators, the Emperor issues 8 gold passes, and it falls upon  the palace detective Dragon 9 (sometimes translated as 009) to decide who is eligible to see the Duel. It is only after an incident at a local brothel that Dragon 9 suspects that something isn't right, but can't say what it is exactly. Not long afterwards, Dragon 9 and his friend and owner of the brothel, Lord Goldbeard find three carved figurines in the hands of a slain stone carver. While two of these figurines are easily identified, one as been the chief Eunuch Lau, and the other as a gambler named Ma a.k.a. "The dice demon," the third has had the face filed off it leading Dragon 9 to believe that this figurine is a replica of the killer but, without a face on the figurine it is impossible to say who it is.  The killer's identity remains unknown as both Ma and the craftsman asked to restore the face on the figurine are killed, and Eunuch Lau dies mysteriously. But the real surprise is not so much the killer's identity as to what the whole master plan is.  What this movie lacks action-wise, it makes up for in mystery and suspence, humour, softcore sexual references, and certain Matrix like special effects.  Quotes:  Dragon 9: Nice (playfully slaps sword wielding women on the face) Big ass too (spanks them as he passes through the throng) Hey! love your ass!  (a few minutes later when Simon Blow Snow arrives to fight the Phantom)  Simon:(to Phantom) Live or die? Dragon 9:Big....I mean live.   (Princess Phoenix and Dragon 9 fall into a pit after finding the slain craftsman)  Princess Phoenix:You cowards have used a dirty trick to trap us, come down here and fight Dragon 9 if you dare. Dragon 9:Come down here! Copme down and fight me if you dare!      Princess:Didn't you say you're telepathic microstep is invinicible, let's get some backup Dragon 9:Ok, ready? 1, 2, (they both jump) Princess:How come it didn't work? Dragon 9:I forgot to tell you, the microstep's only good for running away.  Dragon 9: (eating a cake starts making choking sounds)This cake....is absolutely delicious.   
 After the release of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) terrified viewing audiences (and raked in the dough), homicidal murderers became the soup de jour for exploitationeers as crazed crackpots, lunatic liquidators, erratic executioners, berserk butchers, and deranged death dealers flooded the silver screen, all in an attempt to entertain and cash in on what most of us wanted, that being a jolly good fright.  Within the genre, studios found women could be just as scary (sometimes even more so) as men, which helped revive the careers of a few starlets, thought past their prime, the most famous being Bette Davis (What Ever Happened to Baby Jane, Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte) and Joan Crawford (Straight-Jacket), but one shouldn't overlook the performance of one Ms. Tallulah Bankhead (Lifeboat) in her last on screen role as Mrs. Trefoile in the Hammer Studios produced Die! Die! My Darling! (1965) aka Fanatic.  The film, adapted for the screen by none other than Richard Matheson (The Incredible Shrinking Man, House of Usher, Pit and the Pendulum, The Legend of Hell House), was directed by Silvio Narizzano (Georgy Girl) and stars, along with Ms. Bankhead, Stefanie Powers (Hart to Hart).  Also appearing is Peter Vaughn (Straw Dogs), Maurice Kaufmann (The Abominable Dr. Phibes), Yootha (sounds like a character from a Godzilla film) Joyce (A Man for All Seasons), along with a youngish Donald Sutherland (Kelly's Heroes) as Joseph, the mildly retarded, almost ghoulish looking groundskeeper.  As the film opens, we see a smart young couple, Alan (Kaufmann) and Patricia (Powers), traveling in an even smarter looking coupe.  They just arrived in England by boat, and are soon to be married.  Thing is, Patricia had been engaged before, although her betrothed, Stephen, died in mysterious circumstances, and Patricia promised to visit Stephen's mother, Mrs. Trefoile (Bankhead), if she ever made it to the British Isle, very much against Alan's wishes, but it is something Patricia feels she must do in order for her to move on with her life.  She makes her way through the English countryside, coming upon a rather large, slightly dilapidated house, home to Mrs. Trefoile and her few servants.  Initially coming for a short visit, Patricia finds herself spending the night (and more) as Mrs. Trefoile sees it as her duty to `cleanse' Patricia's wicked spirit, making her suitable for her dead son (you see, Mrs. Trefoile believes engagement and marriage are the same thing in the eyes of the Lord, so they're actually related now, even though Patricia never married her son).  Creepy stuff, huh?  It gets worse...Patricia tries to leave, but Mrs. Trefoile will have none of that, and locks Patricia in the attic, so that she may infuse the spirit of the Lord into her soul, through a steady diet of starvation and scripture (if it weren't for tough love, I'd have no love at all).    One thing I noticed right away about Die! Die! My Darling! is a really well done and intelligent script, infused with slight touches of humor and a sense of realism built into the characters through careful and fairly meticulous development.  Also, I thought all the actors did a fine job, especially Ms. Bankhead, who really acted her wrinkled behind off presenting a domineering character whose motivations seemed murky at best (is it salvation she seeks for Patricia and ultimately her son Stephen, or revenge?)  Her religious zealotry seemed genuine (she doesn't use any condiments, not even salt, as she believes food shouldn't be `adorned' and eaten as God intended...mirror, mirror on the wall...wait, there are no mirrors...oh yeah, they promote vanity you dirty sinner) and thoroughly realistic (similar to Piper Laurie's character in the Brian DePalma's 1976 film Carrie), while in a lesser movie it would have come off as silly, one dimensional, and less than believable.  She wasn't necessarily evil, but her belief was so strong and all encompassing that she felt what she was doing was right (delirious dementia can be the most dangerous, fearsome kind of monster of all).  I really loved the fact the she was even too `religious' for her own church, preferring to hold services within her own home as she found the rector to be an unsavory sort since he remarried after the passing of his first wife.  I thought Stefanie Powers also did very well, struggling to escape, finding herself being drawn deeper and deeper into the morass of Mrs. Trefoile's `tough love' campaign.  I felt sorry for her, for her predicament, but also because she seemed to spend a lot of time getting slapped around.  Even the secondary characters were developed nicely, presenting suitable reasoning for their enduring the lifestyle forced upon them by their mistress (well, except for Joseph, who really needed no development as his was a life of simplicity, blissful ignorance, doing what he was told, subsisting mainly off the charity of others...and what was up with that maid?  She was like freakishly strong...oh yeah, if you like `cat' fights, there's a decent one in here).  Narizzano's direction suited the story well, and he kept the story going, delivering the goods at the appropriate time, and building on the tension an suspense inherent within the story.  I really liked the austere house most of the story took place in, and thought it was used well to complement the film as a whole.  Yeah, the film is camp, but pure and unadulterated (just like Mrs. Trefoile likes her food) camp.  Presented here is a really good looking wide screen (1.85.1) print, re-mastered in high definition.  The picture is clear, but I did notice some minor white `speckling', probably due to age deterioration.  The Dolby Digital 1.0 sound is quite good, but English subtitles are available for the hard of hearing.  The special features are surprising few, with only three trailers (none for this film), all William Castle films in Mr. Sardonicus (1961), Straight-Jacket (1964), and Homicidal (1961).  Cookieman108 
 I am a big fan of the author and first discovered "Diet for a Poisoned Planet" when the first edition was published in 1990.  I just read David Steinman's latest book "Safe Trip to Eden: Ten Steps to Save Planet Earth From the Global Warming Meltdown" and this is an excellent companion.   I am quite suspicious that two of the reviews below seems to be from the California Advisory Board's counter PR campaign to the first edition.  However, as a result of the information in this book, many raisin companies reduced or eliminated the spraying of DDT on raisins!  Here are some references on this PR campaign:  "Flying the Koop: A Surgeon General's Reputation On the Line." PR Watch, Volume 5, No. 4, 4th quarter 1998. Stauber J. & Rampton S.

 I have read and reviewed the book by Stephen King, and it was excellent. before I watched it, I found out that it mainly adapted the first story in the book. That was alright, for it was the longest and the best of the stories in the book. I watched it last night, and I loved it. It mainly stuck to the story on which it was based (The screenwritter to this film is William goldman who wrote the great adaptation of Stephen King's Misery). Sure, it got rid of the references to Stephen King's The Dark Tower book series, but that was perfectly fine. My guess for why they got rid of the links from that series is because no one has filmed them. Well anyways, the acting in this film is exceptional (especially by Anthony Hopkins and David Morse. The cinematograpy and music are well done too. I will recomend this to fans of Stephen King and of this kind of genre. I hope that someday the studios direct a sequel or sequels based on the other story segments in the book. They could film the second story (which is also the title story) and call it Hearts In Atlantis II. Then they can film the last three stories Blind Willie, Why We're In Vietnam, and Heavenly Shades Of Night are falling into one film and call it Hearts in atlantis III. We could have a Trilogy of movies based on the book. If they do it, I would pay to see it 
 Espresso Logic finds Chris Rea taking life a little less serious than on his last two releases.  The songs are generally more pop friendly and the lyrical commentary is brighter and more trival.  Sometimes that doesn't  work to good effect, like on "Julia" for example.  But Rea  maintains his moments of moody atmospherics, such as the dream-like intro  to "Espresso Logic" and on "Miles is a Cigarette," both  being fine songs. Rea should have made the Top 40 on some format or another  with "Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea" and the  spectacular riffery towards the end of that track.  Much the same could be  said for "Johnny needs a Fast Car."  If you only are familiar  with Rea's work through "The Road to Hell" and found that album  interesting, it would be worth your while to track this one down 
 In order to fully appreciate this book, I think you should temporarily suspend your feelings about Kissinger as a Secretary of State and consider him as Kissinger the historian. Once you've finished, you can them bring in all of what you know of his controversial career. I found this book extremely helpful and insightful. Kissinger goes through much of the history of "Western" (i.e. European) diplomacy, from the Peace of Westphalia to the fall of the Soviet Union (it was originally published in 1994, and hence is out of date, though two areas Kissinger predicted as being important have mainfested themselves-fundamentalist Islam and China). His thesis or perspective throughout is that international relations and diplomacy are in equilibrium when all nations strive to address properly their national interest and balance that against the national interest of their adversaries (this intepretation of international relations has often been called realism). Kissinger does not put much stock in the moral prounouncements of men like President Woodrow Wilson, who believe that peace is the norm, and not the exception of IR. He instead admires Teddy Roosevelt and Richard Nixon. Despite what you may think of the overarching framework, this is an excellent history covering every conceivable facet of diplomatic history. I was especially impressed with his chapters on World War II and Franklin Roosevelt (who is the President I most admire; I was surprised at the amount of credit Kissinger, who is always deemed a "conservative" gave to FDR, the quintessential liberal). The only downside to the book is its length (over 800 pages paperback) and Kissinger's writing style, which is filled with large words not suitable to every reading level. If, for example, you don't know what inchoate means, I would suggest having a dictionary handy. Overall, a good read for wanna be historians and international relations experts. 
 First, I would like to say, with a bit of trial and error, this is a very good product. Well worth the price. I want to comment on the great technical support from La Crosse, and the super customer support from Amazon. The first unit I received was faulty due to being calibrated wrong. Left La Crosse a voice mail and was called within 36 hours. Tried to trouble shoot to no avail. La Crosse followed up next day. E-mailed Amazon about issue, replacement was in mail the next day. Outstanding 
      Beverly Engel is a psychotherapist and recognized expert in the fields of relationships, women's issues, and abuse.  In her previous book, "Divorcing A Parent", she describes her own painful decision to divorce her mother because of continual abuse.  After she wrote that book, her mother bought it and read it.  Her mother then apologized to the author and changed her behavior, and they have since reconciled.  This book,  The Power of Apology, was then written, to encourage others to heal themselves and those they have hurt by apologizing, and to encourage the victim to try to accept the apology.       I frequently recommend this book in my  ministry, Luke 17:3 Ministries, for adult children of abusive or controlling birth-families.  It is very useful in teaching us to recognize a GENUINE apology which may open the door for a reconciliation and loving relationship, as opposed to a "fake" apology, which will usually only set us up for more hurt down the road.       The author explores some reasons why people won't apologize, such as pride, fear of giving up power, thinking an apology is a sign of weakness, etc. She teaches you how to ask for an apology.        She discusses the right way and wrong ways to apologize, meaningless or fake apologies, apologies without remorse, apologies  delivered through clenched teeth and bumbled apologies like the conditional apology ("I'm sorry, but...") , the half-apology ("I'm sorry you feel bad), and the apology in which the wrongdoer trivializes the damage he caused.       We are told the necessary ingredients in a meaningful apology are regret, responsibility, and remedy, and that the offender should make no excuses.        We are helped to accept apologies with forgiveness and some obstacles to forgiveness are discussed, such as anger, pain, fear of being hurt again, and pride.        The author distinguishes between spiritual forgiveness and human forgiveness, and makes the point that reconciliation and forgiveness are not the same.   She includes "When Sorry Isn't Good Enough", "When Expecting Forgiveness Can Be an Insult"," and "When Forgiveness Is Unhealthy."          The book talks about making amends, and healing your family when there has been an estrangement.  The Power of Apology teaches healing steps to transform all your relationships, and hopefully bring your family back together.       
 I actually decided to watch lone wolf and cub first but am going to have to sneak a few more of these in.    I guess I thought it was Chang Cheh who introduced us to these types of movies but I can see now that some of my favorite movies ever like one armed swordsman are just good ripoffs of Zatoichi.  This guy is wher it started.  Well, the wong fei-hong movies come first in terms of martial arts, but Zatoichi has to be the first person on screen you could really look up to because of the heroic deeds that he does.  Not just doing the good deeds, but the way he slices through everybody is beautiful. Being a kung fu fan I need a good final fight but wasn't really expecting one with how old this is but was pleasently surprised.    I can't believe I thought it was the chinese that started all this, but I was way wrong.  When Shintarô Katsu hit the screen, he may not have been the first but was far and away the best for it's time.  THE JAPANESE EVEN SEEM TO HAVE INVENTED TEH OPENING STAGED FIGHTING SEQUENCES!!!  The movie is anamorphically widescreened and when they say the picture is remastered Home Vision Entertainment is not lying one bit.    So I have to say that my first Zatoichi experience was breathtaking, funny, touching, and very exciting 
 Historical research is usually not the search for pure data, but the search for legitimacy.  Professor Whitelam protests, in his refined manner, the use of history "to validate modern political stances."  This book is about the politicization of history.  It does not intentionally engage in politics outside of the author's academic discipline.  However, the subject matter cannot help but appear more broadly political in our time, when Israel's affairs loom so large in American government and media discussions.  The title does inspire reactions in people with strong political feelings, some of whom very obviously do not read the book before making negative (even acerbic and wildly digressing) comments in order to discourage others from reading it.  Prof. Whitelam does not deny that Hebrew settlements existed in ancient times; rather he demonstrates in detailed examples that in some ways the archaeological record has been misinterpreted, or frankly shoe-horned, to fit literal Bible passages.  The primary offenders have been European Christian archaeologists and historians via whom "political and religious attitudes of modern scholarship conspire to obscure the ancient politics of the past."  There is no hatred of Israel or Israelis evident anywhere in the book.  The tone is consistently unemotional and scholarly.  The author did not set out to write about ancient Israel per se but about ancient Palestine, whose history has been ignored and silenced because of the pressure to preserve "an ancient Israel conceived and presented as the taproot of Western civilization."    I must add that Whitelam does not single out Palestine as a unique or special case of the politicization of history.  Consider this quote: "European nation states from the Industrial Revolution onwards constructed national histories to justify and idealize their positions in the world.  This is particularly true of Great Britain [whose] antiquarians and politicians found vivid illustrations of the people's unique 'national character' that explained and justified Great Britain's unique position in the world."  On nearly every page I found both -  - valuable data, such as a discussion of Pharaoh Merneptah's stele, which has the earliest mention of Israel outside of the Bible; and  - invaluable insights, such as the revelation that "supposed rational results of Western scholarship have been part of a complex network of ideas and associations which are tied to relationships of power."  I recommend reading The Invention of Ancient Israel with a copy of the Old Testament handy for reference.  Also, as you can imagine with an academic work that has a 15-page bibliography, a good dictionary will be vital to handle the vocabulary.  I like the Merriam-Webster Collegiate, in paperback or electronic form 
 This CD is a must have for all of you true romantics out there. It provides a beautiful sonic backdrop that is perfect for moments when you want to escape life's stresses. Michael's ability to create beautiful melodies entwined with electronic processing, makes for a rich sonic tapestry that is at times sad, yet stirring nonetheless. "I have loved you for a thousand lifetimes" is a standout, with a gorgeous melody. It is also the song for which the video was created. Outstanding! I thoroughly enjoyed this CD 
 Where have the Public Enemy's, the NWA's, and the BDP's gone? They've all been buried by a music industry that prefers to push music that seeks to destroy, not uplift, a culture. It is not a full length album of new material but one song off this cd is worth an entire album of P-Diddy / Eminem bling-bling blathering. Think about it folks, this is the root of Hip-Hop. An art form that sought to uplift and empower a people. When Chuck D raps about the current state of our society, he knows exactly what he's talking about. Only the Definitive Jux crew are on par with Chuck these days, a testament to the sad state of pop music. The jams on this album are tight and the message is clear. Few other rappers are actually standing up for truth in Hip-Hop and PE is back in full effect, Boyee 
 Professor Nasr's work on Islamic subjects is generally characterised not merely by its academic and still hospitable style but further by an indepth understanding and experience of spirituality as such in its most universal  and applicable sense.  In the book "Islamic art and Spirituality"  he cover the highlight themes of traditional art, architecture,  calligraphy, poetry, prose literature, esoterism, piety, etc, as it  developed in Islamic lands.  Of special interest is the chapter on the  Persian poet Jalal al-Din Rumi.  I warmly recommend the present work to  students of religious studies as well as religios seekers from all  traditions 
 I honestly had a very hard time putting this book down and found I got very little accomplished until I completed reading the story. Sheldon outdoes himself with a tale of intrigue, suspense and hopeless romance.  Enter, Jennifer Parker, smart and talented young attorney (fresh out of law school) with only the best of intentions as she begins her career as an attorney in the NYC District Attorney's office.  From the start, DA, Robert Di Silva, takes a dislike to her, for no good or apparent reason ever told.  Jennifer then gets unknowingly involved in a dangerous chain of events associated with one of the top Mafia families in NYC.  It seems that no matter how hard she tries, a chain of bad events in her life seems to befall her, leading her to make decisions that put her on the wrong side of the law.  She also finds herself hopelessly in love (as is he) to a mild-mannered, honest, for the most part, in all areas of his "married" life, Attorney Adam Warner, climbing his way from US Senator to the Oval Office!  My only complaint with this story is the end.  The book sucks us into a plot that is unbelievably hard to put down and then when you expect the big bang-up conclusion, the story seems to just come to an end quietly.  The fact that the action became so intense as the Mafia set out to destroy not only Jennifer, but Adam as well (with an extremely "cliff hanging" development), and then boom it was all over.  The main characters' stories were very meekly put to rest.  I was truly expecting a big finale, leaving the reader with a more comfortable understanding as to the fate of the main players.  It seemed to be too neatly packaged and put away.  All in all, however, I would definitely recommend this book as a very good read.  
 Oliver Stone is truly one of the greatest contemporary filmmakers of our time. That's why I look forward to reading this book 
 Typical banter from a low life ambulance chaser. A lawyer who still whines that he could not get OJ off. But this is typical of most leftists. 
 This book is a series of talks given at "Life as a Western Buddhist Nun" conference in Bodhgaya 1996.  p. 15: "This volume explains the purpose of monastic ordination & the relationship of an individual nun to the monastic community of monks & of nuns, to lay Buddhists, & to society in general."  p. 16: "With increased inter-religious dialog, people realize that knowledge of others' traditions enriches their own spiritual practice" & p. 312: "Study, reflection, & mindfulness of the precepts are helpful for monastics & laypeople alike."  More specifically, p. 16: "Knowing the precepts can make us more mindful of our behavior."  This book is entertaining due to its many stories of the origins of the precepts as well as the author's convincing presentations on their whys & wherefores.  Per p. 17: "Although the social environment has changed since the Buddha's time, basic human nature has not" & p. 305: "The Buddha's advice is not rigid dogma, but has various meanings & methods of implementation according to the person & the circumstances."  Ven. Wu Yin provides numerous examples relating directly to the precepts, reminiscent of Knowledge Management's dictum that knowledge = information in context.  Indeed, she categorizes & summarizes the precepts, converting the data into information that can be readily assimilated.  Further, she identifies precepts whose wording may be confusing--p. 292: "In this precept & the precept prohibiting Bhikshunis from eating garlic, the linguistic formulation of the precept does not express its meaning directly" & those that have been adapted to social contexts (pp. 172-9: living alone; swimming, sleeveless shirts, robe colors, etc.).  The historical context pp. 190, 284, & 291 demonstrates that precepts respond to the law of the land.  While only one difference between Theravada & Mahayana is given (p. 294: "learner in prajika" is Mahayana Only), the book is not meant to be all inclusive.  She does demonstrate how advanced the Buddha's thinking was (e.g. pp. 308-10: disputes/conflict resolution-even including arbitration).  While there are precepts that differ for men & women (e.g. p. 144: Bhikshus can be ordained 7 times, but Bhikshunis only once), the Buddha advanced gender equality overall, saying p. 312 of the 1st Bhikshuni upon her death: "This Bhikshuni has fulfilled the meaning of being a great human being."  As Ven. Wu Yin ably points out, "Being a great human being is not related to gender; it depends on caring about the well-being of all our fellow sentient beings. 
 I used this text and the SelfTest Test Engine (PKO-002) - I took the Project+ exam today (10/11/2005) and passed - No Problem!  I'm definetly adding this book to my reference shelf.  Thanks for an excellent treatment of the subject matter and subject exam Mr. Phillips 
 Truely speaking, this is a very hilarious episode. Must see for every one 
 Ann Margaret and co-stars do a good job in this film. After watching this movie, one gets a great feeling about how important family really is.  Great for all ages to watch this and appreciate how special a family is and how much love and care it takes to maintain family ties. 
 Daniel Silva has taken his protaganist right onto the front pages of the worlds' newspapers with his best work to date 
 Regardless of how disenchanted one might become with its politics, its politicians, or its policies, a film like this restores one's faith in what our country has to offer its young people.  Even if you happen to think the sort of ruthless competition that goes on in this film is another strike against us as a country, there's still something very moving about a child being nationally recognized and celebrated for the size of her vocabulary rather than her socio-economic background, social skills, or appearance.  In a place saturated by the influence of beautiful people (valued often for nothing else), its refreshing to see the child with the braces and the bad haircut hold up a trophy that comes up to his chest, and walk away with enough money to see him through his first year of college.    Beyond that, this movie is delightfully nerve-wracking!  Suspenseful and full of surprises, its as entertaining as it is important.      
 This book will show how to turn a cold clinical facility into a warm, caring home.  A place families want to visit, not make exuses to avoid.  This truly can be revolutional.  Anyone placing a person into a nursing  facility should make sure they have Edenized 
 Filmed in the Montreal area during that period of time in the 90s when it was economically advantageous to shoot movies in Quebec, Screamers is a loose adaptation of Philip K. Dick's short story "Second Variety".  It is a throw-back to the days when campy sci-fi was still a marketable genre, it feels more late 80s than mid 90s. Peter Weller is seems to fit comfortably into this genre with just enough over-acting to not compromise his integrity.    Personally, I really loved the scenes that involved the screamers themselves: mechanical devices reminiscent of rats sporting razor sharp saw-blades in their heads.  They are programmed to eliminate the "enemy" in this post apocalyptic setting, but, in the tradition of all great sci-fi, SOMETHING GOES TERRIBLY WRONG(spoken in classic, cinematic threateningly low voice).  All to say that many will end up with severed limbs.  Definately a fun movie to watch, despite its lacking somewhat in the second act.  It turns out that two of my wife's cousins were extras in the final act of the movie when dozens of "davids" come marching out of the compound.  Makes the whole thing that much more enjoyable for me.    Scott    
 Outstanding. A classis example of Good vs Evil.  Plenty of Magic, hate, love, betrayal and action. The setting is dark and gloomy, like the Black company books, but in a way similar to Feists books.  A world half covered  by a dark shadow in which evil wizards,vampires,trolls,goblins and their  evil human allies strive to consume all that is in their path. The forces  of good, lead by the Hasturs,who are powerful magicians, constantly battle  for survival against overwhelming odds. The war is fought on many fronts in  different kingdoms by brave men and women. I have been fortunate enough to  have owned and read the other two Dark Border novels, King Chondos's Ride  and A Gathering of Heroes. This series is fantastic and does not get the  credit it deserves. Too bad that these books are very difficult to find,  but they are worth the trouble of finding 
 For years I experienced the great New York restaurants I could rarely afford vicariously through the sensuous, witty, spirited reviews of Gael Greene in New York magazine...so it was a fun, and also surprisingly moving to read about her life during those years.  I felt I was reliving the seventies and eighties through her memories of the restaurants that came and went.  She is as funny and self-mocking as she always was. I love her bite. I love her candor. I love her proses. This is not just a read for foodies, it's a romp through the culture of three decades -- from young Elvis to Citymerals-on-Wheels. I meant to read a chapter before I went to bed and couldn't put it down till I finished 
 Ballentine brings synthesis to integrating the historic healing systems of the world. I am an alternative practitioner specializing in bodywork and the mind-soul connection. He says plainly what I have struggled for years to explain to my clients who truely seek wholistic healing. It's all in there and it's definitely all connected. This writing allows the reader to extract information and gain understanding in an applicable manner. I refer to it often and always discover something new and timely to aide me and my clients 
 Very good transaction.  Received quickly.  CD is in great condition.  excellent.    AAAAAA+++++ 
 These book will help the executives of your company or under your command to climb cultural walls and make successful negotiations with businessman's overseas. Also it will help understanding other cultures and becoming more culturally humble: much of the problems we have today as humans rely on the egocentric way we see the world, a lot of problems would disappear if we could just sit on a table and learn the way others think. A most read for international sales managers and embassy personal. Enjoy 
 I think that this was an excellent book. It gave me a lot more information about Tupac that i never knew about 
 This is a good program for people who want to get in and stay in shape without spending half of their life at the gym. You do need to spend some time building your own program sheets using the info in the book. I also bought his "Ultimate New York Body Plan" (it reflects on my obsessive streak that I'd buy both!)and I think that program would be difficult to implement for most ordinary mortals. Buy this one 
 From a time when the studio executive could make or break a career and often held equally important gatherings in their homes. A blast from the past. The ecletic mix of archetypes, funky interiors and inuendo reminds you of a time when producers still let an audience read between the lines.  So sit down with a cornish game hen and watch this movie.  
 I watched this program in it's entirety when it aired live on PBS and was thrilled by the incredible lineup of wonderful performers who gave equally wonderful performances! However, many of the night's most breathtaking performances were left off this CD completely! Wynton Marsalis' opening with "A'in no" ...Peter Cincotti's original "Bring Back New Orleans"...the list goes on. I must say I'm disappointed to see that so many stellar performances were not included and I'm puzzled as to why 
 Treasure Island  By Robert Louis Stevenson.   I am a twelve year old reviewer that is in the 6th grade. I enjoy fantasy adventure books the most. I have quite a good memory for the details in books that I enjoy. If  books  are not of interest to me I have trouble getting through them and then I forget about what's happening. I can never forget about a good book. I always go back to check  out a good book over and over again until someone will buy it for me. I like building my own library because then I will always have the book I want there to read. I stay up late at night reading and if I'm lucky I might stay up the whole night reading. I am someone that does not enjoy looking up words in the dictionary so I just read on and try to figure it out.  Treasure Island was not a book I stayed up all night reading, but I still enjoyed reading it. It hand the adventure I wanted, it hand mystery, and it hand a lot of  sword fighting. 	A strange pirate named Captain Flint walks into the Admiral Ben Bow Inn where Jim Hawkins and his mother own, live and work. Little does Jim know that this man will change his life forever. Captain Flint has a treasure map that another pirate named Long John Silver wants more then anything in the world. This map will lead the Long John to the treasure. When Flint died Jim found the treasure map. Soon after he finds the map pirates attack his house and Jim must flee. When Jim goes looking for the treasure he has to work for a mysterious cook named Long John Silver. When they set upon there journey to the island in search of the treasure Jim gets put to the most challenging tasks. When they see the island Jim gets betrayed by Long John Silver and his cronies who want the treasure more than anything. When Jim gets on shore he must fight pirates for the treasure.  As Jim is running through the jungle he finds a man named Ben who was marooned on the island. Ben knows his way around and he may help lead him to the treasure. Jim might lose his life looking for the treasure.  	I thought that the author had a very interesting way of writing. He would go all out on the exciting parts. I think he made the  most important parts of the story sound dreadfully dull. This was a book that I would not stay up all night reading. At some parts I felt like just closing the book and throwing it away. Then he would pick it up again and make it exciting and it made me want to continue. One thing I liked was how I could relate with the character, Jim, at certain points in the book. Something I thought was good was how the author made you use your imagination for the island and how you could picture Ben, the man, and how he lived on the island all alone. The author expressed Jim emotions very well. I could tell when he was scared,  sad and mad.  I would recommend this book 
 The Wire is easily one of the greatest, if not the greatest, cinematic pieces of art ever.  Potential WATCHERS know this however, this is a show that requires a significant amount of commitment; do not expect to sit back and be entertained.  The show challenges the watcher and requires reflection on an array of intellectual levels.  At a minimum, the reasonably bright should have no problem connecting the scattered dots The Wire's creators masterfully placed for viewers.  The dull on the other hand will only see a show with cops and a group of unintelligible thugs while searching for the quick entertainment fix that can only come from brainless shows like Cops, CSI, or The Shield.     
 This book is excellent for those new to building or renovating and need to know what to do and say and who to say and do it to. The author does an excellent job setting out the relationships, processes, chronologies, and thinking for dealing with other parties all the way from dreaming about doing a remodel/build to finishing it. This is exactly the book I was looking for -- not a technical manual about building, but a handy reference about my role as owner and how I can or should interact with the architect, lender, general contractor, etc. to get the home or addition I want. 
 This is a collection of very mello, soulful songs. The type of music you listen to when your in a mello mood. I also feel they are very orginal.  Tracks 2 8 9 & 11 are my favorites.  Out of all 4 of Ms. Ardens Cd's "Happy" is by far my favorite... but time for Mercy makes you think about the more simple things in life...the type of things we take for granted.  I see her in concert whenever she comes to town.  I wish she would perform more tracks from this CD.  Jann if your reading this...I can't wait for the next one.  Don't keep your fans waiting to long 
 This movie is downright hilarious the whole way through. In this story, Ralphie, who is 9 years old, must convince his parents and teacher what the perfect gift for christmas is. At first, he hesitates, and when he asks, its always the same answer: "Oh, no. you'll shoot you're eye out!" Raphie stops at nothing to get what he wants. He would not even listen to the teacher when she gave him a C on his "what i want for christmas" paper and told him it's a bad idea. He didnt even listen to who he thought was the real santa.  The funniest scenes in this movie are : 1. when ralphie and his friends get chased by 2 bullies  2. when his father gets a lamp shaped like a leg and ralphie's mother "accidentally" breaks it,  3. when the dogs next door take the dinner turkey  4. when raphie find out what the little orphan annie code was only a commercial for ovaltine  5. when ralphie gets soap put in his mouth when he says the F-dash-dash-dash word(it is censored by fudge)  6. when santa pushes him down the slide of doom.   My whole family always said, "it isnt Christmas without watching this movie". If you're dying for christmas to come, why not spend time watching this on tv? You'll never miss it, it comes on all day both on christmas and christmas eve 
 a light hearted but still kind of sas movie. poweful 
 This is very good information that is to follow.  He has done a good job on focusing on wellness and how to achieve this.  I like most because anyone can do it and it does not take a Doctorate degree to follow.  Thanks for putting this together.

 What a fun game. The graphics are good. The stereo sound is awesome. There are plenty of tracks... and it's got multi-player. We've had a blast with this one. High quality fun from Nintendo 
 I enjoy this collection of plays from Mr Eugene O'Neill (1888-1953).  He is considered the first dramatist from the US and is also the first to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.  First, I must write that this edition from the LIBRARY OF AMERICA is beautiful.  It has a sewn binding, flexible yet strong binding boards covered with a closely woven, rayon cloth and a ribbon bookmark attached to the spine.  This volume covers the period 1932-43, marking Mr O'Neill's most well-known work.  My favourites are A LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT and THE ICEMAN COMETH.  I also enjoy the the Irish flavour of A TOUCH OF the POET.  ALDJIN is auto-biographical, as is also A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN.  ALDJIN benefits from an eye-witness perspective which makes the characters extremely poignant.  I feel an eery shiver as I read the drama, knowing the playwright's life.  Like his character Edmund, Mr O'Neill left Princeton after his first year; went to sea, searched for gold in South America and haunted the waterfront bars in Buenos Aires, Liverpool and New York.  He drank heavily.  The other characters reflect his life also.  His father was a successful actor who played but one role, the Count of Monte Cristo, and never became a more serious actor.  His mother used morphine and his older brother was an alchoholic.  All three died between 1920-23.  This play is such a vivid "photograph" it sometimes is painfull for me to read, but at the same time a great reward.  If you are interested in dramatists from the US, or in gritty, realistic plays about characters on the the margins of society, this collection will be interesting to you 
 At first I didn't like it at all but it takes some getting use to and now I love it.  As I said "the best yet" 
 Harper Neeld's book is an incredibly detailed compilation of the author's personal experiences in the sudden loss of her young husband, interviews with other widows/widowers, and discussions of phases of the grieving process.  I would rate this book highly, along with one of my favorite grief authors, thanatologist Alan Wolfelt (e.g. Understanding Your Grief books).  Harper Neeld seamlessly combines her painful, personal story with factual, helpful guidelines to create one of the best written boooks I have read on widowhood.  I used the introspective questions with my grief therapist, who liked the book so much that she borrowed it and used it for a class she taught.   
 as a relative newcomer to books on our intelligence community, Body of Secrets is an excellent choice for those of us who are looking for a substantive, easily comprehended history of the NSA, as well as the juicy scoops mentioned by Mr. Steele below.  Especially interesting are the challenges that the NSA faces from the mutiplying growth of telecommunications- i.e. in fiber optic networks, which have created a shift from our traditional tether-based eavesdropping activity.  Alot of food for thought here, and a very satisfying read 
 Although Proust was most obviously indulging himself when he wrote this book, he was also brilliant. If the book doesn't speak to you, so be it. It doesn't mean you're stupid, so you don't have to be defensive and call the people who enjoyed the book pretentious. They like what they like, and if they're pretending, that's their problem. There were a few moments when I was bored, but more moments in which I was absolutely breathless, touched, pierced. If you feel like the book is talking directly to you, then you got what you were supposed to. If you enjoy the language, enjoy it to your heart's content, it's pretty (though translated, so I don't know why people complain as if it was intended for english syntax). If you want to tear you eyeballs out, put it down.  I would recommend it wholeheartedly. 
 A fantastic story of what are now the Great Plains states, when they were covered by the Western Interior Seaway of the Late Cretaceous, some 65 to 90 or so million years ago. This book relates the fascinating expeditions of the great "bone hunters" during the early days of modern paleontology, when Kansas and other interior states were out in the comparative hinterlands, and the jouneys of these rugged individualists could occasionally be fraught with hardship. They were rewarded with an incredible array of some of the fabulous creatures of antiquity; giant mosasaurs, ancient turtles the size of automobiles, great flying reptiles, early toothed birds of the seas, and giant sharks, all found in the chalk beds that bear mute testimony to the existence of this ancient and wondrous place from a time out of mind.   The book is well illustrated, loads of pictures of the fossils in full reconstruction and disarticulated. The color plates by Dan Varner are maybe too few, but they're stunning, to say the very least.   The text may be a bit weighty for only the youngest of enthusiasts, but all others who have an interest in the great marine fossils of the Mesozoic should definitely get their hands on this book. I already consider it a classic; it really is that good 
 The great writing skills of James B Stewart can be enjoyed in all of his books and certainly also in this one. He book reads almost like a thriller, but it is always clear that Stewarts has his facts right and well documented and got the criminals dead to rights.  The book is structured as the first part being seen from the side of Boesky, Milken etc and the second part from the law enforcement, which is another feature that makes it very exiting to read 
 I will admit I am a huge fan of Altman, but I love this film on its own.  Visually it is stunning: the photograhy and lighting are a wonder.  The film itself is like a canvas for some beautiful art.  The perfomances are excellent - watching the love and great conflict between the brothers is riveting.  This is one of Altman's unsung gems.  Highly recommended 
 I was vary impressed by Chaosium's first collection of Machen's work, which was THE THREE IMPOSTERS AND OTHER STORIES.  "The Three Imposters" was a narrative of interwoven tales describing a paranoid man's encounter with three people who are not who they seem.  Each is an excellent story in its own right, but the whole is greater than the sum.  Considering the success of the first volume, I decided to try the second.  If you don't know Arthur Machen, he wrote "weird" stories in the late Victorian - Edwardian period.  They all have a distinctly British flavor that reminds me of M.R. James.   Most of his stories are set in his homeland of Wales, where something of charm and magic remains beneath the hills.  By necessity he began to write for a newspaper later in life, and a fictional account he wrote for the paper on spectral guardians for British troops in WWI became the "Angel of Mons" stories you can still read about today.  THE WHITE PEOPLE AND OTHER STORIES is an eclectic collection of Machen's weird stories, his poetry, and some of his later writings for newspapers.  Despite being a fan of Lovecraft, I have always wondered what HPL meant when he consistently referred to a protagonist hinting at things unknown (to others), dropping outlandish names and meaning more than is said.  Well, he borrowed this technique from Machen's "The White People", a story made to look like a young girl's diary.  Her journal is just a collection of thoughts and experiences, and many things are hinted at as reminders to herself which we will never understand, but these brief glimpses are horrible enough.  Machen's poetry collection, "Ornaments in Jade", also struck me as weirdly beautiful but also indecipherable.  More is unsaid than said, hinted at than revealed.  I felt that it relied on some code, a common frame of reference, that has been lost over the course of a hundred years.  Perhaps his contemporaries felt the same way.  There are other interesting compositions in this volume.  "The Red Hand" brings back the investigating protagonists from "The Three Imposters," with a not-too-dissimilar plotline. "A Fragment of Life" seemed to be a glimpse into the everday life from a time long ago.  It is almost novel length and simply describes the common affairs of a couple in turn-of-the-century London.  If this sounds uninteresting, you'll have to read for yourself how a masterful author makes common situations uncommon.  Finally, there are a series of stories written from Machen's journalistic days.  Besides a group that are all related to the "Angel of Mons" category, there are a few others that describe other supernatural phenomena and are written in the first-person.  They are so straight-forward and sincere that sometimes it is difficult to remember they are meant to be fiction.  Machen's overarching theme is that the material, everday world is merely a shadow of reality and that true living must penetrate that shadow to see the glories beyond.  This is something he truly believed and it is evident in all of his stories.  The reason these stories continue to frighten and thrill is that we desire to see what is beyond the veil, but we are also afraid of what we will find. 
 This was my first Amitav Ghosh book, so I didn't know what to expect. As it turned out, I enjoyed the book immensely.  I was completely transported to the mysterious Sundarbans, the land of tigers and ever-changing islands -- the "ragged fringe" of India. The story itself is quite absorbing and the characters are well developed. He touches upon themes like man's relationship with the river and latent feelings of social class differences that one imagines that one has quelled, but does not appear to be preachy. 
 Thank you Isa!  I finally feel like my hard earned money has been well spent.  I own tons of vegetarian/vegan cookbooks; in fact I think I am pushing a world record or something.  Normally I am so disappointed in all the `new, gotta have it' cookbooks.  The day I got this book I immediately went to the baking section and tried out some of the muffins and cupcakes.  I always find that the excellence of a vegan cookbook can be measured by quality of the baking section.  If you are vegan or happen to like to munch on vegan baked goods, you know how hard it is to make a great vegan anything that is baked.  The better the end product, I figure the better the quality of the rest of the entrees, sides, etc. included in the book.  I am happy to report, Isa hasn't let me down yet.    The only somewhat negative thing is that a lot of the recipes call for slightly expensive ingredients, but again, Isa hasn't let me down.   I know from experience, if you email her and ask her how you can replace something, say maple syrup, in a specific recipe she will write you back with an answer quickly.   
 for the last year or so ive told everyone i remotely know to watch or listen to something monty python.it seems like everyone either says its not funny at all or its the funniest thing theyve ever seen.and even though cleese's "how to irritate people" isnt directly related to monty python, the type of humor is still the same.so ive said this to warn you that before you go and buy it, i would DEFINITELY rent or barrow some python stuff first.in case you were wondering,i loved the movie and am going to add it to my daily python cycle 
 The classic adventure story of The Wind in the Willows is set in early twentieth-century Britain and features the lovable characters of the Water Rat, Mole, Toad, and Badger. Rat lives in the river bank and is totally fond of his little place. Mole lives underground and wants to see a lot more of the Big World. It's no surprise that Rat becomes his mentor and best friend. Both animals do have one constant worry: Toad. Toad, who owns Toad Hall, the biggest building in the neighbourhood, is extremely rich and conceited. But both friends know that beneath his vain faade, Toad means well. But all their effort in vain, Toad gets in a big mess when he buys an automobile. Mole does not know what he can still do to avoid Toad killing himself and others, so he calls in the help of the intelligent and respected Badger, who lives in the Wild Wood.  The major theme of this classic story is the struggle between the noisy, common way of life of the Wild Wooders, like the stoats and the weasels, and the quiet and genteel River-Bankers. Toad is a lovable rebel who does not fit well into either camp. With this setting Kenneth Grahame delivers a lovable and enjoyable fairytale for the younger readers, but has not neglected to fill the story with enough witty sidetracks to address a much wider audience. It is not without reason that this book was voted one of the best children's books ever.   The Wind in the Willows started as a series of stories shared by Grahame in letters to his only child, Alastair, born in 1899. It took until 1908 before these stories were first published. After almost more than one-hundred years this book still manages to capture its own place in the hearts of thousands of people. The Wind in the Willows is simply a must read for everyone who is still young at heart 
 This is the eighth in the naval action adventures of Captain Jack Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin, and, except for the last twenty pages, there's a surprising lack of action. Jack is doing a turn commanding a seventy-four-gun ship of the line in the blockade of Toulon on the French Mediterranean coast, a mostly cold, dreary, boring, enervating sort of warfare. The admiral he admires is wasting away from overwork and the vice-commander, Jack's old nemesis, tries to use him in a diplomatic feint which turns into a debacle, damaging his reputation among those of his crew who don't really know him and even making him doubt himself. Stephen is busy behind the scenes, sharing the secret limelight with Prof. Graham, an expert in all things Turkish. Finally, in a narratively somewhat disconnected incident, they are sent off to the Turkish-held Greek islands to undermine the French among the local beys and pashas. While it makes for interesting reading in depicting another, rather less dashing, side of the naval war against Napoleon, this volume is uncomfortably episodic and not at all one of O'Brian's best. I would definitely not recommend this as one's first novel in the series 
 The City of Falling Angels, by John Berendt, is an excellent book.  The evocative prose really puts you in Venice.  The book is literally a feast for the senses; in that the vivid descriptions of the sights, sounds, and smells of Venice are described in great detail.  The book which centers around the burning of the famous opera house La Fenice, is much, much more than s imple mystery.  We are introduces to various characters and political machinations involving Venice.  I found the book very readable and enjoyable.  I highly recommend this book.  I have yet to read Berendt's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, but this book has inspired me to do just that.  A solid 5 star read. 
 The 'Argonautica' was written in the 3rd Century B.C. and depicts the pre-Homeric voyage of Jason to the land of Colchis in search of the Golden Fleece: a golden lamb's fleece brought by the gods that can work miracles.  Unlike Homer's poetry of the Iliad and the Odyssey, this work was written in the Hellenic age and therefore focuses much more on action instead of poetic recitals and extensive character developments common to the Classical/Homeric period. Nevertheless, this work offers a great adventure of heroes, gods, and beasts that make it a pleasurable reading experience for adults and children alike.  Jason is the lawful heir of Thessally and seeks to avenge his father's death against the usurper, Pelias.  In an effort to keep him at bay, Pelias convinces Jason that he must go on a perilous journey to Colchis to obtain the Golden Fleece before he can claim the throne of Thessally.  Eager to claim his kingdom, Jason calls upon all of the greatest of Greek champions to join him on his quest.  Requisitioning the ship 'The Argos' for the voyage, Jason is accompanied by a crew of Greece's greatest heroes and demi-gods such as Hercules, Castor, Polydeuces, and Odysseus' father, Laertes.  After crossing many perils under the protection of Hera, the Argos reaches Colchis on the other side of the world (present day Turkey on the shore of the Black Sea.)  Deceiving King Aeetes, Jason runs off with the Golden Fleece and the king's daughter Medea to return to Greece in triumph.  This is a great adventure covering the heroic age of Greece a generation before the time of the Iliad and the Odyssey.  The novel is, as typical of the Hellenic novel, fast paced on plot with only minimal character studies.  Unlike the Iliad, this work was a novel meant to be read as opposed to being orally recited as poetry.  A novel that's fun to read for itself or to study Greek history and mythology.  A fun story for adults and children alike 
 Our 6-year-old son just loves this game!  It was super easy to assemble, easy to learn how to play, and the games go by fairly quickly and are exciting.  Plus it doesn't make all those noises that almost all the new, electronic toys make.  It seems pretty durable and well-made and we're very happy with what we got for the price.  
 If Harry Potter Ran General Electric is a bridge between the fantasy world of J.K Rowling's imagination and the world that business and professional people face every day. Both Rowling and author and public philosopher Tom Morris present us pictures of the ethical realities that both the young Harry and the rest of must address in order to be successful without losing our integrity.  Morris's book is more intentionally focused on leadership than his previous books. Whether you own a small business or staff a cubicle in a global corporation, there is something here for you. This isn't a formulaic approach to leadership. There is no leadership matrix revealed here, except that leadership is "always fundamentally a relational, interpersonal role"(p.152). Each chapter explores insights from the Harry Potter stories that illuminate the nature of leadership. Having spent two decades engaged with leaders and their development, I find Morris' perspective is right on the money. That perspective is that great leaders like Harry Potter and the headmaster of Hogwarts School, Albus Dumbledore, display the qualities of "high competence and deep character." (p.156). It is the deep character side of leadership that If Harry Potter Ran General Electric describes.   I've already bought two copies to give to young professionals who will be greatly encouraged by Morris' work.  This is a book to share, discuss and celebrate 
 Pretty good WW II tale of Japanese submarines, ciphers, secrecy, disinformation, misunderstandings, personal loyalties strained, a cargo of Yakuza gold, a German renegade. . . quite a potent mix.  Taut and fast-moving: will likely encourage you to read some of his other books (I'm going to). . . though not perhaps, as the dust-jacket suggests, "will have you looking up your nearest naval recruiter" - that's a stretch, I think! (Anyway, I served my Navy time already! 
 I LOVE THIS SET!!! it is well worth the money, don't wait get it..I promise you won't regret it 
 Content thought provoking and intellectually stimulating. Must have for the scientifically and inquisitive minded 
 Must reading for anyone planning a trip to Australia, or who just likes a teriffic descrption of this far-off land by a master storyteller who writes with self-depricating humor 
 This is one of those books I put on my wish list after running across it in a bookstore shortly after its release.  I then sat back and waited for the theoretical eccentric millionaire who reads wish lists and randomly buys things for people... and sure enough, the book was mine within a few weeks.  I have to admit up front that I simply was not around when most of the stories in this book took place, especially those relating to Wallach's life on the stage in the 1940s through 1960s.  In fact, I'd never even heard of most of those plays, except perhaps in passing; I know him best from "The Godfather Part III", and (randomly) from the audiobook of Stephen King's "Insomnia".  As the book's anecdotes essentially end in 1967, Wallach does not cover this ground.  I put the book on my wish list simply because I wanted to know more about the guy, and to learn more about an era I missed out on.  The book's tone is set by the prologue, in which Wallach sets out to research the role of gangster Albert Anastasia for a guest appearance in a TV series, and learns that he has a much closer connection with the crime boss's family than he suspected.  Several chapters then detail Wallach's Jewish upbringing in sepia-toned Brooklyn (just six miles from where two of my grandparents were doing the same thing in East New York).  I found myself equally captivated by Wallach's stories of growing up, and his tales of working on an impressive body of theatrical and film work.  Entire chapters are given over to "The Misfits" and "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly".  Wallach spends lots of time discussing his (often better-known) co-stars, ranging from Clark Gable to Marlon Brando to Sir John Gielgud to a very young Alan Arkin.  No-one is insulted; particularly warm, extended looks at Marilyn Monroe and Clint Eastwood are featured.  The tone is very pleasant and inviting.  Written in a very simple, direct writing style, with no credited co-author, this autobiography will not require much of your time, but will leave you with lots of anecdotes to re-tell.  Based on the time frame presented, a sequel is theoretically in the offing.  I will update my wish list accordingly 
 I absolutely love Atlantis. From Ronon Dex, to Sheppard, and to all the faces. I'd cry if Atlantis was cancelled. Seriously though, Steve should have never have died, he should also have been put in command of SG1. Can you imagine that..."Why Steve, welcome to Earth...you're welcome to live out your life, if you only feed in self defense on enemies...'kay? Oh, you're also in charge of Sg1. :P" But seriously, the Wraith make this show so awesome. From Steve to Bob to Edward, to Gordon and Alexander, to Michael and Eric (by far James's best performance yet).  The Wraith make this show what it is. But one thing??? Why don't we have Before I Sleep? Seriously, you have no idea how irked I am at that, since I began watching in S.2.12.  Anyways, I think Atlantis totally pwns SG1 
 I'm a person that is in love with the IDEA of radio, but I almost never listen to it because most of what I can get is garbage. Aside from the minimal NPR programming that my local PBS station carries and a couple shows on my local college radio station, there is nothing that I can bear to listen to in my area. The scratchy old crooner station I used to listen to was turned into a right wing talk show station, and all of the other stations here either have obnoxious and derogatory hosts, are filled with blaring advertisements, or else play the same damn songs over and over until you begin to hate every one of them. If I had to listen to this junk every day for a year, I'd complain too - at least Ms. Vowell is funny when she does it 
 My 2 year old daughter loves the movie Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and asks to watch it all day long.  I will often offer the soundtrack instead, and she will dance and sing along to all her favorite songs. 
 This was my first Rita Mae & Sneaky Pie mystery. I don't recommend starting with this one, because there are so many characters (both human and animal) and they take a while to keep sorted. Nevertheless once I really got into it, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Somehow a cozy mystery is very comfortable, and this book satisfied me thoroughly in that respect.  Still, it does ask you to suspend belief in so many ways! Not just the talking animals, but the whole set-up of Crozet (this is my first to read, but it's obviously a murder capital). And there is the idiocy of the main character at the end of the book as she confronts the murderer - done in such a way that the animals can play a role. A cozy of this nature can never reach great literature, hence only four stars. But a very enjoyable four stars, and I will be reading more by these authors 
 I've been around stomp boxes for a few years now (I worked at 4 Guitar Centers and was consistently the 'go-to' guy in the guitar accessories/effects department) and have had a chance to hear good natural sounding botique type pedals and really compressed not so great pedals.  For me, this motivated me to get into building stompboxes.  The book is really easy to follow.  Topics covered include: * Tools to have in your electronics lab * Straight forward schematics and projects * Concepts of electronics * Component overviews  Be warned:  This book is not intended to teach the mathematics and calculations down to a component level.  It touches on basic ideas but in order to understand this book's contents, it might be beneficial to have some prior exposure to electronics to really understand it (ie: schematically literate, able to assemble circuits, etc...).  Overall, an amazing value!  After reading online reviews, I understand why this book is a standard in hobbyist's and professional's workbenches :) 
 It is always interesting to see how different cultures handle the same medium.  Plus any book with this many pictures and creative minds displayed is a winner with me.  The colors are great too.  It's actually overwhelming and I can't flip through the whole book in one sitting because there are so many examples to see.  I'm no graffiti expert, but it's great to see how people choose to modify their surroundings with color and imagery 
 Absolutely hilarious!  Eddie at his best and the animals are superb!  A must-see follow up to Dr. Dolittle!  Add it to your collection for years of laughs 
 If you remember your chemistry, C6H12O6 is the formula for Glucose, the simplest of sugars.  So it is with this album, which is quite simply, a simple, sweet pop album from British girl group Girls Aloud.  Girls Aloud was formed in 2002 as a result of a TV talent show, but unlike many other reality TV performers, they have been very successful with eleven Top 10 singles in the UK, and all three of their albums hitting the charts on release.  This one is their third album, with huge first single "Biology", and second single "See the Day" (a cover song) both going UK Top 10. "Whole Lotta History", a heartstring-tugging slow ballad may be the next single released.  "Wild Horses" has a great intro, then switches into a bouncy dance number, and is one of the songs where they sound like the Spice Girls. No filler material here, but many of the songs sound alike.  With this kind of Chemistry, the new formula is: Glucose(Pop) = Nadine + Sarah + Nicola + Cheryl + Kimberly (Girls Aloud)  Be sure to play it loud!!!  Amanda Richards, January 28, 2006 
 A music teacher friend recommended this book for my son, and before wrapping it I checked it out. I don't know music, but this book seems like a great way to learn. I've bought most other theory books out there and this one seems the friendliest and easiest to understand 
 Seierstad writes a compelling book about cultural and personal differences.   I actually can read between the lines the efforts of a man who is trying to find his own voice in a system that does not work as we think.  With Seierstad's candid observations, one might feel compelled to shout and scream... but yet any body who does not have the opportunity to stand out and taste criticism will shield from taking actions.   I loved the way the author was able to clearly state facts and jumped into her emotions (and I can only imagine the shock). Most people will fail to recognize the main character's effor to provide for an honorable way of living, help his younger wife to read, and do his best.   When we read the book without judgement, we are able to understand how we differ. I actually think I can understand why this or that happens.. Reconstruction after war is hard, anybody who has had to live and survive a very strict regime builds up character or shuts down. I usually found myslef thinking what would I do as any of the character's personalities emerged... it was fascinating.   I smiled at the young teenager boy... thinking of my brother, then my son..  of my feminist father and how he would try to emancipate his daughters and truly believe the guy is making a difference in HIS culture which might be less shocking than if we took someone from OUR culture to make drastic changes.  The insecurity portraid by the female characters also happens to so many people (mostly woman who chose to stay at home to care for kids for a while) who leave the competitive world to nurture others.   but most importantly, the book is a gift of courage on everyone.. to tell how they see it, and not pretending to live in a perfect world. I admire their courage, from the comfort of my house, with water and electricity, glass windows and no fear that I'll get bombed.   I couldn't put it down...   IF you want a TOTAL SHOCK, READ IT WITH 'EMERGENCY SEX'(and other desperate measures 
 I must say this is by far the best book I've ever read. 
 This book is called Mr. Popper's Penguins and it is written by Richard and Florence Atwater.  This is a funny fiction story about Antarctic Penguins.  In the story, Admiral Drake sends Mr. Popper a penguin and calls the first one Captain Cook.  Another penguin comes after him.  It is a girl penguin named Greta.  They make you laugh out of your skin because they are silly penguins!  You should read this book because the penguins do funny things like walk up the stairs at Mr. Popper's house and smack their heads.  They also play fight with each other and Captain Cook poked a woman!  You should buy this book today 
 Letters to a Young Mathematician portrays the life of a mathematician to a hypothetical young woman pursuing a career as a mathematician. The author draws on his own experience as a mathematician to regal his readers with stories from his life but also some useful insights into just what the life of a mathamatician entails. There is information about the use and misuse of computers in mathematics, a chapter on getting over fear of proofs and many others. I found the authors depiction of the career of a mathematician interesting. This book is very easy to read as it does not include much in the way of math. If you are hoping to become a mathematician this book is very useful, but if you are just hoping to learn some math look elsewhere 
 Lipstick Traces is a book for anyone who has ever felt that mainstream society is insane. By outlining the connections between counter-culture movements of the past (Dada, Situationism, and Punk, among others) Greil Marcus shows how people separated by decades or even centuries can speak to each other, and help us current misfits feel less lonely.  It's also great to learn about the funny, tragic, and outrageous ways these artists tried to oppose society and live out their desires beyond its bounds 
 You know what you are going to get with a title like Young, Loud, and Snotty. This album is lewd, rude, crude, adn sure as hell ain't prude (as you will notice on the song I Need Lunch). It might not be the most original American punk to come out of the 1970s, but the Stiv Bators and Dead Boys create some of the most catchy and memorable punk tunes of that era.   Some tunes on this LP manage to be more complicated that three chord wonders, though that does not entail that the Dead Boys give a more mature performace, the lyrics continue to be tinged with juvenille topics and unhealthy amounts of angst.   Standout tracks include my personal favorite: I Need Lunch's "I don't really want to dance, I just want to get into your pants" line is rivaled only my the Macc Lads' "spread your legs and get your knickers down." Sonic Reducer's meaning continues to elude me. Caught with the Meat in Your Mouth is full of comic possibility. Not Anymore/ Ain't Nothin' to Do is effectively two tracks squeezed into one for reasons unknown.  This is a great taste of some early American punk, borrowing equally from both the Ramones and the Sex Pistols, but in the end delivering their own, rather unique product, with some unforgetable tracks. 
 Only one other city is so steaped in architecture history than Chicago and this guide does a commendable job of highlighting the most important Chicago buildings, the synopsis on each building is susinct, the only qualm I have is that there are not more pictures, I also wish the authors had ventured more into the suburbs and commented on some of the great houses in Lake Forest and Highland Park, but that omission does not mar the overall enjoyment of this scholarly guide.  If you are interested in architecture at all, I recommend you pick up this book, Chicago is so steaped in architecture history and this is a good guide to the best examples. 
 OK, I'll admit I always wondered what it is about catnip that gives a  'high' to cats, and now I know.  This very enjoyable collection of cat tidbits explains catnip, purring, 'kneading' and other cat phenomena.  The section dealing with myths and legends about cats is really fascinating.  I never knew there were so many wild (and dangerous) misconceptions about cats.  I also never knew that so many famous people through history were cat lovers--including Cleopatra, Winston Churchill, and Mark Twain.  I'm writing this before Christmas, so I'm remembering the wonderful legend connecting the Nativity with the 'M' on the foreheads of tabby cats.  I wish this book had better illustrations, frankly, but that is a minor point since it is a good read and a good stocking stuffer for any cat lover that is hard to buy for 
 If you doubt his premise, think about World War I. The leaders of the nations of Europe and the US put their male citizens into soldier's uniforms, lined them up in close proximity to one another to dig trenches, ordered them into the trenches, and then gassed them.  It was an extermination experiment. It's time we all woke up to the global death machine and its propaganda. Also read How the World Really Works 
 Let it be known that these are my two favorite MC's out of the Wu camp (Meth and Ghost that is). This is kinda like an extension of Cuban Linx, but not quite. It is good in its own right. The Gambino, Quentin Tarantino/John Woo storytellism is still there folks, so don't miss it. I remember '96 vividly and as one of the most productive/memorable years in hip-hop history and this is album is like a bookmark in time for that era. My personal favs are Winter Warz, Daytona 500 (easily the best), Motherless Child, 260 (that Tarantino stuff), Iron Maiden...hell I like it all b. This album is as much a testament to RZA's production brilliance as it is an ode to the Wu and hip hop in general. Ghost's sometimes wacky but always clever wordplay is always welcome. Buy it.  
 I can't imagine a DVD set being more complete.  It details his personal life as well as huge amounts of art, and how the two mingle.  With interviews of friends, shots from places made famous (like 4 Cats), and work I'd never seen before, this documentary is a masterpiece.  I've watched it over and over; it's like a live-action coffee table book.  If you like Picasso, this is the most valuable and substantial thing you can own.    
 Tom Waits's experimental edge, which began largely with SWORDFISHTROMBONES, finds its pinacle in BONE MACHINE.  This is an album that would later be largely replicated with REAL GONE (a record that is so loud and busy, it takes several listens to get to the point), but is much more direct than the future album: MACHINE is about decay, both physical and psyhological, and how the erosion of time affects us all.  The gutteral "Earth Died Screaming" opens the album, while the beautiful "That Feel" (co-written with and featuring Keith Richards) closes out the set.  In between, the songs range from busy, bustling stoms ("All Stripped Down"), sentimental ballads ("A Little Rain"), recitations ("The Ocean Doesn't Want Me"), even off-beat gospel ("Jesus Gonna Be Here").  The overall effect is an album that comes off as brilliant--which is simply because it IS brilliant.  Tom Waits is a musical genius; his experimental edge, combined with a knack for poetic lyrics and a hooky melody (also melodies that seem to make no sense at all) pushes him far above his peers.  Actually, it's safe to say that Waits has no peers--he is in a class all his own, making music like only he could.  If you've never heard anything like Tom Waits, it's ok--because there ISN'T anything else like him 
 I just finish reading Dennis's book this last week, and I have to say it was one of the more useful and interesting space books I've read in a while.  This book is probably one of the only places you can find a clear case set forward for the existance and potential of lunar PGM deposits.  Even if the transition to a hydrogen economy didn't depend on the availability of Lunar PGMs, their mere existance provides a very lucrative potential market.  Very insightful review of past lunar architectures, including many details I didn't yet know about.  While I may not agree 100% with the proposed approach at the end of the book, it is well worth the read, and a good starting point.  All in all, if you're interested in space settlement, or alt.space, this book should definitely be on your "to-read" list 
 After 2005's amazing release of "Conspiracy in Mind", Communic jumped right back in the studio to start work on 2006's "Waves of Visual Decay". And oh my God did they do something right. This album puts everything you thought you knew about Progressive Metal and Power Metal to shame. The way the two genres are blended make for a great listen and the technicality of this album is mind numbing. At times the guitar riffs might remind you of Porcupine Tree (evident in the track Under a Luminous Sky). This is definitly one of the best of 2006 so far. If you enjoy bands like Nevermore, Soilwork, Beyond Fear, Dream Theater, Scar Symmetry, and Evergrey then this is for you. You wont be dissappointed. And if you like this album make sure you pick up their first! Or vice-versa 
 I don't know what industry people got together to make this possible but this is a breath fresh air.It seems to be getting wide distribution in the USA and actually selling copies to boot. This goes against conventional wisdom that seems to believe that the only thing the public wants is speedy soukous, much of which is beginning to sound all the same. Nothing old fashioned about great imaginative music and this is proof. Nearly 65 minutes and you will shake your hips and buttocks 
 If you are a history buff, and a "sword and sandal" film guru, like myself, you will enjoy this film.  It is an historically accurate account of the book of revelations[Bible], as it was visually imparted to John[Richard Harris], the last living disciple of Christ.  Even if you are not religiously-inclined, you will no doubt be entertained, and impressed with Harris's well-earned command of the silver screen.  
 Anyone who is familiar with mid/ late 80's pop has got to remember Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam and the great jams they cranked out. All of the big ones are here. You get both of their fabulous #1 hits. "Head To Toe" starts out like a Supremes song and then takes off with a terrific catchy chorus *instantly recognizable.* "Lost In Emotion" was the other #1 and is just as great. Then you have the slow song "All Cried Out" which is beautiful and although Lisa Lisa comes off as sort of whiny, it justifies the song so it's forgivable. "Youuuuuu you leave me so confuuuused, now I'm all cried out...over you." An 80's slow jam classic. Plus, you get the great free-style dance jams that put them on the map in the first place. Who can forget "I Wonder If I Take You Home" or one of my faves "Can You Feel the Beat." A MUST buy for 80's music fans. I don't care what people say about the 80's. Free-style dance music like Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam is awesome and music just isn't made this fun anymore. If you like this, I also recommend music by Expose and Debbie Gibson. Ear candy to help you forget about your troubles 
 I had never heard of Beth Hart until last night. A friend of my boyfriend told him how good she was, that she sounded a lot like Janis.   She was playing at The Knitting Factory on Hollywood Blvd last night, so we decideed to see her. The place was sold out but some how he talked our way in. She was singing some mellow song that was really good but I thought his friend was NUTS!, this chick didn't sound a thing like Janis at all. Then she sang Monkey Back....Well I'll be damned! She did sound like Janis! I liked her so much last night I bought this CD.   As much as I like this CD, she's 100 times better live! If you ever have the opportunity to see her, don't miss it 
 A DVD MOVIE WITH JUSTICE  Transformer the animated movie is still my favorite and not only that the special features are great.   I wish all dvd movies that put special features are going to be release will be like this.  
 The alternating first- and third-person narration didn't bother me at all; it's not the first book I've read with that style.  I think it makes for a more effective telling of this tale.  The protagonists are well-drawn, interesting, and sympathetic.  The villian is spooky and powerful.  The supporting players are just right.  Dark, deep, and just the right level of erotic, TALYN is my favorite fantasy so far this year 
 In a sense, Shakespeare treaded on Gothic elements in his play Macbeth, which premiered after Queen Elizabeth had died and King James, who had heritage in Scotland, became the new King of England. James knew about his infamous ancestor Macbeth and commissioned the Bard to write a thrilling work of theatre which recounted the historic tale of Macbeth. There really was a Macbeth, but much of the story is fictional, save for the names of people and places. Macbeth is Shakespeare's darkest tragedy. On the New Folgers Library Edition, we are treated to the very best of scholarly information regarding the creation of the play, and the political and theatrical world of Shakespeare's day. This is the best printed version of Macbeth you will find today. And for this reader, it is a play perfect for this Halloween season. The plot, without giving much of it away in a summary, is quite simple but powerful in its impact. In Medieval England, the minor nobleman Macbeth and his wife Lady Macbeth plot to murder the current king of Scotland. Their ambitions are spurred when three mysterious witches foretell their success. However, as Macbeth maintains power, he becomes fearful of losing it. He orders the deaths of allies and friends out of insecurity. Eventually his own ambition becomes his downfall and a new king arises. Since its premiere, Macbeth has been rumored to be "cursed". Throughout the years, including the twentieth century, reports of accidents and even deaths have circulated involving certain productions of Macbeth. The elements in the play are dark and quintessentially Gothic- flying daggers, constant darkness and fog, ghosts, witches, apparitions including dead kings and bloody children. In the 19th century this would encompass the material of Gothic literature but in Shakespeare's time it was part of thrilling drama. Supernatural beings like ghosts were featured in other Shakespeare tragedies -Hamlet and Julius Caesar for instance. The belief in witches was prevalent in Puritan/Protestant/Catholic England, after all this was still the time of the Inquisition. So the featured Three Witches would have actually been regarded as a true part of history even. This play has many fine moments. All of Macbeth's quotes are memorable but especially his "Out, Out Brief Candle! Life is but a walking shadow..." The role of Lady Macbeth, if played well, can be the signature role of many actresses. She is Shakespeare's most evil creations. She drives Macbeth to murder because she is perhaps even more ambitious than him. Her being a female is her only setback. But she is an empowered and vile woman, even regarded as something of a witch herself. The play inspired several film versions including director Roman Polanski's version in 1971 and in the 19th century an opera by Verdi. 
 Forester brought his characters to life, however the plot development and character contrast development was a bit lacking. I didn't quite accept the growth, I didn't quite feel swept over with the scenes, but it kept my interest going steadly none the less. It was another shamming story of the English speaking people's mores and morals, some of it justifiable, some not, not well balanced anyway. It was also the Madame Butterfly theme but in this case the English, not the Americans, are the ones shammed: the English see life as a spectacle, view it from the third person, are prejudiced, and value the intellect, with all its faults, over feeling.   Forester, in a letter included in the Penguin edition, claims he has a limited intellect or grasp of philosophy. I would have to agree with him. He states, however, that there is another intangible quality that he brings to his writing, unique, another voice; I would agree with that to some extent, at least the method of delivery being so dialogue heavy, and it was fairly good, and the dialogue was mostly stupid, but then most of daily dialogue is stupid especially where intellect rules over feeling, and feeling and thoughts are not closely in harmony with the life one has chosen, and that seemed to be Forester's message, so something new might be jellying here and and he trys to show growth in this muck, although I didn't quite accept it. Byron said much the same thing about English mores and morals, and was much more passionate about it, eloquent, and brought more erudition to his views. Forester's effort is a minor contribution to literature.   If you like the humour in this novel you will probably also like Saki, HH Munro 
 Dark Aprentice is a good continuation of the trilogy with a perfect cliffhanger ending. Sadly the third book won't be much of a surprise for me because I read The New Essential Guide to character (Starwars) and I already know how it ends (this should be a warning to those of you doing the same thing. That's about all I have for now. 
 Eye Toy Play 2 is much better than the first. While the first had limits on what you could actually do, this one has very few. There is a much larger variety of games, and different activities. Such as running during a baseball game, dodging searchlights while collecting items, chopping pickles and smashing tomatoes, defeating a three-headed hydra and so much more. During multiplayer mode, you get to take a picture of your face which is then placed in the head of a robot monkey, which is a hilarious touch. Also, during multi-player mode, when a tie occurs, the players get to do a tie breaker in the form of a fun little mini game. The downside to this is that, if you want to play the minigames at anytime, you have to force a tie, which can be a pain. Downsides to Eye Toy Play 2: Some of the games are more frustrating than challenging, and the instrutions in the booklet aren't very clear. Like most Eye Toy games, you have to turn on all the lights nearby and open the curtains to get decent enough lighting. Even when the camera is set to Dim Room. The video messaging is terrible. You don't get to choose a background like in the original Eye Toy, and the image is small and distorted. The Playroom is difficult to find, and there is a limited ammount of games, some of which make no sense. Like, when it asks you to put a brightly coloured image in front of the camera. It's just weird.  Overall, Eye Toy Play 2 is completely worth the buy. It's hours of endless fun, and the games never seem to get old 
 This is the first Neil Stevenson book that I read, and although I am already a Gibson fan, I had no idea what I was in for. Maybe I was expecting cryptic jargon and emotionally sterile characters, but this was much more lush than that.  I got hooked on this one character, Nell, which the story followed through to the very end, despite multiple parallel stories. Nell is a young girl in poverty who puts up with her mother's many abusive boyfriends. Her brother gets ahold of an interactive (mediatronic) book and brings it home to Nell, and this book teaches her many things, including how to read, self-defense, programming, and so forth. I don't want to give away any plot spoilers or reveal the true nature of her mouse army, but let's just say that the ones who have nothing to lose can be revolutionary.   An interesting structural aspect of the book is its recursive nature - the "Primer" that Nell and other girls interact with sets up a story within the main plot, and it makes an interesting and wholesome periodic alternation between the two. The boundary between the "Primer"  world and the "real" world are blurred and easily transgressed by ractors (actors for mediatronic devices). The explicit pop culture references, also, facilitates in bringing the reader into Stevenson's world, and I began to think of the nanotechnology and mediatronics in terms of how it would function in our world. Thus the fractal nature of these many realities becomes confusing from one view to the next.   This book has rich characters, and amazingly lush imagery. An example is his description of the animated glyphs on chopsticks; another is "kidnapper", a mechanical robot horse that serves as a transport vehicle. This book is complex - it now ranks high on my sci-fi faves list 
 Having spent a sizable fortune on "how-to-write" books, I now realize that I need to stop buying these books and just start writing.  Having said that, however, I think that Horton's book contains a lot of useful information and is better than most screenwriting books out there.  Whether you like this book probably depends on both your movie preferences and your writing style.  If you are more Steven Segal than Woody Allen, then this book is probably not for you.  Similarly, if you are a screen writer who meticulously outlines a story, then you should probably take a pass on Horton.  If you can follow all those story diagrams in McKee's book, then you will hate this one.  This book is the Anti-McKee.  Simply put, Horton view is that the most important part of a story is the development of the character rather than external events.  A story should make us identify and empathize with the characters.  Consequently, a great screenplay will have that identification and empathy as it's main goal.  The book is often written in a high-handed academic style.  Horton is, after all, an academic.  This may annoy some readers.  For me, it imparted a measure of earnestness.  Many of the reviewers had trouble with the "carvivalesque" concept.  This could be explained a little more straightforwardly.  Basically, it means that character: (i) is not static, but in a state of flux; (ii) is multi-faceted and does not always behave consistently; and (iii) is influenced by its background and evnironment.  The first half of the book builds off of these themes.  The one quibble that I had with the book is that some of the exercises are unrealistic.  For instance, am I really going to contact an agency to obtain a copy of a little-known short film so that I can review it?  Of course not.  Neither will you.  Only a college professor would make such obscure assignments.  All-in-all, this is a good book to get one started in writing character-centered screenplays.  I guess the name says it all 
 We have been reading this book almost every night for the past three years.  I am buying another copy because the original - a board book I almost returned - is worn out and torn.  My son has this book memorized and "reads" it to his little sister!  We love it!  It is the perfect ending to a long day for every one 
 Doris Day sparkles in this film, which was her film debut; it's a predictable, silly but fun plot of a couple who suspect each other of cheating, and devise ways of spying, only to be confused by wrong identities and of course, love. The cast surrounding Doris is terrific, with Janis Page and Don DeFore as the couple, Jack Carson as Peter Vigil, the private investigator in love with Doris, Oscar Levant as a down and out pianist also in love with Doris, S.Z. Sakell as Uncle Lazlo who meddles in everything, and Leslie Brooks as the stunning secretary that raises Janis Paige's suspicions.  This 1948 film is peppered with lovely Jule Styne/Sammy Cahn songs, including the Oscar nominated "It's Magic". Others are "I'm in Love", "It's You or No One", "The Tourist Trade" (sung by Avon Long), "Put 'Em in a Box, Tie 'Em with a Ribbon, and Throw 'Em in the Deep Blue Sea", "Two Lovers Met in the Night", "Run, Run, Run" (sung by Jack Carson), and Oscar Levant plays his "Caribbean Rhapsody". Directed with swift pacing by Michael Curtiz, the dance numbers are choreographed by Busby Berkeley, The Page Cavanaugh Trio back Doris in some numbers, and the Technicolor cinematography and fabulous fashions are great to look at.  The circumstances of Doris Day being hired for this film read like a Cinderella story. Jule Styne heard her sing at a party while he was looking for a replacement for Betty Hutton, who had to back out of the film due to pregnancy, and urged Michael Curtiz to hire her. Doris was 23 at the time, and as a singer had a hit with "Sentimental Journey", but according to biographies was in the process of a second divorce, at a low point in her life, and ready to "quit show business" when this opportunity came her way...and a star was born. Total running time is 99 minutes. 
      Fuller truly breaks ground here and starts the conversation by using real life examples to elucidate the tacit hierachy that shifts and blends and reverses itself as we go through our days in public and private. The concept at the core of all civil rights struggles is that each person , in a democracy- has a value equal to another- regardless of "rank" .There is a rare rare bird who can sidestep the ego and see through the illusions of power that we have created for ourselves. I am looking forward to the author's second book, "All rise"  
    Zhang Yimou is one of the most accomplished directors in Chinese film history. I have seen ten of his films and all of them are worthwhile. Zhang Yimou got into some trouble with government authorities for making this film, which is unrelenting and quite realistic in showing the stupidity and suffering Mao brought about with the Cultural Revolution.      In many ways this is a sad, depressing movie, but it is very realistic and depicts what really happened to millions of people in China between the 1930's and early 1970's. One of the stars of this movie, as in many of Zhang's other films is the fine actress, Gong Li. The man she is married to is a foolish compulsive gambler who loses the family home, however, in a twist this later proves to be a blessing because of later historical events.      They have two children and both suffer because of Mao's two most foolish, disastrous policies: the so-called Great Leap Forward during the late 1950's and the Cultural Revolution that started during the mid 1960's.      I highly recommend "To Live," as a very fine film and a realistic portrayal of some of the key events in modern Chinese history. I also highly recommend "The Blue Kite" to go along with "To Live."  
 I love this soundtrack--it really takes me back into the movie, which is what a good movie soundtrack should do 
 This book integrates recent research about the power of appreciation with ageless spiritual wisdom about the vibrational dynamics of life and reality.  It presents practical ways of using this information to help readers shift their thought patterns and thereby change their vibrational state and what they are attracting into their experience.  From the heart coherence research of the Institute of HeartMath to the water crystal photos of Dr. Emoto, the authors make clear how our thoughts create vibrational shifts that transform our external reality.  They explain how appreciation can be used to attract positive experiences rather than continuing to maintain thoughts that energize negative experiences.  This concept is very valid, but the authors fail to adequately explore how deeply embedded our thought patterns and vibrational patterns can be.  For some people it is difficult to develop appreciation in some areas of their lives, as there are strong conflicting patterns in their subconscious levels of mind.  It would take intense commitment to override the self-defeating patterns unless steps are taken to access the subconscious and transform or release the negative patterns at that level.  Since this is a self-help book, it attempts to present things in a simple, clear way that will generate enthusiasm for readers to apply the concepts and exercises in the book.  Unfortunately, by minimizing the complexities of how our thought patterns develop and how life unfolds, this type of approach can lead those who are skeptically inclined to readily give up on or criticize the approach when they don't get rapid results.  The only other significant weakness I observed in the book was something very brief in the discussion of how appreciation was applied following terror attacks in America.  A reference to appreciation of "steadfastness" of America's leaders was made, which in reality was part of the reaction desired by the orchestrators of the terror, making that instance of appreciation counterproductive to those who wish not to give power and energy to terrorism.  In retrospect, a major thing to appreciate about those terror events could be how they fostered a growing awareness of who truly desire to have citizens in states of fear.  The appreciation for freedom that the authors discuss has been of much value and instrumental in helping those viewing ongoing events recognize who were most eager to restrict American freedoms after the Trade Center/Pentagon attacks, leading to discovery of who really was involved in orchestrating those events.  So despite that one brief flaw the discussion of appreciation in response to crisis in this book is generally quite valuable.  Appreciation is a very important vibrational thought/feeling pattern and this book does a good job of exploring the hows and whys. 
 One of the most sumptuous films of that Decade with the young raising promise actor Richard Gere, his sister and his bride in search of hopeful dreams in Texas. An excellent and mature film of Terence Malik that would deserve much more widely known.       
 At the beggining I hate the S4/IEE term but at the end I loved the book because it has a lot os technical information about statistics as it promises 
 I was in college when the Brit Pop phenomena hit.  But I was a snob back then, deeply involved in my college radio station and turning my nose up at this tripe.  Oh that was just too mainstream and commercial for ME to like!  Of course I've since matured, and I gave Brit Pop a chance since then, and this documentary taught me a few things I otherwise didn't know.  There is a curious phenomena that takes place between America and the UK in terms of pop culture.  One gentleman made a comment about a pendulum swing back and forth between the two, and that is certainly true now that I think about it.  I had heard of The Stone Roses, but they never caught on with avengence here.  Then, of course, Nirvana happened and eclipsed everything else.  After Kurt died in 94, Oasis began to rise and the UK's "grunge years" began.  I heard stories about all the kids in the UK chasing after Oasis and their packed, sold out shows, and a new chapter began.  This documentary concentrates mostly on the Gallagher brothers.  Noel is far more well spoken than Liam (but everyone knows that because I don't think he's spent nearly as much time pickling himself), everything Noel said seemed to have more meaning behind it.  They interviewed a few more people, such as Damien from Blur and the guy from Pulp.  Damien seems like a real downer, they should've given the guy from Pulp more of a say as he seemed a little more animated than Blur.  I liked the Beatles vs. Rolling Stones - type rivalry established against Blur and Oasis (seeing whose album would hit #1 first), but you can tell that they really weren't interested and it was a creation by the press.  Plus, you got the impression that London was swinging again like the mods in the 60s.    It is a little ironic that they too fell into the same traps that we did in America with the death of grunge.  Heroin too had them in their grasp (referencing Blur's song "BeetleBum", as it was supposed to be about heroin).  And, a celebrity death ended their trip as well (ours was Kurt's, theirs was Princess Diana).   Here it is 10 years later.  Blur and Pulp seem to have gone the way of the dodo, but Oasis is still around.  They're not the hot phenomena they were, but they continue to make music and seem to have staying power (when they're not fighting or drunk/high).  Now Coldplay seems to be the one leading the Brit Pop charge.  Maybe they will, in fact, live forever 
 The book is a short read, 144 pages. It has a nice assortment of black and white photos, no color photos except the front and back covers. If you have been following Angelina for some time now, you'll already have seen most of these photos. Most of the photos are either screen shots and promotions, or from various award ceremonies. As a long time fan of Angelina, I was surprised to see that this book had a good bit of information on her that I didn't already know. There's a lot of quotes from magazines. The author breaks down most of Angelina's movies, and I do think he spends a tad too much time describing the other actors in these movies. Either way, it is a cheap book and a nice addition to a fan's collection, also a great read for the brand new fan. I recommend! 
 I've been following a vegan diet since 2002 and lost 200 (yes TWO HUNDRED!!!) pounds doing so.  I was interested in macrobiotics, but it seemed so difficult.  I finally found a book that made it so easy to understand and so fun to follow.  Thank you Ms. Porter!!!!!    To anyone who is interested in following a macro diet, do it! Get this book and follow it. It will be the best decision you ever made!! 
 I bought this book recently along with Pamela's first book "Easy Gardens for South Florida" and between the two, I feel completely confident in helping my father design his garden in Englewood.  I plan to move to Charlotte county later this year and begin my career as a full-time landscape designer and these two books give me the information I need to make intelligent choices on plant material 
 This text is very modern, every concepts my professor taught are also in the book, except.....asynchronous sequential logic design. Afterall, I recommend it for every electrical engineering student 
 In this book, a renowned structural anthropologist collaborates with an economist to propose an explanation for one of the great mysteries of economics: where do "preferences" come from?  Much of  neoclassical economics rests on the assumption that, once we know the basic  desires and tastes for a given population, we can then understand how  people make rational decisions about how to acquire them and how to  allocate their resources.  The actual preferences themselves, however, are  a black box.  Douglas & Isherwood tackle this problem, evaluating  several theories of "rational" economic actors from  cross-cultural and systems theoretical perspectives.  Their answer is that  many of these mysteries are not so mysterious after all: we have good  reasons for valuing the things we value, and many of the apparently  frivolous fads and fashions are in fact life-and-death matters.  "Good  taste" is an index of social connections, of reproductive fitness, of  one's ability to mobilize resources -- and in a society increasingly  dependent on information and services rather than physical products, the  race to remain on the cutting edge becomes like traveling with the Red  Queen, faster and faster just to stay in place.  Along the way, Douglas  throws out a number of gems which are incidental to her argument, including  a proposal for why women's work is always and everywhere valued less than  men's.  This book is a must-read for anyone interested in what  anthropologists can tell us about the deep logics of behavior in the  consumer society 
 Attention, Amazon! I think that when there are only about 12 reviews, to print 3 similar ones by the same person is irresponsible, because whether they are 5-star or 1-star (or as here, 3 separate 3-star reviews by the same person saying basically the same thing), they can seriously skew the overall ratings 
 It has 1080i resolution and good sound.  Time Warner has few HD Channels though.  Sound limiting function works great.  I would like to use the smart feature, but haven't been able to find an ethernet wireless adapter.  Anybody know of one 
 This is no candy or soup for the soul, its solid and challenging real world meat for the work of the ministry.  Baxter challenges us to a kind of ministry that exceeds human ability alone.  Such a ministry drives us to our only hope for that ability and keeps us returning to the everlasting arms of our heavenly father 
 I was with Golf 2/7 in 69.  This book, when I read it in 79,put me back in Nam.  I couldn't sleep for weeks.  I missed my buddies.  Semper Fi an 031 
 Mules are not horses, in spite of their similar appearance.  Training methods used on horses are often not effective on mules.  For those equestrians who prefer mules or donkeys as their mounts, this is a teriffic book to help them improve their communication with their animals.    Meredith Hodges' credibility comes from her success in training and breeding performance mules and donkeys.  She is also a regular contributor of training articles to various mule and donkey publications.   Interested equestrians can find an almost unlimited supply of books on riding and training horses, but there is a real shortage of books on the riding and training of mules.  Prior to the publication of this book, Paul and Betsy Hutchins books on mules and donkeys were probably the best books available to readers looking for expert advice on working with their long-eared equines.  Although the Hutchins' books are still superb, it is great to have another viewpoint to read on the subject of mules and donkeys.  Videos and training cards have recently been published to accompany the book.  I have not seen these personally, but have heard that they are excellent.  Mule and donkey lovers definitely need to own this one 
 The "pile" as is came to be known, was the rubble left behind by the collapse of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center.  A mess.  A huge mess.  The who's, what's, why's and hows are accurately discussed in this book about that mess--who took control of it, and what was done with it. A different look at Ground Zero and those who were thrust in charge of this unique operation. An insight at the interests of those who really had control of the "pile"--the firemen, the police, and Port Authority police.  A fine addition to the real story of 9/11. 
 Burton is inspired as ever.  Liz is no Shakespearean actor but, like the Zeffirelli production, stunningly beautiful and great to watch.  Not the whole play, but I've enjoyed it countless times so, I say-- worth owning.  Check out Zeffirelli's background detail and handling of crowd scenes-- wonderful 
 Although I haven't watched this yet, I am looking forward to the same excitement and action that were found in Seasons One, Two and Three.  This truly lis the BEST show on television (but easier to watch on DVDs 
 Where to start...  I rated this 4 stars; 5 stars for being thought provoking and reinforcing my notions of what businesses should be concerned with, and 3 stars for the authors glaring examples of old-renaissance ideas/execution that didn't/don't work, yet providing nothing more than hindsight.  I agree with the previous post that the first half of the book was better than the second half. There are so many examples that are counter to the authors examples, but I'll give a few here.  First, in the absense of fullfilment opportunity exists. While Wal-Mart may be an evil company for some of its practices it also provides people in developing countries with a job, where none may have existed before. If you have no food and someone gives you a scrap then you at least survive to move onto a larger portion. If those who are employed at Wal-Mart cannot find another job that pays more than minimum wage then I would suggest going to a library and start learning...it has free internet access...  Second, many of the arguments made throughout the book are based on a circular reference that is incapable of breaking down, when in fact it would break down. If a=b=c=d...y=z and z=a then for values of a-z that fluctuate so does the continuum. Every example given in the book relating to whatever currency units are give follows the same principle: that at some point, hidden beneath the guise of logic and play, energy will need to be expended that is not optimally or even close to optimally what any person would normally do in search of or in realizing the new renaissance. This breaks the whole model and I suppose it also degrades innovation at the same time.  Third, open-source software, though trendy, has limitations. Imagine a world where function a is performed via single open-source project composing of a single developer, then fast-foward t years where function a is now performed by 1000 different projects each with 1000 developers (who share the same egos), in the meantime you have some number of function a demand satisfied by 1000 projects so a/1000. All of the sudden you have function b that people just though of at t+1 days, but only a small portion like 1% of function a projects are compatible...but the developers of function a projects not wanting their egos to be crushed realize this and perhaps migrate over to the small % of function a projects that are compatible...leaving the other 99% of function a projects to be picked up by some developer(s), whos egos aren't as big, to try and work something out with function b compatibility. Now you have function a compatible projects with a huge number of developers wanting to make their mark with function b, but the 99% of the people who utilize function a and now function b must switch to projects that are fully compatible and relearn, etc. The point is that people want recognition, however good or bad that may be, but it's the truth...even authors put their name, photo, etc.  Fourth, I agree that understanding your "core competencies" are very important and understanding the "source code" and "patterns" is nice, but what really got me was how high people must be in order to realize that this is the path to eternal bliss or "play." I mean who in their right mind would choose to clean out a septic tank as a way of "playing" or even perform surgery on someone's brain...just for fun, when you know that someone's life depended on whether you were qualified or not. If you aren't qualified then doesn't that introduce a classe system of sorts? Who would regulate this...would this person think that telling someone they are incompetent was "playing?" It's clear that any system which qualifies someone as being able to perform a specific action, no matter how much fun they might have, is clearly old renaissance and the illusion of new renaissance is just that (not in entirety, but practicality).   Fifth, while some people prefer to solve challenging problems, others would rather just sit around surfing, etc. What do we do with those people? Where would they get their surfboards, wax, wetsuits, food? I'll tell you who...the people that have enough resources at their disposal to just sit back and ponder how the old renaissance is coming to an end in favor of the new renaissance.   Sixth, peoples faith often becomes a paramount influence in the actions they undertake. Some are at extreme ends and radicalize what is otherwise a very moral and just view of how things should be. These radicals often carry out actions against others because their convictions are so strong and so outside of the middle that even if the middle moves it will not be enough so enough will be "encouraged." This artificial skewing leads to others ultimately forgoing "play" in order to build a counter-trend necessary to prevent skewing that is non-organic. In the end you have a reduction in pure innovation (good) and an increase in pure existence. I'm guessing that the author was too busy contemplating whether or not we could he didn't think whether or not we should...  Seven, the book discusses how currency became the demise of society as it pertains to interest, greed, etc. However, in the Paypal example he exalts that business for being upstanding and trying this new thing, but it ultimately fails because of the banks...yada, yada, yada. Anyways, Paypal was earning interest on the float vs. charging money for its service. How is that new renaissance? If we take the banks out of the equation so that interest is no longer accrued then who pays for the hosting, data, maybe it's those people who like to play in data centers. But then, who builds the steel racks, elevated floors, servers, ethernet cables, routers, switches, supplies power, constructs the building, stays up all night trying to figure out why no interest is being accrued :)   Well, that was more of a rant than anything else. I'm glad this book cemented my ideas about open-source software and about how so many company executives are in such disrepair. Innovation...hmmm...whenever I have a bug in software I usually just open a debugging program that I purchased and print-out the portion of code via a printer, utilizing a driver, written by some person of gets off on that sorta thing...but would they do it for free if there other needs weren't being met...I don't think so.  There's a reason why doctors get paid so much money, there's are reason why people do jobs they wouldn't otherwise do, there's a reason why the new renaissance only exists in the imagination of Gene Roddenberry. The have's and the have not's exist today, and perhaps in the 21st century we can combat much of this gap; however, until everyone is content with their existence and opportunity for existence then we will not reach the new renaissance. Indeed, it will only exist where truly innovative ideas take place...our isolated dreams.. 
 There is so much information packed into this work that it is difficult to imagine how the author and illustrator pulled it off.  This is the story of the life cycle of the loggerhead turtle.  The illustrations are beautiful and actually quite accurate.  The text is simple and very, very well done.  It follows the illustrations perfectly and is just overflowing with good information.   This book, while great for kids to read on their own (this is one of the more used books in our school library), it is also great to read to the class as a whole as it never fails to bring on good questions and good discussions (better know your turtles when faces with a bunch of third graders).  
 I loved this movie so much. I did not know much about 'los maquis' but I knew a lot about 'partigiani' which are the Italian fighters against the Mussolini's men. I thought that, since Spain had had a civil war to get rid of Franco, and did not make it, that was it. Watching this movie I learned that that was not it. Brave men and women had tried to resist the Spanish dictator, as Italians, and to a less extent - whatever it is believed outside Europe- French people had done, Hiding up in the mountains and fighting for their ideas, fighting to get their friends free.  Montxo Armendàriz has done a great work again. Maybe a little slow for American people, it flows perfectly for European eyes. Very realistic, the story is very believable.  The actors, most young, did an excellent job. But, as two of them Juan y Marìa Botto, were trained by the actress who also trained Penelope Cruz and Antonio Banderas, this comes as no surprise. Lucìa Jimenez, the main character, and Carmen Sanpietro, who plays tha aunt, render the feeling of fear and suspect almost touchable. You feel the pressure they had to feel those days. Juan Diego Botto gives the idea of being thorn between fighting for what he believes and living the joys of family life very well in the scene that takes place in the kitchen, and his siter Marìa, which usually is a very talented comedy actress, demonstrates she is great in dramatic roles as well, showing how the desire of fighting for your your ideas can fade away when those you love are sistematically killed. One last word about the musical score. It's only one piece played differently, but it gives you goosebumps. 
 This book comprehensively covers many subjects concerning race and American government--namely: the founder's intentions regarding slavery, the behavior of the federal government toward slavery up through the Civil War, the attitudes and behavior of Abraham Lincoln toward the institution, and the constitutional rulings that effectively ended the first civil rights movement following the formal destruction of slavery.       Early in the piece, the reader might think that the book is designed to cleanse the founding period of any association with slavery, but then the bulk of the work demonstrates the multiple ways that the government under the new Constitution became devoted to serving the slaveholding interest. Lincoln is neither glorified nor vilified but rather is evaluated within the political context within which he operated.       The book leaves the reader with a deeper sense of what has long been called the American dilemma. It wrestles with difficult constitutional issues but in ways that are comprehensible to the layperson. This book will long be an academic classic, but it is also one that every serious American should read, especially given the fact that the ugly legacy of the slaveholding republic is still with us 
 This novel has a simple plot,easy to follow.And the best part is that it is short.I have found it difficult to write this review on my own for one simple reason,it gets to slow paced at certain parts of this book,thereby making me lose interest.I have however,forgotten alot of this book,because I read it so long ago.So I needed to use my research to aid in this review...Nigel...  Here is the plot:The novel is a series of recollections by the members of Troop D, a police barracks in western Pennsylvania. After Curt Wilcox, a well-liked member of Troop D is killed by a drunk driver, his son Ned begins to visit Troop D. The cops quickly take a liking to him, and soon begin telling him about the "Buick 8" of the title.  The Buick 8 resembles a vintage 1954 Buick Roadmaster, and was left at a gas station by a mysterious man, who disappeared soon after leaving the car to be refueled. The "car" is later held by the Troop D police of rural Pennsylvania in one of their sheds. The car, they discover, is not a car at all. It appears to be a Buick, but the steering wheel doesn't move, the dashboard instruments are painted on, and the car heals itself when scratched or dented.  Sandy Dearborn is the main narrator of the book, and tells the story to Ned, discussing various things that have happened with the car, and his father's fascination with it. The car will frequently give off what they dub "light quakes," or large flashes of light over an extended period of time, and will occasionally "give birth" to strange creatures that aren't anything like what they've seen in their world. Two people have disappeared in the vicinity of the car - a fellow trooper called Ennis and a lowlife named Brian Lippy they picked up for drunk driving and being under the influence of angel dust.  After hearing the story of the Buick and how it has been kept secret for Troop D for so long, Ned becomes convinced that the car was somehow related to the death of his father. After all, the gas station attendant who first reported the Buick sitting in front of the station was the same man who, years later, would kill his father. Ned is determined to destroy the Buick, but before he can Sandy Dearborn realizes that the Buick, in fact, wants to take Ned into the world it controls as a sacrifice of sorts.  Sandy returns to the shed to find Ned sitting in it, and just as he pulls Ned out the Buick transforms into a portal, trying to draw both Ned and Sandy inside of it. The other troopers arrive, and manage to pull Ned and Sandy free, but not before Sandy glimpses into the open portal of the Buick's trunk and sees remnants of both Ennis and Brian Lippy on the other side.  The book closes with Ned joining the police force after dropping out of college, and he pulls Sandy over to Shed B, where the Buick is stored. The Buick's window is cracked, and Ned believes that the Buick will one day fall apart, having expended the last of its energy in that final show. ...enjoy...Nigel. 
 Shilts' great book shows us how much of the AIDS related suffering of the last twenty years could so easily have been avoided. The book opens with the July 4th 1976 bicentennial celebration of American independence and closes with the death of Hollywood star Rock Hudson, whose passing garnered the necessary oxygen of publicity that all the thousands of previous AIDS casualties could not.  In between, the book revolves around the hedonistic community of San Francisco's Castro Street area and brings us an amazing array of villains, victims and plain heroes. The villains include the bathhouse owners, who used America's First Amendment to keep their businesses open even as it was blatantly obvious that they were a major conduit for the spread of the virus; Dr. Bob Gallo of America's National Cancer Institute, who put his own prestige ahead of everything else, normal scientific and academic ethics included; and the Reagan administration, which did as little as politically possible to stem the burgeoning plague that blighted America during those years.   Because the air bridges between Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco helped spread the virus at breakneck speed, Shilts also introduces us to Gaetan Dugas, the Canadian air line steward, who is credited with infecting many of America's earliest victims. Shilts paints him as half victim and half villain.  Dugas, he shows, went from being the pretty boy everybody in Castro Street wanted to bed to being the terminal AIDS case they all eventually feared.   Rock Hudson, Liberace and other closet gays are likewise painted as half villains and half victims. Michael Foucault, the fashionable French philosopher, must rank with the vilest villains; he hid his diagnosis from everyone, even his devoted lover. So much for that pompous philosopher and philanderer!  But even in the blighted world of AIDS, there were many heroes. These include the French scientists who discovered the HIV virus and, Gallo excepted, the American ones, who followed up all the early clues that eventually led to the discovery of the medications that can now tackle the illness. Many of these American heroes, Shilts shows, were penalized rather than praised by their universities for performing their singular services to mankind.  The bathhouse chain owners, who were more interested in profiting from the unbridled orgies that gave them their profits than in stemming AIDS, were not the only amplifiers during the crucial early years. The blood banks, by refusing to screen blood, also contributed to the death of thousands of Americans. The Reagan administration's preoccupation with Central America and the Soviet Union was also a godsend to the virus.  And, as the band played on, AIDS wormed its way through America's marginalized communities of hookers, hemophiliacs, heroin addicts, and Haitians. Gay activists, who tried to sound the alarm bells, were dismissed as sexual Nazis and theocrats by their confreres who wanted to party on in Castro Street's backroom bars and bathhouses, even though, as Shilts constantly reminds us, it meant almost certain death.   Shilts has sent us a powerful message that we ignore at our peril. AIDS means that hedonists can expect to die sooner rather than later. The world's legions of drug shooting hookers will remain major amplifiers for AIDS, hepatitis and related illnesses as long as their addiction continues. So too will other marginalized and uneducated people. So too, of course, will people like Robert Gallo, who put his own narrow agenda ahead of humanity's.  On the positive side, the book shows us that the villains are vastly outnumbered by the heroes, not the least of whom is Randy Shilts, who also finally succumbed to this great human calamity.  
 A beautiful book. The writing and reproductions are first class. A must for any collector's shelf 
 Great reference for Italian wines, either for use in the wine store or when traveling the Italian countryside.  Small enough to carry with you yet packed with a lot of relevant informatio 
 The product is excellent, the Cadillac of diapers.  It arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition 
 thanks Mr Lord, for your lovely semi classical music. I love his work on pictured within with Miller Anderson on voice, wait a while is pretty nice with Sam Brown on voice. the whole set is a must for Deep Purple fans. John Lord loves the classical stuffs alots and it is no wonder that Deep purple integrated their hard rock sound with the classical elements what Mr Lord  played. Thanks for Mr Lordy! he is a great master of rock and classical keyboard man 
 Love this little book! My 3 year old son has  made pictures with his fingerprints at his preschool. This is  a great way for children to express themselves by making their fingerprints into any number of little animal or other creatures. I bought this book for us to make projects with at home. I thought it would be great for his little thank you notes to relatives. My son loves this book. If you decide to buy this book, you will not be dissapointed. I also enjoyed using this myself as an adult 
 All My Sons is Arthur Miller's first work which gives hint of his future genius. While the plot is strong, it starts slowly. However, the ending makes the play worth reading.   The story tells of partners in a defective machine shop during World War II. Keller escapes punishment for the faulty parts. Herbert Deever is sent to prison. Keller's son Chris intends to marry his deceased brother's love who happens to be Herbert Deever's daughter Anne. Keller's wife Kate is in denial of their son Larry's death. This denial makes her a trademark of Miller's works, an annoying female character. She is overbearing and at times a nag. Thus, conflict is created over Chris and Anne's relationship.  The story reaches its climax when the true nature of Larry's death is revealed. While the conclusion is not shocking, it is a fitting end.   Miller has written some great plays and novels. While this is certainly not as good as Death of a Salesman, it is still a solid work. 
 Roy Moxham's book on Tea is an absorbing read, and is peppered with very useful information and traces the history of tea. Perhaps, Moxham has started off a trend of sorts on single commodity books. His first was about salt and the great hedge of India. In that book his focus was more on the hedge, and less on salt. However in this book is focus is exclusively on tea and how it made its way to the western world.  Moxham's stint as a tea-planter in Africa certainly helps him to gain keen insights into this drink, that is beloved to so many of us. A cup of tea is meant to soothe your jangled nerves, and comfort you. But, what you did not know is that this comfort drink went through a bloody and dark period when it was introduced into Great Britain.   The book is rich with details, and Moxham's love for this plant comes through clearly. After reading the book, everytime I drink a cup of tea I look at the drink with a different perspective. We often forget the hard work that goes into making this comfort drink easily available to us 
 Interesting book which describes the corporate world from a women's perspective and gives advice on career planning and advancement.  As a man, I find the book overstates the nature men and of `male' business - not all  men are sports jocks.  However, the book does contain plenty of good,  ruthless, honest advice 
 This was a wonderful book! Elizabeth Berg has done it again with a fascinating story about a an adult woman polio survivor, her adolescent daughter, and her housekeeper/friend. She provided some thought provoking issues regarding the difficulties encountered by a single mother that is handicapped, the responsibilities of a child to a parent and vice versa, and how sometimes "family" comes in the form of someone not related by blood.  This was one of those books that made you feel that you know the characters. I was sorry when the book came to an end. I highly recommend it! 
 This book is exceptionally thorough; detailed and practical, with tons of worksheets and exercises to perform.  However, it seems very focused on product-based business, versus service businesses.  The author does include service businesses in his examples, but the exercises and worksheets seem to me to be very helpful for those people providing an actual product, with suppliers and vendors and product margins and the like.  Overall a recommended book, especially if you're looking for an exceptionally detailed blueprint for moving from idea to execution 
 Being a huge Ragweed fan, I couldn't resist buying this CD.  Wade is an incredible singer.  If you like good music with heart and soul, you will love this CD.  It's got it all: some hard country rock, a little alt. country, some uptempo country and smooth ballads.  The title cut is amazing!!!  Too bad radio hasn't discovered Wade.  He is better than most of the guys making some hit music these days. 
 This is the funniest book I have ever read including Catcher in the Rye but then Salinger did not go to Dartmouth and I did and I am an Alpha Delt.It is also accurate except for one minor glitch as Chris Miller writes "Where They Are Now"  "Black Mike is dead." No I am not and we all know about Mark Twain's comment about his demise.It is laugh out loud funny beyond mere words -one must read it and let it flow like beer out of a keg. My brother was also an Alpha Delt at Dartmouth and knew Miller-all Miller had to do was just ask Roger.This is the kind of book Imus would have liked to launch but I think it has its own legs.My fraternity brothers are all scurrying to buy it. Amazon delivered it so quickly via standard shipping speed 
 This book is a wonderful portrayl of life in old New York Society.  The story of a man (Newland Archer) who is trying to break away from the cycle of New York society and be with a woman he longs to have.  However, he must keep up with what his friends and families have spent their lives to keep...their pride, wealth, and dignity 
 Berleant explains clearly why conventional aesthetics do not only impede our encounter with the arts, but even more obstruct the aesthetic appreciation of nature.Thus instead of disinterested contemplation Berlant talks about total engagement and a sensory immersion in the natural world. One cannot distance oneself from events such as "the moving mass of a mighty waterfall", "the sight of the boundlessness of the overwhelming tumult of the ocean" and the "walking through the tall grass of  a hidden meadow whose tree-defined edges besome the boundaries of the earth". These quotations show that this book is not just worth reading for it's convincing theoretical standpoint, but also for Berleants linguistically powerful and rich descriptions of the aesthetics of nature 
 A very good read well written and a good story.I would recomend it 
 This book isn't so much a guide to inking as the title would have you think, rather, it's more of a reference.   Normally, this would cause me to give a book like this a 3 rating, but the redeeming qualities caused a change of heart.  The guidance it does give works so well with the pictures in the book, that I would dare say that a person who is interested in inking should definately pick this one up. And when you do, read it, and draw as much in it as possible. Learning comes by doing. The more you ink, the better you'll get. And I feel this book gives the neccessary lessons, to take your inking to the next level.  -Mat 
 This CD was a big hit with my girlfriend who loves Sarah Vaughn. Her voice is great to listen to when you want to relax, or when you want to dance in the middle of the living room with your special someone. I'd like to get some of her other collections now, not just love songs. 
 In my opinion it's no coincidence that it is this collection above the others that has proved to be the most successful both artistically and commercially of all Ella Fitzgerald's songbook albums as Cole Porter was truly in a class of his own as a songwriter.  I've always found it pretty astounding that someone who could write such dazzlingly clever and witty lyrics could also compose such beautifully crafted and delicious music.  A good deal of Ella's interpretations here are damn near definitive, but special mention should go to 'Miss Otis Regrets', which she completely transforms from a somewhat arch comic number into something poignant and bluesy, and 'Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye', which went from being an obscure song from a long-forgotten show to a big standard and one of Porter's best loved songs after this album came out.  One of the criticisms levelled at Ella Fitzgerald over the years is that her singing lacked emotional depth, but her readings of these two numbers proved that she could really get underneath a song when required.  Yes, some of the arrangements are slightly overblown, like in 'From This Moment On' and It's Alright With Me', but these are minor complaints.  Popular music never got better than this.  
 There seems to be a cottage industry among life scientists in the US.  Their self-assigned role of this scattering of scholars is chipping away of the Darwin icon.  As serious scholars, they have little desire to "overturn".  Instead, they produce a constant barrage of "Darwin got this wrong" or "Darwin didn't answer that question".  In this case, Kirschner and Gerhart are "resolving Darwin's dilemma".  The dilemma is the lack of understanding of genetics when Darwin published "The Origin of Species".  Without knowledge of how traits are passed down the generations, neither Darwin, nor anybody else, could envision how traits might be modified.  Mendel's work opened the door to this mystery, and Crick and Watson provided the mechanism.  Although that trio's insights gave rise to what is now known as "neo-Darwinism", the authors aren't satisfied with a "gene-centred" mechanism for heredity.  They propose a new concept they dub "facilitated variation".  The past two decades have seen a massive increase of what occurs in the "development" phase of an organism.  The authors draw on this work, expanding it by demonstrating how an organism does more than react to its environment.  Cells can direct changes that bypass the "classical" picture of new traits occurring only over successive generations.  Variations can happen during life, making the organism more "fit" to meet challenges.  This ability produces the "novelties" that appear in the evolutionary record ultimately leading to new species.  Change, then, in the best Gouldian sense, can indeed be abrupt.  It can also produce radical new complexities, such as eyes, enlarged brains and novel limb forms such as wings or fins.  These changes, the authors insist, are all natural and perfectly in order due to mechanisms used in building the body.  The organism can drive transformation through an almost infinite set of options.  These options provide the foundation for "facilitated variation".  As so many authors in this field seem impelled to do, they start with William Paley's "watch on the heath".  The watch implied life is too complex to be anything but the product of a "designer".   They go on to recount how Darwin's "three pillars" - variation, heredity and selection - working over time produces complexity.  Although Darwin explained what they were, he couldn't describe how these three processes interact.  The authors recount the history of studies attempting to piece together the mechanisms.  As detailed knowledge was accumulated, it became clear that an element of "plasticity" was in place.  Organisms were not fixed within a species designation, but varied over time and place.  To the authors, this condition implies that it's not the genes driving change, but the variable options available in body development that lead to new structures and traits.  They refer to this process as "exploratory behaviour" on the part of various cell types.  Genetic change becomes smothered in the many choices available to an organism as it develops.  "Random" change, a term the authors overwork, has little role to play.  That's not surprising, since "random" in evolutionary biology remains a poorly defined term.  What "random change" are we to consider, the organism? the environment? the gene?  In conclusion, the authors, as so many writers from the US feel compelled to do, address the fallacies of "intelligent design", a concept rendered meaningless at Dover, Pennsylvania.  Kirschner and Gerhart note how Darwin's opponents in their country have made much of "holes" in the theory of evolution.  Those "gaps" have been used to weaken or destroy the entire Darwinian edifice.  The authors of this book credit "facilitated variation" with plugging the gaps and reinforcing the entire structure on a firm foundation.   Given that there exist shelves of books refuting all forms of Christian "creationism", it's inexplicable why this pair deems it necessary to devote any time to the issue.  Except for claiming their concept of how variety drives selection is the final nail in creationism's false notions, there is nothing here that hasn't been written.  Since their book is obviously intended for a lay, and not a scientific audience, perhaps they feel their explanation will gain a wider audience.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada 
 I can't believe the CD is sold in a fluo-yellow cover. I can't believe such a moron exists. It can't be true. Someone tell me it's not true!  4 & 1/2 stars for the album (and the original cover) minus 5 stars for the CD cover!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 My little brother passed away at just 17 years old on July 25th, and I remember when I first started reading year 4, he said that each book only get's better and I have a long way to go. Yes, it took me nearly three months to read this novel, but not because I'm that slow of a reader. More likely, the story and characters were so interesting that I preferred dragging out each chapter to save myself from moving forward to year 5. Year 4 was an excellent read with plenty of Potter goodness, not to mention the building plot's twists and turns, and the mysteries it would take a Sherlock Holmes to solve. Forget Holmes...it's all Potter and gang in this forth book by J.K. Rowling. As a reader, I highly recommend and back the series. As for my brother if he can read this from afar, man I miss you and I'm enjoying reading the stories you told me about. Thanks 
 The addition of Reid Hastie as an author to Robyn Dawes' classic text on judgment and decision making was superb choice. This edition appears to be written very much in Hastie's voice, from the perspective of a cognitive psychologist. Moreover, we find additional attention paid to algebraic models, which was something that was missing from previous editions. Hastie and Dawes ranks as one of the essential readings for the judgment and decision-making field 
 "If they're Laughing..." was a great read for two main reasons.  Firstly, in today's classrooms sometimes there is not a lot to laugh about.  This book allows the teacher to find ways to laugh with the students everyday.  I believe that students that laugh  and enjoy school will work hard to get to school everyday.  Secondly,  even if you don't use these ideas in class, there are lots of funny  stories and anecdotes.  I was chuckling to myself as I was reading  and relaxing (this is definitely not a typical textbook / teacher  guide read).  If you are looking to add some fun and humour to your  classroom, "If They're Laughing..." is a MUST!   EN 
 If you have a serious interest the theories and cultural symbolism of numbers, this is a solid and still accurate resource.  Though originally published in 1969, this book is a well-researched and clear overview of the ideas and concepts behind numerology and number symbolism.  Unlike most stuff published today, this books isn't some "solve all your problems with numbers!" collection of nonsense, but an insightful outlook on the origins of number symbolism 
 David Shirreff was one of the first and remains one of the few journalists to tackle the challenging subject of financial risk. In this book, he collects material from articles he published during the 1990s (a period of astonishing innovation in the field), supplemented by interviews with some of the true luminaries in the areas of financial engineering and financial risk management. Shirreff is a lucid writer with a sharp and concise style. He has the rare gift of making the complexities of finance accessible to a general readership. Therefore, we recommend this book both to financial professionals and to general readers who have an interest in the subject 
 Bought this product.  It's sensible, helpful and mindful of the time that people don't have for getting into shape.  The only gripes I've got are the UK price, 13.00 plus instead of $13.00 plus dollars and the presentation.  The green, yellow and brown undermine the message on the kit.  Instead of get fit, the presentation is more like a 50s version of how to be a frump in 30 seconds, which most people do effortlessly! Those colours need changing 
 I write this review as a frequent reader of physics books, not a professional of physics. I have found the book very clear. It gives a good overview of the Standard Model, avoiding the most speculative and innovative theories that are the focus of most of the best-seller books in the last years. It is easy to understand, although you need to have certain knowledge in particle physics, and provides with a good introduction to the main "confirmed" theories in this field.  I have not awarded the fifth star because I think there are other books that are superior to this, such as "Deep Down Things" or "The Fabric of the Cosmos" (with a different scope). Anyway, my global perception is that it is a very good book. 
 This book had a good buzz around it, and I picked it up without knowing it was about a mother dying of cancer.  That's not my usual fare, and I'm glad I got into this novel, because it was absolutely amazing.  This is a must-read for any mother or daughter, and I think it would be enjoyed by high school readers, especially those in the AP-English fast-track, because Ellen is a perfect example of a high school overahiever whose adult life gets put on hold to take care of her mother.  Many high schoolers will be able to relate to Ellen.  Ellen always favored her father when growing up, but during her mother's illnes she perceives him as completely selfish, and she starts to learn about her mother as a person.  It is tragic that it takes terminal illness for Ellen to learn about the magic of the softer side of her mother, the loving and cooking part that isn't focused on academia and a fast paced career.  Watching the mother-daughter relationship blossom while mom is under Ellen's care is abosolutely beautiful and will transport you to another place.  There's a great moral dilemma about euthanasia in here, and the novel starts out with Ellen in jail for her mother's death, and then Quindlen fills in the backstory so that the reader can decide for themselves what they think the right action was.  The Epilogue to the book brought me a sense of closure.  This is a masterpiece and I highly recommend it to any literature lover 
 I am really enjoying this book. It's been great in terms of helping me to re-think the way I feel about my body as a woman and it offers some wonderful advice on how I might be able to help my daughter do the same. If you're experiencing hormonal issues, mood swings, and other things you like to make peace with and/or gain more control over, this book offers some very helpful advice 
 Our New Cadet (Class of 2008) writes:  "I write this letter . . . as my friend read Absolutely American out loud to us.  We have sat together listening to it for a lot of free hours. . .  It's been really good for squad unity and a good way to occupy our time." 
 I received this product quickly, even though it was during the holidays.  The product arrived as advertised and perfectly packaged.  I would definitely buy from this vendor again 
 This book contains references to some drugs that I couldn't find anywhere else.  Drugs that are no longer in common use, that are used exclusively outside the US, or that have toxicity levels that are normally unacceptable may still find a listing in Martindale.  The index is very thorough.  I had only two complaints: 1) I don't understand why some drugs information is dropped when new editions come out --  I would rather see the book simply grow, rather than sometimes requiring access to older editions, and 2) it doesn't present molecular structures (sigh).  Still, the opportunity to find information that is otherwise simply unavailable (try to find dosing schedules for potassium bromide elsewhere, to pick an example) outweighs any complaints 
 This book could be said to be a rougher edged, true John LeCarre novel, and it is equally hard to put down. The author served in many of the areas in the news today from the mid 70's to the mid 90's. Baer was an on the ground operative speaking Arabic and running Arab agents. He finally quit when he saw the C IA turning into the see-no evil,, hear-no evil, do-no evil spy agency that has proved so ineffective in the new century. Agents now are mostly yuppies who cannot speak local languages and are discouraged from taking any risks. The result is no reliable intelligence. "See No Evil" is a paean and an obituary for a spy agency that has no spies. It is also a history of the CIA when it did have spies and the background for events in the Middle East today. Entertaining, and educational -- pretty good 
 The problem with this work is that the sections are of uneven quality; the worst being the chapter on the Armada.  There are numerous historical errors and anachronisms: On p. 30 Mary I of England is confused with Mary Queen of Scots; p. 38 the English captains are called "skippers" and the Ottoman fleet was "perforated" by the Spaniards.  The book has been carelessly proofread On p. 41 messages in oared boats are delayed by "bad roads"; and nautical terminology often misused.  Pages-57-58 has maskets being used in a tercio to protect the Pikemen from cavalry!   The discussion of Pearl Harbor and Midway neglects the most recent books on the topic such as "The Shatterd Sword"; and suffers from being unable to use data that would have supported Boot's Theories! The book is at its best in the 20th and 21st century periods; and particularly on the period after 9/11.  The thesis about the role of bureaucratic stuctures in warfare is quite valid and can be applied to many other fields as well.  The right amount of structure and not too much or too little is crucial.  Without the proper organizational structure technology is useless.  The notes and bibliography are impressive.  T 
 One of man's unique traits is our ability to modify the world around us to suit our needs.  One oft-ignored consequence of this ability is how these modifications in turn affect man.  This book deals with the latter, and examines the whole gamut of devices, furniture, apparel, and other man-made products to see how they were created, how they evolved, and in turn how they affect man.    The examples covered in this book include shoes, chairs, keyboards, and tables.  The author compares and contrasts the presence/absence and history of these inventions across multiple societies of multiple eras to illustrate how they affect people.  For example, up to the early 1900s, chairs were rarely used in most countries of this world.  As a consequence, everyone sat on the ground or on their hams.  Then chairs came around one country at a time and relieved everyone of these daily minor inconveniences.  In return, we got chronic back and posture problems, never mind the use of resources (wood, nails, labor) to make the chairs in the first place.  A device made to ease daily life has come full circle to affect our health and that of the planet!     These and other examples make this book quite insightful and interesting.  It should be required reading for any architect, social scientist, or engineer.  
 This journal starts with a Personal Goals page to record everything from calories, fat,& carbs to workout goals, to your measurements. You can also tape a before photo for extra motivation. I look at this daily to remember my goals. The remaing journal has 3 months of pages to record food. The pages are organized in an easy-to-follow layout. Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner on the right side. Snacks, Vitamins, Physical Activity, Water & your Daily Totals on the Left side. It is easy to keep track of all your eating habits and go back over the days to see how you can improve your diet.  I plan on buying another journal when this one fills up.   I would also recommend buying "The Calorie King, Calorie, Fat, & Carbohydrate Counter" Book 
 FujiFilm 256 MB xD Picture Card, Type M ( 600004661 )  I own a FujiFilm A350 digital camera that came with a 16MB card.  This new 256MB card can hold over 300 photos at a quality that still looks good at the standard 4X6 size.  For the casual user, 256MB is more than enough memory for even a lengthy vacation or a summer of picnics or camping.    
 Plot: very interesting. Suspence: absolute and powerful. Entertainment: must keep. Hidden messages: plenty. Book ranking for series: 3rd Mysteries: more than you can count 
 The feeling of intimidation that comes from a long wine list is universal.  This book informed me enough so that I can ask the right questions and use the right words to get what I'm looking for in a wine.  For example, I was under the misconception that a "dry" wine is one that puckers my tongue and mouth -- I hate that -- so a "very dry" wine would pucker it even more.  I now know that a wine that puckers-you-up is described as "tannic" and that a "dry" wine is one that is not sweet (with no sugar left after fermentation) and there is no such thing as "very dry" (you can't have less than zero sugar).  The format of the book lets you apply the knowledge you just learned: There is a "tasting" section at the end of chapters with *affordable* wines to use to compare the many spectrums of wine such as acidity, tannicity, dryness, butteryness, etc.  I plan on hosting group wine tastings based on these sections to make the process even more enjoyable.  The tone was that of a very well-informed person but not at all condescending while being encouraging.  You can tell that the author has an immense passion for making wine approachable to everybody.  I found that every topic built upon the previous chapter (so I encourage reading it in order) and none covered the numerous potentially useless topics that a book on wine could have.  I find it hard to imagine a better book to lay the groundwork for the practicalities of selecting wine 
 From one of the greatest thinkers of all time.  We owe so much to this man, that we ought to at least consider what this document tries to teach us.  This of course does NOT reflect this group entirely, for there are GOOD people in ALL groups.  However, we must study this book and draw from it the warnings that GOD has given us through Marin Luther.  A GREAT read even if you are not religious 
 This is just a plain sweetheart of a lens.  It covers the useful 18-35 mm range (which is 27-52mm on a Nikon digital SLR, which is a VERY useful range).  This lens costs less than half the price of the (expensive) professional Nikon 17-35, and does almost as nice a job. Sufficiently nice, in fact, that most amateurs will not discern much, if any, difference.   While not built like a tank, I think that the quality of construction on this one is excellent, and more than adequate for enthusiastic amateurs and even some pros.  On a Nikon digital SLR, which will use the center portion of this lens (due to the size of the sensor in the SLR) you can expect excellent, even spectacular results.  This is a fabulous lens for landscape and nature shots, portraits, or just plain walking around taking pictures.  Someone who only wanted one lens that was not a telephoto could do much worse than to select this excellent, versatile lens.  This one is great for parties, vacations, and the works.  The images I have shot with this lens have all featured superb contrast, are very sharp, and have beautiful color rendition.  There just is not a lot not to like about this lens. I give it 4 stars for overall performance, but 5 stars for value and price/performance.  Some lenses just get it all together and work and become keepers.  This is one of those 
 If as a reader you are interested in JFK's life and place in history - regardless of where you measure on the "Camelot" scale -  you will not be disappointed with this book. All the bits and pieces from previous books and bios - good and bad - are here, in one place, presented in an engaging, (the editorial reviews use "riveting"), coherent and objective manner. And considering what we now know about this man's life, staying objective is not an easy tightrope to walk on some of the subject matter - both personal and political. Negative or positive, if it can be substantiated, it's here in this book. Where this book also differs from what I have read on JFK is that this author's narrative gives us the evolving/changing/learning individual who became President. JFK is not just a snapshot at Choate or in the Navy, a portrait above the fireplace or a tragic frame in the Zapruder film - he becomes a three dimensional human being and the author allows the reader to decide what this man means to history.  
 Stewart and his crew nail it.  If you like the Daily Show, you will love this book.  If you like political satire, you will love this book.  I have the calendar on my desk where I get a snippet of the book everyday and it reminds me of what I read and I laugh everyday.  
 I purchased both a Woodalls RV guide and Foghorn and compared them both this past Aug and Sept 2005 while RVing in WA, OR, NV and CA.  I stopped using Woodalls after the first few nights -- there is no comparison between the two.  The driving directions in Foghorn are far superior to Woodalls and the campground descriptions are more factual as I believe that Woodalls give an edge to those RV sites that advertise in their guidebook (just my gut feeling) whereas Foghorn does not accept any ads in their guidebook.     
 This book is among my favorites. I have read most or many of his books twice and always find them to be entertaining and educational. I keep a copy of Hawaii, Alaska, and Texas near at hand.  This is a nice 850 page historical novel that gives a very detailed picture of the evolution of a great state. Alaska is one of the last places to have a very clean and unspoiled environment where fish can still be seen to just jump out of the ocean.  Michener's books use a common plot formula that starts out by telling a story that reflects and utilizes the actual historical developments and time lines and people of a region. He starts back with the early native peoples that came from Asia. He adds in settlers, bush pilots, fisherman, salmon canning factories, business people, etc. He adds in more characters and phases out others - it is all fiction - as the dates move forward to current times (mid 20th century).  When I decided to review this book I was not certain if people were still interested in buying this book but I was pleased to see that there is still interest at Amazon.com in buying and reading this great story.  After this read this book I visited Alaska. If you have the resources I recommend a fishing trip to Alaska assuming that you like fishing - or just a wilderness trip. Alaska is cool even in the summers, but the clear waters, mountains and all the unspoiled wilderness and animals make it a special place. If you cannot go, then read this book. If you can go, read this first.  Good read and a good gift 
 same ideals I have read time and time again,. nothing new and it cost to much 
 This movie was so crazy it was fun.  All the big name performers were totally against character and seemed to be enjoying the experience.  Would recommend it for a laughable two hours 
 This is the first complex or psychological novel written and for me, the best.  A work of genius, although to my mind a reader should have a guide, either someone who knows the novel and has studied it or several references such as Ivan Morris's guide to the Heian era.  Genji has many very dark and cynical sides, which a reader may not see very well without a knowledge of Buddhism.  The second half of the novel, for me, was the much better part--deeply evocative, even haunting 
 One the best books on the subject. A must read, but you need to know your history and geography first, if not, have a map ready. Be prepared for a fast and furious ride through time and geography, but with constant flashbacks to the present. You will not look at the world the same way after finishing this book, provided that you have the intellectual capacity and curiousity to read it cover to cover.

 I've never watched any shows regularly on FX until this year, when I happened to catch a double episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, about 3 episodes into Season 2. I don't remember when I've laughed so hard in the past few years. This show is hysterical! Charlie Day, what can I say? I dare say he is the funniest character on television. Case in point, the episode: Hundred Dollar Baby.   The gang's walking home in the evening (Charlie, Mac, Dennis and Dee) when an apparent Meth Head tries to mug them. Charlie Mac and Dennis all run away, knocking down Dee to fend for herself (intentionally or non-intentionally? You decide.).  Dee gets mugged and decides she's going to take some kind of "box-er-cizing" thing to learn how to defend herself, but her dad Frank, played by Danny DeVito, pipes up and says if she wants to learn to defend herself she should learn from him, being that he's a former boxer ("Frankie Fast Hands"). She agrees.  In the meantime, Dennis and Mac convince Charlie to become an underground street fighter after attending one and realizing that "All you really need is to be able to take a worse beating than the other guy." Mac asks Dennis "You know who can take a beating?" And they both instantly turn to each other and say "CHARLIE."  What's great about Charlie is that he's usually up for anything as long as there's money or excitement in it, and this is no exception.  Back to Dee - at the gym she's approached by another woman who offers her some assistance in the form of so-called "Performance Enhancing Supplements." Dee's now popping pills, which Charlie sees while accidentally catching her (she doesn't know he saw her), and now Charlie is popping her pills.  I refuse to spoil the rest, but rest assured that this is one of the funniest things you will see this year, and the rest of the series is no exception.  I have yet to see an un-funny character on this show, but Charlie steals the show almost every time. Charlie Day is comedy GOLD 
 This Virginia Lee Burton Collection is absolutely outstanding.  My three little boys, ages 5, 4 and 2 love these stories and are fascinated by the illustrations.  We have read them over and over and they still ask for me to take this book off of the shelf regularly.  I admit, these stories are among my all time favorite children's stories, and the illustrations interest me as well.  My boys also love two of her other books, "Choo Choo" and "The Adventures of Calico the Wonder Horse or the Saga of Stewy Stinker."   These are excellent treasures, and I bet if the book is kept well over the years, your child when they are all grown up will happily pick up this book and read it to their children 
 This book came to my life at the perfect time. Many things happening at once and by reding it I undestood what was happening. Easy to read, beautiful insights 
 This book is a fantastic read. It outlines an easy-to-follow process for successful negotiation, giving you a guide for any situation. The examples and exercises demonstrate the methodology in real-world settings perfectly. It's full of not just theory, but practice, as well as lots of advice and useful tips. I've read it through and through - it's such a valuable resource 
 Fine review of this from Mike but I just can't agree about On The Boards,  one of my favourites. But if you need just one good reason to buy this then  get it for the live version of Feel So Good (it's the superior Live Taste  version not the one on the Isle of Wight album). When the Live Taste  album  came out (on vinyl) this track was split between the two sides during the  drum solo. The subsequent CD merely faded out and faded back in again where  the break was (unforgiveable!) - this CD restores the track to one  magnificent whole. I think Mike's wrong about the availabilty of Taste on  CD, I still see all four albums from time to time in the shops but had to  get the Best of from the States. Don't be afraid to pick up On The Boards  (Eat My Words, What's Going On, If The Day Was Any Longer, Railway and Gun  . . . all great). Get the Best of, but you'll still need that flawed Live  Taste CD for Gamblin Blues (which is not on the Isle of Wight CD incidently  but is on the video, which has two Taste tracks not just the one credited  on the sleeve 
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The book is exactly what it says it is, a general history of the United Stated during the Depression and WWII.  I found myself wanting to know more about many topics than author wrote.  This should be expected though as the nature of a book of this type though is that some topics must be treated in a rather cursory manner or left out all together.  The book does provide a vivid portrait of the era and of the events and personalities that shaped it.  After reading it, I can see why it won the Pulitzer prize 
 This is an incredible CD. Two albums for such a great price. But the price is not the important thing here. What is important is the sheer brilliance of the drumming prodigy Tony Williams. Speaking as a drummer, this disc was simply jaw dropping. The blazingly quick hi-hat patterns, the very intricate tom patterns, and the overall musicality Tony displayed on the drum set deserves a standing O. Any drummer who wants to be inspired should have this CD 
 I found that this book is excellent as an overview and introduction to herbal magic. It includes basic theory, practice, some common traditions, forms of mixtures/spells, and simple mixtures/spells for common themes. The book will give the reader a very broad overview from which the reader can determine whether or not he/she would like to study herbal magic in greater depth.  If you are looking for a reference on most of the common herbs and their uses or a book of spells, this is not the best book for your purpose. A better beginning book for referencing herbs is Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs. Cunningham's Complete Book of Incense, Oils, and Brews is a better choice for beginners seeking mixtures/spells 
 Jeffrey Smith has given us a devastating and authoritative indictment of the safety of Genetically Modified foods, the corruption and greed of big business and of the failure of government agencies to protect us.  To cover GM soy in my book "The Whole Soy Story," I investigated Monsanto's testing methods and found numerous examples of experimental manipulation, misinterpretation, falsified conclusions and flagrant disregard of data.  So I have no doubt that the testing of the FlavrSavr tomato, StarLink corn and other GM seeds was similarly inadequate, incomplete and rigged to reach favorable conclusions.  I am particularly pleased that Smith honors the brilliance and integrity of Dr. Arpad Pusztai, whose honest revelation that GM potatoes cause immune, brain, and reproductive damage cost him his job and exposed him to vicious attacks by Monsanto and the British government.  Here in the USA, the FDA bills itself as "The Nation's Foremost Consumer Protection Agency." Yet its handling of GM seeds shows that it is not only being asleep on the job but in bed with big business.  As consumers, we must demand independent safety assessments, let food manufacturers know that we will not eat GM foods and, most important, vote with our pocketbooks.  Thank you Jeffrey Smith for giving us the evidence and motivation to do so.  
 With a deep respect for my late dad's generation of WWII veterans, I recently listened as one recalled a bit of his WWII exploits as a B17 tail gunner. Time flew, the graduation party that brought us together was over, and I left to return home. I looked forward to hearing more in future meetings. Sad to say, that'll never happen. Louis Holmer has taken his tales with him in passing away on December 6, 2006. WING DING Memories of a Tailgunner enabled me to appreciate him even in his absence. My thanks go out to Lt. Col. Gene T. Carson RET for writing of his experiences and allowing future generations a glimpse into WWII history on a very personal level. 
 The Fortune-Tellers is an interesting story about a carpenter who wishes he could have more and wants to know about his future and what it holds.  He goes to a fortune teller and asks what his future holds for him.  The fortune-teller on the other hand is a fraud as you can tell just by the first thing he says.  "Rich you will surely be"..."if you earn large sums of money." This is the kind of talk that the fortune teller tells this poor, innocent carpenter. Unfortunately the carpenter buys all this and he goes back to his work.  After thinking, he wanted to know more about his future and goes back to the fortune teller to ask questions.  Waiting for him is a special twist you would've never expected.  This book is great for children 10 an under and even some adults.  It's a great African folktale teaching one about karma in a sense. 
 I really enjoyed this book.  The topic is one I was not really informed about and I enjoyed learning about the Japanese customs and what they went through during WWII.  I loved the characters and lived their joys and heartbreak with them.  The last Danielle Steel I read was a dud so I was not really looking forward to this one but I am pleasantly surprised.  I will continue to give Ms Steel a try 
 Though it's easy to  critique Elaine Scarry's logic and the completeness of her argument, that would miss this book's true importance. As a matter of fact, what's important about On Beauty is that it stood in the face of 20 years of literary and aesthetic criticism, a howling wind into which Scarry makes a simple claim: that the appreciation of beauty presses us toward justice and not away from it. In its simplicity, Scarry's proposition is as brilliant and unprovable now as it was then. But propositions are not the truth; they stake a claim to right action, and Scarry's courageous stand has liberated artists and writers to pursue right action as it resonates with what their eyes and ears hold to be a good and true beyond logic. Scarry uses arguments and descriptions from fellow travellers as various as Homer, Simone Weil. and John Rawls. It's a tour de force ending with a vision of the trireme as the birthplace of athenian democratic values. The logic that connects that vision to the political possibiities immanent in the visual world are as profound and mysterious as any attempt to defend beauty could ever be. Somehow, Scarry manages exactly what she claims for beauty: pressing us toward the good without suspending our desire for all things pleasurable. 
 Maniac Magee  This summary is about a boy that runs away from home and that does not have parents and money his name is Maniac Magee he is poor and his white and has been discriminated he found a girl in the street and made her a friend her name was Amanda.  The theme of this story is about discrimination and racism they discriminate a lot to maniac.  What I learned from this story was that I should never discriminate someone just because of their color of skin or because they don't have any parents. Also I learned that even though he does not have parents he tried to look for his future so that's what I learned about this story. 
 I really enjoyed this book. When I picked it up I wasn't sure what to expect but it has not disappointed. It is the most amazing life story (so far) of a young boy born into a life of drug dealing, gangs and organised crime. It follows the tale of Burrel as he grows up, as he makes illegal millions only to lose it all. How on earth he lived to tell the tale is a mystery. What he has done however, is turned his experiences into positives, this is a real story of ethics and transformation. This book offers two things, a real insiders account into the gang culture and crime worlds of Chicago. It is also a great read, compelling and incredible. I couldn't put it down. If you want to deepen your understanding of gang culture this is for you but if you just want a great page-turner of a story this is it too. 
 My son and I love this book.  It really teaches empathy and he would get sad but happy at the end.  He also asked a lot of questions which made me believe that he was learning.  Would definately recommend 
 I've watched this movie dozens of times since I was a child. I love it. I understand that it doesn't follow the book exactly, but they were making a movie, not filming a book. The actor who played Mary was wonderful. The character of Colin annoyed me somewhat, but I don't have to love every character in a story to adore it. I love the romance of the ending, but I was very sad that Dickon died. The soundtrack is incredible; I read another review where the reader said she found herself humming the soundtrack even though she hasn't seen the movie in quite some time. You're not the only one! It is haunting to say the least.   The only discrepancy I found in the movie is this: If the movie is a flashback for Mary, then how could she have remembered certain scenes, such as Archibald Craven dreaming of his wife when he was on the Alps, and the conversation between Mrs. Medlock and Dickon's mother? That never made sense to me, even as a child. I explain to myself that she was simply remembering the time period and the movie simply was including all parts of the story. And the last thing that scared the bee-jeebies out of me as a child was the scene in the beginning when the cat jumps at Mary.  All in all, I love this movie and will watch it dozens of more times. 
 Jack Johnson is amazing, and along with Jimi Hendrix and Shawn McDonald, is my favorite solo artist. This is his masterpeice. He is the true acoustic guitar-mellow man. Every song just takes you away from the blah-blah-blah of every day life and makes you feel good, and makes you slow down, and simply enjoy life as it is, as well as make you conscience of what we are making it. A genuis lyricist and musician, definitely a 5-star 
 The New Folger Library of Shakespeare's Tragedies and Comedies are among the best pocket editions available for the student and the journeyman lover of the Bard.    Before the actual text of the play which is wisely presented on the right hand page with explanatory notes (metaphors, allusions, similes, etc.)  facing on the left hand page (words and phrases are defined by scholars based on their usage during Shakespeare's time; if scholars are inconclusive as to meaning, the word `uncertain' is used to connote this disagreement), the usual `Reading Shakespeare's Language', `Shakespeare's Life', `Shakespeare's Theatre', `Publication of Shakespeare's Plays' and `Introduction to the Text' introduce the reader to the Shakespearean world.  Following the text, an essay by Alexander Leggatt follows illuminating `The Merchant of Venice' for the modern reader.  In addition, an eleven page `Further Reading' list pinpoints books and essays on topics like the play itself, Shakespeare, the time in which he lived and the Globe Theatre. Rounding out the vital information is a three page "Key to Famous Lines and Phrases" complete with speaker and verse notation.  As far as the play itself, I will keep my remarks limited, saying only that for the modern audience, Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice" borders on the provocative.  All with politically correct upbringing or today's cultural sensitivity training cannot help but focus on the reigning prejudice of the early Medieval and Renaissance time period, namely the exclusion of Jews from all forms of normal life since mainstream thought withheld that this race was primarily responsible for Christ's crucifixion.   Indeed, today's reader will pose the question as to whether or not this play should be deemed more tragedy than comedy and must remember that as a comedy, "The Merchant of Venice" focuses on marriage, couples (Bassanio/Portia, Lorenzo/Jessica, Gratiano/Nerissa) and their emotional and financial interrelationships and uses sly humor and innuendo to poke fun at Venice's societal `outsiders'(Shylock, Morocco, Aragorn and in a lesser sense Antonio) who do not form a Shakespearean couple per se.   Looked at from this perspective, the character of Shylock becomes simply the play's foremost societal outcast, in spite of the famous speech where he asks seemingly so poignantly, "If you prick us, do we not bleed?"   Bottom line:  Shakespeare is Shakespeare.  If your modern sensibilities are offended by Shakespeare's treatment of Shylock the Jew, the Prince of Morocco and the Prince of Aragorn and question the unhappy and solitary Antonio's intense feelings for Bassanio, simply keep in mind that the world at that time looked at such things differently.  Within the definition of comedy, this play with its multitude of lovely speeches and images works well indeed.  The New Folger Library edition simply makes the play more easily accessible and understood on the various levels of language and scholarship.  I recommend this series wholeheartedly.    Diana F.

 I bought this book/journal for myself and liked it so much that I also bought one for my close friend when she found out she was pregnant.  It does not have much space for writing, but I was not looking for a diary.  The features I really enjoy are the detailed developmental commentary, the health tips, and the quotes about pregnancy, birth, and parenting.  It is also nice to have the spiral binding since I can flip back and forth easily. 
 I have used this book as a reference guide for everything between athelete's foot to zinc and I have found it to be very useful. In fact, I loaned the book to my brother and he refuses to give it back. I bought  another copy for me and a few more for gifts. Not everything that they  recommend works, but I have a high deductable for medical insurance, and I  have saved many trips to the doctor by reading this book 
 In this prequel to Heaven, it answers questions that Marley wondered about Bobby's past.  (I saw on the back a picture of another book called Heaven; at the end, Bobby was moving to heaven, Ohio.  I wondered if they had anything to do with each other. ) 	Each "then" and "now" chapter could stand alone as a small story, esp. the first two pages.  The First Part Last has a lyrical quality, with spare, laconic sentences. 	You can see Bobby's love and gentleness towards Feather, plus painful memories because she looks like her mother Nia. 	Recommended to me by Amazon, I borrowed it from my library when I saw it.  Seeing the book cover from a small picture on Amazon (I didn't bother to see a bigger picture because I thought I'd never read it.), I thought the person on the cover was a serious female sitting and thinking.  I didn't see the baby or that the person holding it was male. (Another lesson about not judging a book by its cover, though I would have read it either way.) 	Many teenagers face this dilemma of pregnancy, but I haven't read a book as masterful at portraying this topic as this one.  Angela Johnson has become my favorite author. Sensitive to the feelings of a boy...a non-sexist book...boys can feel love and have emotions. 
 LOVE IT!!!  Every young girl, teenage girl, and woman should read this book! 
 A middling effort by Carl Hiaasen still rates as a better than average read, and Skin Tight will not rank even remotely near his better stuff like Skinny Dip and Striptease.  Maybe it's not fair to call this a middling effort though, since it was written in 1989.  Since then Hiaasen has just written a lot of very, very good books.  Dated though it may be this is still a lot of fun!  Mick Stranahan is a retired detective, semi-forced into retirement by a fatal encounter with a corrupt judge.  That alone might explain why someone is trying to kill him, but nothing is ever quite so simple as it seems.  How else to explain the lethal impact of a weed whacker?  And is it possible that the people behind the movie Fargo happened to read Skin Tight while writing that movie?  Inquiring minds want to know since the two otherwise disparate efforts share a black comedy style with a single semi-critical plot twist.  You'll get a further update of Stranahan's adventures in crime and love, in the more recent Skinny Dip.  But this makes for a great introduction.  As with all of Hiaasen's books that I've read, this is a perfect book to share.  Do you have a significant other that likes to read aloud from the newspaper?  Does your traveling companion think that the latest Alan Greenspan lecture is one that has to be shared in minute detail?  Trust me, you'll find plenty of return fire in Hiaasen's writing.  You'll be laughing aloud so often, and with such volume that they will be begging you to explain what's so funny.  And even if they don't, you'll want to read parts aloud just because you can! 
 Dr. Agatston developed the diet for his chronically overweight heart patients. Soon, thanks to his patients' results, Dr. Agatston's diet became all the buzz in Miami.   The South Beach Diet is divided into three different Phases. The first Phase lasts for two weeks and is the strictest of the three. Each Phase includes specific allowable foods on the Foods to Enjoy list, as well as meal plans and recipes.  Dr. Agatston says decreasing the bad carbs will help you metabolize what you eat more effectively and will also improve insulin resistance, leading to weight loss. The diet is based on the Glycemic Index.   He says you will become accustomed to eating the good carbs and fats and leaving the bad ones behind. He says by doing so you can lose anywhere between 8 and 13 pounds in the first two week 
 Doctor Zhivago is a dramatic tragedy that, in a world of disaster and misfortune, reminds humanity of its' most enduring traits and precious ability to endure through catastrophe even when survival may be bleaker than if it could simply put an end to its' endless cycle of futility.  Pasternak's work covers a genre that has been lost in our society's infatuation with apathy for the human condition and sacrifice of self-insight for the comfort of purely optimistic media. The art of tragedy that was so important to our understanding of our selves has been lost in contemporary literature. It is extremely healthy for humanity to be reminded of and critically reflect on tragedy, for it is in catastrophe that humanity reveals its primordial characteristics. Pasternak wonderfully explores this human tragedy by following the life of Yurii Zhivago through the calamity of the Russian revolution. It is a story of a man desperate to hold on to his loves as the world brutally tears them from his grasp. Through relentless misfortune Zhivago loses comfort, home, and love, left bare to confront his changing life but fervently clinging to his past, ripping his soul and dying of a broken heart.  The disaster of Doctor Zhivago makes this novel a tragedy but it is tragedy's tendency not to suffocate humanity but to encourage its' best. Zhivago is survived by his three daughters; the promise of survival, they are the life that springs from tragedy; destined for futility but forever hopeful. Humanity harbors an incredible ability to endure tragedy, and in its grimmest state, not only to survive, but survive with hope. This hope, however foolish, preserves humanity and lets it continue stumbling not forwards, nor backwards, but simply stumbling on. Doctor Zhivago rekindles peoples' love of tragedy so civilization can retain a beautifully romantic faith in fortune's wheel 
 Mr. Show, season Three, is quite possibly one of the funniest things you will ever see. Unless you're blind, then you're SOL.  The mad minds behind the first two brilliant seasons, Bob Odenkirk and David Cross, return to reprise their roles as "Bob" and "David" (apart from understudy Kedzie Matthews, who takes over for Bob when he has to go shopping). They bring the funny, they make you laugh, they make you wonder how such a glorious creation could exist in the absence of a just and caring God.  Quite simply, this is the finest American sketch comedy I've ever seen (and yes, I have seen Mad TV). If you want smart, savvy, hip and hilarious comedy...this will have to do. No, it's better than that. It will change your life.  I used to be in debt all the time, then I got Mr. Show...I'm still in debt, but the laughter they elicit in me distracts from my gnawing hunger pains!  Anyway, get this when you can (preferably before the Rapture) 
 I am surprised to see so many negative reviews of this book.  Unlike most authors who tackle the subject of the Philadelphia Experiment,  Moore and Berlitz stick to hard evidence as much as possible, and attempt to make a genuine argument instead of simply printing incredible stories.  The book is also well written, which is a testament to the professionalism of the authors.  The problem it suffers from most is that many of its human sources wish to remain anonymous, which hinders any research ino their credibility.  I am still skeptical of the whole incident, but here is my final thought:  If you want to be entertained by Al Bielek, look elsewhere.  If you want something with some real substance, Moore and Berlitz are your source 
 Not only is the music market currently flooded with dud bands offering sad pastiches of 1980s synth rockers, there's also a glut of bad compilations that habitually gather together the decade's worst sonic offenders. Praises to the compilers of 12"/80s/2 are in order, since this three disc set gathers together over 30 remixed cuts only vinyl conneiseurs will have heard before. Generally drawing from the UK's best in New Wave and New Romantic, highlights over the three hour compendium include obvious 12" mixes from New Order, Duran Duran and Frankie Goes To Hollywood. Less obvious tracks that offer flavour include Echo & The Bunnymen's The Killing Moon (Up All Night Mix) and the forgotten Belouis Some's Imagination (12" Mix), although Spandau Ballet's Chant Number 1 and Yello's The Race are truly awful. Both seen as touchstones to the later hip hop renaissance, Tom Tom Club and Malcolm McLaren each present tidy and uncomplicated beats, while moody old friends The Cure and Siouxsie & The Banshees prove Goths aren't afraid of a solid dance overhaul thanks to the excellent sounds of The Walk (Extended Mix) and Peek A Boo (Silver Dollar Mix) respectively. Neatly providing an aural history of the remix phenomenon in its infancy, 12"/80s/2's more than three hours of massive hits and glorious misfires from the era of denim skirts, E.T. and Cabbage Patch Kids 
 The story is of a young, honest cop going against the crooked establishment. The characters are well described and believeable. It is a good, gritty read 
 Purchased this as gifts for two men; they loved it!  Both are very appreciative of where they live and how lucky they are.  John Wayne is someone they both respect 
 Excellent presentation of past and present information about the culture groups of native North America, arranged alphabetically and accompanied by a terrific selection of pictures. This reference book is easy enough to read that it works as a children's resource, but it doesn't 'dumb down' or get lost in silly romanticizing. I could recommend this book to anyone with an interest, but particularly for school libraries 
 Everything has gone smoothly from the moment I ordered Entertainment Weekly from this seller.  It's a pleasure to do business with them and I plan on using them again in the future for my next magazine purchase.  
 I am a huge fan of Michael Nesmith's solo music and his music with The Monkees. If you enjoy The Monkees then I strongly recommend that you check out the following:  1) Teenage Symphonies To God by The Velvet Crush  2) Papa Nez: A Loose Salute To The Work Of Michael Nesmith by Various Artists  3) Home by Josh Rouse  4) Summer Teeth by Wilco 
 Rutland Place is one of the most successful of Anne Perry's novels about Thomas and Charlotte Pitt.  The mystery encompasses Charlotte's family which gives the events more immediacy for the reader who has been going through all of the novels, and the nuances of the Victorian withdrawing room have never been better portrayed by Ms. Perry.  In addition, the misdirection away from the evil doers and what they did works pretty well in this one.  As the story opens, Charlotte finds that her mother is distraught over the loss of a locket.  Originally, her mother explains this distress as being concern because her mother-in-law gave her the locket as a gift.  But later, Charlotte finds out that there's a powerful personal reason for getting that locket back.  In the backdrop, it soon becomes apparent that others have lost small items of jewelry.  Since the losses have occurred in many houses, it cannot be one of the servants . . . it must be "the quality" behind it.  But what's the motive?  The mystery develops into a murder investigation when a woman dies in a way that can hardly be an accident . . . or suicide.  But who did it?  And why?  And how is the lost locket involved?  The book's main weakness is that the locket story line doesn't quite carry off its initial promise.    If you've run out of novels that you enjoy about Victorians and their mannerly evasions, you'll enjoy this one 
 Excellent toys for the handyman wanna be.  My son has played with the tools everyday since he got them in the mail.  Very durable as he is 2 and like to pound on everything 
 Hip Hip Hooray for Amazin's Lethi's book Total Strength Training for Women, even though I'm a man. I've been around texts on gym workouts, but I think Amazin's insightful touch is that 'She' prepares the reader, mentally right at home as needed before picking-up any weights anywhere, ever 
 I'm a long-time John Badham fan (going back to the first feature of his I saw, the made-for-TV "Isn't It Shocking?" with Alan Alda, Ruth Gordon and Louise Lasser -- a classic!). He's written an invaluable little book here for anyone who wants or needs to better understand the sometimes-fragile relationship between actors and their director. Whether you're directing a $75 million studio feature or the Christmas pagent at church, you'll find real-life tools that will make your job easier and your project better. In addition, the book is chock-full of great quotes and insights from other directors and actors, as well as on-set examples of when Badham did the right thing with his actors ... and when he screwed up. This is a great book from a great director 
 I found this book to be very informative.  Although aimed at grades 6-10, it would be a great read for any age.  There is much about epidemics and medical practices that is not included in the typical history of our country, but they are important to the complete historical picture.  Mr. Murphy has done a great job in relating a story in such a compact way.  The only fault I find is that he did not include who history gives the most credit to in eradicating yellow fever and malaria - William Crawford Gorgas.  Overall, this book would be a great addition to a classroom 
 i have read many books & know from real life & working experience that what the author says is true, & it is a very realistic & nicely done analogy of the progression of ambition & our mental & physical states (although they vary between individuals) throughout our  working lives~thank you very much for this stud 
 To me, it looks as if Wilson turned to be a great scientist against all odds. He did not come from the academic royalty, but from a broken family in Alabama. With strong intuition, lot of hard work and endless enthusiasm, he became one of the great scientists of the 20th century. A well written book, that would probably change the course of my life have I read it at the right age.. 
 Sinclair Lewis was the first American writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature with a remarkable collection of books including Babbitt and Main Street. I have to say that he writes clearly most of the time. There are times that I wished that he would just get on with it. Zenith is small town America and that is where the protagonist and family lives. George is supposed to be satisifed with his mundane life but he isn't just like Carol wasn't in Main Street. Small town life seems suffocate George and Carol and that is theme in Lewis' novels. If you despise your hometown or small town life, then read Sinclair Lewis. I am just surprised that there is no movie based on his works. Maybe they would not work because it is character driven and not plot driven today. I know that Sinclair Lewis novels like Elmer Gantry and Dodsworth were adapted to the screen. Classics like Babbitt are timeless and should be taught in schools and adapted to the screen. American Classics like Babbitt and Main Street seem to be disregarded in favor of lighter, inferior fare for the audiences. We have to stop dummying down the audiences' mentality 
 It was a good book, but I thought it was a woman for a long time because of the depth of thought. Men just don't think like that, and the author put too much thought process into everything 
 I began reading about Shamanism, when the Castenada books hit the bookstore, and I quit reading half way through his series, because he lost me in the twist and turns of his learning process. When I began reading Hank's SpiritWalker, it was with serious reservatons; however, I quickly moved on to MedicineMaker with enthusiasm. I liked Hank's intellectual grasp of the indigenous point of view, combined with his *field-note* anthropological mentality, which was a good mix with my own blend of white-urban core shamanistic practice. Soon, VisionSeeker was published. I bought a copy and started reading. I began to underline whole paragraphs to reread. For me, in VisionSeeker, Hank succeeded in pulling together the esoteric teachings, that rest on the shamanistic foundation he developed in his two preceding volumes. Granted, I am of mystical persuasion, so Hank's use of symbolism and metaphor was not lost on me. Hawaiian mysticism is easy to understand within Hank's storytelling context. I encourage you to buy a copy of this book for your library, since there are few volumes that will teach you more. Thanks Hank, for living your life so authentically. I have benefitted from your written experience. And, if you have a chance to spend some time with Hank personally, DO IT 
 This graphic novel/kids' book is part of a series that puts the story of The Incredibles in comic book-form for young readers. This book picks up after Syndrome's capture of the Incredibles (or Parrs), and ends with their defeat of the powerful Omnidroid! BEWARE - If your young reader hasn't seen the movie yet, wait to get this book, or you will spoil a few things for him or her.  Also included are eight punch-out hero trading cards! VERY COOL!  Now, I found the illustrations in this book to be very good, but not great. But, that said, it is faithful to the movie, and makes a great gift for a young reader. So, if you have a young fan of The Incredibles (and anyone who has seen it is a fan!), then you really must get him or her this book. My children and I highly recommend it to you

 I have actually purchased this book twice now, once about 10 years ago and it was the best book then! then I lost the book in the Cedar fire in 2003.  Now we are ready to go camping again, so what book did I look for? That's right, the Complete Guide but realized it had been burned like all the others.  So I quickly purchased it again, and upon its receipt and review am amazed at all the new campsites he has added and all the fantastic information! The one thing I miss-all my notes I had made in the other book! Oh well, time to start the new one 
 great choice for the casual to heavy duty sansa user.  strong and looks good.  It even comes with a clear plastic screen saver. I am very happy with this product 
 I love these headphones.  Combined with the Sound Blaster X-Fi, it gives me the best sound I've ever heard from my PC.  Really great value for someone looking for a first set of above average headphones 
 Suzanne Somers has done it again! This book states what I have been telling my patients for the last 8 years, which is that bio-identical hormones do work. Women feel better, look better and are more able to control their lives. Suzanne's book is very readable, and as usual, Ms. Somers is very honest and exceedingly helpful for the menopausal woman.

 How could we not adore this set? Our dear friend Terry Fisher's greatest movies for Hammer plus the creme de la creme of their canon of movies. Beautifully presented, wonderfully transferred to dvd. Our author friend Tom Johnson's quite right when he says "You made 'em - we got 'em!" and how glad we are that the US has preserved them so well.If only you'd do the British print of Dracula (not Horror of Dracula) you'd make two old codgers who fell in love to these movies very, very happy! As it is, if you are reading this and you dont yet know Hammer - buy the set and immerse yourself in the best british cinema has offered in this genre.Enjoy 
 Despite being around for over 65 years, Batman's popularity never seems to wane.  The blockbuster Batman film in 2005 once again generated enormous interest in the character.  "Batman: The Ultimate Guide to the Dark Knight" has been updated right up through 2005 to ride this crest of popularity.  The book is really geared towards the more casual or new Batman fans, as old-timers will already be familiar with much of the material inside the 144 page, hardcover book.  Still, the book moves the reader on a rapid fire history of the character beginning with his origin and creation by Bob Kane way back in 1939.    Techie fans will love the intense coverage of all of the "wonderful toys" that Batman uses.  His utility belt includes such items as tear gas pellets, an acetylene torch, a palm top communicator, grappling hook, and more.  The book also presents a look at each of the Batmobiles and how the style has changed over the years from a rather modest sedan to today's sleek, armored road-killer packed with the latest cutting-edge technology.  There's also a look at the various other "bat vehicles" including the Bat-plane, Bat-sub, Bat-Copter, etc...There is also a nicely diagrammed, cut-away view of the Bat-cave.  Most of the major characters in Batman lore are featured including allies such as Commissioner Gordon, the various Robins, Batgirl, Oracle, loyal butler Alfred Pennyworth, and Azrael.  Then there are the Batman romantic interests: Vicky Vale, Silver St. Cloud, Talia Al Ghul, and Julie Madison.  But what would any Batman book that calls itself "Ultimate" be without a rundown of the caped crusaders rogues gallery of villains.  Batman's villains are almost as famous as he is and have played a huge role in the character's long-lasting popularity.  They are all here:  The Joker, Riddler, Penguin, Catwoman, Bane, Mr. Freeze, Scarecrow, Mad-Hatter, Two-Face, and many more.  All with brief sections noting their real name and first comic book appearance.  The book covers some of the more well-known storylines in Batman history such as the Death in the Family storyline where the Jason Todd Robin was killed by the Joker.  Unfortunately the book fails to mention that this gimmick storyline hinged on a fan vote via phone call to determine if Robin lived or died.  Another notable storyline mentioned is Frank Miller's landmark mini-series The Dark Knight Returns.    Finally, there is a fantastic look at the Golden Age Batman as well as a timeline noting important events and stories in Bat-history along with the issue number where it took place.  If I do have one nit about the book it's that issue numbers are not provided for some of these noted storylines although you can find most of them in the timeline section.  The book features incredible artwork from the host of artists who have worked on the various Batman titles over the years including: Neal Adams, Jim Aparo, Brian Bolland, Paul Gulacy, P. Craig Russell, Dick Giordano, and many, many more.  All in all, "Batman: The Ultimate Guide to the Dark Knight" definitely lives up to its grand title!  Reviewed by Tim Janson 
 I was given this book a week ago by a professor of mine, and read it with more relish than any book in a long time.  A truly lovely book!  I have spent a fair amount of time at monasteries and convents, and my sister, about Sister Cecily's age, 24 (but in character much more like Sister Hillary), is a nun in a very traditional community.  Godden captures both the realism and the beauty of the consecrated life.    I have two responses after reading this book. The first is to become a cloistered Benedictine nun (!), and the second is to give this book to everyone I know to help them understand the reality of life in a convent.  Most people cannot begin to fathom why anyone would chose such a life, and more than one person told my sister that they thought she was wasting her life by entering a convent.  In This House of Brede provides a beautiful apology for the importance of "being" over "doing".  Oh yes, I also had a third response.  Reading the book caused in me such a great desire to sing Gregorian Chant that I pulled down my Gradual Triplex and sang for the next hour or so!  And now too, as I write this, I am listening to the Benedictine Sisters of Regina Laudis chanting the Office.  This is a wonderful book to read for Lent, and I've found it encouraging both my prayer and my work.  My biggest dilemma is deciding to whom to give my copy now that I'm finished 
 Good map if you want plenty of detail.  Large scale makes it easy to navigate through London.  Shows many well known tourist spots as well as hotels, stores and tube stops.  Worth the price

 This book is a must read for politicians, activists and researchers.  It shows without a shadow of a doubt that sanctions against American multinationals in South Africa did not work.  Why do we keep using them as weapons?  Read this one 
 I recently purchased a Weber Gold Series grill and wanted quality grilling tools that complimented the stainless steel design of the grill. I decided on this spatula because of the quality normally associated with the Weber name and I was not disappointed.  The spatula handle is attractive and has a rubber grip for comfort.  The length of the spatula is great for reaching the back of the grill and for large flanks of fish.  I would highly recommend this spatula for anyone who is searching for a quality accessory to their Weber grill! 
 What can I say that other reviewers did not say, I can say this is Bette Midler's best album, since "Bette Of Roses" & a impressive "Bathhouse Betty". This album is full of joy, goosebumps & Christmas spirit. Bette does beautiful renditions of Christmas classics such as a "Merry Christmas", "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas", "I'll Be Home For Christmas", "O Come, O Come, Emmanuel", a Christmas version filled with additional lyrics to Bette's hit song "From A Distance" and a "White Christmas". Also this album contains some fun little numbers like a sassy "Cool Yule", a traditional "Winter Wonderland/Let It Snow!, Let It Snow!, Let It Snow!" with Johnny Mathis, a Jazzy "What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?", a "For The Boys" style "I've Got My Love To Keep Me Warm", a Hawaii "Mele Kalikimaka" since Bette is Hawaiian. This is a great Bette Midler album & and a great Christmas album that is perfect for Christmas time and Christmas events!. 
 It's a great to have HD content even before the HD-DVD or Blue Ray discs start shipping. Picture and sound quality are great, Stings music reallly brings something extra to the soundtrack compared to other IMAX films 
 This book is a breath of fresh air.  It keeps you laughing and thinking positively in spite of whatever comes your way in life.  It is a GREAT book for a no good very bad day!  
 Millionaire Fredrick Loren played by a young Vincent Price invites five strangers to a party in the House On Haunted Hill. With his delectable wife Annabel in tow, he has set the strangers a task of sorts, if they can spend one night locked in the house he will give them $10,000 each, however there is a bit of a catch to this seemingly generous offer, the house has seen several brutal murders and is reputed to be haunted.  One of the guests in the house was even related to one of the victims and he is emphatic that the whole house is haunted and that they are all doomed because of what they are doing.  At midnight the door is locked and everyone in the house waits to see what will happen next, and very soon all are locked into a game of terror and murder as the House on Haunted Hill takes on a life of its own, but there is a twist in the tale that is deliciously surprising as it is fun.  I enjoyed this film, it wasn't overly suspenseful, but there are enough scenes to make you jump every now and then, the special effects were none-existent and there was a lot of screaming and shrieking from the character Norah a young woman who appears to be being targeted by the ghosts in the house.  All in all a hokum of a movie but great fun all the same.  
 Dr. Phil: My first guest tonight is a man who has some impulse-control problems.   Raskolnikov: What do you want? When will you leave off tormenting me?   Dr. Phil: Hold it right there. Seems to me you need an attitude adjustment.   (Raskolnikov turns abruptly and stares at the wall.)   Dr. Phil: Says here you murdered an old lady for her money. You murdered her, and then you murdered her sister. What were you thinking?   Raskolnikov: (Making a violent effort to understand what it all means) I murdered myself, not them! It was the Devil that killed them. Enough, enough! I killed a noxious insect of no use to anyone, so what is the object of these senseless sufferings?   Dr. Phil: You need to get a grip on yourself, and you need to take some responsibility and make healthier choices.   (Applause from studio audience.)   Raskolnikov: (Breathing heavily, his upper lip twitching.) My choice was to be a great man dedicated to improving the lot of humanity. The vast mass of mankind is mere material, and only exists in order by some mysterious process to bring into the world at last one man out of a thousand with a spark of independence.   Dr. Phil: Let's talk about the independence thing, since you brought it up. You're still receiving money from your mother, isn't that right? And you have a college degree but no job? And recently you've embarked on a life of crime?   Raskolnikov: The extraordinary man has the right to find in his own conscience a sanction for murder, if it is essential to the practical fulfillment of his idea. Our rulers destroy men by millions themselves and look on it as a virtue. They are knaves and scoundrels.   Dr. Phil: Ho ho, well I'm not an expert on politics, but don't you think you have enough problems of your own to keep us busy here? I understand you're in love with a prostitute?   Raskolnikov: Sonia is a woman of the utmost purity whom I love with a Christ-like intensity that drives me to torment and humiliate her.   Dr. Phil: Be honest with me now. Don't you think she'd prefer a relationship in which two healthy people come together because they complement each other on an equal footing of respect and love?   (Applause from studio audience.)   Raskolnikov: (Grinds his teeth.) A dull animal rage boils within me.   Dr. Phil: We need to extinguish these self-defeating behavior patterns of yours.   Raskolnikov: Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart.   Dr. Phil: I one-hundred percent disagree. You can do better than that. Now I understand Sonia can't be here tonight because she's ministering to the needs of plague victims, but once you get out of prison for those murders, supposing this Sonia's still waiting for you, what do you think  you'll have to do to repair the damage you've already done to the relationship?   Raskolnikov: My mind is clouded and I am almost unconscious of my body.   Dr. Phil: I'm sending you to the green room to do some figuring.   Raskolnikov: Why must you persecute me with kindness, when I would rather boil over with a rapturous agony. (Laughs insanely.) Perhaps I am really mad, and all this happens only in my imagination.   Dr. Phil: Nope, you ain't getting you off the hook that easy. Fact is, you are accountable for your actions. What I'm asking you to do is take responsibility. Are you willing to give that a try?   Raskolnikov: (Bows down to kiss the earth.) Good God, man is a vile creature.   Dr. Phil: Do we have a deal or not?   Raskolnikov: I could strangle you at this moment. Why must you torture me? I feel a physical hatred for you, cannot bear you near me, and am becoming convinced that you are the most aggravating bully on the face of the Earth.   Dr. Phil: You see, now we're getting somewhere. Pain, once it's acknowledged, can be a powerful motivator.   Raskolnikov: Be silent, I beg of you. (Shuddering nervously, a malignant expression in his black eyes.) I am a louse, a wretch, a fool.   Dr. Phil: It's time for you to identify and confront the behaviors that are making you unhappy. I always tell people, you don't need a diploma to hose down a mule.   (Standing ovation from studio audience.)   Raskolnikov: I feel sublimely indifferent to your opinion. (Walks toward the exit.) No, I retract everything I have said, your words make perfect sense, you are a seer, a god. (Bounding out of the studio, his voice carrying from afar.) If only I had met you before I became an axe  murderer, perhaps I would now be among the saints.   Dr. Phil: Oh boy.   (Raskolnikov returns after a tumultuous inner struggle, pushing his way through a dense crowd of peasants.)   Dr. Phil: We're going to take a break now.   Raskolnikov: (Strikes Dr. Phil repeatedly on the head with the blunt side of an axe, then leaves overcome with remorse.)  
 this is a good book that I read awhile ago...I just purchased for my son...the book was in perfect condition.. 
 Paris Armstrong's husband of 24 yrs decided one day that he had enough of the marriage and wanted a divorce. Paris was devastated. She did not see it coming. After struggling over the loss, she decided to move to San Francisco to be near her children. After she settled into her new life, she started dating. She ended up going out with a string of losers one right after the other. Eventually she stopped looking and by coincidence she ran into someone who was suitable. A happy and romantic ending 
 Mrs. Barnes does a wonderful job at delivering practical advice for women (and men!) to help them make the most of their time! At first, I was very skeptical about her writing - how could a career homemaker possibly know  what a working mother goes through? Guess what? She does! I have only used  a handful of tips from her book, and already I feel a lot more relaxed and  have more time! My favorite tip is the 15 minute total-mess-to-total-rest  routine. It's amazing how much one can accomplish by breaking chores into  15 minute intervals. The bible verses that she uses are helpful as well,  but this is a great book without it (as a Christian, I am glad they are in  there). I have ordered 3 more of her books, and I highly recommend this  book for the woman (or man!) who wants to clear the clutter and chaos out  of her (or his!) life 
 I found this cook book very helpful when I am trying to make some new dishes for my friends. The most remarkable thing is Nigella always make thing simple and in a way make your life easy. If you are a newcomer to cooking and sometimes find it difficult, this book may help you out 
 Really enjoyed this book.  Loved the first one and this one just brings it further along.  I was wondering how the author was going to continue this series.  Mr. Lindsay does a good job with it.  I loved how Doakes was stalking him and how he decided to become more human to handle it.  Not sure that his girlfriend would all of a sudden be buying it but just a small plot hole.  I like the future accomplice that Dexter finds to teach "Harry's ways" to.  I again enjoyed Dexter's ramblings of his state of mind and how he feels.  I've only seen one episode of the TV show but still feel the books are a way better than the show.  I highly recommend the books 
 The Incas and their fascinating history have intrigued scholars for centuries.  Professor Henry Conklin is no different.  However on his dig in Peru he believes he has unearthed a mummy that will prove that there was an ancient indian civilization that actually predated the Incas and inhabited the jungle first.  Henry has left the dig site in the hands of his beloved nephew Sam and the other graduate students while he escorts the mummy back to the United States for further examination.  But no one foresees the danger that is waiting for everyone associated with the dig.  Years of searching for a mysterious substance that can heal wounds and resurrect the dead have led multiple groups with multiple motivations to elimiate the Professor and his discoveries.  Everyone involved in this adventure will be forced to deal with both man made and natural dangers all the while trying to determine what the golden "Substance Z" really is and of what it is truly capable.  James Rollins never fails to entertain with his wild stories of mystery and intrique set in an archeological setting.  The scientific basis of this story gives it some grounding in reality while the story and adventure keep the pages turning.  Even though there is some suspension of reality, the science that is real makes the reader think that the rest of the story could be possible.  This is another fun and exciting novel in Rollins' arsenal that is truly enjoyable 
 This book is actually a sequel to Brimstone,and with Book of the Dead form the Diogenes trilogy and even though a really compelling thriller in itself, those who are not familiar with the works of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child should start reading The Relic, Reliquary, Cabinet of Curiosities, Thunderhead and Brimstone before reading this book to fully enjoy it.  A really great read, this book is thrilling and hard to put down.  Back are some of their beloved characters, Pendergast, D'Agosta, Margo Green ( The Relic ), Nora Kelly and Bill Smithback ( Thunderhead ). 
 Good size, fits my largish size notebook computer; comfortable; light. I like the pencil clip along one edge because it helps pencils stay there. Rugged cloth and stitching so the stuffing (beads) stay inside (a competing product routinely sprung leaks and ended up getting replaced with the Posture-Rite).  Downsides: very slick top - so I use one a light rubber mat on top so my notebook doesn't slide off 
 All the stuff your minister or teachers didn't want you to know. It's history in the raw. Brutally honest and written well, the book is organized extremely well. If you are easily offeneded this book is not for you but if you can handle the truth it is a great find. 
 I have just finished reading "Pain Free For Life" and was thrilled with the book!  I couldn't put it down.  I was captivated about the way many of today's diseases, pain, and other ailments were described and how we can prevent them and heal them.  Dr. Stoddard wrote in a down-to-earth manner making the information very understandable and most useful.  Pain has never been described like this before and it made total sense.  I am trying to take more control of my health and "Pain Free For Life" was a wonderful, easy, educational experience.  Pain Free For Life gave many every-day examples about how we can alter our habits in such little ways that make BIG differences to ease or delete pain and disease from our lives - common pain and common diseases.  This is not brain surgery-type reading.  This is real life reading.  I highly recommend it.  I even got my 72-year old mother to read it and take action.  THAT speaks volumes!  When you read this book and implement just a few of the very sound concepts that are based on published medical literature, you will feel a positive difference in your life!  I have to say that this is one of the best health books that I've ever read.  It will be a staple that I'll refer to and share the information for many years to come 
 On the surface this seems to be a simple story, but once you get into the book you realize this is a case where it is the journey itself that matters most. The main character, Billy, narrates the book in his own voice. At first the conversational style might throw you off a bit -- there are some run-on sentences and odd punctuation, and Billy often addresses you, the reader, directly. Once you settle in for a few pages, though, Billy's words are easier to follow and the occasional odd rhythms only add to his charm. There is plenty of humor and drama, and some the best-written dialog I've encountered. There are some sexy scenes, too, and Billy's enthusiasm for these (well, at least in the ones with the boys!) comes across quite vividly as well.    What also impresses me is how John Fox uses the literary device of the unreliable narrator as a way of depicting Billy's transformation over the course of the book. Billy at first tells a few tall tales about his sexual exploits with girls. We don't know he's misleading us at the time, of course, since like all teenaged boys he is quite skilled at boasting. It is only as he proceeds further into his story -- presumably starting to trust that you, the reader, are going to stay with him despite all the very personal details that he's revealed so far -- that Billy finally starts to own up to what is untrue. One by one he sheepishly admits his lies, until eventually he reaches a point where he promises that he will stop lying completely. On the part of the reader it results in a strange sensation, as if a character in a book is somehow interacting with you, even benefitting from the fact that you have proven so loyal and unjudgmental. Since the matter at hand is that of sexual orientation, it is a technique that carries deep resonance. Essentially, the reader becomes much like a friend who is helping Billy to accept who he is. I can't recall any other book that manages to accomplish this in the same way. I imagine also that a confused youth who is struggling with the same issues as Billy would experience this stylistic device with an added degree of intensity.    This novel was originally published about 20 years ago. Even at that time the setting of the story was in the past, during the Kennedy-McCarthy Presidential Primary campaign, so it is no less pertinent a book today than it was when it first appeared. Quibbles about its setting being out of date are therefore entirely beside the point. (Part of me does wonder, though, if the author chose that particular era to avoid having to deal with the spectre of AIDS, which at the time of the book's first publication had become so much a part of gay literature.) This book is primarily about transformation and self-acceptance -- timeless literary themes -- and succeeds tremendously on that count.     The ending of the story is somewhat jarring but does serve as a reminder that gay youth hesitate to come out for many reasons, amongst them family pressures, career aspirations, and fear of bodily harm. It takes courage to step forward and proclaim who you are, whether you live in today's world or Billy's. Still, despite the air of sadness that permeates the final pages, there is also a sense of hope for Billy and the friend who is with him at the end. The continued journey may not be as easy but you feel that they will have one another.    
 'Unforgiven' is a magnificent piece of film-making, yet a dark and troubling study in violence and machismo... It revels in memorable statements of crudeness and cruelty... Munny sums it up best: "Hell of a thing killing a man. You take away all he's got. All he's ever gonna have."  Aided by Jack N. Green's cinematography and Lennie Niehaus's music, Eastwood gives the film an ensemble portrait of sorrowful beauty...   Clint Eastwood shows another face of the Old West... He is perfect as the unforgiven, the stone killer, whose eyes are full of brutally painful memories...   Will Munny (Eastwood) is a retired bad man desperate for the 'whore's gold' to save his shabby farm, two kids, and sick animals in the vast emptiness of the Colorado range... Munny had a monogamous devotion to the wife he'd lost, and is forced to confront his own past no matters how he tries to avoid it...  Eastwood is supported by some quite outstanding character actors whose performances are impeccable:  Gene Hackman plays Little Bill Daggett, the town sadistic sheriff who rules with an iron fist, forbidding anyone to carry guns across the town limits... He is a lawman cold as ice, who hates "assassins and men of low character." He also despises reward-chasers and tries to humiliate them, revealing their cowardice and indecision... In his judgment, he declines to punish a crime in a way that the hookers consider appropriate...  Morgan Freeman plays Ned Logan, Munny's longtime honest partner, who ensures the compassionate balance that keeps his friend from sinking in a self-pitying haze of recklessness and bitterness, but he also launches Will into one of the bloodiest shootout in that untamed place...   Richard Harris is English Bob, the egotistical gunfighter who desires to leave the hospitality of Big Whiskey behind him... He now lives off his publicity, and is followed everywhere by W. W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek), a writer of books, glamorizing the cover scene for purposes involving the market place...  Frances Fisher is Strawberry Alice, the outraged brothel's madam, who has raised, with a group of oppressed women she works with, a thousand dollars to anyone who punishes the two attackers who slash her working girl's face...  Jaimz Woolvett is Schofield Kid, the ignorant young rider who tries to make a name for himself... He shows up at Munny's place offering to split the reward, just for killing a couple of 'no good cowboys.'  Anthony James is Skinny Dubois, the owner of the bar and brothel, who pays good money for Delilah, and wants compensation...  Anna Thomson is the 'damaged property,' Delilah, the pretty prostitute whose disfiguration serves as the starting point for the story...  Nominated for nine Academy Awards and winning four major ones, "Unforgiven" becomes only the third Western ever to win the Best Picture Academy Award after "Cimarron" (1930/31) and "Dances with Wolves" (1990).  On screen, Eastwood dedicated the film to Sergio Leone and Don Siegel, his master directors and professional mentors...   
 Reading once again 'Old Man And The Sea' by Ernest Hemingway was simply a joyful reading experience that will stay with me for a very long time.  The writing is eloquent yet raw.  The reader experience humble yet filled with sheer power.  The connectivity is filled with singularity yet there is a sense of one with the universe.   There is of course so much that has been written and said about 'Old Man And The Sea' that I will not write a commentary about this marvelous book's movement; however, what I will say is this: there are books that are indeed worth returning to since they have a timelessness to the story, and, as the reader's own life experience grows, so too does the appreciation and understandings of the written story.  In this compelling book, I have found that the meaning of this story so powerful and connected to my soul in few ways a book ever has.  Do yourself a favor, go pick up 'Old Man And The Sea' and enjoy yourself.  Though you may be holding a paperbook in your hand, you may soon come to realize your actually holding a mirrow, and you're peering into your own life 
 This was either the first or second bird guide I ever owned.  It's a birding guide that contains the most common species of birds that you'll see.  The maps are good, the drawings are excellent, and the information on  each bird is great.  Greater starter guide for beginners and children 
 It's fascinating that Bourdain was invited to showcase delightfully mad scientist Chef Adria, as he is famously traditionalist and anti-fuss. However, he's also ideal as a food program host: Enthusiastic, charismatic, likeable, knowledgeable, down-to-earth, and articulate. Without having met him, he makes the viewer feel like he's a friend sharing a fabulous vacation. He makes this journey as much fun for the viewer as it appears to have been for him, and openly questions his own notions about food, its potential as art, investigating and preparing it from a scientific perspective, and the balance between quintessence and complexity. I look forward to successive viewings, and sharing the video with fellow fine food enthusiasts. Bourdain's television shows, terrific 'though they be, are restricted by the time limitations of the medium. It would be wonderful if he would produce more such DVDs that allow him to take the viewer a bit more in depth. Hey Mr. Tony, how about a French Laundry DVD?  :- 
 For anyone remotely involved with advertising and brand communications, if you haven't already, you should read Joseph Jaffe's excellent, thought provoking and brave book. In the foreword Don Schultz says 'this is the book I wish I had written'. I'm sure many more people will feel the same.   It's time to get our heads out the sand and realise that technology, media and consumers have changed dramatically. But advertising hasn't. We must move on. A continued reliance on the 30-second spot as the mainstay of all media strategies just isn't going to cut it. Jaffe brilliantly lays down the arguments and ideas for Life After The 30 Second Spot.  If you're already thinking ahead of the 30-second spot or if you're in a state of denial or anywhere in between - read Jaffe's book. And check out his blog site too jaffejuice.com.   Can't wait for the sequel 
 This Book Is great for children that love trains. When i was 5 and under i was CUKOO about trains. When i recieved this book i went nuts and i loved it! Parents Buy it!  its great for a gift.

They'll love it 
 An unsentimental appraisal of the benefits of a laissez-faire economy. Rajan and Zingales obviously admire financial markets in the way a mechanic would admire a well-designed engine and suggest ways they could be "tweaked" for maximum performance. That includes safeguarding the market mechanism from the very people and industries it has rewarded, and whose immediate interests no longer coincide with the free flow of goods and capital. The authors provide ample evidence of the depredations of crony capitalism, and chronicle the many ways in which powerful industries in Europe, Asia and North America have sought -- and secured -- harmful trade barriers and capital restrictions over the past century. A remarkably clear-headed book, free of the usual libertarian cant or other ideological baggage that plagues so many popular books on this topic 
 The American musical in the past few years has often been  of the "jukebox" type(Mama Mia, Good Vibrations)or  featured music that hearkens back to a particular period (Hairspray)  or verges on contemporary pop. There is a lot of  tongue-in cheek out there (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,  Urinetown), and much of it is excellently crafted.  What has often been lacking are musicals where genuine emotion is allowed to be expressed,  with all the risks that that entails, by a composer with a definitive sound of his/her own.  The Light in the Piazza is an admirable attempt to craft  a musical where the scenes and songs aren't drawn from a pool of pre-packaged emotions. And Adam Guettel's 'sound'  blows like a fresh breeze. His simple yet subtle lyrics  allow the characters to display themselves as individuals,  not stereotypes. His harmonic and formal choices,  characterized respectively by comparatively  frequent modulations and subtle departures from strict AABA convention, allow melodies to soar and sweep in  a manner that never sounds old-fashioned, only human.  This CD is worth buying for listeners interested in hearing  the sound of a composer/lyricist whose range encompases both gravity and levity; who is willing to let characters express themselves and reveal their weaknesses and vulnerabilities without being subjected to the composer's superior oversight. 
 I really enjoyed this book.  The complexities of Miguel Chico and his family are so rich and deep.  The relationships between them were interesting and made the book an easy read.  The irony and sadness the family endured showed the true colors of the family.  They were not perfect, but they were real 
 This DVD is excellent as far as the workout goes. I really felt the burn on each of the three beginning abs workouts. I was surprised that the "kickboxing" routine is done laying on your back though.  I certainly still felt the burn, although I'm not sure how a person "kickboxes" from the prone position. Nevertheless the workouts are intense and target mostly the upper abs. The lower abs and obliques also get some time but not as much as I would like.  I found the lead trainer's voice somewhat irritating, but that is a really small thing, and I'm probably being over critical since the key point is to get a good abs workout, which I have done each time I've gone through one of the various workouts.  The six workouts are really only 3 workouts with a beginner and advanced version of each.  I am a physically fit 35-year-old soldier, and I found the beginner routines fairly challenging. If you are out of shape, plan on it taking a while to be able to get through an entire 8 or 9 minute workout. You may need to pause and rest and build up to the point where you get through the whole thing over a period of time 
 No Retreat No Surrender is a classic 80's indie film that introduced the world to cheesy "karate" films inspired by The Karate Kid and Jean Claude Van Damme.  The movie stars Kurt McKinney as a wimp named Jason whose dad gets beaten up by a Russian guy named Ivan, played by Van Damme. His family move to Seattle where he gets pushed around by a group of karate bullies. Just when he thinks he can never learn karate, Bruce Lee's ghost appears to him and turns him into a fighting machine. In the meantime, the Russian arrives to fight for a championship against the karate bullies...and the rest is history.  No Retreat No Surrender is one of those movies that connects me to my past childhood years. I watched this movie so many times when I was younger that I felt persuaded to revisit it with a purchase and this review!  Recommended  B 
    The translation of the book is more than worth the price. With the commentary and explanation of the terms it exceeds the price paid. The subject matter and the commentary by Jung makes it pricless. I am familiar with many meditation styles and i must say this is a gem. I would recommend that before this work is done one has trained several years in the magical arts, the worker should at least be over thirty and has a family.Also a working knowledge of chi kung or tai chi should be had. Otherwise the treasure gained will not be as grand or the work never begun properly 
 Jeremy was a charater that describe 10th graders exactaly how they are. This book showed him going through different stages and him maturing. But this is how it it. He talks about girl's bodies and is infactuated with boobs. He also handles the struggle though his soccer seasons. Jeremy is a good kid and many of the girls thinks he is sweet and kind. But his mind isn't always in the best place. Buthe sees how girls have their different feelings though out the book and seems to mature a little more. This was an easy read book and i recomend it to anyone that likes a stories that dont take alot to think. 
 This slim book is perhaps the best one in which to start reading about the danger of massive extinction of languages in our world. The author, who claims to care much about this worrying issue despite admittedly never having spent longer periods in any endangered language environment, does a pretty good job systematically examining the causes of language death and what could be done to halt the process. He not only points out the fact that often communities themselves are to blame for not doing enough to pass on their native tongues to the following generation, but also examines what may have lead them to do so. One shortcoming of the book is that very few actual "real-life" cases are mentioned to illustrate his points and breathe life into the subject, and those few cases that are mentioned only get a few lines - this leaves the text somewhat dry and academic. He has also devoted one chapter to "Why should we care?", and as usual in books about this issue, that is where his writing is weakest. I found his arguments rather unconvincing, but also unnecessary - I personally don't feel the need to have practical arguments to care about preserving languages, which I think should be considered valuable in their own right. A valuable extra in the book is the appendix listing organizations devoted to the preservation of endangered languages worldwide. 
 I enjoyed it very much.  It appeared to be very objectively written.  Showed many items that I was not aware of 
 As I searched for books, for personal use, on early education I encountered this one, Better Late than Early. It carefuly and in an easy to read format explains the positive influences that delaying school entrance age to after 8 years. The first part covers the details concerning the  state laws regarding school entrance requirement. And the second part  guides you to the developmental stages of infancy, what to expect and how  to provide, at home, proper stimulation for optimal skill development.  An  excellent book for those willing to go the extra mile to provide their  children with an education begining at home 
 Bought this for my husband who cans deer meat.  The 18 Quart size is perfect and is very easy to use.  Amazon offered it at a great price and it arrived super fast. We highly recommend this Cooker/Canner

 Dear Gloria Vanderbilt, i am enjoying reading your wonderful book. Thank you!! sincerely,                                       Joan Clement                      
 I HAVE TO SAY HANS ZIMMER IS THE GREATEST OF HIS ERA. I HAVE PURCHASED ALMOST ALL OF HIS MAJOR SCORES FROM RAIN MAN, CRIMSON TIDE, GLADIATOR, AND EVEN THE LATEST BATMAN AND I KNOW I HAVE PLENTY OF MORE THAT COULD BE LISTED. I FIRST WAS WEIRY ABOUT BUYING THE SECOND SCORE TO GLADIATOR THINKING IT WOULD BE JUST LIKE THE FIRST ONE. IT IS AWESOME AND JUST AS GOOD OR BETTER, IF YOU ARE A TRUE ZIMMER FAN YOU HAVE TO ADD THIS TO YOUR COLLECTION. I HOPE HE KEEPS MAKING MUSIC FOR YEARS TO COME 
 What I love most about Danielle Steel is that her books are always the beginning to a better life for the main character, and this one is no different.  She has had, in my opinion, some ups and downs in her writing over the last few years but this is one of the ups for her 
 This is the kind of live album that shows that Earth, Wind & Fire was a strong combo on stage, featuring a dynamic set with lots of improvisation and hot playing. Just listen to Sun Goddess, Africano or Reasons. Unbelievable! isn't it? Definitively of one the best live albums ever 
 Just what you would expect - good music 
 What I like about this book is it provides a step by step hypothesis driven approach to discovering who your customers are and selling to those customers.   It defines the sale of a new product to a new customer (the most difficult type of sale in any strategy framework) as a discovery process. The book explains how this process cannot be done using the same sales techniques as more mature products (and thus often requires a different type of salesperson).   1) You have a hypothesis of who the customer is and what is their need. 2) You need to discover and validate that hypothesis in order to scale your sales organization and sell your product. Opinions are inside the building, facts are outside the building- you validate the hypothesis by hitting the street and selling).  The book may be described as basic marketing blocking and tackling but still useful to entrepreneurs that have been brainwashed by Innovators Dilemma and Crossing the Chasm and want to translate strategy into tactical actionable steps they can perform to grow and sell their product 
 I have been showing this video to my children since my son was 6 months old and my daughter was 5 years old.  It has a very calming affect on him.  I love the video because they are praise songs that I can sing along with, which he also gets a kick out of.  You really can not do the same with the classical music that you find in most childrens videos 
 Instinctively, I picked up these two small but wonderful books while browsing the local bookstores during one weekend:  1. The Art of Doing Nothing: Simple Ways to Make Time for Yourtself, by Veronique Vieene; 2. The Art of Napping, by William Anthony;  Ever since I have read Jeff Davidson's Breathing Space: Living & Working @ a Confortable Space in a Sped Up Society, many years ago, I have always valued - & benefitted tremendously from - the power of time-out. In a world where the future is hurtling at breakneck speed with hurricane-force changes, all of us must learn to do some time-outs!  Donald Mitchell's earlier review sums up very much my sentiments about the first book.   As for the second book, which is also equally lighthearted & humourously illustrated, I find myself amused & entertained by the author's introduction to a napaphobic culture. In a nutshell, these are his fun stuff:  - profiles in napping (stories of legendary nappers, including JFK, Winston Churchill, Thomas Edision, Napoleon Bonaparte, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan!); - napping strategies (noice to advanced levels); - nap management (getting the most from your naps); - the future of napping;  In some way, this book reinforces the chapter on 'The Art of Napping' in the first book. While the first book is beautifully illustrated by the co-author's photographs, the second book has several funny & bone-tickling cartoons.  To sum up my review, I want to say that these two books (plus, Jeff Davidson's book)are excellent handy guides for the time-pressed, over-achieving generation. 
 I bought this Audio CD looking for that one NEW concept that changes the way I think about money/risk/living in general. I found many more than one, plus I've listened to it 3 times in the two days I had it, audio CDs are great for that! If your looking for business ideas or investment advice you're not really going to get it here. I did disagree with his comments on buying real estate at any means (as an investor, one should only buy real estate property at zero or positive cashflow or they should move on to the next property). A great real estate investment book the is Weekend Millionaire's Guide to Real Estate investing and the Mindset book (amazing books!). He talks about the MINDSET you have to have to take the ACTIONS despite of your FEARS. Futhermore, he elaborates on the following. Your THOUGHTS determine your FEELINGS and your feelings determine what you DO. DOING translates your desires, visualizations, etc... into reality. The biggest thing I got out of this book is the following warning: "I already know that" is what most people, especially poor people say in most aspects of their life and don't further educate themselves in a topic. Rich people are always learning and applying what they learn. If you have read 1000+ books on money, investing, whatever you want in life and you don't have the results you want its two things. One, you're MINDSET is not right for that task and you DON'T UNDERSTAND what those books were saying. If you did UNDERSTAND, you would be taking all the ACTIONS spelled out and like SCIENCE your life would reflect them (CAUSE and EFFECT). Notice how I said YOU and not blameing outter circumstances for your financial situation. Great book, Add to Cart!  
 Parents, your preschooler will delight in discovering details in this charming book.  Others have noted the ever-present mouse with the banana on a string.  The mouse got the string by gnawing free a balloon, which subsequently appears in every scene (that isn't inside).  No one else, however, seems to have noticed the figures in the window in the house next to the zookeeper's.  In one panel there is one person, the next has two, and then there are three.  Why are these people awake?!  By the clock in the zookeeper's bedroom it's ten-thirty at night!  This is one book my two year old wants to hear again and again, pointing out where that mouse is, where that balloon is, counting the people in the window.  Don't forget to point out that, by the time the gorilla goes to sleep, he has eaten that banana 
 After reading this account of the acension of Everest, you gotta wonder why anybody would want to. Is it really worth it ? For the thrill seaking personality, of course it is. For normal people, forget about it. Even if you aren't into climbing mountains, this book is gripping from page to page and you don't want to put it down. Krakauer's first (?) book - "Into the Wild" is also great but this one is better, being a first person account. I remember when this came out and the surrounding backlash that accompanied it from people associated to the dead. Forget them, Krakauer get's it right, with no hidden agenda, unless you count surviving. I would have liked more commentary from the surviving members, though. And not to state the obvious to everyone else but me but why do they leave the bodies on the mountain ? They risk their lives to rescue the affirmed or injured living but once they're dead, they just leave them there ? What's up with that ?    
 I especially like the Yodel tracks.  This is clasic country at its bes 
 A catalog of quantum worldviews. Herbert discusses the various interpretations of how quantum mechanics describes reality. In other words, what does it mean about the underlying reality of the world to say that electrons (and all other subatomic "building blocks") are both/neither waves and/nor particles? Herbert presents eight different, yet overlapping, interpretations of quantum mechanics. The ones that I remember most clearly are the Copenhagen interpretation (i.e., that there is no underlying reality), the multiple worlds interpretation, the consciousness-only interpretation. Needless to say, all of the interpretations were, in one way or another, counter-intuitive and weird.   Another point that Herbert drives home is that, however we understand reality in light of quantum physics, it is definitely non-local (everything is everywhere and everywhen) as demonstrated conclusively by Bell's theorem.  
 This is an amazing, amazing album. Every song is powerful, meaningful, and emotional. You know how even on some of your favorite albums there's that song or two that's kinda mediocre and you skip over most of the time? Well you will NOT find here, I promise you. Listen to the clips, you won't be disappointed. 
 This is an incredible biography of Goebbels. Irving was the first to translate the missing portions of Goebbels own diaries, which lay hidden for decades in the cold war Soviet union files. Making a nonsense of many histories of the Nazi era, Irving has come up with a priceless work.     The internal rivalries of Nazism are fascinatingly revealed, Goebbells spiting vitriol about rivals Goring, the Strasser brothers, and occasionally the fuhrer himself. Debunking the myths of kristallnacht, Irving shows Goebbels to be the orchestrator of the violence against Jews and their businesses, much to their rage of Hitler and the other Nazi leaders, who called an immediate hault to their mayhem.    On a personal level, Goebbels comes across as an intriguing, often bizarre individual. Afflicted with a club foot, and of Gandhi-esque proportion - 5 feet 4 and barely 100lb. One of the most intellectual of Nazis, his formative years were a mix of academic achievements and periods of poverty inbetween. Irving portrays these years vividly, against the backdrop of WW1 and the years afterwards.           In other works, Dr Goebbels is portrayed as a lifelong womaniser, in this biography the peculiar and complicated evolution he goes through belies this notion. Though having numnerous 'girlfriends' in his Univiversity years, the Doctor conducted these intense relationships on a platonic basis, only losing his virginity in hie early 30's.      To touch on even a fraction of the themes worth reading in this book would take hours. It offers a deeply personal portrait of the man himself, but also reveals a greater depth on the Nazi era, both individual events and the time as a whole.     
 Though Megadeth's Hardcore fans may be a bit disapointed. Simply cause they had chosen more popular and well known songs, Instaed of a more random approach. This is an excellent collection none the less, With well known metal anthems like Symphony of Destruction and the ever popular Trust. But one song that stands out above them is Kill The King, This song was actually voted to be on the album on Megadeths site by the fans. All together this is a good start for people who are new to Megadeths many works and old fans who want these beauties on one disc. The songs sound better then ever, Obviously the remastered versions! And seeing the long list of great songs is allways a plus. Buy this album, You won't regret it.. Unless your a certain Green Day fan whom shouldn't even be looking at Megadeth in the first place! 
 As always I enjoyed this Fannie Fagg story!  Just a good ole' heartwaming book that was an easy read on a cold winter's night!  
 Excellent book. Clear figures. However, this book has the same problem most medical texts have, namely that is is too long. As a review book I would expect something much shorter, but that's not exactly the fault of the authors since biochemistry is a pretty big field. But at the current length, I would recommend reading the book by Marks Marks and Smith since it's only a couple of pages longer and it has more useful information; i.e. it is a book you can use during your second year for pathophysiology courses. For a review I would recommend the new text Rapid Review Boichemistry simply because it is short and to the point, with only high yield information, and a CD full of questions. However, Lippponcott's is still a very good book and can probably be used as your only resource for biochemistry in medical school if your school follows a standard medical biochemistry format versus a clinically oriented biochemistry class, which requires supplementing with other texts or lecture notes 
 This Movie was very hard to find. Found it in DVD an it was new 
 I took this camera along on a week long trip to Florida.  I never lost a charge and made over 1.5 Gbs of content with this camera.  The video camera is not an SLR.  Please do not expect professional quality images from this camera.  However if you want to shot video, this is the camera for you.  Buy a 1Gb memory card and start shooting your favorite family moments.  I suggest using the 640x480 mode so that your video is DVD quality.    Zoom... the video zoom was great.  I shot some offroad video of my Jeep and was able to easily zoom in over 100 ft away on the Jeep while shoting.  I never installed the camera software on my Windows XP based PC.  Instead I used a secure digital memory card reader and pulled the files of the card.    For $145 this video camera has replaced my Mustek DV4500.  I threw this camera around, ran it's battery down and let it sit in a black Jeep in the sun for two days.  After I did all this the camera was still running.  The controls on the camera are not complicated like other video cameras in this genre either.  All this being said, one could make the case that a cheap camera like this could easily be used by the younger generation, easily.  Pros: 1)  640x480 video recording was seamless with excellent audio streaming. 2)  Long battery life (held a charge for 1.5gbs worth of pictures and video recording) 3)  Video stabilization really does make video smoother.  4)  Can take 1gb memory cards 5)  If you can wait 1/4 of a second, the 5mp photos come out well for a camera with no real lens.   6)  Best image quality of any solid state video camera in this genre.   Cons: 1)  Poor flash photography 2)  Images: Shutter lag is over 1/4 of a second. 3)  Battery charging requires removal of battery.  UPDATE 9/7/2006: I am still using the camera.  I keep it in my Jeep during the hot Louisiana days, no problems.  I really like the quick boot time of the camera; 5 seconds or less.  I can instantly shot video or take a picture with the press of a button 
 What is there to make of the Joni Mitchell that emerges on The Hissing Of Summer Lawns?  This Joni Mitchell seems to have no connection with the Joni Mitchell who, up through Court and Spark, released the previous year, was in her creative peak, a winning streak that spurned out one perfect album after another (what artist working today could make albums the astonishing quality of Blue, For The Roses, and Court & Spark in succession?).  Mitchell, it seems, was interested in taking her music in a very very different direction - the lyrics now are not the coherent, eloquent epistles of angst and regret, they are works of beat-poet stream of consciousness (this line starts "Don't Interrupt The Sorrow": Don't interrupt the sorrow/ Darn right/ In flames our prophet witches/ Be polite/ A room full of glasses/ He says "your notches liberation doll"/ And he chains me with that serpent/ To that ethiopian wall"), and the music itself wreaks of the Steely Dan 70's.  The attempt?  To say something in the vein of a Luis Bunuel about the stagnating complacency of the bourgeoisie.  I didn't much care for that Joni Mitchell when I started listening to the record, as many people still don't - her less-transporting verse is a meaningless ramble and truthfully, even some of the great writing is lost in its song form.  A song like, for example, "Edith and The Kingpin" might read like great morality tales, but is as far from memorable as the weakest of her material, and its opener, the single "In France They Kiss on Mainstream" is energetic enough, but is dying in search of a tune.  Yet something struck me after a while - that middle section of the record!  "Don't Interrupt the Sorrow," "Shades of Scarlet Conquering," "The Hissing of Summer Lawns," "The Boho Dance," "Harry's House/ Centerpiece" and "Sweet Bird" work with at least a fraction of the full conceptual and lyrical fire that Mitchell intend, and, in the case of "Hissing" and "Sweet Bird" allow Mitchell to fulfill a grander ideal with songs attempting more daring commentary and soaring past their already large intentions.  It's a flawed record to be certain, but what works about The Hissing Of Summer Lawns is its ambition to be a work of great concept that, even when failing, makes you admire the drive 
 I bought seven beans for seven dollars, and was a bit unimpressed with the aromatic quality. They didn't have that strong complex aroma right out of the bag that bourbon beans are known for. That is not to say that the inside of the bean isn't aromatic. After all, it's the guts that really count. Even though these beans don't seem to be as aromatic as other beans, this is still a KILLER DEAL!!! I recently purchased one bean from a popular brand "Spice Islands" for seven dollars. An unbelievably aromatic bean, but seven times the cost of these beans!?!?!? I think I'll just buy these and use twice as many as the higher quality beans. I'm still making away like a bandit 
 This is an essential work that clearly outlines the origins of the Cold War.  Lefler does a fantastic job of detailing how the Truman administration set the tone of the Cold War and how little attention they paid to the actual threat the Soviet Union posed.  My review, however, is in direct response to the one below this. It seems as though the other review believes that lengthy and difficult to read is a fair criticism for a work of history.  I would greatly disagree.  It is lengthy to read because it must be, and it is difficult because so is history 
 A simple, strong, straight ahead rock album.  Some fine guitar and keyboard work.  Also loaded with laughable pseudo-profound lyrics.  Sing it, Jim Rutledge:  "I just wanna go home-a, an' have m'self an ice cream cone."  Huh?  But it's a great album anyway 
 From the opener, "I'll Fall In Love Again", STANDING HAMPTON got it right for Sammy Hagar. Combinig the pure Detroit rock of Bob Seger and Ted Nugent, the Southern boogie of Skynyrd and the Outlaws, and the metal of Humble Pie, Foghat, and Montrose, Hagar adds his own elements and comes up with his own special blend of hard rock that both rocks and swings, a sound that he formed in the 70s and has continued to develop into the 80s and since leaving Van Halen. This is one of the great 80's rock albums, and it should have been a huge hit. The fact that Hagar currently advocates sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's recent trumped-up drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist, as well as more funding for law enforcement, makes this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience 
 I think the book is wonderful.  I wanted to attain a better sense of Charles A Lindbergh and what better way then to read something he wrote.  He is a good writer and his character comes through.  It is also very enterntaining and down to the practically of having real substance of history in the book.    I am greatful to have read it and attained a glimps of a cherished individual in our aviation history 
 Don't feel like a philistine.  Don't scratch your head and wonder what is the matter with you for not appreciating the world's great literature.  Just read this book and it will all come clear.  In all likelihood, your literature teacher didn't know how to teach.  Rosenblatt's thesis is that without a pro-active, supportive environment in which a novice reader is credited for those things he or she can discern from his/her experience, knowledge, intuition, and reasoning, the most erudite transfer of knowledge from a 'professional' reader to a novice will at best be a delivery of information not unlike the role the pizza guy performs in bringing you your pizza and at worst, promoting a self-doubting reader who will not feel comfortable with his or her own insights.  Assuming that a prime reason for reading literature is to sense the 'transpersonal' between writer and reader, anyone who can read should be able to make that connection since we are all human.  Of course, expert knowledge and scholarship have their place, but not the first place.  The primary place is within, and it is the job of the promoter of 'literature' to help the student find that place within himself or herself--not demean the unenlightened to exact revenge for all those years of torturous graduate school. 
 This book is about a girl named Amber Conrad.  Her dad is a preacher so Amber has lived a pretty religious and sheltered life.  She is a senior in high school and has never been to a party.  One day she decided to go to one even though she the parties were knew for drinking.  She ended up drinking one or two drinks.  She told her best friend Simi about how she drank.  Simi became worried because that was unlike Amber.  Amber than becomes friends with a popular girl from school named Clarie.  Clarie drinks all the time and she get Amber into lots of drinking too.  Amber addicted and she starts turning away from God.  Will Amber stop her drinking habits?  Will she loose her job?  Will she keep her best friend Simi?  You have to read the book to find out. 	I thought that this book was awesome.  It was one of them books that you can't put down.  This book was never boring.  It was exciting from beginning to end.  I thought that Amber's friend Simi was a great friend.  She was so caring and she listened to everything Amber had to say.  She was also one of the only ones that was worried about Amber and her drinking. 	I think that most girls that are into books about teens and their problems would like this book.  I also think people who like books about people that change and make new friends would like this book.  
 In regard to Mr Kasprzak's review above -- If interested in Viking explorations or any other matter described in that review, one should buy the Northern Voyages work, not the Southern Voyages edition under which Mr Kasprazak's review appears.  His signals were crossed.  
 I think I'm in love with the good doctor. Here's a lady who loves reading more than eating, and thinks making beds is a waste of valuable writing time. I could live with a person of these values.  What a great writer, and some great ideas. In this book Dr. Sellers takes a no-nonsense approach to excuses for not writing and encourages aspiring writers to use the same 24 hours granted to all mortals to write for 10 or 20 minutes per day. She teaches you how to focus on your writing, finding quiet time, and accepting the solitude so important to writing. Also, I love her love of reading. Throughout the book she uses the metaphor of reading and writing as lovers. According to Sellers, writers read, and in fact often sleep with their books. I warmed to her imagery here, as I often bang an elbow or my back on a hardbound book left in my bed. My personal favorite bedtime book is an old one, Jean Christophe, by Romain Rolland. This book was written around 1910 and is over 800 pages. There is something about Rolland's writing that sets my imagination drifting into unexpected places. Sellers legitimizes this compulsion of mine, and advises the writer to let your writing flow with your imagination. Sellers also uses some yoga analogies in this book, but the book is not about yoga. I know nothing about yoga, except what I may have learned from David Carradine in the 70s TV series, Kung Fu. It is not a distraction, and illustrates her points well.  Sellers does not present actual writing instruction in this book, that is not her purpose here. She is highly readable and offers a ton of ideas for inspiring people to drop the excuses and start writing. 
 Well, after reading Born In Fire I didn't have much hope for Born In Ice but it was so much better then the first.  These are the first Nora Roberts books that I've ever read.  This is the 2nd book of 3 in the "Born In..." series & I really enjoyed it.  In the first book you were introduced to Brianna & this book is her story.  She is running her bed & breakfast in Ireland when a writer from America comes to stay at her inn.  He is there for several months while writing a book.  During his stay him & Brianna begin a romance that neither of them expect to continue once his book is completed.  This was a very peaceful & enjoyable read.  I recommend this book in the series.   
 I have been using the principles in Eat Right 4 Your Type for about 2 months now, and have not only lost weight, but have gained energy and relieved a lot of symptoms that had been diagnosed as chronic fatigue. I am convinced this works, and this companion cookbook adds another dimension to the program. I now have many more options of what to eat, and the book makes it easy to choose meals that will benefit family members of all different blood types. On top of that, the recipes are easy to follow, and taste good. Highly recommended 
 I absolutely enjoyed Dance of Death. As a matter of fact this entire series has been great and Preston and Child have really created a winning combination  in both their writing and the characters of Pendergast and D'Agosta. The pairing of two unlikely detective partners, one a tough talking, no  nonsense NY PD cop, Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta and the mysterious but urbane FBI Agent Aloysius Pendergast make the perfect 'odd couple'. Together they continue to solve quirky mysteries laced with menace and terror. I particularly liked Dance of Death because for this one the authors have chosen to bring the long lost brother of Pendergast into the picture as the most menacing villain yet.  Diogenes is almost like Pendergasts alter ego, brilliant but evil. In the hands of lesser authors, the evil brother villain could become a caricature of 'the evil twin'. But Child and Preston have pulled it off masterfully, giving the fiendishly devious tortures and Catch 22 situations he puts his despised brother in, just the right amount believability. They somehow manage to walk the fine line between a believable psychopath and a comic book villain.  This is a fun novel for anyone who likes suspense, terror and smart classy detective work with characters who jump out of the page at you.  I heartily recommend this book and the entire series.  Ric Wasley 
 I have read this book 3 times. It seems that each time I read it, I find out something new. I am a huge Bob Dylan fan and I love learning things about him. Howard Sounes really did his research for this book and it shows. I recommend this book to any Dylan fan 
 This one is a complete to read with your child.  The wonderful illustrations blend completely with the wonderful rhymes dealing with animals and farm life.  It may (or maybe not) be too early to classify this one as a classic, but if I were to make a guess, I would strongly suspect that this one will make the grade.  There is something quite soothing in Brown's simple verse and the wonderful blend of watercolors adds to the overall feeling of peace.  This is a gread book to read to your child before bed time and I have also found it is a good book to read to a hyperactive group of little ones at school.  It seems to calm them down.  THis is one you certainly should add to your library.  Highly recommend this one. 
 This is a story about ordinary folks. It may seem unreal as a whole but it's not hard find every single person in the real life. How many movies are completely real stories? So put them together to make a drama which also looks like comedy and a little tragedy (for the teenage girl who is definitely not 18 as she told  and has to leave those who showed care and love on her and and for Zhao who was blamed as a liar and lost his "love" again and was injurred by an unneccessary accident).   Unlike some other Yimou's moveis, this movie was not focusing on the poverty but on love. An unemployeed (his factory was half closed and had no pay to give out)old man Zhao seeked love and did his best he could to make his new date happy. The fat woman turned out to be a savvy gold digger type and took advantage of his love to let him to help her dump her untanted blind stepdaughter. While trying hard, with his scarce money, to please his date Zhao had to take care of the blind girl who had been abandoned by her stepmother and was neglected by her biological father. Troubled by lacking of money, Zhao and his fellow workers set up a fake massage parlor to "hire" the girl to do the only thing she can do. They even gave real tips to the girl though they themself were all not rich, even poor. But this could not last long so they decide to give paper as money to make her stay to avoid her dangerous leaving-out. The fat woman kicked Zhao out after her new lover (seemed to be the girl's father who seemed to have made a lot of money but did not show sign to find her daughter and cure her eye) came back and blamed Zhao as a liar. Yes Zhao lied to her about his fake hotel and finacial situation but not about his love to her. The girl also found out the massage parlor was fake and the later paper money were fake but she did not feel being deceived but felt being loved by those unknown folks who are not her father and stepmother. Not wanting to add more burden to these nice guys the girl left secretly, not even waitng for anotehr fake letter from her father. Probably she knew her father did not even care about her. Like she said her happies times were those while she were with Zhao and his fellow workers. The whole story was smoothly told and was toutchng. Every single person has his or her unique characters through out the whole movie, making it real life like and vivid. It's hard to find this kind stylish movies in Hollywood.   
 Thanks to John Surman on soprano sax + bass clarinet and Dave Holland on  d-bass, Mr. Brahem has created another excellent album. The pieces (most of  them composed by Brahem himself) all share the well-designed balance  between North African and contemporary sounds, and reflect excellent  musicianship by the trio. Very soothing, and contemplative, as is the case  in many ECM albums. We'll be looking forward to similar sound adventures  and live performances by the artists.. 
 This book will teach you to recognize that most of our fears are illusions that never happen. So why be afraid? Every time we take a step foreward, be it big or small, we exercise our Fearlessness Muscles, so you can build them up. Fear is contagious. When you feel better about yourself you are more fearless, and when you are fearless you have better sex. Ms. Huffington in this book was being entirely personal, raw, intimate and vulnerable. Brilliant 
 This is about as pure as hip-hop gets.  Real, unadulterated beats, eloquent verses, and fresh hooks make this album an instant classic.  The fact that this album flies under the radar shows how misguided pop culture is.  "It's the questions.  It's the questions, girl.  It's the questions.  It's the questions, come on.. 
 Brings back great memories of Big Bird and "The Count 
 David Quammen has produced a book reminding us that biology, history and science are life's enjoyments. Not some abstract or sometimes notion. He brings a real sense that your surroundings are rich and potent. Song of the Dodo brings together travel and science, using humanity as its foil; rarely becoming 'liberal' or 'tree-hugging'. If you enjoy reasoned argument and wit, take the time to enjoy one of the most enjoyable books on offer. Always rewarding, and with the exceptional ability to make you feel smarter (the sign of a truly gifted science writer) Mr. Quammen brings a great voice to writing, biology and humanity 
 Perhaps the most amazing thing about this book is the reaction to it by various readers.  Those who detested it said it was because of the violence.  Those who like it apparently liked it because it was by Nora Roberts.  There are the usual Nora Roberts fixtures here:  a beautiful, independent, tough heroine; R-rated sex scenes; handsome and talented lovers; flowers, etc.  It has been touted by some as a mystery of sorts, but there's nothing very mysterious about it.  Anyone who doesn't know who the arsonist is after the first fire hasn't paid much attention.  In fact, I kept wanting to tell Reena to wake up and go get him.  Perhaps the biggest departure from Ms. Roberts' previous books (for me, at least) is the rather humdrum atmosphere.  Ambience is the writer's strongest suit in other works--Alaska in winter, an island off Boston, Chesapeake Bay, Ireland, Louisiana etc.  Old Baltimore neighborhoods and a pizza shop aren't quite the same.  Still, the writing is mostly good and I kept reading.  A second-rate Nora Roberts book is still more interesting than most other novels being published today 
 I found this book very interesting and easy to read. Personally, the writing style was fine with me. Corbitt makes a statement in the front of the book that everything he says is the truth. He also says someone will probably get whacked over it. But who? At the end you find out that virtually every person he refers to in the book is now dead. Who is left to get whacked and who can corroborate this incredible story? If all he says is true, it's one hell of story. That's a big "IF", however. My guess is that the truth is somewhere in the middle of what Mike Corbitt actually claims it to be. I also suspect Corbitt has many more dirty little secrets he hasn't yet told 
 If you've been in middle-management, chances are you've either had this book pressed on you or seen it lying on someone else's desk but only in the "adult" form (I use the term loosely, "Who Moved My Cheese?" is on about a 7th grade reading level). As it turns out everything that was in the blockbuster WMMC is here in this version for kids, to the extent that middle-managers should have THIS version of the book vs. the adult copy-- it would've saved everyone a lot of time.  ANYWAY, the "plot" is this: in a maze there are 4 characters, 2 mice with big ears named Sniff and Scurry, and 2 mouse-sized humanoids, Hem and Haw. Each day they all set forth (the mice earlier and more industriously than the humans; the mice are instinctual whereas the humans consult maps) into the maps and seek out Magical Cheese. Everyone loves MC 'cuz it makes you feel good (no surprise there). Here's how the rest of the story goes:  Sniff and Scurry find a BIG OL' pile of cheese in a Cheese Station and are happy as... well, rats. Hem and Haw find it too and everyone has a grand ol' time. Sniff n' Scurry carefully measure the cheese to see when the supply is getting smaller whereas Hem & Haw sleep later and later and pay no attention to the dwindling supply. Eventually, surprise, surprise, the cheese runs out.  The mice knew this was coming and immediately set out to find NEW cheese whereas the humans more or less freeze up and piss n' moan that there's no more yellah' stuff 'round. Hem actually decides to STAY there in the empty Cheese Station thinking that some day (who knows when) there will be more cheese. Haw eventually goes out seeking more cheese like the mice, eventually finding a massive dump even larger than the first station. Surprise, surprise, the 2 mice are already there. Haw is, presumably, left in the empty cheese dump waiting and withering away to nothingness.  Now, what's the message for kids behind all of this? Well, actually, you have to infer that for yourself. Unlike the adult version of this book that carefully walks you through the concept that Change is Inevitable and Fortune Favors the Flexible, in the kid version there is very little to assist young minds to realize what the moral of the story is. Sure, Dr. Johnson asks questions like "what is YOUR cheese?" but what the hell does THAT mean to anyone younger than, say, 6th grade or more (who probably wouldn't be caught dead reading a picture book in the 1st place).  What I find interesting about this whole thing is that the book that STARTED out as a management book for adults wound up (no doubt as a way of raking in a few more $$$ under the thin veneer of "lets pass on this wonderful bit of whiz-dom to the younger generation) as a kid's book. In actuality, I think it would've worked best the other way around: starting this as a kids' book and turning it into one for adults; after all, hardly anything is changed other than there's more words & less pictures in the adult book.  In other words, I'm torn. I see the value in a book that espouses being open to change, but I'm offended it was written at a 7th grade reading level. I find it interesting that the original book came out some 6+ years ago, and I have yet to see any useful, sweeping change done because of this book or any others (Awaken the Giant Within; Iron John; Fish!; Zap! or any other management books on the shelves). To turn it into a children's book, especially one in which the central message of Change is Invevitable and Sometimes Necessary isn't even STATED strikes me as a sort of "quick, lets get this out there on the tail end of the adult book so we can make money".   I don't know if I recommend this book or not. Maybe it's good for your 4th grader, but I think like a lot of adults who were given this book and then expected to "work smarter, not harder", the message for kids will faaaade aaaaawwwaaay almost immediately 
 Being a Neurophysiology which is a part of physiology as a science, which is concerned with the study of the nervous system. It is closely connected with psychology, neurology, clinical neurophysiology, electrophysiology, ethology, higher nervous activity and other schools of science makes the author more than qualified to write a book on how food effects the human body.  And anyone who has lived in France for two years and has shut up and listened and observed, should be qualified in some way to discuss how the French eat and why they are so healthy compared to most Americans.  Having said that, I find the book full of wisdom that should a reader use even a small amount their life and health should improve alot.  Sure the author drives home common sense things like stop eating faux foods, or eat small servings and he notes on page 122 'This diet is about giving up quantity for quality, about eating richer, better food and loving it more. Eating fewer calories falls out naturally from that.... You aren't losing weight, you are developing a healthy relationship with your food. Weight loss just happens.'    Going back to page 3 the author shows that in the United States 13,000 new fat free products invented in the last 15 years whereas in France you wont find such products.  That the % of fat in the diet is lower in the US, 30-35% but 10% higher in France where obesity is almost unheard of.  That in the US at least 30% of Americans are obese (this doesn't count those who are overweight or morbidly obese wheras in France the number is 8% and holding.  Heart disease in the US is 3 times higher whereas in France it is 3 times lower. French women live years longer and French men 2 years longer than your average American.  And the author is 100% correct when he shares that people he has known (same with me) who have been in France for even a few weeks who have eaten in a total French way, are amazed that they lose weight and haven't really tried.  And he shared on page 33 that 'Paul Rozin a scientist who explores the psychology of food, recently surveyed dietary viewpoints from many cultures. He pointed out that the French see food in terms of what it can do for you. Americans, on the other hand, view it in terms of the harm it can inflict'.  The author also shows keenly that Americans cheat when it comes to food whereas the French savour what they do eat which means that unlike the American cheater who eats  fast in order to hide their mistake, the French not only can tell you what they ate and why they loved it, but can do so while eating 75% less than the average American.  The author also wisely reminds the reader that its their responsibility to stop making excuses and start making wiser choices. So what if when eating out the serving size is enough for three or four meals, grow up and learn to eat less and leave the leftovers or take them home for two more meals.  Or better yet pick better places to eat where the serving sizes are more European in size.  The only complaint I have about the book is the title which I would have preferred to be The French Lifestyle Secrets to Permanent Weight Loss since studies show that only around 20% of people who diet succeed, whereas those who make lifestyle changes which are more permanent, have a much higher success rate.  
 Short, Philip (1999) Mao: A Life (Holt: New York)  Fenby, Jonathan (2003) Chiang Kai-Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost (Carroll & Graf: New York).  	On October 1, 1949 Chairman Mao Zedong stood at the Gate of Heavenly Peace and declared the founding of the People's Republic of China.  He told the assembled crowd, "We, the 475 million Chinese people have stood up and our future is infinitely bright." He further continued "The Chinese people have stood up."  Two months the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) achieved later final victory.  The leader of the Kuomintang (KMT), Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek, fled with his party to the Chinese provincial island of Taiwan.  That day was the endgame of a battle that began twenty-two years earlier during the 1927 Autumn Harvest Uprising in Hunan.   	Both Mao and Chiang are synonymous with the history of modern China.  Both men came from similar backgrounds, had similar strategies and similar visions for China.  Each man came from humble origins - Chiang the son of a salt merchant and Mao the son of a well off peasant.  Mao and Chiang also sought to remake China as a modern nation within the world of nation-states.  On more than one occasion each man was willing to use the other for their own struggle within their respective parties.  To a degree, they were peas in a pod in modern China. 	The capturing of these complicated men in their pod has been a complicated process for most writers.  Many writers are trapped in their internal politics to capture the true person behind the images.  Mao and Chiang both have had devoted followers and devote detractors who were more than willing to take a blind eye to things both good and bad done by these men. 	Short and Fenby, however, do not.  These two biographies are both extremely objective and sound.  Mao is seen as the terrible dictator that he was.  "His rule brought about the deaths of more of his own people than any other leader in history."  Short admires Mao as being the man "who wrenched China from it medieval torpor and forced it into the contours of a modern nation." 	Fenby, meanwhile, is equally objective in his assessment of the Generalissimo.  Chiang's regime, both on the Mainland and on Taiwan, was not the thriving democracy it is even though of in the west.  But in fact, it was a authoritarian one "organized on Leninist lines with a repressive internal security apparatus."  Yet in the wake of three decades of horrid revolution, "Chiang and his era become less of the nightmare painted after the Communist victory." 	Without Mao or Chiang China would probably still be the semi-colonial backwater it was when they were born in the late nineteenth century.  Both men helped to unmake the old feudalist China ran for the betterment of Qing Dynasty and laid the groundwork for the extreme economic growth both on the Mainland and on Taiwan. Each Short and Fenby attempt to capture these two complicated men who will dominate the pages of history for centuries to come.  Each is a fantastic read about the two men who would be king 
 Jane Yolen has struck in the gold yet again with this collection of folktales starring clever, brave, daring, courageous women from all over the world.  There is a lovely poignancy in her introduction and in the  response from her daughter and granddaughters, showing how absolutely right  she is to revive these stories, to sing out these tales that celebrate the  power of women through the ages.  Like Ms. Yolen, I too was Robin Hood and  Arthur when I was a girl, desperate to play the hero and not knowing any  heroic women to model myself on.  Well, my  sisters, here they are, a grand  selection of them, Atalanta and Bradamante, daring Princesses and bold,  clever wise women from many cultures.  Their stories are all told with the  sure and lilting voice - or voices, for she is a wildly talented writer and  able to make each tale ring with its own cultural music - of a trusted  modern bard.  Thank you, Ms. Yolen, for giving new life to these tales with  your consummate artistry 
 Man oh man are these guys good, Carmine Appice formerly of Vanilla Fudge can out Bonham John Bonham any day, The guitar and bass mix perfectly with the gut wrenching drum fills, The track Evil is sure to blow out speakers, with its heavy bass riff, this album is a must buy for any rock musician, or fan of Led zeppelin, or Hard rock in genera 
 Richard Bangs is an award-winning outdoor travel writer and adventurer, Pasquale Scaturro is a geophysicist who loves adventure. The two team up to provide the lively Mystery Of The Nile: The Epic Story Of The First Descent Of The World's Deadliest River. A blend of adventure story, travelogue, and history, Mystery Of The Nile provides a survey of Nile regional history and culture in the process of detailing the two-man expedition on inflatable raft from its mouth into the Mediterranean Sea near Egypt 114 days later. While the blend of memoir, history, and travelogue may prove difficult to neatly categorize, any with an affection for all of the above will relish the unusual saga. 
 This was an extremly helpful book 
 Since I am one of the characters involved I can truly say that Pete Earley captures the events more precise than those of us on the inside looking out. The chilling things he describes are true, and the scary part is they  are still happening, everyday. It is a must read for anyone truly  interested in how the justice system Really works 
 With season one behind them, this team made up of diverse backgrounds and talents shines in their sophomore season.  The action is more intense, the plot lines more twisted, and the emotions more heartfelt.  The writers of the series really knew how to attract the male audience through action and gun battles while drawing in the female audience through heart wrenching tales of heroism and heraldry.  This is a must buy for any person wanting an experience of a lifetime.  Hannibal is more cunning, Face is more of a philanderer, Murdoch is crazier, and Mr. T. is tougher.  It's all around an Emmy winning performance from the entire cast.  
 This is one of Bobby Lake Thom's books that changed my life in a very Positive and Spiritual way. The knowledge in this book comes from experience and training in the medicine way.  Native Healer, Bobby Lake Thom (Medicine Grizzly Bear) shares his wisdom and experience to the reader about the importance of honoring nature and the Great Creator everyday of our lives by becoming aware of our natural surroundings in nature. I am very GRATEFUL for this book and the other books that Bobby wrote. It teaches and informs the reader about nature symbols, spirits, healing and knowledge. This book is a must for anyone in search of spiritual healing and knowldege. Bobby has the experience and training from several elders(Medicine Men and Women) in his lifetime from many different tribes.   Readers should also look for  the books Native Healer and Call of The Great Spirit by the same author. Again THANK YOU again for a very powerful spiritual tool Mr. Bobby Lake Thom!  May the Great Creator and Good Spirits in Nature Bless You and your family Forever! I Highly recommend this book to everyone interested in Spiritual Knowledge and Healing 
 Franny and zooey    This book consists of two short stories about members of the Glass family. The members of this family are actors and actresses from New York and they used to be intelligent people who appeared on a radio. Obviously the Glass kids had a special education in religion and philosophy.   As we see on the first section "franny", we see a girl of 20 years old that go to college. She is the youngest of the family Glass. However, Franny has returned home to rest a little of it, because of her breakdown in which Lane Coutell her boyfriend didn't care at all. And Zooey her older brother, who is an actor, tries to help her out.   Their mother who is worried about her Franny, she tells Zooey that he most has to talk to his sister to help her out of her breakdown. Then Zooey watching her sister sad, he went to talk to her for a while about her sadness. Franny first tries to hide her frustration and anger, but while Zooey where talking to her and encourage her to revive of her breakdown, she couldn't hide her frustration any more and she argue that her professor doesn't like her because she always argues his lessens and that she don't like to act, so that's why she start to reading "Jesus Prayer", because she in some way she want to get knowledge to understand everything, because she thinks that the world is not smart, like its suppose to be.  Zooey argues her anger in which he tells that she really doesn't understand what the "Jesus Prayer", and then he apologizes to her and leaves the room. Then Zooey go to Buddy's room, then after thinking for a while, he grabs the Buddy's personal phone and call to the house to talk to Franny, first she thought it was Buddy that in somehow he knew about her breakdown and he wants to help her out, but then she realize that it was Zooey and gets a little of it mad at him, but Zooey tells that she most do what ever she thinks is best for her, in which not be famous ( to not be an actresses) anymore or continuo doing it and the Jesus Prayer!. 
 I found this book easy to read and digest and organized well, with lots of helpful information.  It's definitely a worthwhile buy for anyone considering or planning to go to law school 
    I found this version to be well done.  The readers were dynamic, and seldom boring in tone.  My one big issue with the presentation is the change on certain chapters to a different reader.  Each of the two readers remain consistant in their seperate chapters with the pronuonciation of characters names and the names of places.  However, the readers are not consistant with each other.  This makes for some confusing moments as you try to figure out that a character is talking about the same thing/person/place that was being talked about just a chapter before.  Someone who has read the series in paperback will have less of an issue, but I could see more problems for someone who is just being introduced to this book.    Otherwise, I enjoyed this audiobook.  I have read all of Jordan's Wheel of Time series available, and this is an excellent presentation of his work in The Great Hunt.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good audiobook 
 I first picked up "The Story of English" when I was in my mid-teens, and its a testament to its quality that I can still vividly recall the glee with which I turned each page of this invaluable tome. It is chock full of information about the origins and evolution of the English language, all the while providing the reader with scads of concurrent historical information about the various cultures which have been touched by this most unusual tongue. The illustrations make the experience as visually pleasing as it is intellectually stimulating, and the prose style is such that one feels entertained even while being informed on a subject that could just as easily be rendered esoteric and boring. Regardless of your normal interests, I cannot imagine that anyone would not be swept away by this book 
 I grew up in a city that was building a stage of the Saturn V booster for the Apollo program.  My mother was a children's librarian and my father sold electronic parts.  Every week, my brothers and sisters and I would go to the Public Library, where we could check out all the books we wanted, as long as we read them all and returned them on time. It was there I discovered Mister Robert Anson Heinlein.  Living, as it were, in a city full of rocket scientists and engineers. I was delighted to find that most of my friend's dads had read RAH, and not just the kid books (Red Planet, Have Spacesuit Will Travel, Farmer In The Sky, etc.) Soon I was reading Puppet Masters, Double Star, and then one day, The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress.  This book is written with serious poetic overtones.  Our Hero Manuel Garcia O'Kelly Davis, is a programmer on a very large computer system.  The computer one day tells a joke, and betrays the spark of self awareness. "Is a cat aware?--almost certainly" muses Manuel.  He names the computer Mycroft Holmes (after the Character of Sherlock Holmes brother) which is shortened to Mike. Mike, once so dubbed, always refers to Garcia as "Man, my only friend" and so we meet the first GREAT AI character the world has ever known.  By the book's end we LOVE Mycroft Holmes, we WANT him to be real, to be our friend, too. Mike, you see is a good friend to have, if you are planning to overthrow the government and go to war with the entire planet Earth.  This is all set in the background of a Lunar prison colony where air is not even nearly free. Where TANSTAAFL is a way of life. Where the Warden and his goons are hated everywhere and where rations are cut to make more profit shipping food back to an overcrowded earth. We meet Manuel's teacher (like everything on the moon, self taught, and freelance for pay)Professor Bernardo De La Paz. The Professor, together with Mike, Manny and the lissome Wyoming Knott, start a classic revolutionary cabal, recruit others, and develop a method of warfare guaranteed to make you think and possibly to do some math.  There is real science in this book, and realpolotik as well--this book is a manifesto for crypto libertarianism, and shows well the talents, messages and magnificent vision that keep Heinlein as a standard few will ever touch.  If there is a quintessential science fiction masterpiece--this is it 
 The Passion Test is a GREAT book to help you clarify what is most important to you.  If you follow the book and take the test often it helps keep you focused.  You will never be successful if you don't know what you are passionate about and keep that passion fresh in your mind 
 I bought this book as it was the textbook for a class I was taking at the local community college. I found it to be helpful in learning about the Intel Assembly Language. The material is presented well and it has examples in the book as well as additional materials and study information that you can get from the author's web site. I've spent over 27 years writing software in various languages (FORTRAN, C/C++, JAVA and 4 different assembly languages) but Intel Assembly language was new to me. The information I was looking for specifically was how I could use the knowledge of Intel Assembly to help me debug problems in C/C++. The information and explanations in the book of the different language and Windows calling conventions was particularly helpful in that regard. Ever have a problem with the stack and tried to figure out what happened?  I don't know of any other books on this topic but this one seems to be one of the best as it has been adopted by colleges and unversities.   Some of the descriptions/explanations are a bit off from what we use in the software industry but you can figure out what the author meant. One area is how the stack is depicted in the book. It's upside down from what I am used to seeing (ie. the top of the stack is depicted at the bottom of the illustration) 
 This book was a pleasant surprise. The underwhelming titles "The Master Sniper" and "War of the Rats" had not ingrained me with high expectations about WW2 fiction. "Black Cross" manages to wrap suspense, characterization, and a fast-paced plot into one neat little package that will have the reader wondering where the hours went. The writing is excellent. Descriptions are concise and easily visualized, action is both exciting and believable. One star. The plot is another gem. Learning the Germans have developed nerve agents, the allies are confounded as to how to prevent them from being employed. A raid on the concentration camp where the gas is being developed is the answer. Without giving away too much, the covert action is engrossing and thrilling, and there is a true sense of urgency (and a few, but not too many, twists). Ons star. There are two protagonists, an American pacifist physician and a Jewish Zionist fighter (Stern gang? I don't recall.) Naturally, the personality conflict is substantial. Both are well-developed and sympathetic, and have good, well-explained reasons for their personal beliefs and biases (I, for one, can't stand it when a character acts uncharacteristically just to advance the plot. There is none of that here.) It is truly a character-driven story. One star. The supporting cast is similarly well-done. Churchill acts in true-to-life fashion. A nurse at the gas-research camp struggles internally with her service of an evil regime. A Jewish mother in the camp does whatever it takes to save her children. The camp's security chief, honorable despite his service in the Waffen SS, loathes his current assignment and the men he commands. An NCO of the camp guards displays the sadism typical of that position. And the commandant of the camp, a physician conducting vile research, is a very suitable villian. All characters have convincing motivation and personalities, and there are no stereotypes. One star. The ending is suitably climactic, exciting, and provides good resolution. There is no silly deus-ex-machina that comes to save the day (rahter, the characters find their own solutions.) One star. Other notes: The details of this book are truly great. The author did his research concerning topics as diverse as organic chemistry and firearms. There is little, if any, eye-rolling. The heroes are not supermen (though they do have the hero's luck and are somewhat exceptional.) Conclusion: Fans of action, suspense, or military literature will probably enjoy this book thoroughly. If the author likes WW2 stories, then that is just more icing on the cake. Buy it 
 i compared this book with michael crichton's timeline and i have to say, this book rocks!! both books are about quantum physics but iles made it more interesting and easier to understand..  the story line is just amazing, you keep living on eventhough you're actually dead.. i guess that's the theme of today's technology; cheating death eventhough the book was a bit long, iles has a way of writing that if you left out one single sentence, it's just plain unacceptable and you'll probably end up not understanding the whole stor 
 If only every person that ever eats food read this book as a set work at school, the level of intelligence across the literate world would double. No longer would advertising companies have such a gullible audience. No longer would the medical and medical insurance industry have such a ready customer base.  And most of all, the customer of the farmer/producer would not tolerate the practices in industrial agriculture, and in turn, small farmers would not be trying to ape their "big brothers 
 Well they say that this IS THE PLAN..........  if anything happenes to the machine in 2 years they wil fix and/or replace....  Hopefully I never have to use it........ 
 Good book.  Not his best, but still a faced paced, interesting thriller.  Worth the time to read 
 If it's even possible, I like the second .hack//sign soundtrack better than the first. When I got the first soundtrack, I listened to it constantly for at least a month. Now that I got the second one, and because I like it so much, I might listen to it more. Especially, the first four songs. The music is great. .Hack//Sign is a great series and the soundtracks help to further that. I would recommend this track to anyone who has heard any of the .hack//sign music! It's all fantastic and after all, that's how I first heard of the series 
 As a big fan of Rancid, I was excited to see this side-project CD from Lars, and I wasn't disappointed.  Either when writing books or song lyrics, it's usually a good idea to focus on what you know best, so what better subject to choose than your own life, which is exactly what Lars does.  I find myself listening to this CD over and over and I never get tired of it.  It's punk, it's loud and rough, but unlike some punk bands with less talent, you can understand Lars' words and the music is exceptional.  Together with a cup of coffee, it provides a great early-morning jolt. Songs like Skunx and Vietnam sound better every time I hear them.  And after seeing the Bastards at the Avalon in Boston and meeting Lars several times, I am confident that this will forever remain one of my top-10 favorite CDs.  Listen to it 4 or 5 times, and chances are, you'll be hooked too.  Oh, I should also mention that the Bastards' second CD, Viking, is also outstanding.  
 fun interesting w/ valuable lessons.  don't pass this one up, its one you can pass down to the next generation 
 I felt that Appiah captured the current world of ethical view points quite well.  I enjoyed seeing the world through new eyes it was refreshing and a delightful read.  I reccomend it to anyone who cares about the condition of our global interactions with each other 
 I Have read a lot of how to books, but this book takes things to the next level, clearly defined and understandable text. Recommended for anyone wanting to know all there is to know about the subject 
 This is THE book for anyone in the culinary fields.  It contains both the science (down to the molecule) of foods as well as the laymans terms of explanations and history of all things culinary.  I am a professional cook, and anyone I know or train on the job who is serious about the profession gets this book from me.  Take months, if necessary, to read this book.  Absorb it and learn from it.  I have read so many books on cooking but this one beats them all.  It is required reading at most (probably all) culinary schools 
 I've been looking forward to another album from Ana Carolina since I bought "Ana Rita Joana Iracema E Carolina" last year, and only recently noticed that this album had come out some 10 months since its initial release. I'm always surprised at how little exposure Brazilian artists get in the USA, but most especially so for Ana Carolina. Of all well-known young MPB artists I'd say her music is perhaps the most accessible to American ears unfamiliar with Brazilian music since she does not venture into Samba, Forró, or even Bossa Nova, sticking instead to straight-ahead pop. Regardless, her music is no prefabricated pop junk - there's a great variety of instrumentation, idioms, and feeling on her albums which are always well (but not overly) produced.  "Estampado" is no exception. There are a few of good groove-oriented songs (Ana plays rhythm guitar and percussion in addition to being a singer) in Vox Populi,  Não Fale Desse Jeito, O Beat da Beata (with guest Seu Jorge; easily the highlight of the album) and Elevador; and some nice ballads in Mais Que Isso and Nua. The rest of the songs lie somewhere in between, though she seems to be at her vocal best in sentimental songs like Encostar Na Tua and É Mágoa.  This album also adds some orchestral accompaniment on some of the tracks, which could easily have become cheesy, but is handled with taste and subtlety, adding to the overall polished feel of the album. This is another fine effort from Ana Carolina; not a significant departure from her previous work, but creative enough that you won't be bored. If you like her previous albums, you'll almost certainly enjoy this one as well 
 This book is not another fun summer read. It is, rather, more like a sledgehammer assault on our collective complacency and cultual denial.By summarizing out current environmental malaise by means of the four easily  understood "spikes", Ayers makes clear (at least to this  reviewer)the time to wake up from our "business as usual"  slumbers is now. He convinced me of his diagnosis. I was a little less  convinced that there was much any one person could do about it. I was  looking at our tired old earth a little differently after this one 
 This is pure blues, with a little hard rock mixed in. But who does it better than Jimmy Page?  1. Good Times Bad Times.........8.3 - a rare pop song that Zep didn't do until around '78, but it's still blues	 2. Babe I'm Gonna Leave You........9.6 - amazing vocal performance 	 3. You Shook Me.............8.8 - the best blues playing on the album 	 4. Dazed And Confused.........10 - classic bassline; the song is a blend of slow blues alternated with hard rock riffs...and an amazing solo 	 5. Your Time Is Gonna Come........7.4 - slow blues pop 	 6. Black Mountain Side...........7 - eh 		 7. Communication Breakdown.........9.5 - not an amazing vocal performance but you can tell Robert Plant puts all he's got into each song. All out blues/hard rocker; great guitar performance all-around	 	 8. I Can't Quit You Baby...........8.5 - slow-tempo blues	 	 9. How Many More Times.......9 - cool bassline, and again, total blues with amazing guitar wor 
 No, Mitchell isn't at the apex of her game on this album - the egregious album cover says as much - but 2nd-tier Joni is still world-class songwriting & performance by most standards. On this set, she looks at the raging injustices of the world from her wry, increasingly detached point of view. There is bitterness in almost track and the topics are pretty downer; "I've lost all taste for life, I'm all complaints," she sings on the final track. Nevertheless, her acoustic guitar is warm & smart, Shorter's sax is sly & sweet and Mitchell places a few savvy pop hooks & harmonies here & there. Lyrically, she's better addressing the human condition than working world events. The overall sound is a continuation of the formula perfected on "Don Juan's Reckless Daughter" with waves of synth bass taking the place of (the more creative) Pastorius. Standouts include "Sunny Sunday," "How Do You Stop," the title track and, featuring one of her most direct melodies since the 60's, her devastating address to God on "The Sire of Sorrow." All in all, not Mitchell's best work - but her best work of the 90's 
 I can't begin to describe how beneficial this book is. In fact, I would run out of space here before I even got halfway through an explanation. I will forever be referencing this book and gaining new insights with each read. I have a notebook full of notes that I took as I read the book, and applied her statements to my life, and events therein. It explained so much, and made a remarkable connection to just about everything. As I go through my "phases" in life, I expect more notebooks of scribbled notes, page references and quotes that will certainly apply and give new insights. I've given a copy to all my closest girlfriends and they too loved it. Every woman should read this book and keep a copy handy! 
 This is the one & only cooking/food magazine to buy.  Not only does it share fabulous recipes that are tested in the magazine's test kitchens, it also illustrates step-by-step instruction, rates cooking tools & gadgets, & educates the reader on seasonal ingredients 
 Hafiz is, together with Rumi, simply one of the greatest poets to have walked on this earth (in my opinion), and Ladinsky's translations bring them to English speakers in a way that we can easliy and deliciously assimilate. This book of enlightening poems will make your soul glow and shiver with delight, if only you let it.. 
 The application is good overall. However, the routing could be better. It does not always choose the best route no matter what option you choose. The routes are a little longer than what other mapping software suggests.   Secondly, it does not allow you to enter waypoints. It also does not seem to be able to redefine a route if you wanted to take a specific road to improve the routing.   I hope the software vendor is working on these issues for a fix in the near future. Other than that, the application seems to be one of the best out there at this time. 
 I just saw this band last night, and their energy on stage is amazing.  Hard Wired is a great collection of their older songs, and definetely captures what makes them so good live 
 This live album is a MUST have for fans of Bill Evans, but jazz fans in general.  Not only is Bill on top of his game here, the drumming of Morrell and bass playing of Gomez, you could say, almost steal the show.  A terrific collection of songs and a great recording as well.  Buy it 
 I had the opportunity to see Rhonda and the Rage at Johnston County Community College in Smithfield, NC recently.  I was NOT a bluegrass fan...but Rhonda is NOT the bluegrass I was thinking about.     She's an awesome entertainer, not just talented but so energetic, and so in touch and in tune with the audience.  Her current single of I've Forgotten You is awesome...and even CMT thought so and featured it several times on their Wide Open Country programming.   This Live CD is like being right there at the concert all over again.   I'm not a fan of live performances but this one is awesome 
 I am a conservative by nature, and have tried for two years to convince my republican husband to read this book, but he has not yet seen the light.  I was not only lucky enough to read this book in my Adminsitrative Ethics class, but also had the priviledge to have Professor Balfour as a professor in my graduate program.  The information provided in Unmasking is shocking to say the least; as an administrator, you tell yourself that initiatives and programs the government is doing "for the good of the people" is simply that.  However, scratch the surface, and you will find what Adams and Balfour refer to as "moral inversion"--an act that is evil or destructive is redefined as "good and worthy."  I can think of a million examples on a local, state, federal and international level that refer to this phenomenon.  This book is a must-read for any person presently in public managment, or considering a career in government or politics.  And hey, maybe one day my husband will read it 
 Reading this book was for me like looking at a family album while my host (whose album this is) tells me about the photographs quietly, gently, his sad eyes fixed on the back of my head.  And as I looked I realized that the photographs (the still lives captured on this page and that) are photos of photos of photos; that behind them simmer reflections of things not in the image itself; that they are photos of the same scene but taken with many cameras, seen with many eyes; and slowly, gradually I realize that I am in the photographs also-a kind of ghost guided inside by my host-and I step in and look around.  Until finally, I come to the last photograph in the album (not the last photograph; just the last photograph in that particular album) and I look at it, at its grey rain, at its sadness and I don't close the album.  That is what reading this incredible book is like-and that is why I heartily recommend it to anyone who ever hesitated to speak of himself, his family, his heart. 
 Common is quite simply one of the most consistent rap artists ever.  The Chicago native never ceases to amaze me.  Known for his smooth and poetic delivery and limitless verbal capacity, in addition to consistently putting out tracks with excellent production, it is virtually impossible to be disappointed with ANYTHING Common puts out.  This time around with Common's new album "Be", the highly talented producer/rapper Kanye West is handling producing duties.  When I first heard Kanye took care of the albums production, I was somewhat skeptical.  I thought this meant that Common would have a completely new sound and possibly "sell out."  Once I heard the new album, this quickly became the furthest thing from the truth.  A combination of Kanye's production and Common's flow, this album will please anyone regardless if you are partial or not to certain genre's.  With the album "Be", Common does a great job of grasping the listener's attention and follow each song as it depicts an excellently detailed scene.  The flow of the album is incredible and the chronology of the track listing is in the order it should be.  Coming from a long time Common fan, this is definitely Common's best effort to date.  Kanye West did an excellent job bringing out the best in Common's musical ability.  In addition, Kanye was able to bring some surprising guest appearances such as John Mayer and John Legend, as Kanye normally does on his own albums.  Highly recommend this album and can almost guarantee you will have a hard time turning it off.  
 My daughter really enjoys this book.  We love the illustrations. It's a quick and easy read...both cute...and sassy 
 I got this video for my 5 1/2 yr old to begin to get some experience in "party" dancing.  The moves are very easy to follow.  She loves the video, as does her younger 3 1/2 yr old sister.  They have watched it 5 or 6 times now and still love it.  While the oldest is not a master of the moves yet, it is exactly what I was looking for.  It is a video that introduces her to some dance steps, while encouraging her to create her own.  It allows her to have fun (not sit in front of the TV) and learn some dance moves at the same time.  I would expect that if she continues to watch the video that it would help her get some confidence and be able to dance.  Although the video is not necessarily for 5 year olds, she is able to "try" the moves and should be able to get them down after practicing.  I think this video has "staying power" -- they will use it for a few years.  I would recommend this for someone looking for a basic dance video.  It is good for 5 year olds on up to early teens.  (My husband and I were even trying out some moves!)  Keep in mind it is hip hop, not the waltz.  It is good for kids learning to dance with other kids.  And I agree with another reviewer, I was pleased that it is not too racy for childen -- it is in quite good taste.  After they get the moves down, I will try the Hip Hop Shop 2 
 Athol Fugard, 'Master Harold' ... and the boys. New York: Penguin. 1984.  Originally produced in 1982 by the Yale Repertory Theatre.  Hally does not know who he is.  The single white character on stage in South African-born playright Athol Fugard's one-scene work is the friend of his mother's two black employees when they tend to St George's Park Tearoom in her absence.  But he is also their 'Master Harold'-reluctantly but inevitably-when the stress of his crippled, alcoholic father's homecoming impels him into an emotional space that one simply does not share with black folks.  Perhaps is it the burden of dealing with human beings on the multiple levels that racism forces upon those who resent but ultimately accede to their required roles that embitters Hally beyond redemption.  Hally doesn't know several things.  He is ignorant of the nobility with which Sam and Willie have battled for his dignity over the years of service to his family.  He doesn't understand that even this virtue has its limits, beyond which dignity weighs more than the possibility of continuing friendship.  Hally doesn't understand that a night of dancing at the Eastern Province Open Dancing Championships is a thing of beauty rather than of entertainment, nor the hope that is nurtured in a space where for one night people never bump into each other.   'Master Harold', the title upon which he insists at the cost of everything that matters, will never know because he cannot learn.  He is a million times more the victim of the 1950's racism in the land of Fugard's birth than any black man whom, when pushed beyond his modest emotional means, he shoves around.  They, at least, leave this dark, sad drama with something 
 This is my favorite book, but its not for everyone. Pynchon's style is dense and you'll find yourself reading sentences two or three times before you can make out the grammar.    The story reads like a mystery, but this plot is only a cover for the philosophy Pynchon is proposing. Once you find the philosophy, though, a second and third read will reveal that the story of Oedipa and even the structure of the book are examples of that philosophy. Oh yeah, and its funny as hell too.  If you can deal with Pynchon's style and stave off the idea that he is simply toying with his readers, then The Crying of Lot 49 is one of the most rewarding little books you'll find 
 Years ago, I was in love with Jane Austen.  Now, I love Gogol.  I'll say it.  He makes me laugh.  He's a funny guy.  He's the kind of guy that you want to meet when you're walking down the street.  I will gladly sell my dead peasant souls to this Chichikov.  I won't argue, I won't complain about the exchange rates.  Gogol is a mad, runaway genius, and when I am on my deathbed I will say to my children: Gogol made it all worthwhile 
 The novel is a tragic tale of sexual discrimination that is pretty blunt in its treatment of premarital sex, abandoning newborns, prostitution, etc. There are some key differences in names of the characters depending on the edition you read. This is one of the classic epic family tales in which one side of the family prospers and the other suffers 
 This book is for those that really want to COMMUNICATE -- not simply write or speak well. It includes over 1000 (yes I said one thousand) tips taught in 23 situational lessons. I found Booher's writing style to be conversational and easy-to-follow. After reading the book cover-to-cover, I also find it a straightforward  reference where I can "look up" how I might handle "special" circumstances. There's also a full list of all the tips in the back that I used to highlight a few goals that I want to put in practice in my professional and personal life 
 great pen for puppiies or small dogs. You can  bend over it or use the door for dogs to come and go as they like. I ordered 2  and they came right away have ordered 6 more they have been on back order for a month so far 
 I normally don't write reviews, but these jeans are the best ever! They run SMALL and still fit over my wide thighs and hips, and somehow manage to fit my smaller waist. Wide hips narrow waste almost always = gaps in the back, but not with these! 
  They started out by taking the abridged audio cassette (that I also have) and spliced in with a new voices the missed sections to make it unabridged. What ever is cheap and easy. 
 Milton Friedman, now approaching 94 has for his entire lifetime been the vanguard of freedom in academia. "Capitalism and Freedom" dispels the so-called myths about capitalism that have become prevalent in society. The book was orignally writeen in 1962 so that is the era in which his point are made. However, they are points that never go out of sytle. He refutes the lie that the free-market caused the depression (it was actually a tyrannical Federal Reserve), that socialism can be democratic, and others. Friedman discusses public education, roads, minimum wage laws (which he calls, "the most anti-black law on the books,"), as well as the how so-called "progressive" tax system and welfare actually hurt the poor.  Please understand that Friedman is NOT a "right-wing" extremist as some knucklehead below states. He is a libertarian. He developed the idea of the negative income tax to help the poor. His ideas were to help people not hurt them with the free-market. Someone who says otherwise doesn't know what they're talking about. 
 Before you spend your time and money on purchasing any books on the subject, buy this one first. Depending on your background and your needs, it may also be the last one you will purchase.  At the time I got to place my two-cent's worth, there are already 5 other reviews rating this book in a very positive light. While the style of presentation of a technical subject may not be strictly original, there have been few attempts by other authors to use it, this author has actually delivered - very effectively.   Technical writers, take a note of this work - it can serve as a blueprint for other technical subjects. Publishers, please a take note of the style and the thoroughness that this work employs to present a complex technical subject. The demand is there - the competition is very scarce.  Yes, this book presents a comprehensive technical explanation in a very practical as well as theoretical terms, and more importantly, places all the components of the technology subject matter within context. After you get through this book you will not be left in a position where you sit in front of your computer and realize you really have no idea how to apply the knowledge of the book you just read. Instead, you will be off and running. Think back, how many books that you read in the past delivered this kind of ability to you?  In closing, I appeal to the author of this book to select another subject of the current technology and write another book. Sadly, the bookshelves are full of "bibles", "primers", and definitive guides that leave the reader wondering what to do AFTER they read them.  If you need to know how to DO networking, this book is a must.  
 A very readable version of one of the most remarkable books ever written.  Hats off to Mr. Hedrick for making this ancient text seem so contemporary, without undermining the historical integrity of the work.  I am a big fan of making the classics accessible to the average reader and Mr. Hedrick has done that.  This would be a great gift for the recent high school or college grad.  We can only hope that he is working on something similar for Xenophon's Persian Expedition, another ancient text that is rich in contemporary lessons 
 Ok, if you're tired of all the talking animal CGI junk Hollywood pumps out each year, this is a great alternative. Keep in mind this is an indie flick so the CGI is not cutting edge but it is never a distraction from the story. Most of the story takes place looking down at a 2D plane, kinda like an old Atari game, which was very retro. I found the voice acting to be top notch for an indie film and I swear the main character 'A' Square sounds exactly like Owen Wilson at times. The music was also very well done. I have not read the book so I can not say how much the film deviates but I guarantee you've never seen a movie like this before. Honestly, the only thing I can really complain about is the ending. The meaning of the last scene is kinda vague, but hey, so is life. Maybe that's the point. Bottom line, if you like unique films, add this to your collection 
 ROOM is a great methodology, but I rarely encounter it in my work. I do mostly SOA and BPM work, and I think there are aspects of ROOM (particular its state machine language) that are well suited to that domain. I wonder how popular ROOM is these days in the real-time and embedded systems development community?  If you're into state machines, you'll enjoy this book. ROOM is influenced by the work of David Harel, supporting hierachical states, group transitions and transitions to history, choice points, and the ability to associate actions with both transitions and states. In contrast with Harel, ROOM does not support orthogonal states, although its concurrency model is quite powerful. I prefer ROOM to the UML for the modeling of state.  
 This book is good to illustrate the phenomena of light in a composition. It discusses the different kinds of light and their effect on the environment of the picture. Worth getting to use as reference material 
 All of the Velvet's albums were unique in their own way (sans Squeeze, Doug Yule's solo attempt to keep the Velvet's name alive).  This is perhaps the most unique of the bunch.  While I like the 1st and 3rd albums the best, this is still a fantastic album.  Lou's lead guitar playing on I Heard Her Call My Name recalls Yoko's screeches and Ornette Coleman's manic free jazz solos (which I think is a good thing).  The Sister Ray marathon is perplexing.  It's a fantastic song, yet I think I've made it through the entire thing only once or twice.  I usually get to about the 8 minute mark, then I just give up, like Tom Wilson, the enigneer who reportedly left the studio and said "tell me when it's over".  There are actually LONGER versions of Sister Ray on the Bootleg Tapes, Vol. 1 (upwards of 38 minutes), so this version is actually the easiest of them all to listen to.  In conclusion, it's a sonic wall of garage band noise, but fantastic if you're in the mood for it.  Makes a great double bill with Metal Machine Music....  
 I loved this book.  I love it so much, I want to give copies to my sisters, my friends and to get my husband to read it.  The ideas seem so simple and straight forward, that when you read it, you say "of course, I can do that in my life." Much of it covers identifying your goals, focusing on those and affirming that you can achieve them.  I found it very rational and not just wishful thinking.   I really like the exercises included in some chapters.  One exercise was to write a description of what would be a your perfect day.  He explains the purpose of each exercise and ask questions/gives direction for carrying it out. It's the type of book that can be sampled and parts re-read at intervals to reinforce your efforts for a happier life 
 Used to play a lot of cash games, but took a look over at tournaments due to the high Expected Value.  I tried my cash game strategy out on a few Sit 'n Go's and a couple Multi-Table Tournaments thinking that since I could rock any ring game I sat down at that it would transfer over to these tournaments just as well.  After about 6 loses I started to get really frustrated.  Even though the buy-in's were low, my cash game strategy just didn't hold up in tournaments.  Then I got Kill Phil.  I read through the whole thing, typed up my own "Strategy Sheets" that Lee talks about in the book and that are also available from him, and set out again to try my luck.    I swear to God, this book should be made of GOLD !  Over a 10 day period I played 21 Sit 'n Go's at my favorite poker site, and out of all 21, I placed in 13.  Not only that, I more than double my money!  Here's my numbers;  1st Place - 8 Times (This was a first for me...Actually, 8 firsts :-D )  2nd Place - 2 Times  3rd Place - 3 Times  Overall Profit minus Buy-In's = $127!!!  I'm still amazed!  Because all I have to do is sit down, play this extremely simple, yet complex strategy, and I rake in money everyday!    Some people may be reluctant to try this out, I know I was at first, but the results are simply stagerring!    Instead of sitting down at a ring game for 5 hours straight to "hopefully" double up, I can now sit down at any Sit 'N Go for less than 1 hour and simply DEMOLISH everyone there!    This is THE best tournament strategy book available.  Harrington is no doubt good for those that really want to get into the mind of a poker champ, but when it comes down to it, my money is on Kill Phil 
 This is the 3rd book in this most excellent series. First of all I would like to say that this book splits it's time between following Prince Arutha on his quest for Silverhorn and Pug and his search for answers about the danger they face. As with the other books in the series the story grips you and the action is plenty. I would say that Arutha's quest for Silverthorn is almost like a side quest in terms of the whole plot. It does help to introduce new aspects of the plot and it also has young Jimmy the Hand in the spotlight. I like how his character is developing. I also hope that his relationship with the "Upright Man" is further explored in later books. The one main gripe I have is how easy this books' main bad-guy was dispatched. You are made to believe that he is much more powerfull then he turns out to be. Everything is always wrapped up in a neat package at the end. Would not be so bad to see a good guy get his head kicked in (Lyam????)from time to time. Having said that I ordered the 4th book in the series within hours of finishing this 
 I have now read all of Sedaris' books (just finished dress your family in Corduroy and Denim), and I have loved them all.  They are great coming of age type of stories for any orientation and very funny.  not just gay literature -- just funny literature.  Not quite as funny as "Running with Scissors," but probably more poignant and identifiable to more of us.  Running with Scissors is hilarious, but seems out of this world. Sedaris as 99% as funny, but much more identifiable to us and seems much more like a family member of ours gone awry in a funny, funny way.  Plus, we all know that if our siblings were to rant about us, we'd be characters in a book like Sedaris' too!  I highly recommend this.  Quick read, and very, very good 
 This is a wonderfully talented group. And a very enjoyable show to watch. The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is because I went to see them and it has much more of an effect in person. But the show also involves a great entertainmen 
 The first Stephen King book I've ever read was "Christine" in sixth grade. I was instantly hooked, and I've been reading King's works for more than ten years now. Call me morbid, but I absolutely love what's going on inside the guy's head!  It's popular misconception that Stephen King is just a horror writer. Au contraire; most of King's work spans across genres. Rose Madder is one such example - while it has signature Stephen King gory scenes in it, I wouldn't exactly classify this as a horror novel. Psychological suspense? Applicable. A story of love and hope? It is that as well.  Rose McClendon-Daniels has endured fourteen years of abuse from her cop husband Norman. She's been through a miscarriage (prompted by Normie, of course), and endless beatings, but it takes one drop of blood on the bed sheets to make her realize that she has had enough. She takes a little of her husband's money and runs off to start a new life of her own.  However, being shut up in Norman's world for fourteen years has made our Ramblin' Rosie as innocent as a newborn babe. With very little money and nobody to run to, Rose is lucky enough to meet a string of kind strangers who helps her on her way to a new life. In just a few months, she has landed a decent-paying job, got a place of her own, lost weight, healed both physically and emotionally, and has started to fall in love again.  However, she can't stop looking over her shoulder, expecting to see him there. And right she is, for Norman, who can't get over the fact that Rose got awat from him, is obsessively bent on hunting her down. And cops are very good at finding people.  One day, Rose finds a painting in a pawn shop. It depicts a woman in a rose-colored chiton, looking towards the horizon. It actually isn't even a very good painting, but Rose finds herself strangely drawn to it. She is inspired by the woman in the painting, and is empowered by this mysterious figure. Rosie finds strength she doesn't even know she possessed.  Meanwhile, Norman is closing in on her. His insane rage leaves a string of violent deaths- of people who has helped Rosie- in its wake. Rose McClendon, determined that nothing would destroy her life again, must stand against what terrifies her most: her husband.  Nobody tells a story like Stephen King does, and nobody creates living, breathing characters better than he does. Each character not only has a unique voice, but different accents as well. And this book screams women empowerment as well, which would definitely appeal to a feminist like yours truly.  The only thing that didn't sit right with me were the EXTREMELY long exchanges between the woman in the painting (whom I have baptized as Foxy) and Rose. Foxy plays a bigger role in eliminating Rose's problems than you might expect. I mean, magic and reality could go hand in hand pretty well in stories, but I just couldn't help feeling that all that mythological crap went way *shwing!* off the storyline. I must admit, though, that picturing Normie as a minotaur (half-bull, half man) is just... so appropriate :P  This book is one of the few books that have struck a chord in me and made my normally stoic self go haywire with a rollercoaster of emotions. I wanted to strangle Rose for being such a pathetic idiot, but I couldn't help cheering her on as well. I felt mushy in the scenes with gentleman biker Bill, and I felt suffocated by Norman's presence in the story. I am disgusted yet fascinated with Psycho Norman who is the main character in the gory scenes. *chomp chomp chomp* I particularly loved the scene where Gert, the big momma self-defense teacher of Daughters and Sisters leaves a lasting mark on our Normie dearest. *grin*  Rose Madder is a beautiful story. It is a story of desperation, madness and death, but also of hope, kindness and the celebration of life. And that is what I loved most about the book - the striking contrast between the elements of the story. After all, the deepest, darkest desperation only serves to tremendously emphasize the tiniest ray of hope 
 I don't understand all the negative sentiment surrounding this release.  This disc blew me away the first time I heard it.  It has not left the CD player yet.  There is so much beautiful music contained here.  Everyone involved sounds great and you can sense that Berne and Torn are on the verge of sharing a common langauge.  
 My one year old grandson who lives next door to us loves to be read to. He loves this book and can't wait for you to turn the page so he can "feel" each part. His favorite thing to do each afternoon is go for a tractor ride with his Paw Paw, so having a book about a tractor is really cool. 
 As a listener new to the chill-out genre, I came across this artist by happenstance and was hooked at first song. I have since determined that if my life ever became a movie I would insist on a Lemon Jelly song to be played during the rolling credits.  People either really like the group or hate it. The appeal in Lemon Jelly is found in its creativity and drive-- all songs start with a simple premise and through a new instrument, beat, or sound, it grows into a beautiful complex array of diverse sounds. The downside is that some can perceive the slow evolution to be repetitive and it does make for a very lengthy track. Regardless, the songs invoke several different emotions in the listener:  Some of the more light-hearted tracks include 'Spacewalk and 'Nice Weather for Ducks'. 'Spacewalk' is particularly clever, incorporating Neil Armstrong's comments about landing on the moon with various instruments. 'Nice Weather for Ducks' is a personal favorite based on how playful it is (the best indicator is in the lyrics-- "all the ducks are swimming in the water, tra la la la la la" against the sound of raindrops).   Every now and then, some tracks border on creepiness. 'Experiment number 6' is one such song that gives off a vibe of worry and even intrusion. 'Homage to Patagonia' is a song that can best be described as music one would hear when walking into a chic (albeit overpriced) ethnic bar.   Essentially, Lemon Jelly is a take-it-or-leave-it group based on how eccentric the music is. Listen to some sample tracks, because should it be appealing, the listener will be hooked just as I am. Because listening to one track will tell the listener in 5 minutes what takes hours to explain in a review, go listen to a sample. It's worth a shot.   
 Wendell Jaffe swindled a lot of people out of money and then conveniently disappeared from his boat.  The verdict was suicide, but the insurance company that had sold him a half-million dollar insurance policy is not convinced.  When 5 years passed, the company was forced to pay the premium to Jaffe's wife.  Two months later, a man looking very much like Jaffe is spotted in Mexico.  The insurance company hires private investigator Kinsey Millhone to investigate and she does spot a man who appears to be Jaffe, along with his girlfriend Renata.  They escape Kinsey's surveillance and she returns to California.  Jaffe's son Brian is in big trouble with the police and Kinsey concludes that Jaffe will return to help his son.  As she continues her investigation she becomes acquainted with Jaffe's supposed widow and his two troubled sons.  She also comes in contact with some of her long-lost family, and agonizes over whether she wants to establish a relationship with them, and open up old wounds.  Sue Grafton can be relied on to provide a good read, and this book, although not the best in the series, is no exception 
 A first class read for any history buff.  Right up there with 'The Ornament of the World' by Maria Rosa Menocal

 Certainly helped me establish boundaries in new relationships.  Also helped me learn not to help a person destroy my boundaries out of an attempt to be nice.  There is no fighting hate with love in this book. Very useful 
 I bought a copy of this book while camping in Big Pine Key and read it over the course of a day or two.  The book made me look at the Keys in a different way and really added to my trip by giving me a sense of some of the history surrounding the region.  No complaints here.  
 I highly recommend this book. He starts out examining old societies that failed and why they failed, then slowly moves to modern times. However, reading the environmental issues of the day one comes to quickly realize we are not much different from those collapsed societies of the past. There is hope, in that by realizing and learning from man's past mistakes we may be able to protect our world for future generations to enjoy. 5 stars 
 If you are interested in learning more about Africa, this book is a perfect place to start. Don't let the page count intimidate you, Meredith's writing style is very clear and he achieves a perfect balance of facts & figures, analysis, and anecdotes to keep the reader involved and the pace moving.  The entire history of the African continent from Independence to the present day is covered in a very organized and methodical structure. Meredith manages to tell the story of so many countries whose paths are so intricately connected in a very fluid and coherent manner. The result is a very impressive work that comprehensively covers the issues that have impacted Africa through its cycles of hope and despair.   
 Why did I decided to listen to an autobiography, I still don't know, autobiography's have never interested me before? However, Bill Clinton's autobiography, articulate and exceedingly detailed, was the exception.   Aghast by Clinton's extraordinary memory, I found myself lured in by the minutia of his narrative; a perfect account of every name, date, and place since he was a kid! He has almost a photographic memory; a prerequisite of any Yale law graduate.   Public opinion often casts presidents as idiots, when in fact they are some of the brightest minds in our country. To become a president takes a great deal of intellect, wisdom, charisma, will power, and luck. Marveled by Bill Clinton's brain power, I wished I was him.   Bill Clinton leaves the reader inspired by his biography; motivating the reader to accomplish their own goals. An upbeat former president, Clinton is still a leader and motivational speaker. A must read for anyone who needs direction in their life.    
 Excellent reicital of one scientist's search for the means to prolong human life.  I found it to be a very good introduction to concepts such as stem cells and telomerase - areas I had only vague knowledge.  But the best part of the book is its description of Dr. West's passion for ending human death and mortality.  Dr. West echoes many thoughts I have had myself - man does not want to die!    Despite the narrow minded opposition of obsolete religious teachings, science will find the way to overcome and we will reach one of mankind most long soughts yearnings.  Perhaps we will lose part of our humanity in doing so, but in my opinion it will be a transformational change that takes us to the next level of life.  This book describes one possible approach on this journey 
 Lewis's book on Love is one of the most insightful and helpful books I've ever read. His intellect is impressive, his theology flawless; so much so that one cannot help but benefit from reading this book... or practically any of his other works, of which there are quite a few. It's really a shame that men like this have to pass on the next life, isn't it? 
 a good and clear book for improving your code in small steps. a lot of (not language specific) good examples. 
 The Mystery of Breathing works on a number of levels. The novel is unsurpassed as a piece of literary fiction, but it also works as an intellectually astute character study, a riveting thriller, and as an insight into the world of premature babies and the medical professionals who fight to save their lives. Klass peppers her narrative with short, sharp sentences and alternatively jumps between the past and the present; the result is a narrative that has an almost urgent and frenzied quality, fitting perfectly with the concurrent themes of ambition and career.     The main protagonist in the Mystery of Breathing is Maggie Claymore, a leading neonatologist at a busy Boston hospital. She's absolutely committed to her work - she works long hours, and fanatically assists in bringing the smallest and sickest babies back to life. Her loyal husband Dan, who also works as a doctor for the underprivileged, understands her commitment, and generally supports her in her endeavors.  Maggie is organized, disciplined, and reliable - "a neat person who needs her world to be neat." She's also an excellent, compassionate and ambitious practitioner, but she has a tendency to be egotistical, arrogant and "far too wedded to her own arguments." She thinks nothing of berating other doctors and inexperienced medical interns for being hesitant and not knowing enough about their job. The novel opens with her dramatic resuscitation of a premature baby, who teetered on the verge of death until Maggie's skill helps the tiny lungs take a breath. Then, in front of nurses and staff, she chews out a resident for not being more prepared for emergencies.   The same day she gets a malicious and hate-filled letter that vilifies her as being evil and self-satisfied. Soon letters blasting her competence and hinting at her responsibility in the death of a child are posted on walls around the hospital and are being sent to hospital officials. One evening, she returns to her office to find a bedpan full of someone's nasty diarrhea on her desk. Maggie's world of professional security and temerity begins to fall apart as the administrators hire a detective to frantically find the letter writer. But the damage is already done - her co-workers are whispering behind her back, and many of the colleagues start admitting that Maggie - determined to save every baby's life no matter the cost - is far too aggressive in reviving infants who will more than likely end up with brain damage or serious health problems.        Klass juxtaposes Maggie's modern dramas with a look back at her life as a child, and as a teenager where her religiously conservative, unfocussed mother, Annalisa tries to instill a "cramped and pinched life" into Maggie. Good friends who felt sorry for her poor and single state so carefully scrutinized Annalisa. But Maggie is an example of a modern woman who has reinvented herself, her home, her sex life, and her personal relationships. She realizes that she doesn't have to grow up to live the life in which she was raised and that she can pick and choose a life from "the great treasure chamber of the world."   Much of the narrative focuses on Maggie's internal life, and as the smear campaign gets worse, a conflict begins to rage within her. She finds herself asking why she's here and what she's feeling. Maybe her experiences in the neonatal unit will make her a more understanding person, aware of her own vulnerability and of the quirks and turns of fate. The Mystery of Breathing is a finely balanced, subtle novel that says a lot about the costs of career, the revelations of our hidden secrets, and the fear of being exposed.

 Beck's best at his hippest, funkiest, top. Put this CD in your player and a party is virtually bound to start. Unlike almost any other pop artist Beck oozes talent and imagination. He shrugs off convention and creates an amalgam of musical styles that always seem to fit just right. Each of Beck's new CD's always seem new and some fans of his earlier works might not like this new one but if you like any kind of dance or funk there's a whole lot of fun here. Mixed Bizness gets my vote for the best. 
 I am still blown away by the fact that this book was written over 80 years ago.  But the lessons in this book still hold true to this day.  It is unfortunate that many people have forgotten these lessons.    This book lays out the basic principles on how to become financially successful.  And thankfully, this is not a book filled with some outrageous quick rich schemes or requiring you to attend some useless seminar.  It has basic and time-tested principles which will help you to lead a financially secure future.  Quite simply put, it's now about how many Gs you pull down, it's how you spend those Gs which will determine your financial success.  I have given this book out as gifts to colleagues and friends.  All of have benefited from reading this book.  But the best part of this book is the length ... you can finish reading it in a single afternoon.  And unlike some other financial books, it's quite entertaining.  Take the first step towards planning for the future ... get this book 
 As a long time dog owner (and ownee) I really enjoyed this movie. It is family oriented, very warm and has a wonderful ending.  In between I loved how the personalities of the various dogs were portrayed.  I happen to be partial to poodles but I liked the boxer best.  Would definitely recommend for light viewing.   
 This is the book I wish I'd been able to give to my family and friends several years ago when I began my own journey in the Independent Sacramental Movement. (I've made up for lost time and bought several copies for friends.)  Bishop Plummer has given us a generous and insightful glimpse into ways of doing and being Church that too often go unnoticed. There's an exuberant chaos in the Independent Churches today - at its best, filled with the joy of the Good News. I am, frankly, amazed at the sheer breadth of groups covered in this one volume, and at the level of access Bp. Plummer was able to gain across ideological lines to bring this information to the public. This book stands head and shoulders above previous efforts to give an actual flavor of who we are, and how we aspire to proclaim the Gospel.  Bp. Plummer has done a fine job of creating a family portrait - a snapshot in time - "warts and all", by a member of this extended family of faith. Thank you, John! 
 If you have kids, or if you pay taxes that support schools, you need to read this book.  The Moores' thesis is that children aren't physically or emotionally ready for school until they are 10 to 12 years old. Emotionally, younger children (age 10 and below) need a loving, permanent relationship with a few persons. This is a perfect description of the relationship between parents and child. Sending the young child off to school gives the child the opposite of that: at school the child gets superficial relationships with many people. The result is that the child loses the sense of security he needs, forms unsatisfactory bonds with other children, and may never form the essential bond with his parents. Physically, children's brains are simply not ready for many of the demands of school before age 10 to 12, so the years spent in school are wasted academically. The gains that the children make during those early years in school could be made in a year or two starting at a later age, with fewer negative consequences.  Homeschooling parents don't have to worry about the emotional affects of typical homechooling practice, but we do have to worry about trying to push academics too early. This book shows us that it is possible to push too much, too early, and that the harm we do could outweigh the good. It's not all gloom; I think that it can also show us how to push our kids as fast as they should go, and no faster.  The Moores present an impressive and convincing mass of research from the fields of optometry, neurophysiology, sociology and education to support their thesis. The bibliography has over 700 entries, mostly peer-reviewed research. The Moores contribution with this book has been to tie together research threads from several disciplines, and make it accessible to parents, while still making it useful to scholars. 
 This book was given to me as a Christmas gift this past year. As a writer of Spy Fiction ("The Malagasy Tortoise"), this book has given me a wonderful and exacting insight to the many gizmos and gadgets being used in the field of spying. From weapons to decoding devices "The Ultimate Spy" has it all. I recommend this book to anyone interested in anything clandestine or who is looking to expand their knowledge of the CIA, the FBI or the private sector of spying. This book is loaded with excellent photos of spy personalities, guns, secret hiding spots, good guys and bad guys -- everything is in here to make yourself a fantastic investigation. An exceptional book, one that I now keep right next to my computer 
 Nick Cullather's account of the CIA operation PBSuccess is quite interesting in that it relies primarily on CIA documents.  These documents were unavailable to those previously writing about the overthrow of Jacobo  Arbenz in 1954.   He provides insight into the processes rather than into  the personalities involved. The only negative about this account, pointed  out by Cullather himself, is that the CIA uses retired agents to screen  material before publication.  The screeners' deletions can be quite  extensive in certain areas despite the CIA promise to be more open.  As one  reads this book it becomes annoying when many names, sentences and  paragraphs are sanitized by the retired CIA agents.  Nonetheless the book  is informative, well written and a very enjoyable read.   This book is a  must for anyone interested in the  covert world of the CIA.  The book also  would be of interest to anyone studying the nature of U.S. involvement in  the national affairs of our Latin American neighbors 
 This is a great collection of music that seems to have an eclectic group of sounds for individuality in taste. My personal favorites are Hanging Around, A Long December, and Mr. Jones. I've been into the Crows for about 6 years now. I remember when VH1 used to play their Mr. Jones video ALL the time. Then, sometime in 1999, I heard their "Hanging Around" song from their album "A Desert Life" and became hooked 
 First I got captured by the poetic language. Then to my suprise I noticed I was regularly laughing out loud! This novel is delightful and compelling, although you may feel it becomes just a little long-winded from the moment when the narrator retreats.  I also want to add that I don't really understand why so many readers think it is impossible to find out the sex of the narrator. I thought the affair with Inge and the hilarious semtex attacks on the men's urinals were evidence enough for her being a woman... But I must admit the author definitely plays with preconceived ideas of gender. This, however, adds to the book's value and makes sure it remains in your mind for some time after putting it down. For me this was a very good book that perhaps could have been brilliant. I'll definitely read more of Winterson's work 
 Richard Green has captured the spirit of independence and the Native American in this fabulous collection of pages from Te Ata's diary and notes from her husband Clyde Fisher 
 I'd give Gooney Bird Greene 4 stars because it's a sweet and funny book that teachers a lot to a young reader, but I wasn't incredibly impressed.  Newton's third law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.  Of course, that's a part of science, but action and reaction become a part of second grade when Gooney Bird Greene joins Watertower Elementary School and her new classmates, not to mention her teacher, Mrs. Pigeon, don't know how to react.  You see, Gooney Bird quickly proves to be as strange as her name when she shows up on her first day at Watertower fabulously clad in pajamas, topped with a cowboy hat, claiming that she just moved there from China.  Those are the actions, so what are her classmates' reactions?  That's for you to find out by reading Gooney Bird Greene by Lois Lowry.  Her laid back, perky personality and charisma eventually win over her classmates, though, and she soon becomes their favorite story teller.  All of her stories are absolutely true, or so she claims, but her audience is more than a little skeptical when their titles include: How Gooney Bird Came From China on a Magic Carpet; The Prince, the Palace, and the Diamond Earrings; Why Gooney Bird Was Late for School Because She Was Directing a Symphony Orchestr;, and Beloved Catman Is Consumed by a Cow.   	The moral of this story, though I'm not sure Lowry particularly tried to incorporate one, is that things aren't always what they seem.  All of Gooney Bird's stories are very different from what their titles make you think, but the titles still fit the stories.  All of the characters in Gooney Bird Greene are your basic stock characters of second grade school children, the second grade teacher, Gooney Bird's parents, and all of the characters in her stories, but hilariously exaggerated.  Lois Lowry's style in this book is very well adapted to an audience of beginning readers and the way she writes very much reminds me of poetry.  The story flows wonderfully from one thing to the next, she uses repetition skillfully in some places, and I could've sworn I saw a simile, but I cannot locate it now.   	Gooney Bird Greene is entirely set in Gooney Bird's second grade classroom.  This is a quick-read chapter book with occasional pictures perfect for a beginning reader.  So if you know one, be sure to order Gooney Bird Greene.   
 This handbook of change is a must-have for any executive, simply as a primer in the language spoken by consultants. Read this book and become instantly familiar with the latest, most successful, and even the trendiest theories of change management. The editors have evaluated 18 leading change methods, as applied and tested by some of the largest corporations in the United States. They group the change methods by functional categories, making it easier for readers to go directly to the method that applies to their particular problem. Another bonus: The leading practitioners in the field write the change method chapters, bringing a unique depth of perspective. The editors also have written several excellent chapters on the nature of change. An extraordinary comparative matrix - worth the price of the book by itself - is included in the "Afterword." We [...] recommend this book to executives, managers, change agents, human resources professionals and students 
 This is a great movie if you are in the mood for comedy.  I remember watching this when I was a kid and it is still just as funny.  Check it out 
 This is the only book of Prof. Kissinger's that I have read, and I have to say that I am not as impressed by it as I thought I would be.  There is no doubt about his intelligence and wide range of knowledge, but he has the diplomat's habit of getting bogged down in the details and in the process forgetting his main point.  Here is the final paragraph in the book:  "While traditional patterns are in transition and the very basis of experience and knowledge is being revolutionized, America's ultimate challenge is to transform its power into moral consensus, promoting its values not by imposition but by their willing acceptance in a world that, for all its seeming resistance, desperately needs enlightened leadership."  Well, yes, and, as Rodney King said, "Why can't we all just get along?"  Content aside, the above quotation is a one-sentence paragraph containing 52 words, a typical sample of Kissinger's turgid, unimaginative, and bureaucratic prose style.  One can almost hear his droning accent as one tries to follow these interminable ramblings.  So:  His style is abysmal and his conclusions either naive or disingenuous.  He KNOWS we live in a world dominated by force, that platitudes are not going to keep us safe and secure, and that perhaps even the SEARCH for safety and security is a chase after rainbows.  As a long-time advocate of realism in foreign policy he should be able to come up with something with a little more depth than this.  In spite of these defects this book is well worth reading.  Although the first six chapters, the bulk of the book, are primarily an indictment of Bill Clinton's foreign policy (or lack thereof), the last chapter contains two very helpful and informative discussions.  The first section of this chapter is a review of the basic historical approaches to American foreign policy, which he has identified as "Hamiltonian", "Jacksonian", and "Wilsonian".  The "Hamiltonian" is a tradition of practical balance-of-power maneuver advocated most vigorously in the early years of our Republic by Alexander Hamilton, whose first concern was to make sure America avoided being trapped and destroyed by the military monarchies then ruling Europe.  The "Jacksonian" tradition, named for President Andrew Jackson, more or less corresponds with Isolationism as advocated and practised for most of the 19th century and during the interwar years of the 20th century.  It was a reflection of the development of American self-confidence and relative geographical isolation from the wars of Europe.  The "Wilsonian" tradition, originating with Woodrow Wilson, has been the major influence on American foreign policy since WWII.  It aspires to make the world over in America's liberal democratic image.  The speeches of George W. Bush could easily have been delivered by Wilson himself.  And the Democrats, who are now so viciously attacking Bush and his policies, when in power have been vigorous advocates of the Wilsonian approach.  When Kissinger himself was in power and responsible for liquidating the American position in Vietnam, it seems to me he followed a pretty orthodox "Hamiltonian", not to say "Machiavellian", approach to foreign policy.  It is therefore surprising to hear him sounding so Wilsonian in this book.  One has to wonder if he is being sincere.  Nevertheless, he knows his  subject and presents it well.  The last section of the last chapter, on Universal Jurisdiction, is also very well done.  In the preceding chapter he reviews the basic motivations and concepts of the Treaty of Westphalia, that in 1648 stopped the barbaric blood-letting of the Thirty Years' War.  He then shows how the recent preoccupation with Universal Human Rights, and especially the setting up of the International Criminal Court in 1998, completely overturns the settlement so painfully reached at Westphalia.  (It should be noted that Westphalia is a province of Germany.  The treaty is named after a province because the parties to the treaty were too hostile to meet in the same city.)  Of course, as many have pointed out, Kissinger has a dog in this fight.  Serious proposals have been made by his political enemies to prosecute him for war crimes, much as Pinochet was indicted by Spain and arrested in Britain for "crimes against humanity" that occurred in Chile.  Kissinger, however, is not the only person whose personal security is placed at risk by this new and intensely idealistic focus on transnational prosecutions.  Under this doctrine all American military and diplomatic personnel serving overseas are potentially liable to criminal prosecution by third parties for actions taken in the line of their official duties.  Kissinger rightly points out that this unprecedented development has the potential to massively increase the difficulty of America's pursuit of its national security in a dangerous world.  In summary, this book doesn't live up to its title.  However, it should be read for Kissinger's description of the major historical trends of American foreign policy and for his analysis of the doctrine of Universal Jurisdiction 
 Very well written.  Covers a lot of important aspects as far as javascript development is concerned.  It helped me out in 3 of my web development projects already, provided in-depth concise answers.  Thanks to the author, very well written 
  I first heard "So Come Back, I am Waiting" when I was listening to KEXP.org (a fantastic Seattle radio station) and I didn't pay too much attention to it until I thought I heard the word "Abecedarians". Now, I already feel like I'm one of, hmmm, maybe 1000 people who have some idea of what that word means (a derogatory name for a group of early Protestants who denied all human knowledge, including speech) and was amazed it'd be in a song shortly following the word "wisteria" in a gorgeous, tense epic about a serial killer.   I couldn't get the song out of my head, so the next day I bought the album and, seven months later, I'm still listening to it and still discovering new ideas, themes and lyrics.  
 Hello everyone. I put Sieze the Night down about five minutes ago. The book is quite a good read for fans of the author, or of the first book, Fear Nothing. The characters are great, very easy to come to love.   The plot line is much better in the second book, elaborating on many aspects of the first installment. I found it hard to put down.  However, the ending left room for another book. I began my search for the elusive third Christopher Snow book and have found nothing conclusive. Please.if any of you fans know if there really is, or will be a third book, let me know. I have started a discussion below, I would very much appreciate any helpful information 
 I read this text for an intro class to Cultural Studies, and I really enjoyed it.  Hall discusses the issues of race, gender, and class in our society in many interpretations within this text. He shows how all these  three are interconnected, and does so in a fascinating way.  The question  of how did we become the way we are in society is addressed in various ways  through different representations: the media, culture, and ourselves.  A  lot of historical aspects is presented in this text to give the reader more  of an answer to the previous question.  This text is great for someone who  is into cultural studies, or anyone who is interested in just learning more  about themselves and making sense of the society around them 
 This movie was always a fun one to watch; however, after Katrina in New Orleans, it was the best comic relief on those days when it was all going wrong as we rebuilt the house. Love the movie 
 Dr. Geoffrey Miller, in The Mating Mind, offers a hypothesis regarding the brain that is truly exciting. He postulates that our advanced functioning evolved at a rapid pace due to sexual selection. Women, over thousands of years began to show preference for men with large brains featuring creative intelligence and expansive verbal ability. Unlike with a peacock's tail, the brains of females also developed to enable them to discriminate amongst the men they encountered in the hopes of selecting the finest specimen. Many speculate that a good deal of our early mating was a result of rape, and that men took women when they saw them, but this was generally not the case. Husbands, fathers, brothers, cousins, and sons have always shown an aversion to their female relations being raped, and, throughout history, women largely have been free to choose the best males with whom to mate.  Miller's theories are extremely intriguing, and I do not regard them as being mutually exclusive with the predominant view that our minds evolved as a means to overcome the complex environmental challenges of our existence. This may have been why women showed the preference for large brains that have over time. I think both concepts are harmonious with one another.  As a writer, Miller has a lively pen and does not overburden readers with scientific lingo. This book is definitely geared for a popular audience. Politically, Miller is a true child of the universities which is painfully evident in the deference he displays towards feminism and Marxism. He appears to be a master diplomat with skills which must have evolved from dealing with academic overlords for many a year. One can't help but sense that a man as level-headed as Miller sees through much of the political correctness infecting academe, but that he is smart enough not to condemn the religious tenets of PC. Overall, this is an excellent book and I emphatically recommend it. 
 I bought this particular version of Pictionary because we had been playing with the same version for many years, so I felt it was time for an upgrade with new materials, new items to draw, ect. The first thing I liked about this version was the more portable box, which is no more than 9 inches long. The previous version I had was about 24 inches long and a major eye soar. Of course, presentation isn't everything.  I got it home, opened the box, and was so pleased to find a more than adequate supply of paper tablets to write on and pencils. Also, the board has been shrunk just slightly for portability. The cards now include 20 Phrase Cards, which state phrases instead of objects. Also, there is now the option for there to be more than 2 teams (5 if I am remembering correctly). The quality of the game seems to have increased remarkably.  Having said all that, the only major thing I dislike is that the game, while it says it is for 3 or more players, is extremely unenjoyable without 4 players. Sometimes, one wants to play Pictionary because it is a very addicting game for kids, teens, and adults, but 3-person-Pictionary is a lame use for such a well-thought game.  I highly suggest buying this game. If you don't use it on a daily basis, it's a terrific addition to parties and family get-togethers--almost a necessity. Kids love it because it allows you to draw what you get on your card, but since they are children, sometimes they don't know what the object on the card is; however, Pictionary is a necessary addition to any household 
 I found this book to be amazing.  I have researched the various relgions of the world for several years now (never really seeing the big picture untill recently), but I found this to be still a kind of difficult read.  It was the first book that truely introduced to me some of the Qabalah, and it took a little bit of outside reasearch to get at this book.  From my findings though, one can not really read Regardie cover to cover without study (or a lot of previous knowledge).  I got a lot out of this book, and would recomend it to anyone willing to work through the material.      I found working through the material and doing the research to understand the book to be just as valuable as the book itself also.  A great starter on some of the more western esoteric traditions some (eastern stuff in there too) 
 Dr. Hollabaugh has certainly shed useful light on the concept of embedded linux.  He intelligently sets the stage and walk you through real steps for deploying a fully embedded linux control and monitoring system.  The diagram, table, and code examples will leave you with a very clear understanding of the subject matter (providing you have some background with linux development).  Personally, I was totally captivated and found myself extremely happy that I have chosen this book to help thrust foward my own intelligence of embedded linux.  This book and website....has become a primary reference for future embedded linux application 
 This is the third booki read on the situation between Israel and Palestine and so far is the best book yet.Mr La Guardia is an excellent historian with great knowledge of the situation in the Middle East.The way he tells the story is captivating and clear.One of the things i like the most was that he explains every detail of the conflict.He explains and describes every group involved, every city or place and the importance of every conflict.For example, he explains names like Hizbollah,Hamas,Mossad and a lot others that you hear a lot in the news.He also explains both sides of the conflict with accuracy using interviews and a lot of historical sources which gives you a very good understanding of the conflict.This is the book for complete understanding of the situation between Israel and Palestine.Fantastic work! 
 This book is a like a time-capsule that sheds light on the poker world before poker was on every channel and before Hold 'Em was the biggest game in town. A great look at one journalist's foray into the World Series of Poker, this is just a terrific book. He's a great writer, he captures the action clearly and with a 'you're in the game' point of view, and he makes it very exciting, yet still personal. A must read for all players 
 and arguably the best of the early ones (if not the best of all of his). Holiday is a wonderful synth pop album which ranks up there with 69 Love Songs as their best. This opened my ears to alot of synth pop music.  The album starts of with the 22 second long intro, which has a sixties-meets-synth sound to it (i think) and is followed by 13 brilliant tracks. All You Ever Do Is Walk Away is one of the best vocal performance from Stephin Merritt and also ranks as one of his best songs.

 This long overdue biography of Jim Webb fills a needed void in the literature of the Apollo program. Webb, a disarming but astute partisan Democrat from North Carolina ran NASA during the crucial years leading up to the Apollo program. This book not only details his personal life, but the wheeling and dealing that went on behind the scenes in Washington to get to the moon.   Nobody doubts that Webb was brilliant, but Webb was not without flaws. He was totally infatuated with Roosevelt-era New Deal big government, and ran NASA accordingly, sometimes to the detriment of the program. He adopted the mantra of "Space Age Management" and took it to mean a giant, monolithic government run program straight from FDR's playbook. I think the book does a great job explaining Webb's less than savory relationships to politicians and others of questionable ethics in both the Kennedy and (especially) Johnson administrations such as Bobby Baker. It also recalls a less than savory battle with fellow Democrat and political climber, Walter Mondale, that exposes Washington political opportunism at its worst. I rate the book four stars as the book tends to downplay the significance of ethically borderline issues that occurred in Webb's tenure. To the credit of the book, Bizony does correctly point out that Kennedy was not the true champion of space he is revered to be today, but saw space exploration as a politically expedient course to follow, as did Johnson.  On the plus side, the author absolutely nails the deplorable history of NASA since Apollo and presents an accurate and devastating portrait of the Shuttle and International Space Station programs. Mr. Bizony correctly identifies the root cause of the problems in both programs as an unholy alliance of political objectives and unfocused technology. Webb's stature rose significantly in my eyes when I read Bizony's account of the hostility Webb had for Robert McNamara, another big government technocrat, but one without the vision of either Kennedy or Webb. NASA veteran Bob Seamans comes off as a much needed moderating force within the administration, and this book also details the fascinating relationship between Seamans and Webb.   Overall this is a noteworthy book. While it occasionally seems to come off the rails and get sidetracked, Piers Bizony always manages to tie up loose ends, resulting in a detailed and historically important book. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the space program, and further to students of management to learn not only the successes, but failures of the biggest single peacetime logistical puzzle in history 
 Uncut is without a doubt the best music mag in the world right now....but why on earth would anyone buy 12 issues for the price of 15?  This mag is 8 bucks in any of the stores mentioned in the other reviews here, not 11 an issue which is what this subscription breaks down to....whats up with that?  Also, if you get a subscription direct from Uncut's wesite, it's literally half the price they're selling it for here 
 Now in an updated and expanded second edition, Living With Rheumatoid Arthritis by Tammi L. Shlotzhauer (Clinical Instructor of Medicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center and Practicing Rheumatologist at Rheumatology Associates of Rochester) and James L. McGuire (Chairman of the Department of Medicine at Mount Auburn Hospital, Cambridge, Massachusetts) is a large print compendium of the latest information on Rheumatoid Arthritis concerning the diagnosis, treatment, and daily life (from special diets to possible alternative therapies and more) with this troublesome and painful disease. Living With Rheumatoid Arthritis informatively presents its facts in terms and text ideal for the non-specialist general reader, yet without glossing over specific issues, problems, medicines, or other challenges facing rheumatoid arthritis sufferers. Simply put -- this is a work of superb medical scholarship and Living With Rheumatoid Arthritis should be on the shelves and available to the patrons of every community library system in this country 
 Creed's third studio release "Weathered" marked two landmarks for the band:  It all but solidified their status as a band that would consistently release great rock albums, and later be hailed with the likes of Led Zeppelin and Van Halen.  It also marked the end of the band, for it was thier last studio release.  Creed's magic would be cut short before it could ever be fully realized...but at the same time, perhaps we got the core of the band's potential.  With that, the album "Weathered" was a nice way to go out!  With Weathered me move into a sharper metal sound that isn't to harsh but does not cuddle the listener.  The first three tracks take us into a whole new world with "Bullets" "Freedom Fighter" and the haunting, moody track that explodes with emotion in the chorus "Who's got my back?".  It wouldn't be Creed without a little power ballad, so "My Sacrifice" has become a radio friendly staple that's a fun listen.  "Don't Stop Dancing" is an excellent soft tune that gives the album some balance.  11 Tracks in all, it's never enough, it's what we got, so we'll cherish these final songs from what was one of the greatest bands to emerge from the 90's.  
 How can anyone bash this serial?. It was made in 1949. All batfans across the world can thank this type of thing for making the franchise what it is today.  Good honest (early) filmaking, a pleasure to own and watch 
 Speak of the Devil spoke to me. Being a life-long resident of the New York Metropolitan area, I could more appreciate the vivid settings and enjoy the authentic, interesting characters that Richard Hawke sets to life on the pages of his debut thriller. Fritz Malone, a multi-dimensional personality with a dense history, seems not the spare creation of a first-timer, but rather the substantial one of a veteran writer (Harlan Coben comes to mind). Many of the ancillary characters seem poised to join center stage in what I hope will be a continuing series of hard-boiled crime novels. If so, I'll be interested in their stories and will find myself anticipating each new offering in this fledgling series 
 Mr. Koenig puts everything down to minute detail.  Too bad we don't have enough "believers" to see our country act accordingly 
 OK, I bought this movie to try a movie on my iPod - there weren't many to choose from and I was hesitant because I don't usually particularly enjoy Sharon Stone - but, wow.  This is a must see movie in my opinion, well acted, etc.  Too bad it somehow didn't get noticed because of "Dead Man Walking" - which was a good movie, but would not get 5 stars from me.  All movies have some plots that are used over and over - I believe the saying is that there are really only 5(?) plots - so this one, as all of them do, has intermingled things we've seen before, but they are extremely well interwoven with each other.  As I said, I am not much of a Sharon Stone fan, but she's "typed out of cast" in this one, and is very impressive.  Rob Morrow does a great job too, and as, almost, always, Randy Quaid.  I'll watch it many times over - my true judge of whether a movie is good or not.  And, I was fortunate enough to get the widescreen version, I can no longer enjoy the full screen versions - what can I say 
 Simply Awesome! I keep having to stop the tape so it can sink in 
 What I found particularly informative was Dover's fascinating theory on the social use of Homosexual pursuit among the citizen class. Particularly the information that hubris was a crime in democratic Athens. What has this  to do with homosexuality, you ask? the first half of the book explains.  Ancient greek homosexuality in no way resembles the modern version and it  is mind-blowing to see how they differ and how analogous structures, in two  different societies, may seem to be opposites. For instance, in speaking of  homosexual pursuit Dover is constantly forced, when comparing Ancient  Athenian society to modern, to use heterosexual pursuit as an analogy for  homosexual pursuit. The resemblances between modern heterosexuality and  ancient homosexuality are just that strong 
 by far, Picture This, is my favorite cd from the JB collection...have three copies...one for the home, one for the car, and another he personally signed for me at one of his concerts! Been a fan of his since he appeared on tv talk show back in late 1997...despite our daily hectic schedules, his music always brings us back to a place that is calm, relaxing & peaceful...now that we have small children, they are even accustomed to listening his music, which makes bedtime even sweeter! :) 
 Simply an excellent book.  One can not read this book and not marvel and Dazai's superb skill as a story-teller.  Some consider The Setting Sun to be a "lesser work" than No Longer Human.  Sure, whatever.  The Setting Sun stands on its own, and is very much a worthwhile read 
 the movie is great but I received my items in good Condiation.  I will buy products again 
 Two recent books about megalomaniacs: genial, larger-than-life luminaries of the food and wine world, Robert Parker, the American wine critic, and Bernard Loiseau, the French chef. They both tell of youthful talent that became increasingly ambitious as it ripened. Parker, the most powerful individual in the wine industry, ultimately claimed virtual infallibility; Loiseau, anointed with three Michelin stars but beset with doubts, ultimately committed suicide.  The Perfectionist is the saga of Bernard Loiseau, big, outwardly gregarious and confident, inwardly shy and insecure, whose traveling salesman father apprentices him, as a teenager, to the chef at his favorite restaurant. As it happens, while young Bernard is flailing away at his first kitchen tasks, the Michelin guide awards the restaurant three stars. Bernard, who's a competent though not exceptional cook, is awestruck: winning those three stars for himself become his life's obsession.  Bernard is fortunate to find a patron who sets him up at a country inn, the famous Côte d'Or in Saulieu, a once-thriving market town in northern Burgundy now bypassed by the autoroute. No matter: Bernard settles in for the long haul. He assembles a talented team for his kitchen and dining room, he courts the Parisian press, he develops a network of local suppliers. He's unlucky in love (his first wife cheats on him with the maitre d'hôtel) but has a knack for the restaurant business (food journalists adore him); he wins back a Michelin star for venerable auberge, then two.  Now, as Bernard puts it, the trouble with success in the restaurant world is, "C'est jamais gagné." The battle's never over. First you strive for ten or twenty years to reach the top. It's not like training for the Olympics, where a single perfect routine wins you the gold medal; you've got to score a ten every day, twice a day. But then, after you've won, you panic even more: now that you've been given those stars, what if they take them away?  And poor Bernard, though happily married to his second wife, was bipolar. Mostly manic: that was the perfectionist his staff knew, the outgoing giant the adored by the media and the public.   (He was ebulliant, too, when I met him in Saulieu in the fall of 1998, eager to discuss his plans for a new bistro in Paris--eventually three--and an unprecendented plan to raise money by being listed on the Paris stock exchange.)  Then third Michelin star came along, and it seemed Bernard could do no wrong. But the tentacles of darkness were stronger than anyone knew.   A slight slip in one of the guidebooks, a rumor that his third Michelin star was in jeopardy, a change in the culinary fashion dictated by Paris critics: it all took its toll on Bernard.   His manic-depressive disorder--easy to diagnose in retrospect--was never treated. The right medications, it's assumed, could have saved him from his private demons. Instead he succumbed.   Rudolph Chelminsky, a keenly observant foreign correspondent, had already written one of the liveliest books about gastronomy, The French At Table, some 20 years ago. This longevity--critical to professional acceptance in France--and his deep understanding of French culinary history gave him unprecedented access to all the actors in this drama, including Bernard himself over a period of many years.   You taste Bernard's recipes, savor his enthusiasm for hospitality on every page. Even as you cringe at his effusiveness, you savor his generosity.   In the end, you mourn his death, but when the latest Michelin guide again awards his restaurant three stars, you recognize that Bernard Loiseau's spirit lives on.  A footnote to compare this book to William Echikson's Burgundy Stars, also about Loiseau. Chelminsky does everything that Echikson fails to do: he shows us how haute cuisine comes about. I read Burgundy Stars with mounting frustration at a writer whose research consisted of showing up and taking notes; I finished The Perfectionist with heady admiration for the author and his subject. That's the difference between blogging and real journalism.    
 I took another reviewer's recommendation and used this as my source of information for the American Government CLEP.  To say the least, this book does indeed cover the examination very thoroughly.  The topics covered in this book cover exactly what is on the CLEP examination without any other non-essential information (such as local government).  There were maybe a handful of questions (out of 100 total) that were not covered on the examination, but IF you truly know the material in this book, you will be able to pass the exam with no problems.  For the price and value, it is simply the best 
 A forbidding mansion far from town, a night of driving rain and thunder, a mute young woman who works for the ill matriarch, a spiral staircase that goes down to the shadowy basement...and a killer who strangles women who are "imperfect."  The Spiral Staircase may not be full of frights, but it is an eerie exploration of suspense. The mansion itself is a great prop. Lit by candles and gas light, the rooms, covered with flocked wallpaper, are filled with flickering shadows, deep velvet curtains, carved marble fireplaces and dark oaken tables. Helen Capel (Dorothy McGuire), who became mute when she was a child, works there as a maid. She helps care for Mrs. Warren (Ethel Barrymore), the bedridden, ill and strong-willed matron of the house. Mrs. Warren has a son, Steve Warren (Gordon Oliver), an unreliable ne'er-do-well, and a stepson, Professor Albert Warren (George Brent). She has no illusions. "They are both weaklings," she says.   In the village, young women are being strangled...one had a limp, another was simple minded, one had a scar on her face. It's not long before we realize Helen is on the killer's list, and that the killer is most likely someone who lives in the Warren mansion. One person who seems drawn to Helen is Dr. Parry (Kent Smith), the new physician in the village. He is convinced that Helen can be made to speak and wants to take her to Boston for treatment. Mrs. Warren, although bedridden and often irascible, is no fool about the murders. When Helen is late coming home in the evening from the village, Mrs. Warren tells her, "Come here. I'd hoped you were never coming back. You should run away. Leave this house tonight if you know what's good for you!" During the long night, however, the killer shows his determination to make Helen his next victim.  It's not too hard to figure out who the killer most likely is. Since Dorothy McGuire is the star of the movie, it's also unlikely that her character will be killed. What makes this movie work so well, in my opinion, are several elements. First, not whether Helen will be killed, but what dangers will Helen face unable to call for help, including a final confrontation with the killer? Second, who among the supporting cast will be killed? There is the professor's secretary, Blanche (Rhonda Fleming), the cook (Elsa Lanchester), her husband (Rhys Williams) and the nurse (Sara Algood). It's unlikely all will live. Third, the production values of the movie. The Spiral Staircase is beautifully staged and filmed, with each shot framed for maximum creepy effect. The descent to the basement, where one killing takes place and another is attempted, is almost worth the price of the DVD itself. The place is deeply shadowed with wooden trusses and brick walls, piles of cut wood and an axe, heavy casks and rows of cobwebbed wine bottles...so many places to hide, and the only light coming from candles so easy to blow out. Fourth, the killings are subtly handled, which makes them all the more unsettling. The murderer is never shown until the end. Before then we only see his eyes. We never see the actual killings, either, only black shadow and white hands clutching at the air. And fifth, the performances of Dorothy McGuire and Ethel Barrymore. McGuire, in my view, was a fine actress with an innate quality of goodness about her. We worry about Helen because of McGuire's skill and personality. Barrymore was a dominant actress in all her roles. Here, bedridden, she must act with her eyes and her face. She becomes an implacable old woman who sees that justice is done.   The Anchor Bay DVD has an excellent picture and audio. There are no significant extras 
 What does it take to get your customers to see the light, to praise your product like evangelists selling their creeds? How do you create customer evangelists whose word of mouth will convert other acolytes to your product? Authors Ben McConnell and Jackie Huba offer chapter and verse. They tell you how to encourage customers to preach your message for you. However, before consumers will take to the pulpit, you must have an excellent product or service that converts their thinking. There's good information here, though not much new. The last chapter sums everything up as nicely as a homily, and the appendix provides additional tips on e-mail marketing and jump-starting the evangelical process. The authors' penchant for name-coining adds little; at best it's confusing and at worst downright annoying ("word of mouse" is cute, but "Napsterizing"? "Customer Plus-Delta"?). We are is glad to see someone preaching the cause of being customer-oriented - we're already pretty faithful about that 
 I like the album.  The alternate versions of previously released stuff is good, but Dylan's voice obviously wasn't in tip top shape for them.  Either way, he makes the best of what he has.  Diamond Joe is the only one you'll understand completely if you don't already know the words (like me).  If you are looking for an album full of people re-singing Dylan in Dylan's style, this album isn't gonna give it to you.  There's a song that samples Rolling Stone and the rest of the lyrics are rapped in Italian.  It's doesn't have the same gravity as Dylan, but it's fun to listen to and catchy.  The Japanese cover of My Back Pages is good- really angry sounding.  I thought Sophie Zelmani's cover of Most of the Time was excellent.  It's quiet, she's got a pretty voice and she let's the desperation of the song into her voice.  The Los Lobos track's was nice.  The Dead track and Garcia track I found to be a little too slow and drab for me to appreciate.  One more cup of coffee was pretty wild - very gypsyesque.  City of Gold was OK - reminded me of a song Joe Cocker would do.  It didn't sound like a Dylan song 
 This book is divided into two sections.  The first one is an introduction to the techniques and materials used for bookbinding.  The technique are illustrated with clear drawings to show you what to do.  I don't know anything about bookbinding so I can't tell if this part of the book describes best practices, traditional techniques, or modern adaptations.  I can say, however, that it was perfectly understandable and clear.  The materials are all common and easy to find...though I would have liked to see more brand names mentioned, just so that I was EXTRA sure I was getting the right stuff at the store.  The second part of the book contains instructions for a series of projects.  Unless you are a pretty good artist, there's no way you will be able to reproduce these incredible miniature books since many of them include original artwork.  But WOW, are they cool to look at!  And of course you can design your own pages using stickers, clipart, cutouts, rubber stamps, or anything else.    Keep in mind that when the authors say "miniature," they mean it!   The projects are all very small.  (The techniques section in front will help you learn how to make books of any size, though. 
 There is so much to say about this book but I will try to make it short:  1. Great learning material for the nutritionally challenged.  2. Excellent reference book for when you hit a nutritional plateau or when your food knowledge is skewed.  3. Honest. Honest. Honest. Honest. Very truthful about the subtitle: What Your Doctor Doesn't Have Time to Tell You". Here's the kicker: She's a doctor and she does tell you!!!!  4. It is a nutritional bible. That is no joke!  An excellent book and I am glad I purchased it.  Enjoy. 
 This is a very interesting book, I have recommended it to all of my friends...all of which are excited about borrowing my copy!  It's very fun to read and hard to put down once you get started 
 Having been a fan of the Art of Noise in the 80's, it is a very high bar that reaches my ears these days, and Amon Tobin has done it.  His incidental style, combined with crafty rhythms and a high degree of acoustic precision create something between acid jazz and techno, a very listenable, wordless play on the human spirit 
 This is an excellent guide to making adjustments to store-bought patterns, altering clothes and understanding why things don't fit.  It was worth a lot for the detailed, well illustrated information on construction and alteration that is very readable and not a drag like a lot of this stuff is.  It makes sense to a normal person.  That said, the "flatter" part of the title is not necessarily so.  In the illustrations under the heading of "give them something to look at" (so they won't notice your size) the "before" drab outfits looked much slimmer and more attractive than the fussy "after" ones.  In theory, without a "distraction", all anyone will see is how heavy you are.  In practice, the fussy details make you seem heavier 
 I don't have the walk belt but really like this workout with handweights.  This one has a great tempo and you really work up a sweat.  I think this will be one of my favorite Leslie workouts 
 This book is simply amazing!  Author Gary Simmons has delivered a perfectly organized and extremely informative book on the techniques of the technical pen.  Simmons starts with the basics of the technical pen and walks the reader through the various techniques and even concludes with a chapter on the use of color.  I couldn't recommend this book more...if you don't have it already, GET IT NOW 
 this man's pen weaves wonders!!! just as simple as that!!  Marquez you are the voice of a Latin God! 
 I really enjoyed this book. The characters are entertaining and the explanations are okay although sometimes you have to read it a few times until you "get it".  One important thing readers should know; there is ALOT of female and MALE nudity in this book. the author could very well have put shorts or underwear on the dozens of men in the book, but chose not too. I didn't like it. Also, if someone is embarrassed to take their clothes off, they don't have to be made fun of.  Other than than that, the book does explain perspective quite well. 
 Great story!!  Excellent in fact.  My beef is with the narrator and editor:  As someone who grew up in the Baltimore area, I thoroughly enjoyed the local references.  However, it is frustrating to hear the narrator mispronounce Baltimore icons, like Boog's BBQ at Camden Yards.  For the record, it is NOT pronounced Bow-g!  It is Boo-g... Do better research!! 
 I am compelled to add my comments here because I disagree completely with those of K. Unger, the first of the reviews here. Etty's diary is not a "book" that can be reviewed the way one reviews a novel.  This is  an historical document--a journal and letters--and Etty's intention when  writing was not to weave a narrative for some future reader, but to explore  her own character--her faults, desires, dreams, and place in the world.  Unger calls her "self-involved and lazy;" I would say that she is  profoundly self-aware, self-critical, and attempting to create an  intellectual life for herself. This intellectual life requires her to sit  at her desk--reading, thinking, writing. The value of the work is that it  allows us to watch as her mature self unfolds, as she struggles with both  personal issues and the increasingly threatening political situation. If  you come to this book prepared to allow Etty to lead you along the path she  follows, a path which leads ultimately to acceptance of her fate, you will  come away awed and moved by the power of the human heart and mind 
 This is one of the most spiritually enriching books I have ever read.  The insights into how God works in our lives is spellbinding. What Jesus asks of Faustina is truly remarkable.  It is sometimes hard to read, not because of the text but because of the sacrifices she is asked to make on behalf of others. One of the real eye-opening insights comes in paragraph 301 in which Jesus tells Faustina that to know God we should meditate on His attributes, and that the greatest attribute of God is His mercy. This book should be in the spiritual library of everyone seriously seeking to develop their relationship with God 
 I laughed, I cried, I related! I'm so glad I found this book! Reading it is like talking to a good friend, who will tell you the truth. I loved the chapter titles and subtitles. It is a QUICK read that is light hearted yet realistic. 
 This is the first book I recommend to anyone interested in learning how to think and decide better. It is both an exploration of the usual way we think (and the mistakes we make) as well as a contruction of a toolkit for better thinking. It's well written and is at the level of an advanced undergraduate liberal arts course. Not too technical and mathematics oriented, but covers the concepts with rigor in an intuitive way. A good preparation for more technically oriented investigations of the subject 
 Single releases from Nine Inch Nails are a lot different from the typical single releases you see.  Trent Reznor doesn't like to just give you the original song and just leave it at that.  He actually likes to re-mix and manipulate the songs to give you different versions.  The downside of this is that this will only appeal to real hardcore fans of Nine Inch Nails.  The plus side is if you are a real hardcore fan... then you will love it!  "Head Like a Hole (Maxi-Single)" is proof of that.  This CD includes 10 tracks, which is pretty much like buying a full length NIN album.  The songs that are reconstructed are "head like a hole," "terrible lie" and "down in it."  Again, only a real fan of Trent Reznor will really appreciate this, as it does not include the original versions of the songs.  If you're just a casual fan or you only like the song, then I'd advise you to think about it before you decide to purchase it.  I really love this Maxi-Single, and that is because I LOVE Nine Inch Nails.  I love the lyrics and the instrumentals behind it all.  All of the songs are EXCELLENT, proving to us that Trent wants to do more than just provide you with a lame single release.  Would it have been nice if they included the original version of "head like a hole?"  If you're just a casual fan, sure, but if you really love Trent and Nine Inch Nails, then it won't bother you at all.  A must-have for any NIN fan. -Michael Cran 
 This is a great game. The graphics are wonderful, the controls are easy to get used to, and the gameplay is exciting. I really enjoy the customized mini-movie you see when you defeat an enemy. It changes based on who you defeated and who you're playing as! 
 This is an excellent documentary of Shangri-La and its elusive transcendental nature 
 This practical guide is a must-read for anyone who conducts performance evaluations - especially for those new to the process. Step-by-step, it explains why you should evaluate employee performance, how to set up a program and how to conduct the evaluations. The appendices alone are invaluable. Author Glenn Shepard provides nearly 60 pages of useful, hands-on materials. Appendix A is packed with words and phrases that will enable you to be specific about your observations of employee behavior in areas such as attendance and workplace safety. Appendix B provides five performance evaluation forms that demonstrate a variety of evaluation techniques, such as using essays or assigning numerical values to weighted descriptive scales. Appendix C includes several self-evaluation forms organizations can use as models. We recommend this book to managers, supervisors and human resource professionals who must develop workable, legally sound employee performance evaluation systems 
 Once again, Fox has cancelled a brilliant show. While it is occasionally a bit off-color, the dialogue is brilliant, but apparently people couldn't follow the episodes, so no one watched this great show, and it was cancelled. I haven't tried the download option, but I highly recommend the show 
 If you like the honesty of foreign films, you will like this one. It is in English, but produced by a Polish film company. There are some strange edits and it could be mixed a little better, but the story is exquisite and the actors are believable.  I really like the Parisian street scenes and the salon scenes.  Was absolutely delighted to see Baroness Rothschild in the story. I found the film, overall, to be much more authentic in the telling of Chopin's life than Impromptu. 
 i enjoy learning more about the jewish faith and jesus christ, so I loved it. It's a must read and you must have your KJV bible along side you to understand the material 
 I've had them (symptoms) all.... Now I know why!  Easy to find answers right away.  Clearly discusses all the latest research about hormones.  I think it's a great book if you're in your thirties forties or fifties 
 This book is an excellent display of how the French and Indian war fits into a European context. The only reason I would not give it five stars is that it loses the global context that is really essential to the war.  Fowler covers not only the crucial Indian involvement but the sheer hopelessness of a French Victory.  He clearly lays out how the war unfolded and what each side had to gain. He shows how the British reorganize their systems in America and bring about an eventual victory.  The British victory is put in the context of what it means for the American Revolution a little over a decade away 
 This is my third trilogy by Nora and so far so good.  I like Margo, the main character and her relationship with Josh. She is fiesty and fun. The friendship between the women is also nice to read about.  It will be interesting to find out if the dowry really does exist.  I look forward to learning more about the other two women, especially Laura!  
 Though CSI:NY is most least favorite of the three CSIs, they still manage to make a good one sometimes.  This is one of those good ones 
 This book has wide contents about embedded system but brief. Readers will take many basic concepts of real system and embedded design. This book is appropriate to the beginner of embedded design 
 The Art of the Incredibles is an epic journey in its own right beyond the smash motion picture release from Disney and Pixar. Reading the interviews from Pixar giants like Brad Bird and John Lasseter on the impetus that began the In-cred-uh-ble (never mind) journey for the movie feels like you're sitting in a conference room at Pixar headquarters being debriefed on the joy and pain that brought an age-old story about fathers that want to be the super-heroes of their kids' dreams into a CGI medium that made its expression all the more enjoyable. The term "eye candy" doesn't even begin to talk about the content of this book, as collage after collage and drawing after drawing illustrative the evolutionary process employed by Pixar and other bleeding-edge animation studios to breath life into characters that in turn produce a realistic, enjoyable, and profitable film. I purchased this book for my brother, as he wants to be a storyboard artist for Pixar or ILM (Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic) one day. It really serves it's purpose to help him think about the creative process and realize his true potential in this field. As a CGI fan, I'm impressed by the ability of Pixar's technical team to innovate new technology (such as sub-surface light scattering that removes the "plastic look" of Toy Story and gives the human characters more human appearance) for their projects. If you're a fan of Pixar, CGI, or good art in general, this book will serve you well on a coffee table or near an artist's drawing table 
 These goggles are great! They are not bulky like other goggles and they are a lot more stylish. I got a lot of compliments while skiing. The price was great too! Almost half of what my local ski store sells them for.   Without a hat, the smaller size fit me snugly but when I tried them with a hat (since I would be wearing them to ski), I found that I needed the bigger size to keep them from popping off. 
 After reading this book, I have a whole different outlook on my health as a whole and also on the treatment of arthritis. It will take a bit more reading to fully understand some of the information but by learning something that has been in practice for 2000 year, it gives me a better feeling about how to live my life, the proper way to give my body the things it needs to balance me and give me better overall health 
 This is the fourth Harry Bosch mystery. For me, this is the best of the lot so far. I am reading them in the order they were published and have found that THE LAST COYOTE is also the best novel so far. Michael Connelly just keeps getting better and better. Harry Bosch, detective, is put on leave and, with the involuntary free time, decides he wants to solve the murder of his mother, which occurred when he was a boy. Bosch must contend with an intrusive psychologist who is evaluating his fitness to return to duty, internal investigators who have his number and killers intent on eliminating everyone involved. As much a psychological study as a police procedural, the reader gets further insight into Bosch's character in THE LAST COYOTE. Using just the right mixture of action, authentic-sounding dialogue, characterization and police procedures, Mr. Connelly delivers another good novel of perhaps the last coyote on the LAPD, Harry Bosch 
 I purchased the Twilight Turtle as a Christmas gift for my 27 month old grandson and he says "I Like it!".  He asks for it every single night at bedtime.  His favorite color is the amber, which is almost impossible to see, but he likes to hold the turtle and aim the stars at his pj's and the wall behind his bed - so it works for him.  While he does not use the toy as it was meant to be used (sitting on a dresser so that the ceiling/wall is illuminated) and prefers to hold onto the turtle and aim it like a flashlight, he really enjoys it, and that's the whole point!   
 This book is one of the funniest books I've read in a long time.  In fact, anything by Christopher Moore is a "must read."  This guy's sense of humor borders on the insane...it's light and easy reading, appeals to male or female readers, definitely a worth-while read.  My first experience with Christopher Moore was when I picked up "the Stupidest Angel" at an airport.  That book was so funny I couldn't put it down, I had read it cover to cover in the time it took to leave Sacramento and touch down in St Louis 
 This is a book on using the Enneagram system specifically oriented to todays business environment. The Enneagram is not unlike other personality oriented systems. First an individual is asked to examine nine different personality types and to identify himself with one. Then the Enneagram, a diagram of the interaction of the various types can be used to predict behavior.   The book, however, reverses the normal trend in personality testing books where the book is organized around the personality type. Instead the book describes several common business situations and then describes how the various personality types react to the situation.  
 True to the title, this book is full of everyday recipes. I'm not as strict a vegetarian as the book advocates, but I do like to eat light and still enjoy food. Many of the recipes in this book are so easy and speedy, I keep coming back to them for quick weeknight dinners. We like the Haystacks and the no-fat hummus, both a 15-minute deal. I also liked his suggestions for roasting vegetables for sauces instead of sauteing. It adds a nice depth of flavor without fat. This is not a complicated cookbook, but it is very tasty. It definitely fits into a busy person's long-range plan for eating healthfully 
  I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.)   The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable.   The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it.

 For most of us, good self-esteem and good self image drives us to do great things ... make more money, create a home for our family, be the best kind of person we can be, and do right in the world. But for Debrah Constance, not having any self-esteem and being labeled "Fat Stupid Ugly" pushed her to help a displaced community deal with life's hardest issues -- drug addictions, gang violence, single parenting, school drop outs, and death. Debrah is the founder of "A Place Called Home,"  a South Central Los Angeles youth center that provides at risk children, ages nine to twenty, with a secure, positive family environment where they an regain  hope and belief, earn trust and self-respect and learn skills to lead to a productive life. Debrah's memoir chronicles her life as an abused child who thought so little of herself she endured deep psychological and emotional problems, drug and drinking addictions and abusive relationships throughout her life. After a life long struggle with her poor self image, she found a way to change her pattens, get help for her drug/alcohol problems and give back to children who have lost hope. This is an amazing person. I found hope and direction for my own life after reading it. I hope I get an opportunity to meet her one day so I can thank her. Her story belongs on the Oprah show so that other people can learn that even when the most unfortunate situation occurs ... there is hope. Thank you Debrah!

Read the book to find out what happens!        This is a really good picture book. As I said before, it is in teh form of letters from Lynda-Grace to her parent's and grandmother. It is a fantastic book for all ages!                   Give "The Gardener" a try!        
 This book is an excellent book for the beginner it shows the moves very clearly. good photos. It also includes the applications for those who are interested in self defense. I think applications are important because they demonstrate the why and hows of a particular posture. I highly recommend it 
 Jaco's first solo record proves to be the most important and influential recording in the history of the electric bass.  I invite listeners from all other forms of music to try and find another bass player other than old jazz cats like Charles Mingus and Scott LaFaro who did more for the bass than Jaco has.  He single-handedly showed us new directions we could take the instrument in.  Modern players like Victor Wooten, Marcus Miller, Flea, and Les Claypool owe an immense debt to Jaco Pastorius.  This record holds even more weight, because it was recorded all the way back in 1976.  Jaco totally revolutionized the electric bass.  'Donna Lee,' an arrangement of a Miles Davis song, is just about the closest you could get to a bassist who 'shreds' in the style of monster guitarists like Malmsteen and Vai.  Every note is played clean and clear - Pastorius is a perfectionist and he makes no mistakes on this opening piece.  This is followed by the only track with vocals, 'Come On, Come Over.'  It features Sam and Dave on vocals, and I predict that one day Quentin Tarantino will use it in one of his movies.  Pastorius shows his versatility through his mastering of natural harmonics on the sublime 'Portrait of Tracy.'  He also shows his versatility in playing slow using plenty of vibrato and slides in other tracks like 'Ocus Pocus' and 'Continuum.'  Keep your ears open for elements that would sprout up in all forms of music from Rock to Rap to Hip-Hop to Country following this debute record.    In my opinion, the true highlight of this record is 'Used to be a Cha-Cha' which is another arrangment of Charlie Parker's 'Ah Leu Cha' which is also covered by Miles Davis on his ROUND BOUT MIDNIGHT lp.  The track features Herbie Hancock and is a fusion barnburner full of solos from Hubert Laws, Hancock, and an hypnotic looping bass line from Jaco.  The alternate take bonus track on this edition is a gem, with Hancock shining even more.    Listen to what I have to say about Pastorius and this record.  If you don't believe me then look no further than Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, and Randy & Michael Brecker, all of which are featured on this pioneering release.  If you are a bass player, or simply call yourself a fan of the instrument, then anything Jaco has ever done belongs in your collection, including his solo material, his work with Pat Metheny, and his late involvment with the fusion supergroup, Weather Report. 
 When I received it, I read it through and passed it to my home schooled friends, and they loved it.  I highly recommend it  It is great for younger ones, for their are cards to open and things to peak at and art work is beatiful.  
 I offer a slightly dissenting voice:  I do not think that this performance is a 5-star winner.  Yes, Wunderlich sings the arias exquisitely well. I find that Fisher-Dieskau has already become mannered in his singing.  Yes, this is far better than Von Karajan's later digital version.  No, this is not THE recording to have.  At last not in my book (as a music historian and teacher).  There are more than thirty complete recordings of "The Creation."  Much good can be said of many, perhaps most of them. I recommend the following as the best of the lot:  John Eliot Gardiner's performance of the German version on "period" instruments -- superb in every regard, even if his soloists are lesser known.  Eugen Jochum's 1966 stereo recording with the Bavarian State Radio Orchestra and Chorus   -- beautifully nuanced, deeply spiritual, and quite a bargain as a Philips Duo.  Also the German version.  Rafael Kubelik's recording, also with the Bavarian musicians, on Orfeo.  Warmth and clarity, strength and tenderness.  Again the German version.  The original English version either by Christopher Hogwood or Robert Shaw, two very different yet equally effective performances.  Whichever version you choose, Haydn will lead you into the depths of Creation at every level of the word's meaning 
 The author strikes a good balance to create a thriller with a romance weaved into the plot. Both protagonists, Zoe & Ethan have disturbing pasts that ups the mystery factor.   Zoe is cast as the reluctant victim in settings of a mental hospital and in homes where she hears screaming voices where murders were once committed. Against these chilling settings, she rises with fortitude to solve the crime of who murdered her husband.   What is a romance without a swasbuckling & brooding hero in the form of private investigator, Ethan, who falls for his client, Zoe. Their romantic tension is nicely eased with their light joking banter intervals. Like the treatment of PI Ethan not only being macho but also comes across as an intelligent crime solver. Like the easy going treatment of male bonding between Ethan and his pals which provide comic relief 
 This is a beauty. It has the look and feel of a first class writing instrument. It can be changed to accommodate your own writing style with a felt tip, rolling ball, or a standard ball point (not sure about the ball point, but then why would anyone choose to write with a ball point pen?).  Highly recommended. I have owned other so called quality pens but this is the best buy for my money 
 The poem of 'Piers the Ploughman' is often considered to be anonymously composed, as the name William Langland was less an authorial designation as it was an inscription on the back of a manuscript - it would be as if I would be assigned the authorship of the O.E.D. because, in some future time, the only remaining copy was missing the title pages, but still had the hard-cover with my 'ex libris' impression on it. Be that as it may, Langland is considered at least as likely an author as any other, and becomes a sort of stand-in, an 'everyman' for his time period. A few details of this Langland are known - he was a wanderer, a constant reviser (the poem goes through several revisions that scholars have designated as texts A, B, and C (and some argue for Z). This is not a spiritual autobiography, as J.F. Goodridge states in an essay about Langland in another edition, but there are no doubt autobiographical elements in the text. That the lead character is named 'Will' helps in this identification.   This poem stands alongside Chaucer's 'Canterbury Tales' as one of the great products of Middle English; this also has the character of being a different sort of Middle English than Chaucer's more courtly, continental influenced variety. Thus, it gives breadth to the history of the English language. Langland is often ranked as a great English poet on a par with Spenser, Milton, Wordsworth and Yeats, as representative of his age both in topics as well as language facility.   This epic poem deals with themes familiar for the time - like Dante and Milton, Langland deals with the grand ideas of the meaning of life and the destiny of humankind. However, unlike Dante and Milton, Will and Piers the Ploughman do not go through a mystical, otherworldly adventure or journey, but rather stays rooted to the earth. These are dream sequences, but these too need not be otherworldly - they are things that can happen to every person. The ideas of the seven deadly sins, the virtues, the church, and the images of heaven and hell are very much rooted to regular society images of the same. The discussion of the allegorical characters, aptly named Do-Well, Do-Better, and Do-Best, does much for the moral teaching of this poem, which would have been of primary concern to the author.   Langland's text is often more Old English than Chaucerian in ways. It is far more alliterative, a strong component taken from Old English. Also, it is less metrical in rhythm than Chaucer - there is a pause in each line akin to older English poetry, but the metre is less secure.   This translation is done in alliterative verse by E. Talbot Donaldson (the 'E' stands for the very olde Englishe sounding name of Ethelbert).  There are notes, essays and other helpful material provided by Elizabeth Kirk and Judith Anderson.   There are over 50 non-related texts of the poem that have survived the Middle Ages, that vary from minor to major changes throughout. Reconciling these is rather like attempting to reconcile the gospels of the Bible, and then adding to that task the discovery of other non-canonical gospels. It leads to rich discussion, but less agreement.   The introductory material helps set the stage for reading, and the appendix gives a more thorough development of 'The Dreamer' from the C text.    Perhaps one of the reasons I like this text so much is that the persons involved were known to me, or friends of friends.  Donaldson was the founding editor of 'The Norton Anthology of English Literature', a broad, wide-ranging text.  However, it was 'Piers Plowman' that was to be a continuing favourite study for him.   This is one of the classics of English literature, perhaps the least known among them. 
 Cortazar was one of the more unearthly literary geniuses of the 20th century; like Borges and Nabokov I return to his short stories often (more than a decade after first discovering them), and can still get new things out of them.  I agree with previous reviewers - Cortazar's precision with language rivals Nabokov, Kafka, Proust or Borges.  I would add another comparison as well - though the intent is quite different, the very musical and rhythmic sensuality of the writing also recalls the best of Ferlinghetti - Cortazar is confident enough in his expertise to be willing to play with language in a similar fashion, and creates extraordinary and unforgettable worlds throught this (and other) collections.  This is a great introduction to Cortazar, with many personal favorites: "Night Face Up," "Idol Of The Cyclades," "House Taken Over" and "Axolotl" are all unforgettable short fictions.  I wouldn't stop there - Cortazar's other writing is well worth investigating (especially the second story collection, ALL FIRES THE FIRE).  Cortazar seems to be sliding into unfortunate obscurity as of late, with a number of key works currently out of print.  Thankfully, and for the time being, this is not one of them.  -David Alsto 
 This is Levi-Strauss most readable book, and it is a fantastic introduction to the "why" behind his interest in structuralism.  There are hints of the various methods and approaches that he uses in later works, but this book shows why he was to develop structuralism in later works.  The writing is clever and eloquent, and various conclusions he made about cultural diversity address contemporary concerns in a highly articulate and responsible manner.  Read this book before delving into the other writings of one of the 20th Century's most important anthropologists 
 we bought this as a gift but have been using it for years as a devotional book.  this is great to use for people from various denominations!  i am a die hard presbyterian who married a Catholic and have now converted!  this book's methodist roots keeps the big picture of God's Truth and Jesus, the Light, in focus!  it has meat, and one can apply it to one's daily walk 
 This is a wonderful book, and as I read, I wished that the Sherlock Holmes's stories could tap into the same vibrant vein.  You can tell that ACD wrote both books, but he hit on something here that is only suggested in the Sherlock Holmes stories . . . With the possible except of part II of "The Valley of Fear."  "Characterization" and "setting" are the story's main attraction.  We have a band of two bickering scientists--Challenger and Summerlee--, Lord Roxton, the cleft-jawed big game hunter who is the mentor to the group, and the Everyman/point-of-view character Ed Malone.  This oddball group makes its way into THE LOST WORLD, an isolated part of the Brasils where evolution has stood still.  It is a great romance that has been copied by everyone from Kenneth Robeson to Michael Crichton.  This book's two strengths are combined in Professor Challenger. He is an apish superman who constantly brags about his own intellectual abilities, or spouts out Sancho-esque aphorisms relating to the supremacy of science.  I think his appearance causes him to overcompensate.  Reread the end of Chapter 13 for more clarification. And you will see why Philip Jose Farmer says he is related to Monk Mayfair.  I was surprised to see how much ACD was able to get in this book: romance and coming of age for Malone, the reconciliation of Challenger and Summerlee ("Two of a trade never agree"), the core adventure story, and the sly social commentary of Victorian England.  This puts the book on par with "Gulliver": just as funny, and a quicker read.  There are two weak points--hence the four stars.  The first problem is that once the band reaches Maple White Land,  ACD has no idea what to do with them there.  The protagonists lose the plot-inertia, and just seem to be sight seeing and getting involved in "A Private Little War."  But there is no lost city, or any MacGuffin to aim for.  The second problem has to do with the ending.  The ultimate ending was satisfactory, but the penultimate ending and, indeed, the entirety of Chapter 16 was tight and coiled.  This is excellent for a spring, but is horrid for a book.  I was glad that we did not get a gag ending (way overused since "The Maltese Falcon"), but the plot zigged and zagged like an episode of "24."  ACD seemed to be rushed to tie up the loose ends, hence the corkscrewing events: the triumphant entry, the presentation, but no proof . . . except for the live pterodactyl . . . which flies away, and the spit-in-your face ending to the romance.  To coin a phrase, "Love is a Fallacy."  Overall, this book is worth reading because it is worth enjoying . . . despite any flaws 
 Emphasis - This is a "Study" bible... Reality is that no translation is "perfect" and it behooves an individual to use more than 1 translation...   2 Timothy 3:16 Every scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, 17 so that everyone who belongs to God may be proficient, equipped for every good work.  In many cases the RSV's footnotes have migrated into the NRSV text.  The revered reading of the Isaiah servant song from "Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows" to "Surely he has borne our infirmities and carried our diseases" (Isa. 53:4) , though the RSV note indicates that its translators already knew which was the more correct. So also Genesis 1:1 now follows what was a note in the RSV: "In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth."  Antiquated terms were replaced --  "Dome" helpfully supersedes "firmament" in Genesis I. "Behold" is handled by a variety of clever means: `look," "see," "just then," "see here," "suddenly," "here is." "Rejoiced exceedingly" becomes "overwhelmed with joy"; "he opened his mouth" becomes "he began to speak" "he knew her not" becomes he "had no marital relations with her."  Some of its nice "corrections" are vivid and pithy: "bombastic nonsense" replaces "loud "boasts of folly" in 2 Peter 2:18; the Gerasene demoniac is now "howling," not just "crying out" (Mark 5:5) ; the Shulammite maiden in Song of Solomon is now "black and beautiful," not just "dark, but comely" (1:5) , and her lover's "intention toward me was love" (RSV: "his banner over me was love" -- 2:4) Saul no longer is "prophesying," but in a "prophetic frenzy" (1 Samuel. 10:13), and "outlaws" replace Jephthah's "worthless fellows" (Judges. 11:3)  Adam and Eve did not make "aprons," since kitchens had not yet been invented, but "loincloths" (Gen. 3:7) The RSV's "great men" are now "magnates" (Rev. 6:15) who behave like "tyrants" (RSV: "exercise authority" -- Mark 10:42) The stilled sea is "a dead calm" (RSV: "great calm" -- Mark 4:39) , and acting "by nature" is now to "do instinctively" (Rom. 2:14)  A modest clarification - The angel with which Jacob wrestled did not merely touch the hollow of his thigh on the sinew of the hip (RSV) , but rather "struck Jacob on the hip socket at the thigh muscle" (Gen 32:32) And speaking of wrestling, Epaphras is not simply "remembering you earnestly" in his prayers, but "wrestling (agonizomenos) in his prayers on your behalf' (Col. 4:12)  Jesus' family is not just afraid that he is "beside himself" but that he has "gone out of his mind" (Mark 3:21) The translators showed that Junia is a woman (RSV: "Junias") , and not one of the "men of note among the apostles" (RSV) ; she is rather a woman "prominent among the apostles" and a believer before Paul was (Rom. 16:7)  The "believing wife" in I Corinthians 9:5, when the RSV has merely "wife" is a faithful translation, the Koine Greek reads "sister as wife" -- sister denoting a member of the church.  "Super-apostles" (for "superlative apostles" -- 2 Cor: 11:5) ; or "to be our way of life" (for "that we should walk in them" -- Eph 2:10) Advice for slaves has been clarified, now that there is fortunately no need for such advice: obey your earthly master "not only while being watched" (RSV: "not in the way of eye-service" -- Eph 6:6)   Galatians 5:12: "I wish those who unsettle you [with the demand that they be circumcised] would castrate themselves" (RSV: "mutilate")  Nice touch in this verse... Thus the leader of the synagogue "kept saying" (RSV: "said") ' to the crowd that healings should not take place on the sabbath (Luke 13:14)   The RSV's awkward "In these you once walked, when you lived in them" becomes "These are the ways you also once followed, when you were living that life" (Col. 3:7) Or RSV's "the time for establishing all" becomes the far more majestic and correct, "the time of universal restoration" (apokatastasis -- Acts 3:21)   Why did Peter, who was unclothed in the boat, put on his clothes and dive into the sea to reach the risen Jesus? He was just covering his nakedness, not fully dressing (John 21:7) And at Cana the steward does not say that good wine is normally served first, and then, "when men have drunk freely," poor wine is served (RSV) , but "then the inferior wine after the guests have become drunk" (John 2:10) The Greek verb means to be inebriated.   Luke 18:5 has an accurate footnote in the text: "so that she [the importunate widow] may not finally come and slap me in the face" -- the term is from boxing, more literally, "give a black eye."  Christological titles shift a bit. "Christ" is replaced by "Messiah" when it is a title, not a proper name, for Jesus (except in Mark 1:1 --why?) , and "my beloved Son" by "my Son, the Beloved"; both changes are welcome.   "Son of Man" is correctly rendered by "mortal" in the Old Testament, yet it is left untranslated in the New. "Son of" in Hebrew is merely an idiom meaning "of or pertaining to the following genus or species," and the NRSV never leaves it untranslated.   Thus a "son of a quiver" is an `arrow.' In Matthew 8:12 "sons of the kingdom" is correctly given as "the heirs of the kingdom" by the NRSV  In keeping with our English language development, the NRSV uses inclusive language when biblical authors refer to both men and women. For example, when Paul addresses all the members of particular churches, the NRSV makes this clear in translation. "Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be uninformed" (1 Cor. 12:1). After "sisters" there is a footnote, which indicates that the Greek simply says "brothers." Other passages might substitute another alternative: "My friends (Greek 'brothers'), if anyone is detected in a transgression, . . ." (Gal. 6:1). In this regard, therefore, the NRSV is less literal than the RSV, because it changes words to show the inclusion of women in the biblical authors' messages.   Although the translators sought to do this sensitively, it does involve certain trade offs, and at times these can be problematic. Like the RSV, however, references to God retain use of masculine pronouns. But unlike the RSV, use of "Thee" and "Thy" in prayers is altered to the contemporary English forms "You" and "Your."  Shalom: 
 Without even knowing who he is, you can tell Mr. Flannery must be an excellent teacher from the way he writes an ecological history of North America that starts with the demise of the dinosaurs.  If you're into history, science, and story telling, this is a great read from a Harvard professor 
 I can't get over how much I enjoyed reading every word in this book. Hiaasen's dialogue is fantastic and there is never a wasted word, a testament to his journalism background. His dark humor resounds in the book, giving his characters a depth to their shallowness and an erotic edge to some pretty dicey situations 
 "Sunshine Superman" remains to this day Donovan's greatest work, a pioneering masterpiece which ranks as one of the best albums of all time.  That the 19-year-old could write and perform a work so ahead of its time--he was working on the same artistic level as The Beatles, who were recording "Revolver" during the same months--seems astonishing today, but it took forty years for a proper version of the album to be released.    "Sunshine Superman" originally appeared in September 1966 in the US only in "reprocessed stereo", and when it was finally released in the UK in June of '67 (which made it seem less pioneering than it was in those heady times) it was combined with songs from "Mellow Yellow" in a mono version that sounded OK but in spite of the clear genius of the songwriting and arrangments, the sound on both versions seemed "off" and the CD versions up to this point did nothing to improve matters.  Finally, forty years later, some wizard at EMI properly remastered the sound and the results are astonishing: the acoustic guitars, sitars, tablas, harpsichords and organs have a deep, rich resonance to them which wraps around the listener's ear like a fine silk tapestry.    The album contains not a single weak track and although the pace towards the end of the first side slows to a crawl (with three slow tracks in a row), all are gorgeous.  The title track and "Season Of The Witch" were memorable psychedelic rockers, while stoned ballads like "Three Kingfishers" and "Guinevere" are awash in a dreamy, novel synthesis of Indian and Celtic influences that is simply intoxicating. The combination of acoustic and electric guitars, electric violin, harpsichord, strings, sitars and tablas made it one of the first pyschedelic reocords and Donovan has since belatedly been recognized for his contributions to the movement, his influence on The Beatles being particularly strong (see The White Album).    The next two albums, "Mellow Yellow" and "A Gift From A Flower To A Garden" were equally focused and essential but "Sunshine Superman" remains his greatest, both lyrically and musically, and the measure by which all of his later works were compared. This remastered version also contains the essential outtakes "Breezes Of Patchulie", "Museum" and "Superlungs" which are all in the same breathtaking mold as the album (all three should have been included, actually, and "Museum" and "Superlungs" may have balanced the album a bit more with rockers, but both found their way in satisfactory versions on later works), as well as a few acoustic demos never before released. In all, an essential purchase for all Donovan fans, who have been waiting years and years for something like this to come out--and unlike some reviewers here, I thought the liners were fine and quite detailed.  
 Back in the late 1960s Jim Kitses wrote an enjoyable study of three western directors who at the time were not nearly as highly regarded as they are today. His chapters on Anthony Mann and Budd Boetticher were marvelous because both directors had pretty much completed their contibutions to the western genre. The chapter on Sam Peckinpah left something to be desired since, at the time, Peckinpah had only three feature films--all of them westerns--under his belt. This new edition addresses that problem by providing a career-length reassessment of Peckinpah's contributions to the western. The other new material--mainly on John Ford and Clint Eastwood--is certainly readable, but I'm not certain that it was essential. Nevertheless it is good to have this volume back in print once more.    
 If you are a serious artist then you will probably have to study a few perspective books before you learn all you need to know about the subject. This book deserves to be in that collection. It covers the nuts and bolts of the correct methods for drawing in one, two and three point perspective and offers hints for shortcuts that you can use to build drawings with a perspective look, even if they are not technically accurate, when you have to work with a deadline.   What I like about the book is that it provides thorough context for understanding not just the how, but the reasons behind the perspective techniques. If you know the rules you can do it, but if you understand the context in depth you can make informed decisions about when to follow the painstaking rules and when to use the shortcuts.  The book is also written in a very approachable visual medium. Basically it is a comic book following in the tradition of Scott McCloud's "Understanding Comics".  The book also includes some facinating bits of trivia about 3 point perspective, when it was developed and why, and the lengths that some artists, like M. C. Escher, had to go to in order to properly employ it.  The book has two shortcomings. The first is a consequence of its comic format, there are a large number of pages which present more character development than is strictly necessary to get the information across. By contrast, most perspective books are very condensed, explaining as much as can be explained with illustrations and diagrams. This not only goes into detailed discussion of perspective, its uses and theory, but does so within the voice baloons of two characters.  The second shortcoming is one that I can't think of any other perspective book that treats, that is, it leaves out curvileniar or 5 point perspective, though apparently the author is aware of this kind of perspective, he tantalizes us by using it in a couple of illustrations in the book 
 ...into the complicated, sometimes inscrutable world of Photoshop. If you're aspiring to be a professional photographer or post-production assistant, probably the single best thing you can do for your career development -aside from practice, practice, practice- is make sure you own a copy of this book and Ms. Eismann's other work: "Photoshop Masking & Compositing". Study her techniques, apply them to your own images and re-apply them until you can look at an image and know right off which tools you're likely to use and how.  Far better than a reference type book (Photoshop Bible, et al), and more thorough than other lead-by-example PS books, these two clearly explain the different contexts for each tool, and show you -in relatively simple terms- how to use them to great effect. This book is also nicely illustrated and laid out, which makes it much easier to read through the examples without getting bored or frustrated. In short, as someone who works in this business professionally and also does some instruction, Katrin's books are the ones I recommend to those who are really serious / not just looking for a glossed over summary of Photoshop.   Highly recommended 
 the cheetah girls have great voices and have great chemistry together!  a great cd, and the kids will love it.  really gets you in the christmas spiri 
 The latest from the Portland, OR quintet, and their first release on a major label.  They have lost nothing in the transition from Kill Rock Stars to Capitol - this album is fabulous, and not a dud in the bunch.  Fans of 2003's The Tain will be pleased with track 2, a 3-song suite called "The Island" that is 12-1/2 minutes of prog-rock-drenched awesome (also useful for bathroom and cigarette breaks).  The title tracks (actually 3 songs divided into 2 tracks) retells a traditional Japanese folk tail, and the story theoretically serves as a theme for the whole album.  Mostly the album features the stories of death, crime, war, and doomed love that we expect from Colin Meloy and crew.  Track 3 is a sweet duet with singer-songwriter Laura Veirs 
 This is not your ordinary "work at home idea" book.  The authors really packed a lot of information in this one.  And it is valuable information.  For instance, in each home business idea they describe, they include pros/cons, REALISTIC salary expectations, potential clients, alternative businesses that are similar, etc.  It is great information and really goes beyond the "outline" that most other books give you.  If you are looking for ideas on what home business to start, this is the book you need 
 I CAN'T believe there was a reviewer who said it was "boring"! I have bought this book at least 5 or 6 times because I've lent my copy to people and never got it back because everyone thought it was so good. (No worries, those people were family....figured I'd overlook it *this* time). I've also read it at least 4 times over the past few years. It's simply wonderful; it delves into your heart and stays there. You will not regret purchasing this book 
 i got this case as a present, and it is a really great case.  apart from the cool retro look of it, it protects my ipod and isn't at all bulky.  this case uses magnets for the flip top, which makes this case less bulky than other ipod cases.  my ipod fits very snugly in this case and theres a clear plastic that protects the screen.  the sides of the case stretch, so i'm pretty sure it would fit both the 30 and 60 gb ipod.  it is a bit pricey, but totally worth it.  buy this case 
 This book is one of the best novels ever written.  It is still current today and keeps you turning the pages.  You will not regret this purchase 
 The carnivorous carnival was a good book The book was about the baudelaire orphans Sunny, Klaus, and Violet. There are accused of murdering a guy named Count Olaf. He is the real bad guy that is after them for there money.   They are running from Count Olaf and they find this carnival. They decide to disguise themselves as freaks and go join Madame Lulu's house of freaks. They meet the other freaks and become friends with them. Count Olaf comes and stays at the carnival because he thinks they are there. Count brings a new attraction to the park. Lions, he is going to throw a freak into the lions pit for money. The Baudelaire's excape and look into madame Lulu's cristal ball. They see that one of there parents are still alive. They are hiding in the Mortmain Mountains. They're new goal is to find there parents but there is some obsticles on the way.  I thought this book was pretty good and I recommend this book to kids that like mystery because there is a lot of thinking in this book or adventure because they are running around a lot and hiding from the bad guys. The suspence will keep you standing and the end of the book is a real cliff-hanger 
 This is the first 'for dummies' workout that I have bought and I really like it.  It's a good dvd if you haven't done a ball workout before.  You focus on stability and balance and building up your core strength.  But because you use weights too, you also get good toning for the whole body.  They use your regular overhead presses and ab work too.  She gives you optional moves if you want to make it harder or easier and tells you what not to do wrong.   Don't be fooled by thinking you can't get a good workout from a stability ball.  You will totally feel this the next day and you will be surprised with exactly how many muscles you in fact worked.  I really like this a lot 
 This is a truly amazing book that gives a breif insight into the mind of a true genius this book gives an accurate and true to life account of bruce lee's personal life and some of his inner most thoughts and beliefs if you  only buy one book in your whole life this should be it so.. what are you  waiting for go buy i 
 My little one just gobbled up the first recipe I made from this book and I felt so good knowing she ate a wholesome homemade meal. I know exactly what was put into it, I controlled the seasoning and she just loved it!!! I also recommend Favorite Family Meals by Annabel Karmel as well for meals for the whole family. My family is eating so much healthier now thanks to Annabel's amazing cookbooks 
 Theologian Bernhardt W. Anderson's Out of the Depths, first published in 1970, provides an excellent introduction to the theological, devotional, and literary aspects of the Psalms. Anderson makes the the  "form-critical" approach of Gunkel, Mowinckel, Westermann, et al.  accessible to the layperson in a highly readable short study, which should  sharpen the reader's appreciation of the Psalter 
 This book might seem dated: it describes the machinations of the court from 1969 to 1976, which included, among other things, Roe v. Wade and the Watergate tapes case. However, it is far from obsolete. The Brethren is a still-unprecedented look into the Supreme Court, the most secretive top-level branch of government. Although the faces (save one) and the cases are different, the way in which cases are decided by this body has likely not, plus it is a look at a tumultous time in ours as well as the Court's history.  The focus of the story is Chief Justice Warren Earl Burger, who replaces Earl Warren after his retirement. The irony of the names is unexplored, but it is appropriate, because Burger becomes progressively preoccupied with trying to match Warren's legacy. Unlike Warren, though, he allows political concerns and vanity to influence his judgment and, bit by bit, erode the confidence of his colleagues, to the point where the late William Rehnquist, then a young conservative on the Court, makes fun of him behind his back. Although this book is unflattering to some of the justices, such as Thurgood Marshall, who is noted as lazy and uninvolved and Byron White, who is noted to be unlikeable, Burger is the biggest loser here. The book was published in the early 80s, only a few years before Burger left the court, and the image of him as a pompous, preening, intellectually deficient and generally clueless politician cost him, big time. In spite of the landmark rulings his Court made, he was unable to reverse the Warren Court's liberal activism (as he had hoped to do). His "Minnesota Twin", Harry Blackmun, would drift further away from him, both politically and personally, until finally becoming the most liberal justice after the departure of Thurgood Marshall in 1991. Burger's Macchiavellian strategizing to assign opinions caused such a backlash that, at one point, William Brennan decides to vote for whatever side of a case puts him in the minority so that Burger won't be able to assign him another crappy oppinion.  Ultimately, Burger had good intentions, but his blunders dominate the book. He is a fascinating character, almost as bad a manager and as delusional as David Brent from the recent BBC TV Series The Office. Some of the principals come out looking good: Potter Stewart, for example, and Brennan also. But Rehnquist comes out best, in spite of some scheming and obfuscation. Burger, though, is front and center, and he's a reminder of how we're to seriously we all should take the business of the Court 
 I bought this item when it was on sale for only eight dollars and change although it had mostly bad reviews and low star rating. I live in a approx. 1900 sq foot home and from one end to the other it picked up with almost no static what so ever. For the price I payed it gets the job done well 
 I've used Tabor's before but now that I'm studying to be a nurse, I have been using the nursing diagnosis section. This section is as good as the pocket guides that you generally buy seperately 
 This is really a super compiler text. It is also one of the most recent compiler books you can buy.  First of all this is a theoretical book. If you read the title 'Engineering a compiler' as 'Coding/Building a compiler' you would be disappointed! So, if you're looking for a learing-by-coding book, this is not for you (but I have some recommendations at the end of this review in the latest paragraph). The difference with most of the other theoretical books is that this book is not a dry text. It has also a nice layout. It gives plenty of examples, and all topics are well connected to each other. It's a pleasure to read for not native English people, so native English people can read it pretty fast.   This book read like a novel.. It does contain enough diagrams, tables, etc. but not too much (crowded), and everything is well explained.  You can read this book as a compiler introduction book. But I can only recommend this to B.Sc/M.Sc Computer Science students (like me). You don't need to have a M.Sc in Mathematics to understand this text, (all the math, eg. liveness graphs are well explained), but  you will understand everything better if you have some background in algorithms (design), pseudocode, etc. like you gained during your B.Sc program. People without formal computer science education I would recommend to read a practical book first (see at the end of this review), because you may find else this text too theoretical.   This book focus on code optimizations. According to the authors (and me) compiler front ends (scanning/parsing/etc) are commodities today, and the backend (codegeneration) is where the difference is made nowadays. So if you're looking for a introduction text into compiler optimization this book is for you!  If you're looking for a more practical book I advice you to read 'Programming Language Processors in Java' from Watt & Brown. In that book you learn to build a nice stack virtual machine in Java with 'advanced features' like records (structs), procedures/functions, arrays and so on. That book is a good companion for 'Engineering a Compiler' to give you some practical insight. If you're looking for a Language Design book I advice you to look at 'Programming Language Pragmatics'. Both books are worth the money.. 
 In a day and age where all the 30- & 40-somethings are still behaving like teens and 20-somethings, Hurricane is not your typical mainstream R&B, Pop chart topper.  Unlike the majority of what's played, Hurricane is full with story, meaning, and insight.  It speaks to "grown folks'" experience in away that if youth happen to get into it they may actually gain something as a person.  Be Myself Again  is so uplifting and motivating that I will find ways to play it for the youth I work with.  The entire album contains an essense of maturity that much of today's music lacks.  It also gives us a sense of self-awareness and spirituality, that is refreshing.  Benet is definitely on the right track
